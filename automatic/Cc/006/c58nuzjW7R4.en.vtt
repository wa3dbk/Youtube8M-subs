00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
holding on RT you can let go over every

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.439 
holding on RT you can let go over every
other<00:01:00.719> button<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:02.059> basically<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.420> no

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
gun so there are that time I used frag

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.280 
gun so there are that time I used frag
grenade<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.570> glitch<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.110> can

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290

walk<00:01:07.439> around<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.830> hold<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.100> frag<00:01:08.340> grenade

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
walk around and hold a frag grenade

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.000 
walk around and hold a frag grenade
forever<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.260> hold<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.590> foreign<00:01:10.920> aid

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
forever so you can hold a foreign aid

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.039 
forever so you can hold a foreign aid
for<00:01:11.220> as<00:01:11.310> long<00:01:11.490> as<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.729> want<00:01:11.970> but<00:01:12.570> I'm<00:01:12.720> showing

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
for as long as you want but I'm showing

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.420 
for as long as you want but I'm showing
you<00:01:13.080> here<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.470> does<00:01:13.680> not<00:01:13.830> work<00:01:14.100> with<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
you here it does not work with the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.399 
you here it does not work with the
Claymore<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.509> kind<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.869> screwed<00:01:16.080> up<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
Claymore so I kind of screwed up on the

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.780 
Claymore so I kind of screwed up on the
first<00:01:16.530> one<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:16.860> I've<00:01:16.920> did<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.430> second<00:01:17.729> time

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
first one so I've did it a second time

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.969 
first one so I've did it a second time
but<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.750> doesn't<00:01:19.080> actually<00:01:19.259> work<00:01:19.680> with<00:01:19.740> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
but it doesn't actually work with a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.460 
but it doesn't actually work with a
claymore<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.520> only<00:01:20.700> works<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.470> grenades

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
claymore it only works with grenades

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.030 
claymore it only works with grenades
from<00:01:22.920> what<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.189> tell<00:01:23.369> um<00:01:24.590> so<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.650> can<00:01:25.950> see

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
from what I can tell um so you can see

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.859 
from what I can tell um so you can see
no<00:01:26.189> cross<00:01:26.400> hairs<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.790> nitride<00:01:27.150> Claymore

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
no cross hairs in the nitride Claymore

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.230 
no cross hairs in the nitride Claymore
thing<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.170> does<00:01:28.290> not<00:01:28.439> work<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> find<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.090> it

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
thing it does not work so I find that it

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.539 
thing it does not work so I find that it
works<00:01:30.479> best<00:01:30.930> with<00:01:31.380> stakeout<00:01:31.890> or<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.369> mean

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
works best with stakeout or I mean

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.539 
works best with stakeout or I mean
shotguns<00:01:33.000> but<00:01:33.710> you<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:35.009> with<00:01:35.189> other<00:01:35.340> guns

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
shotguns but you can do with other guns

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.300 
shotguns but you can do with other guns
too<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.150> also<00:01:36.270> climb<00:01:36.570> ladders<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.320> climb

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
too you can also climb ladders and climb

while<00:03:38.260> to<00:03:38.440> do<00:03:38.560> sometimes<00:03:38.950> and<00:03:39.220> I<00:03:39.489> got<00:03:39.670> it<00:03:39.790> in

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
while to do sometimes and I got it in

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.699 
while to do sometimes and I got it in
three<00:03:40.090> tries<00:03:40.299> lovely<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:40.959> you<00:03:41.320> can<00:03:41.440> now<00:03:41.500> see

the<00:03:41.739> claymores<00:03:42.280> up<00:03:42.489> stuck<00:03:42.910> in<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.120> ceiling<00:03:43.590> so

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
the claymores up stuck in the ceiling so

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.340 
the claymores up stuck in the ceiling so
I<00:03:45.670> think<00:03:46.150> I'm<00:03:46.600> pretty<00:03:46.750> sure<00:03:46.959> it<00:03:47.019> when<00:03:47.170> I<00:03:47.260> was

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
I think I'm pretty sure it when I was

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.599 
I think I'm pretty sure it when I was
work<00:03:47.530> when<00:03:47.739> people<00:03:48.010> walk<00:03:48.130> in<00:03:48.250> front<00:03:48.430> of<00:03:48.519> it

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
work when people walk in front of it

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:50.699 
work when people walk in front of it
they<00:03:48.760> do<00:03:48.820> blow<00:03:49.180> up<00:03:49.359> and<00:03:49.540> die<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:49.750> I've<00:03:50.320> seen<00:03:50.590> it

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
they do blow up and die and I've seen it

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.349 
they do blow up and die and I've seen it
before<00:03:50.739> like<00:03:51.220> you<00:03:51.400> can<00:03:51.519> run<00:03:51.760> up<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.030> get<00:03:52.150> kill

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
before like you can run up and get kill

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:53.819 
before like you can run up and get kill
especially<00:03:52.780> if<00:03:52.840> they<00:03:52.989> climb<00:03:53.260> over<00:03:53.500> like<00:03:53.650> that

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
especially if they climb over like that

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.759 
especially if they climb over like that
then<00:03:54.130> they're<00:03:54.280> going<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.489> get<00:03:54.609> killed<00:03:54.820> so

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
then they're going to get killed so

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.860 
then they're going to get killed so
basically<00:03:56.970> you<00:03:57.970> can<00:03:58.150> get<00:03:58.359> killed<00:03:58.570> very<00:03:58.750> easily

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
basically you can get killed very easily

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.599 
basically you can get killed very easily
with<00:03:59.049> it<00:03:59.260> and<00:03:59.410> it's<00:03:59.680> a<00:03:59.769> working<00:03:59.980> great<00:04:00.370> glitch

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609
