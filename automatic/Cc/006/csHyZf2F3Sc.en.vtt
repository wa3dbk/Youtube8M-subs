00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
and then to move that information to

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.490 
and then to move that information to
just<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> standard<00:02:00.270> system<00:02:00.869> information

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
just the standard system information

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.410 
just the standard system information
like<00:02:01.680> in<00:02:01.829> your<00:02:01.950> context<00:02:02.520> all<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:03.000> stuff<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.270> a

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
lot faster with this new s-pen now

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.039 
lot faster with this new s-pen now
multitasking<00:02:05.969> has<00:02:06.090> also<00:02:06.299> got<00:02:06.570> better<00:02:06.840> with

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
multitasking has also got better with

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.690 
multitasking has also got better with
the<00:02:07.140> new<00:02:07.259> multi<00:02:07.619> window<00:02:07.920> application<00:02:08.580> which

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
the new multi window application which

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.100 
the new multi window application which
is<00:02:08.759> going<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.970> allow<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.330> have<00:02:09.479> one<00:02:09.780> single

is going to allow you to have one single

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.510 
is going to allow you to have one single
application<00:02:10.530> like<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.099> for<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.340> example

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
application like and for this example

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.550 
application like and for this example
chaton<00:02:12.300> would<00:02:12.599> just<00:02:12.840> say<00:02:12.930> H

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
chaton would just say H

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.620 
chaton would just say H
an<00:02:13.770> application<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.700> can<00:02:14.849> now<00:02:14.940> have<00:02:15.150> multiple

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
an application you can now have multiple

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.780 
an application you can now have multiple
screens<00:02:15.989> of<00:02:16.200> just<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.590> single<00:02:16.860> app<00:02:17.160> open<00:02:17.610> on

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
screens of just that single app open on

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.760 
screens of just that single app open on
your<00:02:17.940> no<00:02:18.120> three<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:19.140> you'll<00:02:19.290> be<00:02:19.380> able<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.620> pick

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
your no three so you'll be able to pick

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.680 
your no three so you'll be able to pick
