00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.740
 for convenience and more practical 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.420
 applied 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.420
 frame type spider its easier to do 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.180
 the truth is that such a frame is difficult not to climb 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.690
 I'll break the back door design 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.690
 missing 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.270
 then everything happens the same way 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.880
 chess cape covered 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.250
 but now he is not given the task 

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:42.879
 an anthill so humming 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.879
 will be less 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.890
 frame type spider for clarity 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.570
 made in thick metal 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.570
 wire grabbed by a screw 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.840
 like a casite sniper carry this with him he 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.880
 quite compact 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.870
 as already mentioned in place nasty not 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:37.150
 will always find material to overlap and 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:40.890
 time will allow him to look for another 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.890
 sniper disguise method 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.720
 near the road look stump 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.740
 sometimes not here it would be possible not to draw 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:57.610
 attention if not for the rifle barrel 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.610
 which you see arose not 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.740
 it's not just a stump that's disguised 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.740
 sniper position 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.400
 same position on the side 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.040
 visit from behind under pin someone 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.760
 cover pryadkin it 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.760
 you see a sniper 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.770
 the stump itself is made of ordinary 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:10.330
 rubber tires trimmed to 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.820
 need dogs do you take that for that 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.160
 so that you can aim optical 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:21.820
 Sight in front made small 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:25.210
 recess under this afternoon sniper reliably 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.530
 protected from wind precipitation 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:32.140
 cold weather 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.140
 and curious eyes 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.170
 sniper should not make mistakes now 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.060
 you see wrong positions selected 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.800
 sniper 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.190
 even with very good camouflage he 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.190
 is visible 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.770
 this position is selected sniper on the ridge 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.770
 heights 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.079
 railroad switch always 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.189
 will stand out against a flat line 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.189
 waiting for the road rail 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.780
 with the wrong master 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.780
 sniper doomed find sniper now 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.110
 here is his position on the ramp 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.810
 rifles can be seen for clarity 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:56.380
 he has where to hide his shelter 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.380
 reinforced concrete support 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.820
 I have identified myself from the side 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.150
 distance to him is two
