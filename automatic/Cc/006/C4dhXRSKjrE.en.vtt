like<00:06:18.750> the<00:06:18.900> band<00:06:19.110> went<00:06:19.410> in<00:06:19.560> and<00:06:19.830> decided<00:06:20.430> to

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
like the band went in and decided to

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.909 
like the band went in and decided to
really<00:06:20.970> examine<00:06:21.389> themselves<00:06:21.740> examine<00:06:22.740> where

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:22.919 
really examine themselves examine where

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:25.339 
really examine themselves examine where
they've<00:06:23.160> wanted<00:06:23.520> to<00:06:23.669> go<00:06:23.880> whom<00:06:24.660> they<00:06:24.930> wanted<00:06:25.199> to

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:25.349 
they've wanted to go whom they wanted to

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:28.490 
they've wanted to go whom they wanted to
be<00:06:25.560> and<00:06:25.919> what<00:06:26.699> they<00:06:26.880> wanted<00:06:27.180> that<00:06:27.360> sound<00:06:27.810> the

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
be and what they wanted that sound the

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.770 
be and what they wanted that sound the
soundtrack<00:06:29.010> I<00:06:29.130> guess<00:06:29.310> of<00:06:29.490> who<00:06:30.180> they<00:06:30.360> are<00:06:30.389> and

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
soundtrack I guess of who they are and

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.629 
soundtrack I guess of who they are and
what<00:06:30.900> they<00:06:31.020> want<00:06:31.050> to<00:06:31.349> be<00:06:31.500> what<00:06:32.250> they<00:06:32.340> want<00:06:32.520> that

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 
what they want to be what they want that

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.050 
what they want to be what they want that
to<00:06:32.820> sound<00:06:33.060> like<00:06:33.979> what<00:06:34.979> the<00:06:35.070> result<00:06:35.460> was<00:06:35.700> is<00:06:36.030> a

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
to sound like what the result was is a

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.140 
to sound like what the result was is a
carefully<00:06:36.810> crafted<00:06:37.260> album<00:06:38.039> it<00:06:38.610> actually<00:06:39.060> is

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
carefully crafted album it actually is

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.439 
carefully crafted album it actually is
able

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:39.449 
able

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:41.149

to push a lot of molds and actually

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:45.379 
to push a lot of molds and actually
shines<00:06:41.939> this<00:06:42.330> band<00:06:42.659> as<00:06:43.370> kind<00:06:44.370> of<00:06:44.520> one<00:06:45.150> of<00:06:45.270> the

shines this band as kind of one of the

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:48.249 
shines this band as kind of one of the
new<00:06:45.509> torch<00:06:45.779> bearers<00:06:46.259> of<00:06:46.289> this<00:06:47.089> perhaps

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:48.259 
new torch bearers of this perhaps

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:51.529 
new torch bearers of this perhaps
overpopulated<00:06:49.259> sub-genre<00:06:49.469> of<00:06:49.860> music<00:06:50.539> now

overpopulated sub-genre of music now

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:53.299 
overpopulated sub-genre of music now
does<00:06:51.719> that<00:06:51.749> mean<00:06:52.169> anything<00:06:52.439> to<00:06:52.830> be<00:06:52.949> a<00:06:52.979> torch

00:06:53.299 --> 00:06:53.309 
does that mean anything to be a torch

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:55.489 
does that mean anything to be a torch
bearer<00:06:53.550> of<00:06:53.849> an<00:06:54.150> overly<00:06:54.569> populated<00:06:55.229> sub-genre

it actually kind of does especially if

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:00.589 
it actually kind of does especially if
it's<00:06:59.430> not<00:06:59.550> something<00:06:59.909> that<00:07:00.029> you've<00:07:00.300> done<00:07:00.479> with
