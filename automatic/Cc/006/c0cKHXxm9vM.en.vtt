well<00:00:24.920> I<00:00:25.300> like<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:26.480> fact<00:00:26.690> that<00:00:26.900> more<00:00:27.710> advanced

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
well I like the fact that more advanced

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.850 
well I like the fact that more advanced
maneuvers<00:00:28.940> were<00:00:29.330> explained<00:00:29.810> as<00:00:30.110> a<00:00:30.170> way<00:00:30.830> to

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
maneuvers were explained as a way to

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.130 
maneuvers were explained as a way to
explain<00:00:31.340> more<00:00:31.850> basic<00:00:32.270> maneuvers<00:00:32.419> I<00:00:32.899> thought

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
explain more basic maneuvers I thought

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
really need to be able to apply that

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.060 
really need to be able to apply that
knowledge<00:00:59.690> to<00:01:00.050> correctly<00:01:00.530> control<00:01:00.890> aircraft
