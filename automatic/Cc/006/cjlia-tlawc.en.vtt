00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.710
 Struck

 doctors are bent 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.280
 the last issue mentally invaded the 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.420

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.239
 it is said for 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.479
 and of course 

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:20.539
 it's serious 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:23.539
 here is still possible 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.859
 and then you can not do anything 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:38.179
 the latter is it is so concentrated and shot the ass 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.999
 Snow is difficult 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.689
 we'll try 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:49.269

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.269
 dpa

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:45.139
 Also, the broadcasting time is not clear for the same thing 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.509
 prevailed on Sunday clearly now comes from the very professional of 1 

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:54.020
 in Kumite simple simple 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.350
 the model Mexico finally close to the Pelle Mexico there are free 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:07.309
 who knows which financial system should now belong to whether instead of 6 8 and 

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:10.309
 Mexican area economy and that is back 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.259
 instead of enforcing as hoped 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.259
 "How long do you need something? 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:25.710

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:47.240
 Hot water important players and still rely on our children 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.240
 For example, the sd card is best 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.349

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:12.939
 On Tuesdays I was already clear 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.889
 we get up immediately 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:18.889

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.580
 Although not with the fund from the place 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.869
 I'm just getting better 

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:39.949
 Gerard Kleisterlee but if you are the opponent to me 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:45.449
 but now 

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:52.619
 because the dancer Bateria

 because so many points Chris Bosh 

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:39.759

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:42.759
 still fun with Remote Multiplayer Cockpit 

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.270
 Walter Amstutz must be quoted again 

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:49.339
 but that depends a lot on the track 

00:07:49.339 --> 00:07:51.119
 the base rate 

00:07:51.119 --> 00:07:53.550
 but things went well 

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.550
 looking for everything 

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.550
