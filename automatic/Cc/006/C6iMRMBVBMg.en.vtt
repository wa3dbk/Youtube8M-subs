 I felt very excited 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.640
 a little nervous but I think that 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.739
 It's normal because they say that nerves 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.960
 they are good and the truth is if 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.870
 pretty cold here at the carla mine 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.079
 because in veracruz we are at 550 degrees 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.789
 but seeing how hot it has been 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.980
 normally here it's a little colder 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.600
 because the girls are disappearing 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.309

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.800
