00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.670 
mechanics and how the web rush feature
totally<00:00:21.730> changes<00:00:22.150> that<00:00:22.300> experience<00:00:22.779> when<00:00:23.650> we

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
totally changes that experience when we

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.689 
totally changes that experience when we
were<00:00:23.830> thinking<00:00:24.070> about<00:00:24.100> how<00:00:24.310> to<00:00:24.340> use<00:00:24.550> web

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:24.699

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:25.890 
were thinking about how to use web
browser<00:00:24.910> in<00:00:25.000> our<00:00:25.090> game<00:00:25.269> we<00:00:25.570> actually

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
browser in our game we actually

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.420 
browser in our game we actually
approached<00:00:26.170> it<00:00:26.320> from<00:00:26.349> the<00:00:26.560> view<00:00:26.740> of<00:00:26.769> how<00:00:27.250> do<00:00:27.310> we

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
approached it from the view of how do we

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.429 
approached it from the view of how do we
want<00:00:27.609> to<00:00:27.670> give<00:00:27.760> choices<00:00:28.240> to<00:00:28.420> the<00:00:28.510> player<00:00:28.689> i<00:00:28.930> can

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
at the enemies below and before they

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.439 
at the enemies below and before they

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
choose how I want to approach this I'm

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.609 
choose how I want to approach this I'm
analyzing<00:00:49.299> it<00:00:49.600> i'm<00:00:49.780> looking<00:00:50.080> at<00:00:50.140> guards<00:00:50.530> who

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:50.619 
analyzing it i'm looking at guards who

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:52.350 
analyzing it i'm looking at guards who
are<00:00:50.710> patrolling<00:00:51.100> there's<00:00:51.670> a<00:00:51.760> sniper<00:00:52.000> on<00:00:52.180> the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
are patrolling there's a sniper on the

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.359 
are patrolling there's a sniper on the
side<00:00:52.629> I<00:00:53.440> shall<00:00:53.739> probably<00:00:53.890> get<00:00:54.100> rid<00:00:54.159> of<00:00:54.250> him

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:54.369 
side I shall probably get rid of him

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:55.680 
side I shall probably get rid of him
first<00:00:54.729> because<00:00:54.850> he's<00:00:55.119> probably<00:00:55.330> one<00:00:55.540> of<00:00:55.570> the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
first because he's probably one of the

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.689 
first because he's probably one of the
ones<00:00:55.809> whose<00:00:55.960> most<00:00:56.170> dangerous<00:00:56.650> to<00:00:56.860> me<00:00:56.979> once<00:00:57.610> I

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
ones whose most dangerous to me once I

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.530 
ones whose most dangerous to me once I
once<00:00:58.030> they<00:00:58.180> actually<00:00:58.420> detect<00:00:58.690> my<00:00:58.839> presence<00:01:00.540> by

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
once they actually detect my presence by

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.149 
once they actually detect my presence by
holding<00:01:01.930> down<00:01:01.960> the<00:01:02.170> web<00:01:02.320> rush<00:01:02.530> when<00:01:03.040> I'm

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
holding down the web rush when I'm

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:04.649 
holding down the web rush when I'm
looking<00:01:03.430> at<00:01:03.519> the<00:01:03.610> room<00:01:03.790> I've<00:01:04.239> got<00:01:04.390> some
