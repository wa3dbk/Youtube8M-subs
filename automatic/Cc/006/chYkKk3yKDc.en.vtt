00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.610 
I'm being shutter it's still an annoying
thing<00:03:13.489> black<00:03:13.910> ops<00:03:14.180> 1<00:03:14.269> being<00:03:14.750> the<00:03:14.810> worse<00:03:15.200> than

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
thing black ops 1 being the worse than

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.800 
thing black ops 1 being the worse than
worst<00:03:15.980> flinch<00:03:16.430> over<00:03:16.760> and<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.480> think<00:03:17.690> it's

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
worst flinch over and I think it's

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.540 
worst flinch over and I think it's
because<00:03:17.900> the<00:03:18.140> heat<00:03:18.260> detection<00:03:18.590> was<00:03:18.860> so<00:03:19.190> poor

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
because the heat detection was so poor

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.240 
because the heat detection was so poor

in black ops 1 you know you seem to soak

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.220 
in black ops 1 you know you seem to soak
up<00:03:22.430> more<00:03:22.579> bullets<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.120> you<00:03:23.180> gun<00:03:23.390> flinchy<00:03:23.870> so
