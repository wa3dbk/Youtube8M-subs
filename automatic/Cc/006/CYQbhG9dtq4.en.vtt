well<00:00:01.350> I<00:00:01.620> got<00:00:02.070> that<00:00:02.310> far

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
well I got that far

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.299 
well I got that far
I<00:00:03.890> want<00:00:04.890> to<00:00:04.980> stick<00:00:05.190> sit<00:00:05.370> upright<00:00:05.640> say<00:00:05.940> this

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:07.309 
I want to stick sit upright say this

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:09.709 
I want to stick sit upright say this
probably<00:00:08.309> right<00:00:08.520> here<00:00:08.790> probably<00:00:09.360> enough<00:00:09.690> to

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
probably right here probably enough to

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.779 
probably right here probably enough to
support<00:00:10.200> that<00:00:10.440> kind<00:00:10.830> of<00:00:10.920> weight<00:00:11.070> I<00:00:11.130> may<00:00:11.370> be<00:00:11.430> put

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:11.789 
support that kind of weight I may be put

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:16.640 
support that kind of weight I may be put
up<00:00:11.879> on<00:00:12.030> here

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.470 

but<00:00:17.650> it's<00:00:18.070> probably<00:00:18.430> been<00:00:18.550> naturally<00:00:18.970> is<00:00:19.210> I

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
but it's probably been naturally is I

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.529 
but it's probably been naturally is I
don't<00:00:20.410> want<00:00:20.560> to<00:00:20.680> take<00:00:21.220> a<00:00:21.250> chance<00:00:21.550> on<00:00:21.849> it

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.269 

so<00:00:26.109> in<00:00:26.199> order<00:00:26.320> for<00:00:26.619> me<00:00:26.710> to<00:00:26.740> get<00:00:26.980> a<00:00:27.010> nice

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
so in order for me to get a nice

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:39.930 
so in order for me to get a nice
straight<00:00:27.720> vertical<00:00:28.720> leg<00:00:29.140> in<00:00:29.349> here<00:00:38.790> he's<00:00:39.790> an

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
straight vertical leg in here he's an

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.210 
straight vertical leg in here he's an
angle<00:00:40.410> he's<00:00:41.410> a<00:00:41.440> straight<00:00:41.949> edge

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.850 

there<00:00:46.850> there

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.610 

find<00:00:51.520> the<00:00:51.640> center<00:00:51.850> of<00:00:52.150> this<00:00:52.300> point<00:00:55.230> now<00:00:56.230> I<00:00:56.290> can

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
find the center of this point now I can

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:09.810 
find the center of this point now I can
just<00:00:56.740> attach<00:00:57.190> a<00:00:57.400> magnet<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:02.710> part

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.870 

that's<00:01:10.360> my<00:01:10.570> piece<00:01:10.750> of<00:01:10.960> metal<00:01:11.260> at<00:01:12.160> one<00:01:12.520> square

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
that's my piece of metal at one square

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:21.910 
that's my piece of metal at one square
head<00:01:13.060> on<00:01:13.300> it

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:32.850 

I<00:01:21.950> have<00:01:22.580> to<00:01:22.700> do<00:01:22.820> is<00:01:23.020> Mark<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.110> back<00:01:24.410> a<00:01:24.440> nap

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.050 

there<00:01:33.370> you<00:01:33.460> got<00:01:33.640> it<00:01:34.030> I<00:01:35.520> have<00:01:36.520> one<00:01:36.670> more<00:01:36.790> brace

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
there you got it I have one more brace

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.210 
there you got it I have one more brace
to<00:01:37.270> put<00:01:37.480> on<00:01:37.630> it

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
to put on it

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.670 
to put on it
and<00:01:39.220> then<00:01:39.370> I<00:01:39.520> could<00:01:39.700> put<00:01:40.140> when<00:01:41.140> use<00:01:41.290> expanded

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
and then I could put when use expanded

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.780 
and then I could put when use expanded
steel<00:01:42.130> for<00:01:43.380> where<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.560> tires<00:01:44.830> run<00:01:45.130> up<00:01:45.250> on<00:01:45.430> the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
steel for where the tires run up on the

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:53.210 
steel for where the tires run up on the
track<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.960> turned<00:01:50.230> upside<00:01:50.650> down<00:01:50.680> right<00:01:50.890> now

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
track just turned upside down right now

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.900 
track just turned upside down right now
which<00:01:54.220> is<00:01:54.250> a<00:01:54.400> help<00:01:55.170> support<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.910> expanded

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
which is a help support the expanded

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.730 
which is a help support the expanded
metal<00:01:58.090> I<00:01:59.940> guess<00:02:00.940> we'll<00:02:01.120> cross<00:02:01.270> bracing<00:02:01.930> this

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
metal I guess we'll cross bracing this

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:13.590 
metal I guess we'll cross bracing this
way<00:02:02.980> on<00:02:03.190> it<00:02:03.370> there<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.510> need<00:02:07.690> to<00:02:07.810> put<00:02:12.600> this

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
way on it there and I need to put this

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.670 
way on it there and I need to put this
piece<00:02:13.990> on<00:02:15.630> finish<00:02:16.630> welding<00:02:17.020> up<00:02:17.230> some<00:02:17.410> spots

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
piece on finish welding up some spots

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.260 
piece on finish welding up some spots
and<00:02:18.130> then<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.430> can<00:02:18.670> go<00:02:18.790> ahead<00:02:18.850> and<00:02:19.030> put<00:02:19.180> the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
and then I can go ahead and put the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:26.240 
and then I can go ahead and put the
expanded<00:02:19.750> metal<00:02:19.930> on<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:22.630> I'm<00:02:22.750> done

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.980 

all<00:02:27.250> that's<00:02:27.430> left<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.820> to<00:02:27.880> try<00:02:28.210> them<00:02:28.300> out<00:02:30.990> so

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
all that's left is to try them out so

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.800 
all that's left is to try them out so
I'll<00:02:32.170> try<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.470> tomorrow
