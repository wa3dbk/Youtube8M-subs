of the grading rubric you need to find a

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.830 
of the grading rubric you need to find a
graphic<00:01:52.950> okay<00:01:53.549> i<00:01:53.759> found<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.149> scapula<00:01:54.630> that's

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
graphic okay i found the scapula that's

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.899 
graphic okay i found the scapula that's
what<00:01:54.990> i'm<00:01:55.079> going<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.380> use<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.860> need<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.790> make

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
what i'm going to use you need to make

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.999 
what i'm going to use you need to make
sure<00:01:56.939> it's<00:01:57.180> clean<00:01:57.450> clear<00:01:57.960> doesn't<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:58.860> any

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
other text or words with it as part of

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.800 
other text or words with it as part of
it<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:02.159> need<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.399> identify<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.000> graphic<00:02:03.540> and

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
it you need to identify the graphic and

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.130 
it you need to identify the graphic and
tell<00:02:04.200> me<00:02:04.350> what<00:02:04.560> view<00:02:04.920> it<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.219> coming<00:02:05.579> from<00:02:05.729> and

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
tell me what view it is coming from and

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.449 
tell me what view it is coming from and
then<00:02:07.140> from<00:02:07.259> there<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.560> need<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.069> list<00:02:08.280> at

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
then from there you need to list at

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.160 
then from there you need to list at
least<00:02:08.640> five<00:02:09.060> different<00:02:09.509> parts<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.110> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
least five different parts of the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.380 
least five different parts of the
graphic

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
graphic

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.120 
graphic
in<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.200> with<00:02:12.350> scapula<00:02:12.830> we've<00:02:12.950> got<00:02:13.100> a

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
in that so with scapula we've got a

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.680 
in that so with scapula we've got a
number<00:02:13.490> of<00:02:13.730> different<00:02:13.850> areas<00:02:14.150> that<00:02:14.420> we<00:02:14.510> can

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
number of different areas that we can

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.390 
number of different areas that we can
identify<00:02:14.900> so<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.620> need<00:02:15.770> to<00:02:15.830> identify<00:02:15.980> five

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
identify so you need to identify five

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.770 
identify so you need to identify five
different<00:02:16.819> areas<00:02:17.060> make<00:02:17.240> sure<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.569> you<00:02:17.660> are

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
different areas make sure that you are

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.630 
different areas make sure that you are
using<00:02:17.810> proper<00:02:18.410> grammar<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:18.860> spelling<00:02:19.130> in<00:02:19.490> the

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
using proper grammar and spelling in the

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.410 
using proper grammar and spelling in the
process<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.330> also<00:02:21.319> with<00:02:21.740> them<00:02:21.980> that<00:02:22.760> area<00:02:23.150> you

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
process and also with them that area you

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.360 
process and also with them that area you
need<00:02:23.569> to<00:02:23.690> create<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:24.020> factoid<00:02:24.560> you<00:02:24.890> have<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.069> ten

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
need to create a factoid you have a ten

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.940 
need to create a factoid you have a ten
word<00:02:25.700> limit<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:26.870> these<00:02:27.140> be<00:02:27.380> very<00:02:27.590> brief

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
word limit so these be very brief

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.060 
word limit so these be very brief
factoids<00:02:28.700> about<00:02:28.970> that<00:02:29.930> different<00:02:30.380> area<00:02:30.709> so

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
factoids about that different area so

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.910 
factoids about that different area so
for<00:02:31.370> example<00:02:31.840> we've<00:02:32.840> come<00:02:33.110> here<00:02:33.140> we<00:02:33.740> need<00:02:33.860> to

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
for example we've come here we need to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:41.740 
for example we've come here we need to
give<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.100> image<00:02:34.280> title<00:02:34.690> okay<00:02:36.610> scapula<00:02:40.750> now

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
give the image title okay scapula now

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.059 
give the image title okay scapula now
I've<00:02:41.900> met<00:02:42.110> one<00:02:42.260> of<00:02:42.290> my<00:02:42.350> requirements<00:02:42.530> I've

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
I've met one of my requirements I've

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.800 
I've met one of my requirements I've
identified<00:02:43.550> it<00:02:43.700> it's<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:43.910> scapula<00:02:44.450> it's<00:02:44.690> the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
identified it it's a scapula it's the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.380 
identified it it's a scapula it's the
posterior<00:02:45.230> view<00:02:45.650> in<00:02:45.910> there<00:02:46.910> from<00:02:47.180> there<00:02:47.360> I

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
posterior view in there from there I

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.680 
posterior view in there from there I
need<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:47.690> create<00:02:47.900> some<00:02:48.850> different<00:02:49.850> links<00:02:50.180> you

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
need to create some different links you

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.810 
need to create some different links you
know<00:02:50.780> that's<00:02:50.959> associated<00:02:51.200> with<00:02:51.620> this<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:52.100> it

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
know that's associated with this and it

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.009 
know that's associated with this and it
could<00:02:53.000> be<00:02:53.420> coming<00:02:53.989> right<00:02:54.110> up<00:02:54.290> here<00:02:54.769> and<00:02:56.019> then

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
could be coming right up here and then

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.340 
could be coming right up here and then
from<00:02:57.500> here<00:02:57.560> in<00:02:58.010> this<00:02:58.940> section<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.720> link<00:03:00.019> part

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
from here in this section the link part

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.509 
from here in this section the link part
which<00:03:00.620> is<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:00.860> part<00:03:01.010> that's<00:03:01.070> going<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.370> show

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
which is the part that's going to show

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.190 
which is the part that's going to show
up<00:03:01.730> as<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.330> title<00:03:02.860> has<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:04.130> be<00:03:04.640> one<00:03:05.570> word<00:03:05.870> or

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
up as the title has to be one word or

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.009 
up as the title has to be one word or
can't<00:03:06.950> have<00:03:07.100> any<00:03:07.250> spaces<00:03:07.550> so<00:03:08.120> from<00:03:08.720> here<00:03:08.870> we

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
can't have any spaces so from here we

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:15.340 
can't have any spaces so from here we
could<00:03:09.140> put<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:13.870> see<00:03:14.870> I<00:03:14.930> put<00:03:15.110> an<00:03:15.170> underscore

could put the see I put an underscore

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.039 
could put the see I put an underscore
there<00:03:15.739> has<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:16.070> be<00:03:16.100> one<00:03:16.160> word<00:03:16.870> you<00:03:17.870> know<00:03:17.959> with

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
there has to be one word you know with
