00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 no no 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.310
 Hello 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:17.800
 and the ritz in minecraft 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:21.400
 today I bring you a tutorial on how 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.900
 get your pin can not be do not tell me 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.060
 I think 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.480
 come already outside 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:32.290
 what bad luck good does not matter today 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.960
 I bring a very interesting tutorial in the 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:39.440
 I'm going to show you how to dig 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.520
 under the water faster and now it's 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.040
 when I tell you typical of telemarketing 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.140
 tired of climbing a mine and die the 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.530
 drowned 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.550
 very tired of going to look for limestone and not 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.430
 can chop it because of its depth 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:01.770
 calm in rhythm this is the solution 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:04.379
 and the solution are doors 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.320
 yes doors 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.909
 as you see it looks pretty weird they look 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:16.020
 some strange stripes are valid and there's no 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.610
 oxygen wand ok this how you want 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.009
 call it is an owl a leeds or 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.670
 it is simply another of the things that 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.950
 bring minecraft 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:30.140
 but that allows us to use it in our 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.369
 please to be able to chop under the water 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:37.829
 ok normally when we go to 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.480
 focus sometimes we do not have a little beach 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.940
 near 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.390
 or we just have to get away 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.620
 a lot until you can find something and 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.400
 when we find is one 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.360
 so low depth that we die 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:56.360
 well then putting a door we can 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.360
 Chop 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:08.270
 we would normally take until 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.270
 maybe now I'm drowning 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:16.000
 I take air again down 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.230
 we forget that really now with 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.220
 our new system can be treated 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.920
 which is going to be the door 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:30.970
 we can win much faster 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:37.450
 but not only are the doors for example 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:42.780
 I have here quiet I get in the 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:46.690
 trapdoor and it works exactly the same 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.750
 I can apply the same I have what the stripes 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.450
 what are you seeing there 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.810
 and I can see also through this 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.950
 as you see here I do not see 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.380
 the truth is as if he were in the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.270
 surface 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.250
 well this is very useful as I said 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:09.959
 to chop things or dig under 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.390
 of water but it is also very useful for us 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:17.450
 for when we are coming out of a 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.450
 grotto and it blocks us from what it is 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:23.150
 in the water and it goes up it goes up and you see yourself there 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:27.360
 with the brown that you're going to die 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:30.300
 Well, with this system, you forget 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:35.140
 of good but it is also much more 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:40.060
 useful that we can how are you going to see now 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:45.060
 make us a tunnel sisi antÃ³n let's go 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.060
 putting doors we put doors 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:52.210
 all right 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.210
 and we have a tunnel 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.620
 For example, it helps us to travel 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.250
 under the water or just to go 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.840
 investigating areas under water or not 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.560
 I know that encounters under water or 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.650
 whatever is under water well too 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.530
 the fences serve us as you can see me 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.380
 I can put in there is not 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.609
 so comfortable but if we can stop 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.609
 inside as you see 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:26.960
 we can also use the posters let's go 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:32.060
 to put a sign there blah blah and we're going to 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:34.350
 put here another me that I know pass for my 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.820
 channel 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:43.000
 Subliminal publicity 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.000
 well and we get 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.510
 go through my channel and as you can see we 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.200
 The Jimmy appears here 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.840
 here not here yes 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.260
 not here 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.630
 well and the most surprising thing is that 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.310
 we can do this with plants yes yes with 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.310
 plants and now I explain 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:13.059
 exact with sugar canes we put them 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:16.679
 inside and breathe that is what happens 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:22.320
 here we can not put that because 

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:25.770
 although it sounds very strange you need 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:28.620
 have water on the side and although here I have 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.790
 water everywhere does not have it right 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.100
 by his side 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:37.570
 that is, it needs a depth of water 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:39.100
 is that it is intended for and not for the 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:43.390
 scuba diving 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:46.780
 and nothing as you see is quite useful and 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:49.120
 I hope you liked that the 6 that 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:53.889
 I thought it was interesting 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:57.000
 comment and if you liked it then go over 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:01.310
 for my channel and subscribe 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.310
 thank you very much and see you soon
