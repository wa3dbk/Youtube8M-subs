now<00:00:17.940> we're<00:00:18.060> going<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.240> talk<00:00:18.390> about<00:00:18.510> one<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.779> the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
now we're going to talk about one of the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.870 
now we're going to talk about one of the
newest<00:00:19.170> expansion<00:00:19.529> or<00:00:19.920> rather<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.340> Intuos

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
newest expansion or rather the Intuos

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.509 
newest expansion or rather the Intuos
expansion<00:00:21.449> for<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.689> Cosmic<00:00:22.289> Encounter<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:23.430> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
expansion for a Cosmic Encounter and the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.800 
expansion for a Cosmic Encounter and the
way<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.670> say<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.090> I'm<00:00:24.180> hoping<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.600> means

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
way you say that I'm hoping that means

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.269 
way you say that I'm hoping that means
that<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.289> have<00:00:25.380> some<00:00:25.529> kind<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.890> insider

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
that you have some kind of insider

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.040 
that you have some kind of insider
knowledge<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.449> they're<00:00:27.570> going<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.779> come<00:00:27.900> out

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
knowledge that they're going to come out

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.880 
knowledge that they're going to come out
with<00:00:28.199> buy<00:00:28.529> more<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.920> these<00:00:29.130> things<00:00:29.400> no<00:00:30.890> all

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
with buy more of these things no all

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.490 
with buy more of these things no all
right<00:00:32.040> but<00:00:32.189> anyway<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.669> 2011<00:00:33.600> expansion

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
right but anyway this is 2011 expansion

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.729 
right but anyway this is 2011 expansion
I<00:00:34.590> suppose<00:00:35.300> the<00:00:36.300> cosmic<00:00:36.719> conflict<00:00:36.960> what<00:00:37.649> does

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
I suppose the cosmic conflict what does

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.069 
I suppose the cosmic conflict what does
it<00:00:37.829> add<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.430> brief<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.149> adds<00:00:39.329> another<00:00:39.780> player

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
it add in brief it adds another player

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.790 
it add in brief it adds another player
black<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.190> color<00:00:41.480> adds<00:00:42.480> 20<00:00:42.809> more<00:00:43.110> aliens<00:00:43.559> and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
black the color adds 20 more aliens and

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.100 
black the color adds 20 more aliens and
then<00:00:43.920> adds<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.309> new<00:00:44.579> deck<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.329> adds<00:00:45.570> more

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
then adds this new deck that adds more

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.170 
then adds this new deck that adds more
chaos<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.620> game<00:00:46.860> because<00:00:47.700> as<00:00:47.879> we<00:00:48.000> all<00:00:48.030> know

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
chaos to the game because as we all know

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.060 
chaos to the game because as we all know
there<00:00:48.480> wasn't<00:00:48.719> any<00:00:48.870> cats<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.260> begin<00:00:49.530> with<00:00:49.710> none

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
there wasn't any cats to begin with none

very cool so here's what you get in this

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.100 
very cool so here's what you get in this

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
expansion basically you get a new color

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.980 
expansion basically you get a new color
black<00:01:07.470> guru<00:01:08.130> which<00:01:08.939> lets<00:01:09.150> you<00:01:09.240> play<00:01:09.270> with

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
black and also if you have the first

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.460 
black and also if you have the first
expansion<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.780> now<00:01:12.869> play<00:01:13.049> with<00:01:13.229> seven

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
expansion you can now play with seven

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.200 
expansion you can now play with seven
players<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.640> only<00:01:14.729> expansion<00:01:15.150> you

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
players is this the only expansion you

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.310 
players is this the only expansion you
get<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.509> play<00:01:15.600> with<00:01:15.750> six<00:01:15.930> players<00:01:16.140> so

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
get you can play with six players so

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.179 
get you can play with six players so
that's<00:01:16.470> cool<00:01:17.000> seven<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.270> might<00:01:19.140> be<00:01:19.259> pushing<00:01:19.439> how

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
that's cool seven I might be pushing how

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.920 
that's cool seven I might be pushing how
many<00:01:20.369> players<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:20.820> play<00:01:20.939> with<00:01:21.150> then

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
many players you can play with then

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.719 
many players you can play with then
there's<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.530> neat<00:01:22.799> function<00:01:23.070> here<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.580> is

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
there's this neat function here this is

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.070 
there's this neat function here this is
called<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.150> hazard<00:01:24.540> deck<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:24.900> is

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
called the hazard deck and this is

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.510 
called the hazard deck and this is
something<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.470> actually<00:01:25.590> like<00:01:25.950> using<00:01:26.189> quite<00:01:26.460> a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
something I actually like using quite a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.060 
something I actually like using quite a
bit<00:01:26.750> when<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.840> turn<00:01:28.020> over<00:01:28.080> destiny<00:01:28.619> card<00:01:28.860> this

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
bit when you turn over destiny card this

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.499 
bit when you turn over destiny card this
tells<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.520> who<00:01:29.880> you're<00:01:30.030> going<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> attack

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
tells you who you're going to attack

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.219 
tells you who you're going to attack
wahoo

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
wahoo

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.770 
wahoo
but<00:01:31.920> some<00:01:32.130> destiny<00:01:32.520> cards<00:01:32.820> have<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.240> already

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
but some destiny cards have this already

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.380 
but some destiny cards have this already
built<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.409> did<00:01:34.770> not<00:01:34.950> notice<00:01:35.369> there's<00:01:36.150> this

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
built in did not notice there's this

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.210 
built in did not notice there's this
little<00:01:36.780> funky<00:01:37.259> looking<00:01:37.560> thing<00:01:37.740> around<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
little funky looking thing around the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.999 
little funky looking thing around the
outside<00:01:38.640> move<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.720> means<00:01:39.930> draw<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> hazard

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
outside move that means draw a hazard

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.950 
outside move that means draw a hazard
card<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.030> draw<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> hazard<00:01:42.600> car<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.840> do

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
card so you draw a hazard car to do

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.929 
card so you draw a hazard car to do
whatever<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.380> says<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:44.369> this<00:01:44.520> one<00:01:44.700> during

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
whatever it says like this one during

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.730 
whatever it says like this one during
the<00:01:45.000> encounter<00:01:45.450> of<00:01:45.479> both<00:01:45.780> main<00:01:46.140> players<00:01:46.439> real

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
the encounter of both main players real

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.010 
the encounter of both main players real
attack<00:01:47.040> cards<00:01:47.399> add<00:01:48.060> together<00:01:48.329> two<00:01:48.630> totals<00:01:48.930> of

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
attack cards add together two totals of

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.660 
attack cards add together two totals of
both<00:01:49.170> sides<00:01:49.500> if<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> combined<00:01:50.189> total<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.579> over

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
both sides if the combined total is over

changes<00:02:31.990> how<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.230> game<00:02:32.530> works<00:02:32.970> but<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.360> don't

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
changes how the game works but you don't

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.850 
changes how the game works but you don't
have<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.840> play<00:02:34.990> this<00:02:35.200> if<00:02:35.350> you<00:02:35.470> want<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.830> I

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
have to play this if you want and I

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.750 
have to play this if you want and I
guess<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.100> could<00:02:36.190> take<00:02:36.310> out<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.550> really

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
guess you could take out the really

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.730 
guess you could take out the really
powerful<00:02:36.940> ones<00:02:37.360> but<00:02:37.600> overall<00:02:37.960> I<00:02:38.200> think<00:02:38.650> it

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
powerful ones but overall I think it

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.640 
powerful ones but overall I think it
adds<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:39.010> fun<00:02:39.370> bit<00:02:39.550> of<00:02:39.640> chaos<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.210> game

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
adds a fun bit of chaos to the game

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
adds a fun bit of chaos to the game

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.620 
can steal your cosmic power from you and
take<00:06:25.520> it<00:06:25.640> himself<00:06:25.760> but<00:06:26.150> then<00:06:26.300> you<00:06:26.390> get<00:06:26.540> the

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
take it himself but then you get the

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.060

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.130 
changing so you can steal it this makes
the<00:06:28.250> game<00:06:28.370> more<00:06:28.550> chaotic<00:06:28.880> but<00:06:29.720> I<00:06:29.750> find<00:06:30.080> that

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
the game more chaotic but I find that

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.460 
the game more chaotic but I find that
it's<00:06:30.320> a<00:06:30.380> lot<00:06:30.500> of<00:06:30.560> fun<00:06:30.830> it<00:06:31.130> sounds<00:06:31.820> a<00:06:32.060> very

it's a lot of fun it sounds a very

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.469 
it's a lot of fun it sounds a very
powerful<00:06:33.470> but<00:06:33.620> it<00:06:33.680> actually<00:06:33.919> isn't<00:06:34.340> the<00:06:34.760> only

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 
powerful but it actually isn't the only

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:36.820 
powerful but it actually isn't the only
way<00:06:35.600> only<00:06:35.750> times<00:06:36.020> it<00:06:36.140> becomes<00:06:36.320> very<00:06:36.590> powerful

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
way only times it becomes very powerful

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.370 
way only times it becomes very powerful
as

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
as
