 hello how are you welcome in our 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.570
 chapter 14 of my life was esqueda 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.580
 second part and good we go for the 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.080
 fourth piece of cardboard our fourth 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.059
 opaline sheet that as I see I'm 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.800
 bending in half and good for me 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.510
 page I'm going to use this piece of paper 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.000
 decorated in pink that as you can see 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.220
 I'm painting and well I'm going to use 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.009
 this photograph I will use these 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.570
 decorated pieces of paper, I think they are 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:30.039
 I repeat a lot but all the 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.470
 decorated pieces of paper that you have 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.000
 use the ones that nothing is left for 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.219
 many things can be served 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.070
 all these and well now I'm going to 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.690
 paste the as you see in the background to 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.010
 decorate 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.500
 so the bottom of the paper to be 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.690
 different and to decorate in my 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.190
 photography then I'm using them 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.289
 I repeat these three pieces of paper that I 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.879
 remain there now so it 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.949
 recycle let's go fully with the 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.489
 requirements the first is that you have something 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.260
 cooked I will use this little heart 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.320
 of foami to make a figure behind 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.269
 my little sheet and I trace it with a pencil and with a 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.560
 I'm making several little dots this 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.299
 so that to help me do the 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.159
 stitches I already have here previously my 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.880
 needle with thread and good the only thing I'm going 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.829
 to do is to pass 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.450
 on the bottom part stop it with a 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.789
 little tape so I do not move 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.490
 and so I'm going to get to know all my 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.170
 figure you can use the figure 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.759
 who want the thread they want from 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.829
 color they want if they want to make a 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.170
 framework as you want but the 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.150
 joke is that they have the sewing with thread 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.490
 obviously the hand 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.930
 the next the success is that you have a 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.780
 tag here I am using this so 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.460
 normalito in white and nothing bad in 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.500
 dye a little pink and I'll 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.960
 add a little twain in green and 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.390
 in pink leaving the same white thread as 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.360
 Bring then to give you a little more 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.540
 half decoration 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.820
 and as you see here I am passing my successes 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.590
 from twain I really like to use this 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.650
 thread because I think it decorates very very 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.620
 nice our pages and you are not given a 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.240
 very special touch and very extra but here 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.500
 I'm going to put I'm going to use some crimes 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.729
 of color heat pauses and to put the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.040
 this is very fashionable of the 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:13.000
 hashtags I'm going to put a little hair that is 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.740
 this photo and I'm going to put another one followed by 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.990
 here also of this is the decorum of the 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.730
 country that says hashtag of love and good 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.150
 well this is the decoration that I'm going to 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.280
 use for half I'll put it 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.440
 here in the bottom part of the other 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.040
 requirements is that you carry stickers you can 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.860
 use these very nice stickers in 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.810
 color pink and blue, I put one as 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.130
 you can see on the top and another 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.920
 in the bottom part another of the 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.690
 requirements is that you have a little camera and 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.970
 Here I already have the ones that I have shown 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.310
 that I already have previously sealed and 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.040
 trimmed 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.840
 and I'm going to put it there before putting all 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.030
 the decoration with volume on my page 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.440
 Well, as you see, as I said in 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.050
 other pages first I'm going to paste 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.239
 so as not to struggle at the moment of sticking it to 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.370
 my basis in being the one in being the 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.349
 decorating means me a little bit of light 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.819
 in the light in my videos is because he recorded 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.590
 with those of teeth suddenly like that 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.050
 it clouds and the sun rises and we can see 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.120
 those strange changes but good 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.910
 to start hitting then here as you 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.700
 I say half I 'm going to stick it with tape 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.920
 double-sided and the next thing I'm going to 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.950
 put decoration on this page is 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.739
 another cutout of these that I already have 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.049
 sealed and I'll put a polar marquito 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.940
 markito of these of veneer of wood 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.489
 that makes me look super pretty and 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.069
 I think it goes very well with the decoration 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.230
 of my page you can use in pen on 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.670
 gel the white color as I use it in 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.480
 almost all the pages to put the 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.580
 margin and I'm going to decorate with some 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.620
 with some very small seeds of those 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.450
 they sell as for decoration of 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.220
 cell phones and so on but good 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.090
 short here as you can see with my exact 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.739
 and I'm using the semites that I 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.480
 I need I like them a lot because they are a 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.670
 very tiny size then for these 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.140
 small pages I want you to go super 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.150
 well and good then the last of the 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.480
 requirements of this page is the title 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.640
 which is my favorite photograph of 2014 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.780
 It is not a requirement to put a photo 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.549
 because maybe you do not have 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.019
 still in your favorite photo and want 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:10.650
 leave space then for when 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.030
 have 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.819
