00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.960
 So come dear friends followers 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.580
 my video viewers would fight you 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.590
 tell how to cook popcorn in 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.080
 aluminum cans for this us 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.090
 you need an aluminum can itself 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.820
 such a knife so 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.880
 first we need to cut howl 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.750
 aluminum cans here is this window 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.600
 we do with a stationery knife 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.739
 it's very simple how to do it and on 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:44.739
 nature for example when there is no microwave 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:47.230
 either a skillet do this door we 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.870
 open up so when 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.699
 dutifully exploded when the seeds 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:57.820
 exploded corn popcorn flew out 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:01:00.780
 today is the perfect way 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.910
 under this camphor point 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.430
 now we need to take the grains themselves 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.240
 here my grains are already mixed with 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.790
 oil so I will not add oil 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.100
 if you have not mixed it need a little 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.720
 add so we sleep it all in 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:29.350
 We light a jar of fire and set 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:31.780
 jar for comfort after about 5 minutes 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.250
 the jar is warm enough and we 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:39.789
 little by little the seeds will shoot 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.380
 hour corn navels can also 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.380
 put a plate that hall and 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.110
 slowly worn but don't look at either 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.790
 what is best prepared 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.700
 pockets st microwaves either on 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.750
 pan 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.970
 it turned out 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.850
 It turned out like this for popcorn 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.560
 Of course, there is a burning one . 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.409
 fried not disclosed 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.429
 so I do not recommend doing this in 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.470
 home conditions 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.010
 still better to take advantage 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.349
 microwave but in conditions like 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.890
 nature can take advantage of it 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.940
 by method 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.940
 Thanks for attention
