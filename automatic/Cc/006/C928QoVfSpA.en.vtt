00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.609
 or be strict 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.360
 we will be seeing them 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.800
 we are seeing them 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.640
 for nothing guys right now and 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.640
 we carry 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:47.340
 start doing all this so good 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.420
 first we put it in configuration 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.620
 screen 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:58.290
 screen right now there was a small 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.950
 little olivia 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.950
 how are they called 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.050
 a little 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.710
 the unexpected little chime 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.640
 as well 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.640
 and you listen 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.299
 so we 're not going to font style what 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.300
 here if they are all really nothing else 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:28.240
 we have these 2 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:30.610
 we do not have a weed so 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.980
 we go to an application that is 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.300
 Discharged 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.020
 it's called 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.140
 the more in sp 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:47.380
 we will do it 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:49.360
 it is this that we open it dictated start me 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.670
 is going to start saying things that just do not 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.670
 we can medicate to the screen 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.700
 i 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:13.920
 let's see see to see 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:17.400
 is the best this one of font manager 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.410
 and another one that I have around here when this 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.030
 this 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.700
 my font 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.360
 those are less complicated and here 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.360
 they are all 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.819
 things because we can 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.209
 download so I liked this and 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.209
 we chop 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.770
 download 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.280
 once and for all 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:53.560
 is already downloading 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:58.980
 see you here and you voted font use and 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.980
 we sting or not, nothing happens 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:06.030
 Let us again setting 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.230
 screen screen 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.300
 onscreen 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.690
 no font style 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.740
 and so 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.740
 where am i 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.600

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:32.920

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.730

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.730

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.739
 i 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.700
 very well there was a small 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.700
