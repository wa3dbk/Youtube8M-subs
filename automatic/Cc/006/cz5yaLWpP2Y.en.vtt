00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.130
 Come on guys, now I'm going to talk. 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.790
 today from magÃ© 650 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.570
 Mr. Jose told me to 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.310
 For insurance is for the animal and for 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.470
 complaining that it was leaking and 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.040
 he suspected that it was in the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.840
 oil 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.480
 I posted another video a few days ago. 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.510
 back on this oil reservoir 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.040
 that sometimes the staff get the most boost 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.060
 of oil and this reservoir and oil gives 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.030
 defect, right? 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.430
 He even breaks the invasion here. 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.640
 It was just that his situation was not 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:59.790
 This is not a reservoir , right? 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:02.790
 she is leaking through the game oil by the 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.400
 in this case all that 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.790
 happens and the cause and if that 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.390
 situation around with it because it looks more and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:17.460
 I play for breath in this case neither the bike 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:21.000
 The good tv is he gave a very strong dick 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.350
 there it is subject to the conditions of 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.880
 motorcycle 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.880
 here is a sandbox 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:50.470
 full of engine oil and will not win. 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.810
 You'll see what you can see. 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.100
 one taxinha sandbox oil box 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.200
 filled with oil but threw it into the 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.710
 Water right rate 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:07.240
 Look what leaked now I turn filter 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.709
 of air it also contaminated everything from 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.750
 oil, right? 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.850
 go around to work soon I 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.890
 I make another explanatory video for 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.080
 emissions if you do not have honey 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.370
 burnt can have broken ring there 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.920
 also and playing is with pressure per card 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.480
 he playing look into the filter 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.310
 of air a little more I give one another 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.620
 others 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.410
 It's good that I'm going to talk about the 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.630
 The conclusion of the josep moto service was 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.040
 reviewed there until it kind of 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.130
 basic right 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.200
 in the course of the review work 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.349
 noticed that there was a leak in the head 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.060
 is and that's why he 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.209
 sent a motorcycle 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.069
 thought there would be a leak in the 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.500
 head gasket does not command in the 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.599
 when I removed the 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.200
 water checks the injection these things 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:05.190
 the air box was filled with an eye on 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.069
 motorcycle crankcase oil that 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.100
 this is usually because of 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.130
 cause of head gasket burned by 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.430
 a broken ring that loses itself compression 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.180
 of the crankcase engine and ends up throwing oil 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.700
 into the water filter is good has been 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.910
 to examine everything right in order 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.370
 this part, what conclusion we reached to 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.160
 leaving was that he made an effort 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.859
 Excessive motorcycle abuse 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.720
 a long time at high rpm 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.579
 he said he's a little troublesome 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.340
 therefore you are wanting a 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:45.810
 motorcycle a little higher in the review there 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:49.319
 was done is the exchange of fluids and 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.910
 balancing alignment was giving a 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.940
 general on motorcycle 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.739
 is it folks care about with excess 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.739
 the vehicle
