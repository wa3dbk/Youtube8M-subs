00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.440 

there<00:00:08.010> are<00:00:08.099> some<00:00:08.250> tremendous<00:00:08.400> benefits<00:00:09.330> to

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
there are some tremendous benefits to

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.930 
there are some tremendous benefits to
rain<00:00:09.840> water<00:00:10.110> where<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.500> garden<00:00:10.800> is<00:00:10.980> concerned

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.250 

one<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:14.969> them<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.509> fact<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.929> when<00:00:16.139> you

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
one of them is the fact that when you

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.529 
one of them is the fact that when you
accumulate<00:00:16.920> your<00:00:17.369> water<00:00:17.640> into<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> rain<00:00:18.300> barrel

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
accumulate your water into a rain barrel

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.630 
accumulate your water into a rain barrel
similar<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.199> this<00:00:19.320> one<00:00:19.560> right<00:00:19.770> here<00:00:20.220> it's

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
similar to this one right here it's

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.880 
similar to this one right here it's
always<00:00:21.150> warm<00:00:21.570> at<00:00:21.869> least<00:00:22.050> it's<00:00:22.230> always<00:00:22.590> warm

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
always warm at least it's always warm

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.679 
always warm at least it's always warm
during<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.430> season<00:00:23.820> when<00:00:24.000> you're<00:00:24.449> applying

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
during the season when you're applying

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.050 
during the season when you're applying
water<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.410> your<00:00:25.500> plants<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.460> make<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:26.880> a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
water to your plants so I make it a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.150 
water to your plants so I make it a
habit<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.539> accumulate<00:00:28.349> my<00:00:28.529> water<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.010> collect

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
habit to accumulate my water and collect

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.490 
habit to accumulate my water and collect
it<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.670> rain<00:00:30.210> barrels<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.810> have<00:00:30.990> four<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.320> them

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
it in rain barrels I have four of them

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.299 
it in rain barrels I have four of them
around<00:00:31.769> my<00:00:32.009> property<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:33.360> water<00:00:34.050> all<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.860> my

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
around my property and I water all of my

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.400 
around my property and I water all of my
container<00:00:35.760> plants<00:00:36.420> with<00:00:36.600> water<00:00:36.899> right<00:00:37.170> out<00:00:37.230> of

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
container plants with water right out of

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.350 
container plants with water right out of
the<00:00:37.590> rain<00:00:37.770> barrel<00:00:38.070> there's<00:00:38.610> another<00:00:38.879> huge

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
the rain barrel there's another huge

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.720 
the rain barrel there's another huge
benefit<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.960> using<00:00:40.440> fresh<00:00:40.800> rain<00:00:41.100> water<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
benefit to using fresh rain water and

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.720 
benefit to using fresh rain water and
that<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:41.879> oxygen<00:00:42.660> as<00:00:43.530> rain<00:00:43.860> falls<00:00:44.219> out<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
that is oxygen as rain falls out of the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.600 
that is oxygen as rain falls out of the
sky<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:45.329> becomes<00:00:45.719> charged<00:00:46.410> with<00:00:46.680> 30<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.070> 40

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
sky it becomes charged with 30 to 40

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.270 
sky it becomes charged with 30 to 40
percent<00:00:47.820> oxygen<00:00:48.600> which<00:00:48.840> frankly<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.710> good<00:00:50.039> for

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
percent oxygen which frankly is good for

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.610 
percent oxygen which frankly is good for
everything<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.120> grows<00:00:51.270> used<00:00:52.140> within<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
everything that grows used within the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.340 
everything that grows used within the
first<00:00:52.860> 24<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.670> 48<00:00:54.000> hours<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.870> got<00:00:55.170> that

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
first 24 to 48 hours it's got that

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.830 
first 24 to 48 hours it's got that
benefit<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.160> fact<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.610> rainwater<00:00:57.390> is

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
benefit and the fact that rainwater is

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.590 
benefit and the fact that rainwater is
always<00:00:58.350> nice<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.859> warm<00:00:59.129> plants<00:01:00.030> love<00:01:00.239> warm

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
always nice and warm plants love warm

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.200 
always nice and warm plants love warm
water<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.379> same<00:01:01.590> way<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.070> we<00:01:02.250> love<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.760> warm

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
water the same way that we love a warm

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.690 
water the same way that we love a warm
shower<00:01:03.510> if<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> cold<00:01:05.040> shower<00:01:05.280> well

you have in your garden like impatience

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.929 
you have in your garden like impatience
petunias<00:01:10.439> geraniums<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.250> all<00:01:11.430> of<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.670> annual

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
petunias geraniums and all of the annual

flowering plants that all love warm

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.429 
flowering plants that all love warm
water<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.909> find<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.630> when<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.020> put

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
water so I find that when I put

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.160 
water so I find that when I put
rainwater<00:01:17.340> from<00:01:17.670> my<00:01:17.880> rain<00:01:18.119> barrel<00:01:18.330> onto<00:01:19.049> my

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
rainwater from my rain barrel onto my

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.679 
rainwater from my rain barrel onto my
container<00:01:19.590> plants<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.280> end<00:01:20.820> up<00:01:21.090> with<00:01:21.360> much

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
container plants I end up with much

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.480 
container plants I end up with much
better<00:01:21.930> performance<00:01:22.710> than<00:01:22.830> when<00:01:23.159> I'm<00:01:23.280> using

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
better performance than when I'm using

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.660 
better performance than when I'm using
cold<00:01:23.939> water<00:01:24.210> from<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.600> end<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.900> hose
