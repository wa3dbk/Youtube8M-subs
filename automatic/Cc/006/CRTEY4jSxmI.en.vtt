 amino acid is what the 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.030
 muscle tissue then to 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.640
 recovering after workouts with 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.190
 two scoops of road without recovering

 what we lost during training 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.739
 and it helps us to nourish the fabric of 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.630
 muscle is very important after
