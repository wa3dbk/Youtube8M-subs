00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.170 
need if you have heavy clay soil like I
do<00:01:46.049> they'll<00:01:46.619> need<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.799> be<00:01:47.009> raised<00:01:47.700> up<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.000> little

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
do they'll need to be raised up a little

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.960 
do they'll need to be raised up a little
bit<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.960> they<00:01:49.140> don't<00:01:49.320> stay<00:01:49.710> wet<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.220> to

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
bit so that they don't stay wet and to

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.120 
bit so that they don't stay wet and to
have<00:01:51.149> good<00:01:51.360> organic<00:01:51.720> matter<00:01:51.899> dug<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.829> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
have good organic matter dug in and the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.100 
have good organic matter dug in and the
pH<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.729> soil<00:01:53.880> needs<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.360> be<00:01:54.479> between<00:01:54.689> six

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
pH of the soil needs to be between six

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.440 
pH of the soil needs to be between six
and<00:01:55.290> six<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.710> half<00:01:55.820> here<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:56.850> North<00:01:57.180> Georgia

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
and six and a half here in North Georgia

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.590 
and six and a half here in North Georgia
the<00:01:58.110> pH<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> little<00:01:58.920> bit<00:01:59.040> lower<00:01:59.329> it's<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.420> lot

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
the pH is a little bit lower it's a lot

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.600 
the pH is a little bit lower it's a lot
lower<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.070> needs<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.369> be<00:02:02.460> adjusted

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
lower and and so it needs to be adjusted

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.819 
lower and and so it needs to be adjusted
so<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.420> can<00:02:03.509> think<00:02:03.750> about<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.590> soil

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
so you can think about the soil

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.380 
so you can think about the soil
conditions<00:02:05.310> where<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.670> are<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.119> what<00:02:06.299> you

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
conditions where you are and what you

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.540 
conditions where you are and what you
need<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.659> do<00:02:06.780> before<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.200> get<00:02:07.380> started<00:02:07.619> but<00:02:07.979> if

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
need to do before you get started but if

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.790 
need to do before you get started but if
you<00:02:08.640> take<00:02:08.879> care<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.209> those<00:02:09.360> basic<00:02:09.899> basic

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
you take care of those basic basic

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.559 
you take care of those basic basic
considerations<00:02:11.520> about<00:02:11.790> where<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.120> plant<00:02:12.420> it

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
considerations about where you plant it

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.430 
considerations about where you plant it
and<00:02:12.599> getting<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:13.080> well

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
and getting this well

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.590 
and getting this well
right<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.340> you'd<00:02:14.580> pick<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:15.030> variety

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
right and that you'd pick a variety

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.120 
right and that you'd pick a variety
that's<00:02:15.780> good<00:02:16.020> for<00:02:16.200> your<00:02:16.350> area<00:02:16.560> then<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:16.980> will

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
that's good for your area then you will

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.980 
that's good for your area then you will
have<00:02:17.280> very<00:02:17.820> good<00:02:17.970> luck<00:02:18.120> with<00:02:18.270> raspberries<00:02:18.780> too

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
have very good luck with raspberries too

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.470 
have very good luck with raspberries too
and<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.950> also<00:02:20.160> will<00:02:20.400> have<00:02:20.430> raspberries<00:02:21.300> for

and you also will have raspberries for

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.800 
and you also will have raspberries for
