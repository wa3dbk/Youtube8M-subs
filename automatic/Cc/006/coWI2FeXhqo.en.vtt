go<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.230> toad<00:00:38.180> we<00:00:39.180> are<00:00:39.329> going<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:40.040> u-turn

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
go with the toad we are going to u-turn

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.260 
go with the toad we are going to u-turn
unless<00:00:41.670> he<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:41.879> scarfed<00:00:42.510> which<00:00:42.989> would<00:00:43.200> suck<00:00:43.710> I

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
unless he is scarfed which would suck I

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.610 
unless he is scarfed which would suck I
think<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.329> can<00:00:45.480> still<00:00:45.629> out<00:00:45.780> speed<00:00:46.050> his<00:00:46.200> scarfed

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
think I can still out speed his scarfed

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.450 
think I can still out speed his scarfed
tota<00:00:47.100> though<00:00:47.370> cuz<00:00:47.670> cravats<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.270> damn<00:00:48.510> fast

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
tota though cuz cravats so damn fast

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.850 
tota though cuz cravats so damn fast
we'll<00:00:50.460> see<00:00:51.920> we<00:00:52.920> will<00:00:53.190> see<00:00:54.469> when<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.500> turn

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
we'll see we will see when you turn

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.470 
we'll see we will see when you turn
judging<00:00:56.340> by<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.460> damage<00:00:56.910> he<00:00:57.059> doesn't<00:00:57.300> appear

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
judging by that damage he doesn't appear

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.830 
judging by that damage he doesn't appear
to<00:00:57.600> be<00:00:57.690> defensive<00:00:59.390> so<00:01:00.390> I'm<00:01:00.480> gonna<00:01:00.570> go<00:01:00.660> out<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:00.809> a

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
to be defensive so I'm gonna go out in a

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.910 
to be defensive so I'm gonna go out in a
Ferrothorn<00:01:01.289> probably<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.070> some<00:01:02.219> rocks<00:01:02.430> up

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
Ferrothorn probably it some rocks up

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:11.270 
Ferrothorn probably it some rocks up
she's<00:01:04.920> called<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.610> he<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.790> defensive<00:01:07.820> um<00:01:10.250> so<00:01:11.250> a

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
she's called so he is defensive um so a

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.710 
she's called so he is defensive um so a
couple<00:01:11.520> things<00:01:11.670> can<00:01:12.030> happen<00:01:12.180> here

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
couple things can happen here

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.580 
couple things can happen here
I<00:01:13.159> think<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.310> stealth<00:01:15.060> rock<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.590> super

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
I think the stealth rock is super

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.770 
I think the stealth rock is super
beneficial

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.960 

and<00:01:21.780> now<00:01:21.960> he<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.500> probably<00:01:22.920> going<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.700> start

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
and now he is probably going to start

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.240 
and now he is probably going to start
trying<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.750> set<00:01:24.960> up<00:01:25.079> his<00:01:25.229> own<00:01:25.850> rocks<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.149> such

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
trying to set up his own rocks and such

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.590 
trying to set up his own rocks and such
so<00:01:29.250> let's<00:01:29.460> go<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> crobat<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:32.600> start

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
so let's go on the crobat and start

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.950 
so let's go on the crobat and start
taunting<00:01:33.810> him

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
taunting him

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.560 
taunting him
because<00:01:37.100> if<00:01:38.100> he<00:01:38.280> tries<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.789> yeah<00:01:39.210> he's<00:01:39.360> trying

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
because if he tries to yeah he's trying

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.039 
because if he tries to yeah he's trying
to<00:01:39.630> leech<00:01:39.750> seed<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.630> think<00:01:42.840> all<00:01:42.960> he

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
to leech seed and I think all he

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.080 
to leech seed and I think all he
has<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.500> hit<00:01:43.619> me<00:01:43.710> with<00:01:43.829> like<00:01:44.039> power<00:01:44.549> whip<00:01:44.850> so

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
has to hit me with like power whip so

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.060 
has to hit me with like power whip so
let's<00:01:45.240> start<00:01:45.600> burning<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.560> don't<00:01:46.799> even<00:01:46.860> care

punch<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:33.690> weakened<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:35.069> I<00:02:35.130> think<00:02:35.220> gliscor

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
punch is weakened so I think gliscor

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.690 
punch is weakened so I think gliscor
would<00:02:35.910> be<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.090> best<00:02:36.299> bet<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:37.470> then<00:02:38.459> we<00:02:38.519> could

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
would be the best bet and then we could

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.160 
would be the best bet and then we could
just<00:02:38.850> stall<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.269> hell<00:02:39.420> out<00:02:39.569> of<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.840> stupid

so<00:06:10.760> let's<00:06:10.940> sub<00:06:11.860> if<00:06:12.860> he<00:06:13.010> tries<00:06:13.280> to<00:06:13.550> go<00:06:13.700> into

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
so let's sub if he tries to go into

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.160 
so let's sub if he tries to go into
tortoise<00:06:14.860> I'll<00:06:15.860> know<00:06:16.580> he's<00:06:16.790> a<00:06:16.850> sub<00:06:17.150> variant

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.170 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:22.840 

and<00:06:21.170> we<00:06:21.230> can<00:06:21.380> like<00:06:21.500> sacrifice<00:06:22.100> Ferrothorn<00:06:22.670> in

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
and we can like sacrifice Ferrothorn in

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:29.959 
and we can like sacrifice Ferrothorn in
that<00:06:22.970> instance

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:29.969 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:32.179 

but<00:06:30.599> from<00:06:30.689> what<00:06:30.809> I<00:06:30.839> can<00:06:30.959> tell<00:06:31.110> you<00:06:31.949> know<00:06:32.009> I<00:06:32.039> just

try to set up rocks again raw lino but
this<00:06:39.059> is<00:06:39.209> bad<00:06:39.449> because<00:06:39.719> I<00:06:40.049> lost<00:06:40.229> two<00:06:40.619> good

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:41.129 
this is bad because I lost two good

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:43.459 
this is bad because I lost two good
things<00:06:41.429> 1<00:06:41.909> 2<00:06:42.029> hacks<00:06:42.299> I'm<00:06:42.569> pretty<00:06:42.959> sure<00:06:43.169> I<00:06:43.229> could

00:06:43.459 --> 00:06:43.469 
things 1 2 hacks I'm pretty sure I could

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:47.479 
things 1 2 hacks I'm pretty sure I could
have<00:06:43.559> lived<00:06:43.769> a<00:06:43.919> gyroball<00:06:45.919> pretty<00:06:46.919> sure<00:06:47.189> pretty

have lived a gyroball pretty sure pretty

00:06:47.489 --> 00:06:52.539 
have lived a gyroball pretty sure pretty
sure

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:52.549 

00:06:52.549 --> 00:06:54.979 

and<00:06:53.549> then<00:06:53.639> that<00:06:53.789> goth<00:06:54.029> Attell<00:06:54.389> thing<00:06:54.659> really

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:54.989 
and then that goth Attell thing really

00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:56.719 
and then that goth Attell thing really
 up<00:06:55.409> my<00:06:55.559> Starmie<00:06:56.039> I<00:06:56.069> probably<00:06:56.429> should

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:56.729 
 up my Starmie I probably should

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:59.209 
 up my Starmie I probably should
have<00:06:56.759> toxic<00:06:57.269> tit<00:06:57.419> that<00:06:57.689> way<00:06:57.809> I<00:06:57.839> could<00:06:58.219> protect

00:06:59.209 --> 00:06:59.219 
have toxic tit that way I could protect

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:01.999 
have toxic tit that way I could protect
stalled<00:06:59.789> with<00:06:59.909> Gliscor<00:07:00.509> he<00:07:00.659> could<00:07:00.869> try<00:07:01.829> to<00:07:01.860> go

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:02.009 
stalled with Gliscor he could try to go

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:09.439 
stalled with Gliscor he could try to go
into<00:07:02.189> it<00:07:02.309> now<00:07:02.549> but<00:07:02.599> I<00:07:03.599> would<00:07:03.809> just<00:07:03.989> kill<00:07:04.319> it<00:07:04.379> so

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:09.449 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:12.820 

but<00:07:10.050> I<00:07:10.110> don't<00:07:10.289> think<00:07:10.469> most<00:07:10.590> torna<00:07:11.039> das's<00:07:11.400> run

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:12.830 
but I don't think most torna das's run

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.189 
but I don't think most torna das's run
did<00:07:13.830> they<00:07:13.889> run<00:07:14.009> sub<00:07:14.659> he's<00:07:15.659> probably<00:07:16.020> live

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:16.199 
did they run sub he's probably live

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:21.019 
did they run sub he's probably live
forward<00:07:18.349> and<00:07:19.349> he<00:07:19.409> probably<00:07:19.650> doesn't<00:07:20.129> if<00:07:20.759> in

00:07:21.019 --> 00:07:21.029 
forward and he probably doesn't if in

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:22.749 
forward and he probably doesn't if in
that<00:07:21.180> case<00:07:21.240> he<00:07:21.569> probably<00:07:21.779> doesn't<00:07:22.199> run<00:07:22.319> sub

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:22.759 
that case he probably doesn't run sub

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:28.909 
that case he probably doesn't run sub
and<00:07:23.870> if<00:07:24.870> he<00:07:24.990> does<00:07:27.139> have<00:07:28.139> life<00:07:28.319> orb<00:07:28.559> I<00:07:28.650> can<00:07:28.800> like

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 
and if he does have life orb I can like

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:31.189 
and if he does have life orb I can like
stall<00:07:29.189> him<00:07:29.309> out<00:07:29.400> of<00:07:29.520> hurricanes<00:07:29.969> just<00:07:30.270> by<00:07:30.419> sub

we'll see

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:38.420 
we'll see
or<00:07:37.050> he<00:07:37.139> could<00:07:37.319> just<00:07:37.349> like<00:07:37.680> you<00:07:37.860> know<00:07:37.979> let<00:07:38.309> the

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.050 
time run out and forfeit because he

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.360 
time run out and forfeit because he
knows<00:07:40.229> they<00:07:40.439> can't<00:07:40.710> handle<00:07:40.860> this<00:07:41.099> thing

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:41.370 
knows they can't handle this thing

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.029 
knows they can't handle this thing
