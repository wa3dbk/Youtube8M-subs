exaggerated the Suzuki got refined but
you<00:00:16.920> have<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.400> follow<00:00:17.640> up<00:00:17.940> with<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.270> new

functions because it got refined even in
detail<00:00:21.180> one<00:00:22.109> thing<00:00:22.410> has<00:00:22.769> always<00:00:22.949> been<00:00:23.369> good

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
detail one thing has always been good

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.060 
detail one thing has always been good
about<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.029> Suzuki<00:00:24.539> 1000<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.920> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
about the Suzuki 1000 and this is the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.849 
about the Suzuki 1000 and this is the
engines<00:00:26.490> character<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.420> few<00:00:28.349> things<00:00:28.619> got

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
engines character a few things got

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.640 
engines character a few things got
changed<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.519> engine<00:00:29.849> as<00:00:29.970> well<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:31.109> piston

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
changed on the engine as well the piston

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.680 
changed on the engine as well the piston
and<00:00:31.769> crankcase<00:00:32.430> got<00:00:32.730> changed<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
and crankcase got changed in the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.389 
and crankcase got changed in the
crankcase<00:00:34.170> de<00:00:34.380> ventilation<00:00:34.980> holes<00:00:35.219> are

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
crankcase de ventilation holes are

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.370 
crankcase de ventilation holes are
bigger<00:00:35.670> now<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.329> avoid<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.840> loss<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.200> the

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
bigger now to avoid the loss of the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.740 
bigger now to avoid the loss of the
power<00:00:37.680> punch<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.450> practice<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.570> can

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
power punch in practice you can

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.720 
power punch in practice you can
accelerate<00:00:40.110> quicker<00:00:40.620> when<00:00:40.860> exiting<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.520> bend

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
accelerate quicker when exiting the bend

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.729 
accelerate quicker when exiting the bend
because<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.210> have<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> bigger<00:00:42.809> range<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.320> RPM

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
because you have a bigger range of RPM

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.299 
because you have a bigger range of RPM
from<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> middle<00:00:44.489> up<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.210> high<00:00:45.390> rpm<00:00:46.280> so<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
from the middle up to the high rpm so a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.000 
from the middle up to the high rpm so a
very<00:00:47.760> good<00:00:47.969> attitude<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> GSXR<00:00:49.350> got<00:00:49.739> much

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
very good attitude of the GSXR got much

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.790 
very good attitude of the GSXR got much
better<00:00:50.340> now<00:00:50.719> especially<00:00:51.719> here<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.199> Portimao

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
better now especially here in Portimao

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.560 
better now especially here in Portimao
this<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.160> an<00:00:53.280> advantage<00:00:53.610> because<00:00:54.300> several

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
this is an advantage because several

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.080 
this is an advantage because several
ends<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.260> bends<00:00:55.649> are<00:00:55.770> changing<00:00:56.460> into<00:00:56.640> op<00:00:56.850> hill

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
ends of bends are changing into op hill

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.540 
ends of bends are changing into op hill
and<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.780> situation<00:00:57.989> each<00:00:58.620> talk<00:00:59.039> counts

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
and in this situation each talk counts

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.450 
and in this situation each talk counts
twice<00:01:00.590> another<00:01:01.590> good<00:01:01.800> thing<00:01:01.829> about<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
twice another good thing about the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.700 
twice another good thing about the
Suzuki<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:03.989> motorcycle

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
Suzuki is that this is a motorcycle

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.560 
Suzuki is that this is a motorcycle
where<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.159> don't<00:01:05.460> really<00:01:05.549> need<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.060> user's

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
where you don't really need a user's

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.609 
where you don't really need a user's
manual<00:01:07.760> it's<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:09.000> stable<00:01:09.360> engine<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.409> has<00:01:10.590> a

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
manual it's a stable engine that has a

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.679 
manual it's a stable engine that has a
good<00:01:10.860> handling<00:01:11.280> at<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> same<00:01:11.760> time<00:01:12.000> it's<00:01:12.510> a

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
good handling at the same time it's a

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.570 
good handling at the same time it's a
bike<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.170> easy<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.710> drive<00:01:13.950> despite<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
bike that is easy to drive despite the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.710 
bike that is easy to drive despite the
big<00:01:14.760> power<00:01:15.950> surely<00:01:16.950> easier<00:01:17.340> than<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> zx-10r

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
big power surely easier than the zx-10r

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.800 
big power surely easier than the zx-10r
even<00:01:19.229> easier<00:01:19.530> than<00:01:19.590> an<00:01:19.860> s1000rr<00:01:20.820> or<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.689> new

radical sexy and hardcore as these are
the<00:01:29.009> three<00:01:29.250> bikes<00:01:30.020> important<00:01:31.020> our<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.380> are

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
the three bikes important our we are

the three bikes important our we are
happy<00:01:31.829> about<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.340> because<00:01:32.729> actually<00:01:33.299> we

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
happy about that because actually we

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.569 
happy about that because actually we
came<00:01:33.659> here<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.079> test<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.409> tires<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.979> now<00:01:35.520> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
came here to test the tires and now the

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.940 
came here to test the tires and now the
GSXR<00:01:36.450> turned<00:01:36.750> out<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.140> be<00:01:37.259> easy<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.680> drive

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
GSXR turned out to be easy to drive

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.399 
GSXR turned out to be easy to drive
without<00:01:38.369> any<00:01:38.729> bigger<00:01:39.210> focus<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.840> driving<00:01:40.079> it

this is an attitude on the GSXR that has
been<00:01:43.560> existing<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.130> longer<00:01:44.640> now<00:01:44.790> and
