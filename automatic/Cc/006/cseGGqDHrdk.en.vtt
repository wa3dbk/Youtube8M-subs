00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.990
 happy and quiet meeting thanks to 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.810

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.120
 tomorrow morning 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:20.180
 how I was born is Brink's concern to the 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.980
 wrestling aaa to boxing look at this 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.330
 it has always existed although you do not believe it 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.790
 Well, the first thing that I practiced 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.310
 fight what happens because I took a boom in what 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.710
 that was the fight but while it is in 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.860
 the fight went where the year orlando piÃ±ero 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.890
 the poncho aponte was there but this 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.120
 I took the fight a roll more time 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.470
 explode more than I expected because 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.060
 you feel that you are the best but those are 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.320
 the dreams of one thank God I got 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.960

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.660
 rich start to travel then I have already 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.100
 decided this year not end point we're going to 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.720
 do what I like for life there is no 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.600
 to do it 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.840
 how has that struggle transition been 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.610
 free professional to boxing and has noticed 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.350
 some change there is some difference between 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.720
 both very much 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.480
 I'll chacho the fighter afterwards if he will give 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.430
 you weigh a little bit of cardio and then one 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.710
 knows what moves up 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.500
 of boxing getting up that early morning 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.970
 get up one thinks one takes the day of 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.680
 ten minutes but not here they send you to 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.380
 catch an hour 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.990
 up to him running repeating the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.530
 workouts is nothing other than 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.210
 thing 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.950
 a wrestling and respect now so 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.840
 I hope much more because before this rod 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.060
 until the controversy that the boxer 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.950
 search engine fighter for a long time 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.049
 visit your debut as an amateur boxer 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:42.140
 during your fight by waiting knockout 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.659
 tomorrow Saturday in candle entered today in 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.670
 mendoza as you expect to leave and intimate 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.320
 fight but without taking merit 2 mi 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.000
 opponent that still as it would not be the 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.060
 psoe does not have yet 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.980
 but the number from the first to the second does not 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.110
 it happens to me and if it happens to me I go in the 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.710
 card by long but I do not think that in the 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.690
 quarter 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.590
