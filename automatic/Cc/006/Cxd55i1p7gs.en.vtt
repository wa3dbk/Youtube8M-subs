00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:03.779
 friends punkers colleagues 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.880
 well I have two methods we go with the first one that is very simple the only thing 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.710
 what we have to do is go back to cra create the game obviously after 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.980
 have created the first time and downloaded the patch 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.270
 if we do not have the kers for some reason I will leave a limit where they can 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.180
 download it download it uncompress 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.270
 they decompress it again and that's it 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.180
 to crack the bonus I did not feel like teaching this but I have a few 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.760
 very useless classmates at school who did not even know how to be 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.640
 so for those who are like them they copy the downloaded file which is the 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.790
 Halo icon will go to the icon on the desktop and give it in properties open 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.740
 location or if you have windows xp you get in search destination and they stick it tells you 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.460
 that if they want to copy it and replace it they give it 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.130
 I will not do this 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.800
 and if they do not have the icon on the desktop they go to local disk computer c files 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.490
 of microsoft games program 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.030
 and what they say is the same rite xd 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.399
 well that everyone knows xddd and that's the first step to the method 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.340
 the next thing we're going to do is go to execute 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.920
 and write the following 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.040
 remember 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.510
 and we go to the folder that your being goes through 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.970
 is the second after software 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.880
 then to microsoft 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.010
 then to microsoft games 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.420
 and we eliminate the one that says something 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.110
 not going to be such horses to eliminate the eleven if you have it 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.230
 because they keep it quiet and it would no longer serve them as I would if I were to eliminate 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.349
 the one that says something 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.299
 so I will not do it but you guys do 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.849
 After this, restart your PC and you will be able to access all the games that 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:16.559
 want 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.680
