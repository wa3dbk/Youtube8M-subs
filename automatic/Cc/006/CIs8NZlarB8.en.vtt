00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:37.040 
then fold it down just like that and
then<00:03:32.100> take<00:03:32.370> another<00:03:32.580> strip<00:03:33.739> like<00:03:34.739> this<00:03:35.900> rip<00:03:36.900> it

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
then take another strip like this rip it

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.430 
then take another strip like this rip it
in<00:03:37.170> half<00:03:37.790> put<00:03:38.790> what<00:03:39.450> happened<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.170> side

in half put what happened to the side

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.300 
in half put what happened to the side
and<00:03:42.860> take<00:03:43.860> it<00:03:44.160> and<00:03:44.750> go<00:03:45.830> go<00:03:46.830> all<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.130> way<00:03:47.160> around

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
and take it and go go all the way around

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.229 
and take it and go go all the way around
so<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.880> gets<00:03:48.000> rid<00:03:48.239> of<00:03:48.330> all<00:03:48.480> those<00:03:48.660> wrinkles
