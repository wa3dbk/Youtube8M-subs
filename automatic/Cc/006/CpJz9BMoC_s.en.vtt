other words does it go all the way up to
the<00:00:57.780> spine<00:00:58.019> of<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> blade<00:00:58.319> it<00:00:58.769> goes<00:00:59.010> about<00:00:59.370> 2/3

00:00:59.989 --> 00:00:59.999 
the spine of the blade it goes about 2/3

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:01.489 
the spine of the blade it goes about 2/3
of<00:01:00.089> the<00:01:00.149> way<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.749> leaves<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.140> stiffer

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
of the way that leaves that stiffer

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.250 
of the way that leaves that stiffer
spine<00:01:01.979> to<00:01:02.399> make<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> knife<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.120> little<00:01:03.929> bit

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
spine to make the knife a little bit

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.670 
spine to make the knife a little bit
more<00:01:05.100> rigid<00:01:05.370> it's<00:01:06.090> got<00:01:06.330> this<00:01:06.479> nice<00:01:06.960> continuous

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
more rigid it's got this nice continuous

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.460 
more rigid it's got this nice continuous
curve<00:01:07.950> here<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.940> it<00:01:09.060> cuts<00:01:09.330> well<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:10.080> does<00:01:10.290> have

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
curve here so it cuts well it does have

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.920 
curve here so it cuts well it does have
a<00:01:10.530> twirl<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:11.610> easier<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.509> resharpen

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
a twirl so it's easier to to resharpen

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.770 
a twirl so it's easier to to resharpen
it<00:01:13.200> get<00:01:13.380> started<00:01:13.649> on<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> stone<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.579> it<00:01:15.390> does

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
it get started on a stone and it does

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.020 
it get started on a stone and it does
have<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.049> finger<00:01:16.409> indentation<00:01:17.100> here<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.820> give

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
have a finger indentation here to give

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.380 
have a finger indentation here to give
you<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.180> darn<00:01:18.570> good<00:01:18.630> grip<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.969> you<00:01:20.969> can<00:01:21.149> switch

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
you a darn good grip and you can switch

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.330 
you a darn good grip and you can switch
of<00:01:21.570> course<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.110> go<00:01:22.409> into<00:01:22.560> reverse<00:01:22.920> grip<00:01:23.130> and

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
of course and go into reverse grip and

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.389 
of course and go into reverse grip and
go<00:01:23.399> to<00:01:23.460> good<00:01:23.670> grip<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.060> way<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.890> clip<00:01:26.219> is

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
go to good grip that way the clip is

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.060 
go to good grip that way the clip is
ambidextrous<00:01:27.240> goes<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.960> either<00:01:28.110> side<00:01:28.469> so<00:01:28.770> you

it has faux stag handles these are made
out<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.810> Delrin<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.609> they're<00:01:50.609> very<00:01:50.850> strong

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
out of Delrin and they're very strong

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.289 
out of Delrin and they're very strong
and<00:01:51.539> tough<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.189> we<00:01:53.189> spent<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.579> lot<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.909> time

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
and tough and we spent a lot of time

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.429 
and tough and we spent a lot of time
working<00:01:55.049> on<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:56.189> mold<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.960> proper<00:01:57.960> staining

working on the mold and proper staining

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.499 
working on the mold and proper staining
to<00:01:58.590> making<00:01:58.920> them<00:01:59.100> look<00:01:59.280> just<00:01:59.549> as<00:01:59.729> realistic<00:02:00.119> as

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
to making them look just as realistic as

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.139 
to making them look just as realistic as
we<00:02:00.719> could<00:02:00.990> now<00:02:01.500> I'd<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.159> have<00:02:02.280> used<00:02:02.520> stag

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
we could now I'd like to have used stag

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.679 
we could now I'd like to have used stag
for<00:02:03.539> these<00:02:03.719> but<00:02:04.350> stag<00:02:04.850> scales<00:02:05.850> are<00:02:06.270> quite

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
for these but stag scales are quite

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.350 
for these but stag scales are quite
fragile<00:02:07.049> compared<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.829> Delrin<00:02:08.310> stag<00:02:08.880> won't

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
fragile compared to Delrin stag won't

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.660 
fragile compared to Delrin stag won't
