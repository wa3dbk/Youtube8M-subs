00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
it's like a switch and to slide this

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.840 
it's like a switch and to slide this
back<00:03:52.489> BAM

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
back BAM

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.280

compartment and they'll light that up a

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.370 
compartment and they'll light that up a
little<00:05:15.940> bit<00:05:16.090> too<00:05:16.390> it's<00:05:16.660> not<00:05:16.840> a<00:05:16.870> very<00:05:17.080> powerful

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
little bit too it's not a very powerful

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.360 
little bit too it's not a very powerful
little<00:05:17.920> LED<00:05:18.730> in<00:05:18.880> there<00:05:19.060> but<00:05:19.600> it<00:05:19.720> does<00:05:20.310> it<00:05:21.310> does

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
little LED in there but it does it does

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.210 
little LED in there but it does it does
do<00:05:21.760> the<00:05:21.910> job<00:05:22.120> to<00:05:22.840> a<00:05:22.870> certain<00:05:23.200> extent<00:05:23.530> now<00:05:24.160> you

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
do the job to a certain extent now you

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.320 
do the job to a certain extent now you
can<00:05:24.720> attach<00:05:25.720> this<00:05:26.170> it's<00:05:26.440> designed<00:05:26.920> for

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
can attach this it's designed for

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.090 
can attach this it's designed for
commander<00:05:28.330> class<00:05:28.540> figures<00:05:28.990> so<00:05:29.710> you<00:05:29.770> can

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
commander class figures so you can

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.670 
commander class figures so you can
attach<00:05:31.000> this<00:05:31.270> to<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:31.600> back<00:05:31.780> of<00:05:32.020> state<00:05:32.230> Optimus

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
attach this to the back of state Optimus

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.280 
attach this to the back of state Optimus
here<00:05:32.920> and<00:05:33.220> it<00:05:33.940> is<00:05:34.210> supposed<00:05:34.690> to<00:05:34.810> light<00:05:35.050> him<00:05:35.260> up

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
here and it is supposed to light him up

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:40.620 
here and it is supposed to light him up
and<00:05:36.570> make<00:05:37.570> it<00:05:37.600> translucent<00:05:38.260> but<00:05:39.480> with<00:05:40.480> the

and make it translucent but with the

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.180 
and make it translucent but with the
plastic<00:05:41.140> it<00:05:41.230> really<00:05:41.590> doesn't<00:05:41.860> do<00:05:41.920> a<00:05:41.950> whole<00:05:42.040> lot

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
plastic it really doesn't do a whole lot

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.570 
plastic it really doesn't do a whole lot
it's<00:05:43.150> just<00:05:43.300> very<00:05:43.450> low<00:05:43.810> LED<00:05:44.470> in<00:05:44.620> there<00:05:44.800> very

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
it's just very low LED in there very
