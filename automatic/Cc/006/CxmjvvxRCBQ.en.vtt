but<00:00:35.710> what<00:00:35.980> I<00:00:36.010> will<00:00:36.130> say<00:00:36.250> about<00:00:36.580> them<00:00:36.910> is<00:00:37.090> that

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.240 
but what I will say about them is that

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.820 
but what I will say about them is that
the<00:00:37.420> stitching<00:00:38.020> is<00:00:38.170> what<00:00:38.320> makes<00:00:38.500> them<00:00:38.650> so

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
the stitching is what makes them so

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.100 
the stitching is what makes them so
unique<00:00:38.860> I<00:00:39.340> believe<00:00:40.210> that<00:00:40.510> these<00:00:40.630> leggings

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
unique I believe that these leggings

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.370 
unique I believe that these leggings
last<00:00:42.330> quadruple<00:00:43.330> the<00:00:43.600> amount<00:00:43.870> of<00:00:43.930> time<00:00:44.170> of

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
last quadruple the amount of time of

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.010 
last quadruple the amount of time of
even<00:00:45.100> the<00:00:45.220> second<00:00:45.700> most<00:00:45.820> expensive<00:00:46.020> best

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
even the second most expensive best

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.060 
even the second most expensive best
brand<00:00:47.410> leggings<00:00:48.040> that<00:00:48.160> I<00:00:48.340> own<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.770> I<00:00:50.800> know

however<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:06.549> irony<00:01:06.939> of<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.149> whole<00:01:07.210> thing<00:01:07.479> is

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
however the irony of the whole thing is

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.930 
however the irony of the whole thing is
that<00:01:07.930> my<00:01:08.320> review<00:01:08.740> has<00:01:08.890> to<00:01:09.159> do<00:01:09.430> with<00:01:09.520> that<00:01:09.700> very

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
that my review has to do with that very

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.350 
that my review has to do with that very
fact<00:01:10.210> I<00:01:10.510> would<00:01:11.229> say<00:01:11.380> maybe<00:01:11.860> nobody<00:01:12.610> has<00:01:12.909> thighs

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
fact I would say maybe nobody has thighs

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.020 
fact I would say maybe nobody has thighs
that<00:01:13.570> do<00:01:13.720> not<00:01:13.840> touch<00:01:14.050> at<00:01:14.350> a<00:01:14.380> size<00:01:14.620> 6<00:01:14.890> and<00:01:15.070> so<00:01:15.940> if

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
that do not touch at a size 6 and so if

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.219 
that do not touch at a size 6 and so if
they're<00:01:16.180> gonna<00:01:16.270> make<00:01:16.360> up<00:01:16.600> to<00:01:16.690> 12<00:01:16.930> and<00:01:17.080> say

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
they're gonna make up to 12 and say

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:18.480 
they're gonna make up to 12 and say
their<00:01:17.409> pants<00:01:17.680> are<00:01:17.770> not<00:01:17.890> for<00:01:18.130> people<00:01:18.250> whose

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
their pants are not for people whose

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
thighs touch that's first of all so

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.990 
thighs touch that's first of all so
offensive<00:01:20.200> but<00:01:20.799> secondly<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.970> reason

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
offensive but secondly the reason

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.910 
offensive but secondly the reason

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
the time the scenes in a legging will

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.830 
the time the scenes in a legging will
break<00:01:30.250> and<00:01:30.549> we'll<00:01:30.970> get<00:01:31.120> holes<00:01:31.420> in<00:01:31.570> them<00:01:31.720> and

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
going and going and then I made that

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.809 
going and going and then I made that
because<00:02:14.530> I'm<00:02:14.620> really<00:02:14.770> short<00:02:15.040> I'm<00:02:15.220> 5<00:02:15.400> foot<00:02:15.580> 2

that even though my leggings all scrunch
at<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:20.410> bottom<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.800> decided<00:02:21.250> that<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.989> wanted<00:02:22.989> to

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230

left it not only in the five years but

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.320 
left it not only in the five years but
now<00:02:47.830> I<00:02:47.860> have<00:02:48.190> a<00:02:48.220> brand<00:02:48.519> new<00:02:48.610> pair<00:02:48.819> within<00:02:49.030> that

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330

same<00:02:49.630> hundred<00:02:50.019> dollars<00:02:50.350> that<00:02:50.769> are<00:02:50.950> going<00:02:51.100> to

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
same hundred dollars that are going to

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.280

probably<00:02:51.489> go<00:02:51.790> on<00:02:51.940> for<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.750> next<00:02:53.019> five<00:02:53.260> years

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
probably go on for the next five years

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.400 
probably go on for the next five years
and<00:02:53.860> so<00:02:54.340> their<00:02:54.700> customer<00:02:55.090> service<00:02:55.239> is<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:55.900> good

and that hundred dollars goes such a
long<00:03:00.040> way<00:03:00.400> that<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.819> me<00:03:00.970> it's<00:03:01.209> not<00:03:01.930> even

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
long way that to me it's not even

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.949 
long way that to me it's not even
expensive<00:03:02.610> for<00:03:03.610> what<00:03:03.760> it<00:03:03.790> is<00:03:03.880> because<00:03:04.239> if<00:03:04.720> I

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
expensive for what it is because if I

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.530
