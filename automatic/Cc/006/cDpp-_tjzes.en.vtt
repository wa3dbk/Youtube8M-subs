00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
see the outline of a circular shaped

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.350 
see the outline of a circular shaped

mountain range now the reason for that

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:11.920 
mountain range now the reason for that
was<00:06:10.050> that<00:06:10.259> was<00:06:10.740> just<00:06:10.949> a<00:06:11.009> blur<00:06:11.220> when<00:06:11.460> I<00:06:11.520> went<00:06:11.759> by

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
was that was just a blur when I went by

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.210 
was that was just a blur when I went by
15,000<00:06:12.930> miles<00:06:13.050> per<00:06:13.289> hour<00:06:13.470> but<00:06:13.710> the<00:06:13.860> setting

15,000 miles per hour but the setting

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.820 
15,000 miles per hour but the setting
was<00:06:14.729> there<00:06:14.970> and<00:06:15.210> the<00:06:15.389> hasselblad<00:06:15.960> camera<00:06:16.440> I<00:06:16.620> am

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
was there and the hasselblad camera I am

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.189 
was there and the hasselblad camera I am
told<00:06:17.099> is<00:06:17.370> about<00:06:17.940> one<00:06:18.150> of<00:06:18.180> the<00:06:18.360> best<00:06:18.720> cameras

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 
told is about one of the best cameras

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:21.379 
told is about one of the best cameras
that<00:06:19.349> you<00:06:19.470> can<00:06:19.680> purchase<00:06:19.889> and<00:06:20.250> you<00:06:20.909> would<00:06:21.180> have

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
that you can purchase and you would have

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.779 
that you can purchase and you would have
to<00:06:21.599> have<00:06:21.750> something<00:06:22.050> real<00:06:22.380> Swift<00:06:22.979> including

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
to have something real Swift including

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:26.450 
to have something real Swift including
the<00:06:23.970> a-si<00:06:24.509> film<00:06:24.840> that<00:06:25.050> was<00:06:25.199> used<00:06:25.440> in<00:06:25.590> that<00:06:25.830> so

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
the a-si film that was used in that so

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.939
