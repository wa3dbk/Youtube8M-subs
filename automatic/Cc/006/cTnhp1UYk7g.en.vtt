00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.610
 Hello ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.539
 it's time to talk about my 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:22.140
 kitchen utensils i ordered in china 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.490
 shop like the bank will be mine 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.430
 I will throw the link under the video 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.800
 I honestly forgot the rivers as I called long ago 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.610
 I just wanted such pots because 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.809
 what I saw for the first time at Volodya with whom 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.760
 went fishing in his Carpathians gray 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.770
 starting from such and one vadim 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.420
 is inserted and on each goes lid 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.370
 as she understood it as a plate and to me it 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.989
 theme they liked there if we allow 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.050
 go together they take the little ones 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.809
 Four there take more know and I 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.640
 how would you, too, want such yourself because 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.210
 what's from the army let's say when you're already 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:06.950
 I go cooked like porridge made it well 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:10.680
 much harder to clean now show 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.930
 let's say much more convenient but toilet 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.770
 paper and the same let's say this fist 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.630
 scrub or 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.299
 put your hand on this narrow here 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.320
 hole agree it turns out here two 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.259
 pot and 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.250
 I have all the tea accessories 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:31.640
 is inside prayed the distance to and 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.170
 look at what chip let's say 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.740
 I usually took an army and a mug in 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.790
 I brewed tea 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.540
 in a pot cooked go I get miter 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.030
 Christmas tree 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.700
 mug occupied more space than 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.549
 let's say these two bowlers so little moreover i 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.490
 Now on the scales still tell see 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.580
 this little sound comes out here 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:02.259
 this lid for tea here i brew 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.299
 hence his tea drink this, I still nothing 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.019
 I didn’t cook it now 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:10.660
 pea soup here in my phone 

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:14.940
 all these parameters are recorded here this 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:21.880
 large capacity plates r250 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:27.180
 Bowl 06 is now a small pot 1 liter and 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:32.049
 here is this bowl 05 army yesterday i measure 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:35.200
 liter 375 but it turns out like 125 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.290
 a gram more but this particular role is not a game 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.190
 and amide more precisely from this large 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.930
 then look weighs army bowler 385 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.900
 gram but since i still take with me 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.690
 the mug she weighs 150 pioneers and together 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.329
 it turns out 540 and here it is all 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.690
 Chinese 500 weighs 20 grams that is, 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.609
 weight wins a bit well I go to the mountains 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.970
 so for me there these temples were 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:04.420
 very important then 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.670
 I'm confused by these rivets I thought a little 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.700
 Do what you know can water through them 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.800
 squander seep yes but flooded 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.710
 he also watched the water and it was not warm through them 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:19.120
 Now we cook the soup, too, see 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:22.620
 she's a whole lot of compact from me to 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.840
 the only negative when tea is brewed and 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.180
 if you do not wipe it with this mug 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.610
 then you put the balloon in there 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.090
 covered with sweat condensate and here 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:38.160
 this topic can rust it already 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:45.000
 the cylinder is shorter it becomes unusable 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:47.740
 here I can smear pens wanted to say 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.310
 how do you say covered with silicone or 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:55.959
 it is well in general non-slip 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:59.290
 back heat shrinkage and yes that's the same tibet 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:03.190
 immediately and the plate again as for me 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.870
 very practical now we still have it 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.220
 a little exploit and how else 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.880
 a look that's really when 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:15.790
 heating up will there be subtitles language 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.820
 breakdown shorter generally well basins me 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.400
 I like very much they already deliver 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.050
 pleasure for porridge let's say this and 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.970
 for three enough for two in general from 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.890
 this kit with my head by the way 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.890
 appeared on the balloon adapter too 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.750
 he will be reviewed not the adapter there 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.700
 adapter for refilling cylinders and 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.770
 now I’m not going to save them 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:41.460
 You need to understand now they are with this dollar 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.460
 rose strongly here that the well will begin 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.530
 when I brew tea in a mug 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.389
 there is no cover on it firstly it is fast 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:54.840
 cools secondly badly brewed 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:05:00.010
 here covered fell asleep but brewed 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:02.980
 better and and so fast glass box yes not 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.530
 soup flows see through the holes 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.080
 Well, look here at 1 let's say 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.020
 right in the boat you can brew ear if 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.200
 never pester back 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:19.200
 keep throwing and make yourself a yummy well 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:21.130
 and yulechka I have simple water fish salt and 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.650
 onion 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.430
 even more personal to any cereals 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.040
 nothing 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.040
 one water the main thing more fish to 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.460
 Yushka was rich and nothing more 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.040
 no need 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.550
 and I cook it in 20 minutes only 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.470
 poured noise thought the camera turned on through 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:42.700
 ledge is not poured here everything is clear 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:47.490
 it pours like this does not overwhelm such 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:50.290
 Bowler is more convenient to wipe round than 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.810
 narrow army and a bowl you see 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:57.070
 gray by the handles 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:06:00.700
 better to keep than here as she bakes 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:04.360
 shorter so hot Well, that's like a super vish 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.580
 I have it in the folded state 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.360
 this is turned over and to whom more 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:18.180
 compact burner 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:18.180
 scoring here, too, something like this 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:32.360
 and the last touch of the opanka well, you 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:37.380
 see the dishes in one color with my spoon 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:40.699
 this is also a big plus yes it’s all as if 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:43.610
 packed in such 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:51.380
 net bag is understandable if it is 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:56.160
 Well, in soot who does not help if on the burner 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:58.440
 I did not let it cook clearly I think that it 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.440
 made a grid so that if you 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:06.300
 dishes wet water evaporated can be 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:08.880
 maybe everything in my opinion is all that is necessary 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.979
 said the link to the store there by the way and 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.840
 Description in Russian I will throw under 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:15.539
 video 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:18.030
 now I hope someone this information will be 

00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:22.320
 useful acquisition in China now 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:24.600
 gaining fashion yes this is true with our 

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:27.500
 the prices of all good bye to
