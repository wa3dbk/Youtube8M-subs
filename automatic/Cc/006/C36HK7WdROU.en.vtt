00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
and let's see um okay I think these two

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.140 
and let's see um okay I think these two
are<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:09.229> 20<00:02:09.619> inches<00:02:10.070> I<00:02:10.280> think<00:02:10.610> these<00:02:10.850> two<00:02:11.120> are

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
are the 20 inches I think these two are

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.380 
are the 20 inches I think these two are
to<00:02:11.300> 20<00:02:11.600> inches<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.350> it<00:02:13.160> feels<00:02:13.610> really<00:02:13.880> soft

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
to 20 inches and it feels really soft

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.340 
to 20 inches and it feels really soft
and<00:02:14.750> when<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:15.110> run<00:02:15.380> my<00:02:15.590> fingers<00:02:16.100> through<00:02:16.460> it<00:02:16.520> I'm

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
and when I run my fingers through it I'm

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:26.860 
and when I run my fingers through it I'm
not<00:02:18.350> getting<00:02:18.860> any<00:02:19.070> strands<00:02:19.760> at<00:02:19.880> all<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:26.180> let

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
not getting any strands at all and let

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.990 
not getting any strands at all and let
me<00:02:26.900> smell<00:02:27.350> it

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.580 

so<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:32.090> does<00:02:32.360> kind<00:02:32.599> of<00:02:32.660> have<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:32.989> factory

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
so it does kind of have that factory

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.550 
so it does kind of have that factory
small<00:02:33.950> but<00:02:34.129> it's<00:02:34.310> not<00:02:34.550> strong<00:02:35.000> at<00:02:35.390> all<00:02:35.560> it's

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
small but it's not strong at all it's

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.430 
small but it's not strong at all it's
not<00:02:36.830> strong<00:02:37.160> at<00:02:37.340> all<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.690> webs<00:02:38.959> are

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
not strong at all and the webs are

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.280 
not strong at all and the webs are
constructed<00:02:40.190> really<00:02:40.610> well<00:02:40.819> I<00:02:41.150> do<00:02:41.480> see<00:02:42.050> some

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
constructed really well I do see some

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.369 
constructed really well I do see some
beers<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.709> are<00:02:42.920> popping<00:02:43.280> out<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:43.849> I<00:02:44.510> guess

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
beers that are popping out and I guess

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.290 
beers that are popping out and I guess
that's<00:02:45.560> because<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:46.190> beards<00:02:46.580> are<00:02:46.730> really

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
that's because the beards are really

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.870 
that's because the beards are really
really<00:02:47.599> short<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.590> with<00:02:49.099> this<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.489> bids<00:02:49.730> are

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
really short so with this the bids are

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.759 
really short so with this the bids are
really<00:02:50.180> really<00:02:50.360> short<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:50.959> i<00:02:51.019> guess<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.530> weft

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
really really short so i guess the weft

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.750 
really really short so i guess the weft
caught<00:02:52.130> up<00:02:52.310> on<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.790> it<00:02:52.940> it<00:02:53.269> made<00:02:53.720> it<00:02:53.840> stick<00:02:54.170> out

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
caught up on to it it made it stick out

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.039 
caught up on to it it made it stick out
but<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:55.849> construction<00:02:56.390> of<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.630> web<00:02:56.810> is

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
but the construction of the web is

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.210 
but the construction of the web is
really<00:02:57.530> neat<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.130> strong<00:02:58.640> as<00:02:58.940> I<00:02:58.970> can<00:02:59.239> feel<00:02:59.540> it

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
really neat and strong as I can feel it

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.890 
really neat and strong as I can feel it
and<00:03:01.220> I'll<00:03:01.670> show<00:03:01.849> you<00:03:01.880> what<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.209> bundles<00:03:02.660> look

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
and I'll show you what the bundles look

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.569 
and I'll show you what the bundles look
like<00:03:03.170> this<00:03:03.440> is<00:03:03.739> Malaysian<00:03:04.370> body<00:03:04.610> wave<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:06.579> the

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
like this is Malaysian body wave and the

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.059 
like this is Malaysian body wave and the
ends<00:03:07.910> of<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.120> hair<00:03:08.150> is<00:03:08.540> pretty<00:03:09.140> good<00:03:09.530> no<00:03:09.739> split

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
ends of the hair is pretty good no split

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.000 
ends of the hair is pretty good no split
ends<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:10.640> it's<00:03:11.209> not<00:03:11.510> then<00:03:12.019> it's<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.739> good

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
ends and it's not then it's the good

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.839 
ends and it's not then it's the good
density<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:13.849> they<00:03:14.480> hear<00:03:14.690> a<00:03:14.720> stick<00:03:15.200> from<00:03:15.849> roots

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
density and they hear a stick from roots

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.520 
density and they hear a stick from roots
to<00:03:17.000> tips<00:03:19.000> so<00:03:20.000> let<00:03:20.269> me<00:03:20.390> show<00:03:20.569> you<00:03:20.599> what<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.019> 18

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
to tips so let me show you what the 18

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.819 
to tips so let me show you what the 18
looks<00:03:21.799> like<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:23.239> 18<00:03:23.660> looks<00:03:23.900> exactly<00:03:24.260> like<00:03:24.500> the

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
looks like the 18 looks exactly like the

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.479 
looks like the 18 looks exactly like the
body<00:03:25.069> wave<00:03:25.720> and<00:03:26.720> it<00:03:27.410> has<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.739> same<00:03:28.069> scent

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
body wave and it has the same scent

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:34.360 
body wave and it has the same scent
again<00:03:28.730> it's<00:03:29.209> not<00:03:29.540> strong<00:03:31.329> and<00:03:32.829> as<00:03:33.829> I<00:03:34.010> run<00:03:34.190> my

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
again it's not strong and as I run my

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.440 
again it's not strong and as I run my
fingers<00:03:34.819> through<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.440> no<00:03:36.440> shouting<00:03:36.739> at<00:03:36.980> all

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
fingers through it no shouting at all

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.870 
fingers through it no shouting at all
there<00:03:38.450> is<00:03:38.720> some<00:03:39.049> flyaways<00:03:39.560> at<00:03:40.069> the<00:03:40.220> top<00:03:40.549> right

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
there is some flyaways at the top right

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.559 
there is some flyaways at the top right
here<00:03:41.560> but<00:03:42.560> that's<00:03:42.829> about<00:03:43.220> it<00:03:43.280> so<00:03:44.030> this<00:03:44.239> is<00:03:44.389> what

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
here but that's about it so this is what

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:56.600 
here but that's about it so this is what
the<00:03:45.880> body<00:03:46.880> wave<00:03:47.209> looks<00:03:47.450> like

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:04.850 

so<00:03:57.180> I<00:03:57.690> put<00:03:58.080> it<00:03:58.170> all<00:03:58.290> together<00:04:03.440> think<00:04:04.440> maybe

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
so I put it all together think maybe

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.300 
so I put it all together think maybe
this<00:04:05.130> way<00:04:05.990> you<00:04:06.990> can<00:04:07.200> see<00:04:07.440> what<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.800> body<00:04:08.040> wave

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
this way you can see what the body wave

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.210 
this way you can see what the body wave
looks<00:04:08.550> like<00:04:08.820> they<00:04:09.000> all<00:04:09.240> connect<00:04:12.860> so<00:04:13.860> let<00:04:14.160> me

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
looks like they all connect so let me

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.970 
looks like they all connect so let me
show<00:04:14.520> you<00:04:14.580> what<00:04:14.940> the<00:04:15.090> closure<00:04:15.450> looks<00:04:15.900> like<00:04:16.200> the

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
show you what the closure looks like the

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.720 
show you what the closure looks like the
closure<00:04:17.310> also<00:04:17.880> has<00:04:18.150> a<00:04:18.180> body<00:04:18.540> wave<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.730> it

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
closure also has a body wave and it

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.510 
closure also has a body wave and it
feels<00:04:20.760> really<00:04:21.390> soft<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:22.380> density<00:04:22.890> of<00:04:22.950> this<00:04:23.250> is

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
feels really soft the density of this is

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.090 
feels really soft the density of this is
medium<00:04:24.090> it's<00:04:24.330> not<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:24.840> thick<00:04:25.170> but<00:04:25.740> it's<00:04:25.890> not

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
medium it's not that thick but it's not

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.640 
medium it's not that thick but it's not
too<00:04:26.430> thin<00:04:26.730> either<00:04:27.030> and<00:04:27.480> there<00:04:28.050> is<00:04:28.290> some

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
too thin either and there is some

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.940 
too thin either and there is some
flyaways<00:04:29.010> um<00:04:29.760> at<00:04:30.419> the<00:04:30.990> beginning<00:04:31.530> of<00:04:31.710> the

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
flyaways um at the beginning of the

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.440 
flyaways um at the beginning of the
closure<00:04:32.310> and<00:04:32.870> it<00:04:33.870> also<00:04:34.169> has<00:04:34.740> its<00:04:35.640> own<00:04:35.910> define

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
closure and it also has its own define

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.610 
closure and it also has its own define
part<00:04:37.040> so<00:04:38.040> that's<00:04:38.550> really<00:04:39.060> good<00:04:39.600> for<00:04:39.930> those<00:04:40.350> who

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
part so that's really good for those who

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.500 
part so that's really good for those who
do<00:04:40.860> not<00:04:40.890> want<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:41.910> UM<00:04:43.460> create<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.610> part<00:04:45.120> so

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
do not want to UM create a part so

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.890 
do not want to UM create a part so
already<00:04:45.720> has<00:04:46.050> its<00:04:46.350> own<00:04:46.560> part<00:04:47.250> and<00:04:47.580> it<00:04:48.390> also<00:04:48.630> has

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
already has its own part and it also has

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.409 
already has its own part and it also has
its<00:04:49.380> own<00:04:49.680> peripheral<00:04:50.340> edges<00:04:50.550> so<00:04:50.970> that<00:04:51.000> you<00:04:51.270> do

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
its own peripheral edges so that you do

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:59.360 
its own peripheral edges so that you do
not<00:04:51.450> tear<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.860> lace<00:04:53.310> or<00:04:53.640> over<00:04:54.270> stretch<00:04:54.570> it<00:04:58.370> so

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
not tear the lace or over stretch it so

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.700 
not tear the lace or over stretch it so
the<00:04:59.610> color<00:04:59.880> of<00:04:59.970> this<00:05:00.150> hair<00:05:00.540> is<00:05:00.690> a<00:05:00.810> light<00:05:01.260> brown

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
the color of this hair is a light brown

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.640 
the color of this hair is a light brown
maybe<00:05:02.340> number<00:05:02.820> two<00:05:03.090> so<00:05:03.660> if<00:05:03.930> you<00:05:04.110> do<00:05:04.380> much

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
maybe number two so if you do much

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.460 
maybe number two so if you do much
darker<00:05:05.130> hair<00:05:05.400> you<00:05:05.580> would<00:05:05.700> have<00:05:05.940> to<00:05:06.240> use<00:05:06.930> a<00:05:06.960> semi
