her<00:02:50.019> life<00:02:50.290> I<00:02:50.680> think<00:02:52.079> intellectually<00:02:53.079> and<00:02:53.910> her

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
her life I think intellectually and her

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.720 
her life I think intellectually and her
intellect<00:02:55.480> gave<00:02:56.380> voice<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.709> her<00:02:57.190> heart<00:02:57.489> in<00:02:57.669> a

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
sense

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.850 
sense
and<00:02:58.420> um<00:02:59.370> it's<00:03:00.370> very<00:03:01.210> powerful<00:03:01.750> all<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.830> her

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
and um it's very powerful all of her

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.580 
and um it's very powerful all of her
work<00:03:03.160> takes<00:03:03.520> really<00:03:03.820> seriously<00:03:04.540> that<00:03:05.140> one's

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
work takes really seriously that one's

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.570 
work takes really seriously that one's
personal<00:03:06.100> life<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.640> daily<00:03:06.850> life<00:03:07.270> is<00:03:08.580> actually

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
personal life and daily life is actually

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.610 
personal life and daily life is actually
a<00:03:09.610> way<00:03:09.820> to<00:03:09.880> make<00:03:10.150> change<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.810> so<00:03:11.200> that's

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
a way to make change and so that's

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.160 
a way to make change and so that's
another<00:03:11.860> reason<00:03:12.130> I<00:03:12.340> think<00:03:12.400> of<00:03:12.670> it<00:03:12.700> is<00:03:13.170> an

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
another reason I think of it is an

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.840 
another reason I think of it is an
important<00:03:14.710> feminist<00:03:14.860> intervention<00:03:15.670> that

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
important feminist intervention that

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.010 
important feminist intervention that
probably<00:03:16.680> could<00:03:17.680> only<00:03:17.860> happen<00:03:18.310> through<00:03:19.020> some

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
probably could only happen through some

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.190 
probably could only happen through some
sort<00:03:20.170> of<00:03:20.260> popular<00:03:20.740> form<00:03:21.130> like<00:03:21.910> this<00:03:22.180> one<00:03:23.080> of

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
sort of popular form like this one of

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.600 
sort of popular form like this one of
the<00:03:23.290> things<00:03:23.440> that<00:03:23.500> was<00:03:23.680> so<00:03:23.770> great<00:03:24.010> about<00:03:24.040> dykes
