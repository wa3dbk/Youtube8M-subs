00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
this Springs for the emergency stop line

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.800 
this Springs for the emergency stop line
and<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:12.180> important<00:01:13.049> part<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.350> motor<00:01:13.680> itself

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
and the important part the motor itself

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.570 
and the important part the motor itself
so<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.439> have<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.770> whole<00:01:16.920> plastic<00:01:17.400> wheel

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
so we just have this whole plastic wheel

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.660 
so we just have this whole plastic wheel
on<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.930> one<00:01:19.170> quarter<00:01:19.530> horse<00:01:19.740> motor<00:01:20.369> with<00:01:20.640> a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
on this one quarter horse motor with a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.810 
on this one quarter horse motor with a
thirty<00:01:21.060> five<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:21.659> reducer<00:01:22.140> which<00:01:22.979> works

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
thirty five to one reducer which works

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.899 
thirty five to one reducer which works
pretty<00:01:24.030> good<00:01:24.890> then<00:01:25.890> we<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.189> have<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.610> base

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
pretty good then we just have this base

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.100 
pretty good then we just have this base
that<00:01:26.939> slides<00:01:27.659> back<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.930> forth<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:30.110> crank

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
that slides back and forth on and crank

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.740 
that slides back and forth on and crank
back<00:01:31.470> there<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.189> crank<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.579> up<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.060> down<00:01:33.650> wood

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
back there to crank it up and down wood

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.560 
back there to crank it up and down wood
and<00:01:36.750> then<00:01:37.079> that's<00:01:37.320> basically<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.130> here<00:01:38.570> we

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
and then that's basically it up here we

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.170 
and then that's basically it up here we
got<00:01:39.780> an<00:01:39.900> emergency<00:01:40.140> stop<00:01:40.680> line<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.670> plugs<00:01:42.000> in

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
got an emergency stop line that plugs in

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.670 
got an emergency stop line that plugs in
there<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.570> then<00:01:42.689> if<00:01:42.780> anything<00:01:43.020> twisted<00:01:43.560> it

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
there and then if anything twisted it

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.010 
there and then if anything twisted it
just<00:01:43.860> turns<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.189> off<00:01:47.420> okay<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.479> let's<00:01:48.780> plug

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
just turns it off okay so let's plug

00:01:49.020 --> 00:02:19.040 
just turns it off okay so let's plug
that<00:01:49.049> back<00:01:49.290> in

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.660 

okay<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:20.110> that's<00:02:20.440> basically<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.040> so<00:02:21.460> let's

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
okay so that's basically it so let's

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.600 
okay so that's basically it so let's
just<00:02:21.790> go<00:02:22.270> down<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.630> hill<00:02:22.840> not<00:02:23.800> gonna<00:02:24.010> take<00:02:24.190> GT

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
just go down the hill not gonna take GT

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.060 
just go down the hill not gonna take GT
because<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.090> always<00:02:25.240> crashed<00:02:25.630> so<00:02:26.590> there's<00:02:26.860> this

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
because I always crashed so there's this

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.310 
because I always crashed so there's this
fly<00:02:27.370> switch<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:27.910> it<00:02:28.180> which<00:02:28.480> it's<00:02:28.690> not<00:02:28.900> hard<00:02:29.200> to

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
fly switch is it which it's not hard to

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.660 
fly switch is it which it's not hard to
find<00:02:29.440> how<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.710> do<00:02:29.890> that<00:02:30.040> on<00:02:30.220> other<00:02:30.400> YouTube

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
find how to do that on other YouTube

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.320 
find how to do that on other YouTube

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
now and I don't know why I decided to

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.460 
now and I don't know why I decided to
shoot<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.030> video<00:03:13.150> right<00:03:13.510> now<00:03:13.660> there's<00:03:14.320> the

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.580 
grind grind homemade box ramp basically
it<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:24.100> then<00:03:24.280> down<00:03:24.550> here<00:03:24.580> we<00:03:25.060> have<00:03:25.270> I<00:03:25.660> guess

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
it and then down here we have I guess

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.350 
it and then down here we have I guess
the<00:03:26.890> ropes<00:03:27.280> actually<00:03:27.640> kind<00:03:27.820> of<00:03:27.880> hard<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.180> hold

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
the ropes actually kind of hard to hold

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
the ropes actually kind of hard to hold
on<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.810> all<00:03:29.110> its<00:03:29.290> going<00:03:29.530> up<00:03:29.880> so<00:03:30.880> we've<00:03:30.970> got<00:03:31.380> two

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
on to all its going up so we've got two

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.140 
on to all its going up so we've got two
little<00:03:32.620> like<00:03:32.770> hook<00:03:33.280> things<00:03:33.580> that<00:03:33.820> hook<00:03:33.970> onto

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
little like hook things that hook onto

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.220 
little like hook things that hook onto
the<00:03:34.510> splice<00:03:34.900> that<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:36.130> hold<00:03:36.340> on<00:03:36.490> to<00:03:36.760> that<00:03:37.270> when

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
the splice that you hold on to that when

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.570 
the splice that you hold on to that when
you're<00:03:38.380> done<00:03:38.500> with<00:03:38.740> them<00:03:38.860> at<00:03:39.010> your<00:03:39.130> talk<00:03:39.310> just

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
you're done with them at your talk just

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
running down the emergency stop line and

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.130 
running down the emergency stop line and
stop<00:03:41.560> right<00:03:41.740> here<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.690> then<00:03:43.690> there's<00:03:43.960> the

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
stop right here and then there's the

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.270 
stop right here and then there's the
little<00:03:44.700> whoops<00:03:45.700> almost<00:03:46.030> slipped<00:03:47.280> bottom

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.510 

just<00:05:03.020> stopped<00:05:03.290> it<00:05:03.500> you<00:05:03.620> can<00:05:03.740> pull<00:05:03.920> it<00:05:04.040> up<00:05:04.130> or

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.710 
down the hill
doesn't<00:05:05.990> really<00:05:06.080> matter<00:05:06.970> no<00:05:07.970> more<00:05:08.210> extensive

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
doesn't really matter no more extensive

doesn't really matter no more extensive
look<00:05:08.840> at<00:05:08.990> the<00:05:09.080> splice<00:05:09.380> here<00:05:09.740> that's<00:05:10.010> where

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
look at the splice here that's where

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.530 
look at the splice here that's where
everything<00:05:10.310> hooks<00:05:10.640> on<00:05:10.820> to<00:05:11.320> vice<00:05:13.300> hook<00:05:14.300> which

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
everything hooks on to vice hook which

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.520 
everything hooks on to vice hook which
over<00:05:14.810> the<00:05:14.900> years<00:05:15.080> over<00:05:15.200> the<00:05:15.700> two<00:05:16.700> seasons<00:05:17.530> got

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
over the years over the two seasons got

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.090 
over the years over the two seasons got
bent<00:05:19.510> now<00:05:20.510> they<00:05:21.140> took<00:05:21.290> me<00:05:21.470> a<00:05:21.500> while<00:05:21.650> to<00:05:21.710> build

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
bent now they took me a while to build

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.860 
bent now they took me a while to build
this<00:05:23.050> because<00:05:24.050> I<00:05:24.910> got<00:05:25.910> the<00:05:26.060> whole<00:05:26.210> idea<00:05:26.570> for

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
this because I got the whole idea for

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.770 
this because I got the whole idea for
this<00:05:27.020> in<00:05:27.200> August<00:05:27.680> and<00:05:27.919> right<00:05:28.100> now<00:05:28.250> it's<00:05:28.430> early

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
this in August and right now it's early

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.159 
this in August and right now it's early
December<00:05:30.760> picked<00:05:31.760> me<00:05:31.910> a<00:05:31.940> wall<00:05:32.180> started<00:05:33.050> out

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
December picked me a wall started out

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.570 
December picked me a wall started out
with<00:05:33.290> two<00:05:33.530> pulleys<00:05:33.860> and<00:05:35.050> 20-foot<00:05:36.050> rope<00:05:36.580> that

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
with two pulleys and 20-foot rope that

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.070 
with two pulleys and 20-foot rope that
you<00:05:37.730> pulled<00:05:37.940> around<00:05:38.030> by<00:05:38.300> hand<00:05:38.630> and<00:05:38.900> then<00:05:39.020> it

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
you pulled around by hand and then it

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.870 
you pulled around by hand and then it
evolved<00:05:39.650> into<00:05:39.919> this<00:05:40.660> so<00:05:41.660> that's<00:05:41.750> basically<00:05:42.260> it

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
evolved into this so that's basically it

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.810 
evolved into this so that's basically it
ok<00:05:43.880> thanks<00:05:44.270> for<00:05:44.390> watching
