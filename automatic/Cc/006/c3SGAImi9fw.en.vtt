00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.519
 [Music] 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.000
 so that our body can work properly 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.920
 are three basic requirements 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.610
 required a regular reception 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.110
 of nutrients a constant 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.220
 oxygen supply for the 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:38.660
 energy from this year substances 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.660
 and the excretion of waste materials 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.760
 to fulfill these basic requirements 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.309
 our body will have special 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.229
 organs or systems the utmost 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.129
 reliable and coordinated 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:55.769
 work to build and function this 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.900
 we will recognize the body systems 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.080
 organs and tissues they consist of 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.059
 they grace and examine almost all in 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.549
 This film used organs samples 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.900
 come from the pig and are in 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.900
 similar to ours in many ways 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.740
 [Music] 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.880
 [Applause] 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.880
 [Music] 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.800
 The cardiovascular system consists of 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.530
 the heart of a biological double pump 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.710
 which circulate the fluid organ blood 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.380
 lets and the extensive network of 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.850
 blood vessels in which the blood dreams and 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.850
 body is transported 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.170
 in this system, the blood carries 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.200
 live to important substances like 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.150
 oxygen to the cells and 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.350
 waste materials such as carbon dioxide too 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.350
 the excretory organ 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.729
 our heart is a strong high muscle 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.340
 with slight left tilt it lies in 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.729
 the middle of the chest bordered by 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.729
 the boy 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.710
 the heart is with the two 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.150
 lungsflÃ¼geln by these large 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.150
 Connected blood vessels 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:28.520
 the pulmonary artery transports blood from 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.290
 heart to the lungs via the four young 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.450
 Vienna then gets blood again 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.870
 heart back 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.940
 the other blood vessel is the aorta the 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.940
 largest vein of our body 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:52.010
 The heart consists of four chambers of the 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:56.209
 left atrium of the left ventricle of the heart 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.569
 Right ventricle and the right one 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.569
 forecourt 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.749
 [Music] 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.220
 this heart was cut open like that 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.220
 we in the chamber
