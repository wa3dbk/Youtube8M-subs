flat down pretty good and so now as you
approach<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.350> ramp<00:00:25.470> you're<00:00:25.830> gonna<00:00:25.920> go<00:00:26.099> about

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
approach the ramp you're gonna go about

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.679 
approach the ramp you're gonna go about
the<00:00:26.369> same<00:00:26.609> speed<00:00:26.970> as<00:00:27.150> if<00:00:27.269> you're<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.510> just

a foot jam like here you have to hop all

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.590 
a foot jam like here you have to hop all
that<00:00:34.500> way<00:00:34.680> back<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.969> you're<00:00:36.270> not<00:00:36.390> going

too slow to work feels like you're just
gonna<00:00:38.070> hop<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.910> do<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.090> for<00:00:39.239> him<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.690> slide

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
gonna hop and do it for him and slide

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.560 
gonna hop and do it for him and slide
down<00:00:40.079> brand<00:00:42.020> yourself<00:00:43.610> and<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:44.969> as<00:00:45.329> you

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570

down brand yourself and so as you
approach<00:00:45.660> your<00:00:45.899> ramp

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
approach your ramp

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.440 
approach your ramp
you're<00:00:46.980> gonna<00:00:47.100> kind<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.460> make<00:00:47.910> your<00:00:48.090> way<00:00:48.239> up<00:00:48.420> to

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
you're gonna kind of make your way up to

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.020 
you're gonna kind of make your way up to
transition<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.289> carve<00:00:50.010> into<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.670> foot<00:00:50.850> jam

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
transition and carve into the foot jam

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.209 
transition and carve into the foot jam
you're<00:00:51.629> not<00:00:51.780> gonna<00:00:51.899> just<00:00:52.140> ride<00:00:52.440> up<00:00:52.469> spin<00:00:53.039> any

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
you're not gonna just ride up spin any

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.950 
you're not gonna just ride up spin any
degrees<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.940> foot<00:00:54.180> jam<00:00:54.360> you're<00:00:54.870> gonna

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
degrees and do a foot jam you're gonna

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.380 
degrees and do a foot jam you're gonna
kind<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.230> ride<00:00:55.469> up<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.890> carve<00:00:56.610> your<00:00:56.910> way<00:00:57.090> into

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
kind of ride up and carve your way into

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.660 
kind of ride up and carve your way into
it<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:58.260> what<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.590> does<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.160> allows<00:00:59.460> you

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
it and what this does is it allows you

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.580 
it and what this does is it allows you
to<00:00:59.760> become<00:01:00.059> parallel<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.930> ramp<00:01:01.170> son

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
to become parallel with the ramp son

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.799 
to become parallel with the ramp son
it's<00:01:01.710> easier<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.010> hop<00:01:02.129> back<00:01:02.340> into<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.570> sets

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
it's easier to hop back into and it sets

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.230 
it's easier to hop back into and it sets
you<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> right<00:01:04.260> balance<00:01:04.530> position<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.519> it

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
you in the right balance position and it

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.240 
you in the right balance position and it
allows<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.689> dig<00:01:06.900> your<00:01:07.110> shoulder<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.770> son

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
allows you to dig your shoulder and son

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.649 
allows you to dig your shoulder and son
it's<00:01:08.369> easier<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.760> hop<00:01:08.939> back<00:01:09.390> into<00:01:09.570> the

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
it's easier to hop back into the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.320 
it's easier to hop back into the
transition<00:01:10.610> so<00:01:11.610> once<00:01:11.790> you're<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.060> actual

transition so once you're in the actual

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.120 
transition so once you're in the actual
foot<00:01:12.510> jam<00:01:12.659> position<00:01:13.170> you're<00:01:13.530> gonna<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.860> all

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
foot jam position you're gonna have all

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.620 
foot jam position you're gonna have all
your<00:01:14.280> weight<00:01:14.460> on<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.640> front<00:01:15.000> tire<00:01:15.210> you're
