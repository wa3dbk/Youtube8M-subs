designs so the best thing to do is

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.830 
designs so the best thing to do is
experiment<00:01:04.009> and<00:01:04.519> see<00:01:04.970> what<00:01:05.000> works<00:01:05.150> best<00:01:05.630> with

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
experiment and see what works best with

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.899 
experiment and see what works best with
your<00:01:06.049> drawing

floo<00:01:30.730> works<00:01:31.030> well<00:01:31.330> with<00:01:31.570> spray<00:01:31.900> brushes<00:01:32.380> as<00:01:32.590> it

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
floo works well with spray brushes as it

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.190 
floo works well with spray brushes as it
controls<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.640> density<00:01:34.180> of<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.390> paint<00:01:34.630> as<00:01:34.870> its

changing the smoothness setting will
affect<00:01:43.430> how<00:01:43.640> smooth<00:01:44.030> your<00:01:44.180> stroke<00:01:44.509> is<00:01:44.540> applied

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.970 

you

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.700 

next<00:04:56.880> we'll<00:04:57.330> change<00:04:57.720> the<00:04:57.930> brush<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.350> something

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
next we'll change the brush to something

next we'll change the brush to something

I'll<00:05:00.690> change<00:05:01.170> the<00:05:01.380> opacity<00:05:01.620> on<00:05:02.130> the<00:05:02.310> context

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
I'll change the opacity on the context

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
can either export it as it is or see

example when you make the color layers
visible<00:05:24.900> again

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
visible again

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.879 
visible again
alternatively<00:05:28.000> why<00:05:28.690> not<00:05:28.930> try<00:05:29.169> using<00:05:29.410> spray

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889 
alternatively why not try using spray

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.430 
alternatively why not try using spray
brushes<00:05:30.370> to<00:05:30.669> add<00:05:30.819> some<00:05:31.150> more<00:05:31.330> detail<00:05:31.389> like<00:05:32.289> you

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
brushes to add some more detail like you

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.670 
brushes to add some more detail like you
can<00:05:32.620> see<00:05:32.830> in<00:05:32.949> the<00:05:33.039> original

there<00:05:36.370> is<00:05:36.490> so<00:05:36.699> much<00:05:36.820> you<00:05:37.030> can<00:05:37.180> do<00:05:37.360> with<00:05:37.509> this

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
there is so much you can do with this

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.270 
there is so much you can do with this
drawing<00:05:37.930> and<00:05:38.199> it's<00:05:38.590> really<00:05:38.949> good<00:05:39.100> for

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
drawing and it's really good for

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.249 
drawing and it's really good for
