00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:08.460
 to 1,045 elections just before the release 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.460
 of Sansepolcro 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:16.760
 a gentleman here in front has hooked 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.760
 bartoletti trailer 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.660
 about 15 16 years of age 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.970
 trailers and two axles load of benz that 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.670
 they carry fruit 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.279
 traveling at one speed are active 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.000
 around 80 85 kilometers per hour and 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.430
 we give public danger 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.240
 that in tow the load so the swerves 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.240
 often willingly 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.890
 lewis is noticeably 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.470
 the rough road 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.500
 now he is traveling too hard 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.329
 for the load and half the trailer that 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.790
 have 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.280
 now if you look 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.260
 you will notice 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.539
 the machines that switch to white that 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.840
 often and willingly take from 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.840
 spaghetti 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.229
 that he shows up conspicuously 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.299
 I have in front of Orte what he has 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.159
 made two hours of road behind and in 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.619
 several occasions he risked 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.220
 throw it out of the way 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.840
 some car then 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.700
 eye remember when you are behind 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.180
 the project to overtake a truck 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.650
 always let yourself see swells on loved ones 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.230
 and if you have doubts 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.670
 better to wait a little while to pass 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.780
 why not risk staying 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.970
 crushed reopened the road sucks 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.740
 parolo and look now like mass media 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.080
 that cut him off 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.150
 this machine and this can be heard 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.880
 then he would have made him get on the new 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.340
 jersey and it would have hurt him a lot 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.850
 bad because a truck loads so alone 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.510
 the trailer weight is 200 220 dense and of 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:07.860
 how they load up like an egg 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.860
 expand right left 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:14.970
 and the driver of this truck a 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.600
 unconscious is not a mystery of 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.600
 unconscious
