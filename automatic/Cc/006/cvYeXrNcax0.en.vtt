biggest<00:02:38.549> flaw<00:02:39.549> I<00:02:39.819> have<00:02:39.970> my<00:02:40.180> pair<00:02:40.389> period<00:02:40.780> this

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
biggest flaw I have my pair period this

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.229 
biggest flaw I have my pair period this
glue<00:02:41.230> stain<00:02:41.440> right<00:02:41.560> here<00:02:41.910> other<00:02:42.910> than<00:02:43.000> that

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
glue stain right here other than that

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.670 
glue stain right here other than that
there's<00:02:43.569> nothing<00:02:43.900> wrong<00:02:44.019> up<00:02:44.230> here<00:02:44.400> at<00:02:45.400> all<00:02:46.680> so

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
there's nothing wrong up here at all so

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.910 
there's nothing wrong up here at all so
nice<00:02:47.799> to<00:02:47.980> see<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.160> glues<00:02:48.430> kind<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.760> sloppy<00:02:49.920> but

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
nice to see the glues kind of sloppy but

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.059 
nice to see the glues kind of sloppy but
I<00:02:51.160> got<00:02:51.280> another<00:02:51.400> pair<00:02:51.549> to<00:02:51.730> coming<00:02:52.030> in<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:53.079> we'll

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
I got another pair to coming in so we'll

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.280 
I got another pair to coming in so we'll
see<00:02:54.280> you<00:02:54.579> know<00:02:54.819> see<00:02:55.540> if<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.840> is<00:02:55.959> just<00:02:56.109> a<00:02:56.170> bad

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
see you know see if this is just a bad

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.479 
see you know see if this is just a bad
pair<00:02:56.590> or<00:02:56.889> most<00:02:57.579> pairs<00:02:57.880> come<00:02:58.060> like<00:02:58.209> that<00:02:59.489> they

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
pair or most pairs come like that they

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.840 
pair or most pairs come like that they
did<00:03:00.670> add<00:03:00.880> this<00:03:01.329> the<00:03:01.930> PSI<00:03:02.609> so<00:03:03.609> you<00:03:03.700> got<00:03:03.790> the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
did add this the PSI so you got the

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.789 
did add this the PSI so you got the
arrow<00:03:04.030> pointing<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.600> front<00:03:04.870> this<00:03:05.290> is<00:03:05.380> 20

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
arrow pointing to the front this is 20

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:11.640 
arrow pointing to the front this is 20
psi<00:03:06.750> up<00:03:07.750> here<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:09.310> then<00:03:10.209> you<00:03:10.630> have<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.840> 25<00:03:11.200> psi

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
psi up here and then you have the 25 psi

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.690 
psi up here and then you have the 25 psi
on<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.280> sides<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:13.510> then<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:13.870> got<00:03:14.049> psi<00:03:14.700> here

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
on the sides and then you got psi here

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.319 
on the sides and then you got psi here
in<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.819> back<00:03:15.940> but<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:16.120> could<00:03:16.239> definitely

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
in the back but you could definitely

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.449 
in the back but you could definitely
feel<00:03:16.599> like<00:03:17.019> this<00:03:17.170> right<00:03:17.349> here<00:03:17.560> in<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.280> back

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
feel like this right here in the back

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.039 
feel like this right here in the back
you<00:03:18.790> can<00:03:18.910> push<00:03:19.120> it<00:03:19.239> in<00:03:19.329> more<00:03:19.510> interesting<00:03:19.840> lot

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
you can push it in more interesting lot

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.750 
you can push it in more interesting lot
less<00:03:20.260> um<00:03:20.730> lot<00:03:21.730> less<00:03:21.910> pressure<00:03:23.489> whereas<00:03:24.489> these

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
less um lot less pressure whereas these

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.750 
less um lot less pressure whereas these
on<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.000> sides<00:03:25.739> there<00:03:26.739> they<00:03:27.459> have<00:03:27.549> a<00:03:27.579> lot<00:03:27.730> more

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
on the sides there they have a lot more

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.599 
on the sides there they have a lot more
like<00:03:28.060> force<00:03:28.480> put<00:03:28.989> pressure<00:03:29.609> gamma

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
like force put pressure gamma

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.120 
like force put pressure gamma
pressurized<00:03:31.120> in<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.079> black<00:03:32.410> mix<00:03:32.650> also<00:03:33.040> of

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
pressurized in the black mix also of

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.250 
pressurized in the black mix also of
course<00:03:33.310> do<00:03:34.150> you<00:03:34.180> love<00:03:34.359> what<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.599> 95<00:03:34.959> is<00:03:35.109> that

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
course do you love what the 95 is that

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.199 
course do you love what the 95 is that
gradient<00:03:35.680> look

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
gradient look

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.360 
gradient look
so<00:03:37.870> as<00:03:38.200> you<00:03:38.319> can<00:03:38.409> see<00:03:38.469> you<00:03:38.799> got<00:03:38.920> this<00:03:39.040> straight

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
so as you can see you got this straight

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.069 
so as you can see you got this straight
like<00:03:39.579> black<00:03:39.969> and<00:03:40.299> coming<00:03:40.540> up<00:03:40.659> to<00:03:40.810> like<00:03:40.900> this

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
like black and coming up to like this

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:46.110 
like black and coming up to like this
white<00:03:41.439> mesh<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:42.489> neon<00:03:43.260> lacing<00:03:44.260> underlays<00:03:45.120> get

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
white mesh the neon lacing underlays get

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.520 
white mesh the neon lacing underlays get
a<00:03:46.150> 3m<00:03:46.659> all<00:03:47.500> across<00:03:47.829> the<00:03:47.980> tongue<00:03:49.200> we<00:03:50.200> got<00:03:50.349> air

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
a 3m all across the tongue we got air

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:56.250 
a 3m all across the tongue we got air
max<00:03:50.769> up<00:03:51.010> top<00:03:51.310> stitched<00:03:52.299> in<00:03:54.000> with<00:03:55.000> white<00:03:55.329> one

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
max up top stitched in with white one

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.080 
max up top stitched in with white one
thing<00:03:56.409> I<00:03:56.500> only<00:03:57.099> thing<00:03:57.250> about<00:03:57.310> these<00:03:57.459> shoes<00:03:57.700> man

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
thing I only thing about these shoes man

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.640 
thing I only thing about these shoes man
and<00:03:58.659> why<00:03:58.810> I<00:03:58.840> had<00:03:59.019> a<00:03:59.049> double<00:03:59.349> up<00:03:59.439> is<00:03:59.560> because

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
and why I had a double up is because

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.879 
and why I had a double up is because
this<00:03:59.799> interior<00:04:00.870> lining<00:04:01.870> is<00:04:02.500> this<00:04:02.680> white

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
this interior lining is this white

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:07.770 
this interior lining is this white
material<00:04:03.480> and<00:04:04.480> so<00:04:06.239> there's<00:04:07.239> white<00:04:07.359> material

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
material and so there's white material

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.270 
material and so there's white material
you<00:04:07.840> know<00:04:07.930> I<00:04:07.989> mean<00:04:08.139> I<00:04:08.170> get<00:04:08.620> dirty<00:04:08.829> eventually

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
you know I mean I get dirty eventually

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.439 
you know I mean I get dirty eventually
