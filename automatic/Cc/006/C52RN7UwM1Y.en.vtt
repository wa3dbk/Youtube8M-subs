that<00:01:58.259> I<00:01:58.439> knew<00:01:58.649> would<00:01:58.799> work<00:01:59.039> because<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.849> had<00:01:59.999> a

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:00.029 
that I knew would work because I had a

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:02.690 
that I knew would work because I had a
lot<00:02:00.239> of<00:02:00.299> time<00:02:00.569> to<00:02:00.719> think<00:02:00.749> about<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.799> about

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
lot of time to think about it and about

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.370 
lot of time to think about it and about
you<00:02:03.119> know<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.270> started<00:02:03.809> noticing<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.349> difference

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
you know I started noticing a difference

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.099 
you know I started noticing a difference
but<00:02:05.039> one<00:02:05.759> day<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:05.939> was<00:02:06.119> in<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.329> gym<00:02:06.509> now<00:02:06.569> you

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
but one day I was in the gym now you

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:08.510 
but one day I was in the gym now you
know<00:02:07.229> just<00:02:07.439> after<00:02:07.739> we<00:02:07.829> played<00:02:08.099> around<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.429> was

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
know just after we played around I was

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.059 
know just after we played around I was
pretty<00:02:08.789> fresh<00:02:09.119> pretty<00:02:09.149> warm<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.079> I<00:02:10.679> realized

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
pretty fresh pretty warm and I realized

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.070 
pretty fresh pretty warm and I realized
that<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.340> could<00:02:11.579> do<00:02:11.730> anything<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.480> wanted<00:02:12.510> one

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
that I could do anything I wanted one

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.990 
that I could do anything I wanted one
done<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.440> could<00:02:13.740> 360<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.460> could<00:02:14.730> come<00:02:14.910> from

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
done I could 360 I could come from

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.300 
done I could 360 I could come from
outside<00:02:15.240> of<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.630> paint<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:16.080> can<00:02:16.560> dunk<00:02:16.710> this<00:02:17.040> far

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
outside of the paint I can dunk this far

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.860 
outside of the paint I can dunk this far
away<00:02:17.490> from<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.910> free-throw<00:02:18.150> line<00:02:18.390> never<00:02:18.690> got

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
away from the free-throw line never got

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.780 
away from the free-throw line never got
the<00:02:18.990> free-throw<00:02:19.380> line<00:02:19.440> but<00:02:19.770> I'm<00:02:19.950> six<00:02:20.610> foot

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
the free-throw line but I'm six foot

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.300 
the free-throw line but I'm six foot
three<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:22.110> know<00:02:22.260> there<00:02:22.830> are<00:02:22.860> people<00:02:23.070> who

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
three and you know there are people who

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.980 
three and you know there are people who
can<00:02:23.460> jump<00:02:23.730> higher<00:02:23.910> than<00:02:24.060> me<00:02:24.240> but<00:02:24.510> I've<00:02:24.600> never

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
can jump higher than me but I've never

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.980 
can jump higher than me but I've never
seen<00:02:25.440> results<00:02:25.710> like<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.250> before<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:27.120> now<00:02:27.960> I

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
seen results like that before and now I

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.560 
seen results like that before and now I
understand<00:02:28.710> what<00:02:28.920> had<00:02:29.040> happened<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.670> I'm

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
understand what had happened and I'm

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.790 
understand what had happened and I'm
going<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.780> explain<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.380> you<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.500> little<00:02:31.680> bit

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
going to explain to you a little bit

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.370 
going to explain to you a little bit
about<00:02:32.070> how<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.340> program<00:02:32.670> works<00:02:33.110> see<00:02:34.110> what<00:02:34.350> I

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
about how the program works see what I

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.410 
about how the program works see what I
was<00:02:34.710> doing<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.190> what<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.580> may<00:02:35.760> be<00:02:35.820> doing<00:02:35.970> is

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
was doing and what you may be doing is

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.020 
was doing and what you may be doing is
you<00:02:37.050> might<00:02:37.230> be<00:02:37.410> training<00:02:37.830> your<00:02:37.950> butt<00:02:38.160> off<00:02:38.340> but

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
you might be training your butt off but

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.270 
you might be training your butt off but
you<00:02:39.930> might<00:02:40.140> be<00:02:40.290> training<00:02:40.710> you're<00:02:40.860> jumping

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
you might be training you're jumping

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.890 
you might be training you're jumping
endurance<00:02:41.730> for<00:02:42.210> instance<00:02:42.540> if<00:02:42.720> you're

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
endurance for instance if you're

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.320 
endurance for instance if you're
training<00:02:43.350> yourself<00:02:43.440> at<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.340> jumping<00:02:44.820> level<00:02:45.120> say

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
training yourself at a jumping level say

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.300 
training yourself at a jumping level say
you<00:02:45.600> know<00:02:45.720> this<00:02:45.750> high<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.530> most<00:02:47.100> of<00:02:47.250> your

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
you know this high and most of your

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.730 
you know this high and most of your
training<00:02:47.670> occurs<00:02:48.120> at<00:02:48.360> this<00:02:48.570> level<00:02:48.930> you're

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
training occurs at this level you're

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.710 
training occurs at this level you're
basically<00:02:49.920> training<00:02:50.730> yourself<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:51.209> jump<00:02:51.570> at

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
basically training yourself to jump at

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.380 
basically training yourself to jump at
this<00:02:52.050> level<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.590> certain<00:02:52.890> amount<00:02:53.070> of<00:02:53.220> times<00:02:53.459> or

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
this level a certain amount of times or

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.910 
this level a certain amount of times or
in<00:02:54.630> other<00:02:54.690> words<00:02:54.810> you're<00:02:55.380> training<00:02:55.890> your

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
in other words you're training your

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.300 
in other words you're training your
jumping<00:02:56.550> endurance<00:02:57.270> and<00:02:57.540> what<00:02:58.470> you<00:02:58.800> need<00:02:59.070> in

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
jumping endurance and what you need in

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.250 
jumping endurance and what you need in
order<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.610> jump<00:02:59.940> higher<00:03:00.180> than<00:03:00.420> anyone<00:03:00.810> else<00:03:01.020> or

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
order to jump higher than anyone else or

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.530 
order to jump higher than anyone else or
to<00:03:01.350> reach<00:03:01.530> your<00:03:01.800> physical<00:03:02.430> jumping<00:03:02.910> potential

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
to reach your physical jumping potential

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.680 
to reach your physical jumping potential
is<00:03:03.690> you<00:03:04.500> need<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.709> have<00:03:05.540> explosion<00:03:06.540> and

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
is you need to have explosion and

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.310 
is you need to have explosion and
explosions<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.070> is<00:03:08.250> created<00:03:08.730> in<00:03:08.850> two<00:03:09.060> ways

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
explosions and it is created in two ways

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.110 
explosions and it is created in two ways
the<00:03:10.320> combination<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:11.100> strength<00:03:11.700> and

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
the combination of strength and

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.960 
the combination of strength and
quickness<00:03:13.130> you<00:03:14.130> can<00:03:14.250> have<00:03:14.370> one<00:03:14.580> but<00:03:14.760> not<00:03:14.910> the

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
quickness you can have one but not the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.930 
quickness you can have one but not the
other<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.780> formula<00:03:16.290> will<00:03:16.800> not<00:03:17.010> work<00:03:17.220> but

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
other and the formula will not work but

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.290 
other and the formula will not work but
strength<00:03:18.600> plus<00:03:19.320> quickness<00:03:19.890> equals<00:03:20.670> explosion

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
strength plus quickness equals explosion

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.120 
strength plus quickness equals explosion
so<00:03:21.900> if<00:03:22.019> you<00:03:22.110> train<00:03:22.380> your<00:03:22.500> legs<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.890> react

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
so if you train your legs to react

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.970 
so if you train your legs to react
quickly<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.700> enta<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.989> move<00:03:25.440> their<00:03:25.680> force

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
quickly and enta and to move their force

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.190 
quickly and enta and to move their force
quickly<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:26.820> you<00:03:27.180> have<00:03:27.330> a<00:03:27.360> lot<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.690> strength

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
quickly and you have a lot of strength

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.680 
quickly and you have a lot of strength
then<00:03:28.860> you<00:03:28.980> have<00:03:29.130> explosion<00:03:29.730> presence<00:03:30.600> a

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
then you have explosion presence a

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.509 
then you have explosion presence a
bodybuilder<00:03:31.320> may<00:03:31.500> have<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.680> lot<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:31.980> strength

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
bodybuilder may have a lot of strength

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.900 
bodybuilder may have a lot of strength
they<00:03:32.730> may<00:03:32.940> be<00:03:33.000> able<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:33.739> you<00:03:34.739> know<00:03:34.880> squat<00:03:35.880> a

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
they may be able to you know squat a

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.509 
they may be able to you know squat a
thousand<00:03:36.780> pounds<00:03:36.980> but<00:03:37.980> they<00:03:38.070> have<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.280> do<00:03:38.400> it

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
thousand pounds but they have to do it

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.910 
thousand pounds but they have to do it
slowly<00:03:38.850> you<00:03:39.570> know<00:03:39.690> rise<00:03:39.900> up<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.350> down<00:03:40.560> that's

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
slowly you know rise up and down that's

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.250 
slowly you know rise up and down that's
not<00:03:41.160> going<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.519> create<00:03:41.730> explosion<00:03:42.330> that's<00:03:42.989> not

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
not going to create explosion that's not

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.949 
not going to create explosion that's not
going<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.500> create<00:03:43.739> a<00:03:43.830> vertical<00:03:44.370> jump<00:03:44.810> so<00:03:45.810> what

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
going to create a vertical jump so what

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.110 
going to create a vertical jump so what
our<00:03:46.050> program<00:03:46.440> does<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:46.920> shows<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.370> what

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
our program does is it shows you what

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.449 
our program does is it shows you what
training<00:03:48.630> exercise<00:03:49.110> actually<00:03:49.530> train<00:03:50.280> your

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
training exercise actually train your

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.580 
training exercise actually train your
explosion<00:03:51.239> and<00:03:51.450> not<00:03:52.050> you're<00:03:52.230> jumping

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
explosion and not you're jumping

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.650 
explosion and not you're jumping
endurance<00:03:53.040> I<00:03:53.280> really<00:03:53.880> hope<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.150> understand

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
endurance I really hope you understand

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.140 
endurance I really hope you understand
that<00:03:54.840> because<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:56.100> spent<00:03:56.519> years<00:03:56.880> getting

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
that because I spent years getting

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.509 
that because I spent years getting
mediocre<00:03:57.870> results<00:03:58.019> and<00:03:58.560> if<00:03:59.190> I<00:03:59.310> would<00:03:59.459> have

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
mediocre results and if I would have

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.940 
mediocre results and if I would have
been<00:03:59.670> doing<00:03:59.910> these<00:04:00.060> same<00:04:00.360> drills<00:04:00.750> for<00:04:01.380> years<00:04:01.709> I

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
been doing these same drills for years I

don't<00:04:02.910> know<00:04:02.970> what<00:04:03.150> level<00:04:03.450> idea<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:04.110> now<00:04:04.950> i'm

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
don't know what level idea and now i'm

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.190 
don't know what level idea and now i'm

all about helping people who want to
jump<00:04:28.840> higher<00:04:29.080> I<00:04:29.259> want<00:04:29.440> to<00:04:29.500> understand<00:04:30.190> how<00:04:30.340> to

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
jump higher I want to understand how to

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.280 
jump higher I want to understand how to
do<00:04:30.610> it<00:04:30.759> don't<00:04:31.389> want<00:04:31.540> to<00:04:31.600> just<00:04:31.810> throw<00:04:31.960> some

do it don't want to just throw some
money<00:04:32.470> at<00:04:32.590> some<00:04:32.949> program<00:04:33.430> that<00:04:33.729> is<00:04:34.449> claiming

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
money at some program that is claiming

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.779 
money at some program that is claiming
you<00:04:35.680> know<00:04:35.800> to<00:04:35.860> be<00:04:36.070> able<00:04:36.160> to<00:04:36.310> help<00:04:36.430> you<00:04:36.550> jump

higher than you've ever believed
possible<00:04:38.050> you<00:04:38.380> will<00:04:38.470> understand<00:04:38.949> how<00:04:39.100> you<00:04:39.160> can

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
possible you will understand how you can

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.320 
possible you will understand how you can
do<00:04:39.520> it<00:04:39.610> so<00:04:39.729> you<00:04:39.789> can<00:04:39.970> make<00:04:40.090> an<00:04:40.150> educated

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
do it so you can make an educated

do it so you can make an educated
decision<00:04:40.780> and<00:04:41.320> so<00:04:41.919> the<00:04:42.039> program<00:04:42.370> is<00:04:42.580> free<00:04:42.759> for

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
decision and so the program is free for

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.090 
decision and so the program is free for
now<00:04:43.210> I<00:04:43.479> encourage<00:04:43.870> you<00:04:43.930> to<00:04:44.020> use<00:04:44.110> it<00:04:44.470> you<00:04:44.979> know

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
now I encourage you to use it you know

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
little bit more about the program now so

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.620 
little bit more about the program now so
I<00:04:51.160> hope<00:04:51.250> you<00:04:51.370> remember<00:04:51.669> strength<00:04:52.330> and

I hope you remember strength and

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.840 
I hope you remember strength and
quickness<00:04:53.320> that's<00:04:54.130> what's<00:04:54.490> going<00:04:54.610> to<00:04:54.699> make

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
quickness that's what's going to make

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.290 
quickness that's what's going to make
you<00:04:55.030> explode<00:04:55.410> again<00:04:56.410> if<00:04:56.680> you<00:04:57.370> were<00:04:57.550> let's<00:04:58.120> say

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
you explode again if you were let's say

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.300 
you explode again if you were let's say
you<00:04:58.360> were<00:04:58.600> a<00:04:58.630> sprinter<00:04:59.229> and<00:04:59.380> you<00:04:59.650> ran<00:04:59.830> 100

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
you were a sprinter and you ran 100

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.629 
you were a sprinter and you ran 100
meter<00:05:00.639> dash<00:05:00.729> would<00:05:01.690> you<00:05:01.840> train<00:05:02.229> sprinting<00:05:03.010> by

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
meter dash would you train sprinting by

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.750 
meter dash would you train sprinting by
running<00:05:04.030> the<00:05:04.600> mile<00:05:04.870> or<00:05:05.199> by<00:05:05.560> running<00:05:05.949> two<00:05:06.460> miles

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
running the mile or by running two miles

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.460 
running the mile or by running two miles
no<00:05:07.449> because<00:05:07.750> that<00:05:07.840> would<00:05:08.020> train<00:05:08.320> your

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
no because that would train your

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.159 
no because that would train your
endurance<00:05:08.889> it's<00:05:09.520> a<00:05:09.729> completely<00:05:10.600> different

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
endurance it's a completely different

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.010 
endurance it's a completely different
type<00:05:11.620> of<00:05:11.680> muscle<00:05:12.190> and<00:05:12.550> that's<00:05:13.120> not<00:05:13.419> the<00:05:13.479> muscle

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
type of muscle and that's not the muscle

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.840 
type of muscle and that's not the muscle
you<00:05:14.080> want<00:05:14.229> to<00:05:14.289> be<00:05:14.380> training<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:14.949> as<00:05:15.460> long<00:05:15.669> as

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
you want to be training and as long as

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.150 
you want to be training and as long as
you<00:05:15.940> continue<00:05:16.150> to<00:05:16.990> train<00:05:17.380> your<00:05:17.680> jumping

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
you continue to train your jumping

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.850 
you continue to train your jumping
endurance<00:05:18.699> you<00:05:19.389> are<00:05:19.510> not<00:05:19.780> going<00:05:20.020> to<00:05:20.080> maximize

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
endurance you are not going to maximize

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.250 
endurance you are not going to maximize
your<00:05:21.130> jumping<00:05:21.610> potential<00:05:22.240> and<00:05:22.419> that's<00:05:23.080> what

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
your jumping potential and that's what

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.980 
your jumping potential and that's what
you<00:05:23.410> need<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.620> do<00:05:23.889> so<00:05:24.699> all<00:05:24.910> the<00:05:25.090> exercises<00:05:25.630> that

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
you need to do so all the exercises that

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.710 
you need to do so all the exercises that
we<00:05:26.169> recommend<00:05:26.770> or<00:05:26.979> what<00:05:27.250> we<00:05:27.430> call<00:05:27.720> explosion

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
we recommend or what we call explosion

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.290 
we recommend or what we call explosion
exercises<00:05:29.680> they're<00:05:30.250> all<00:05:30.430> exercises<00:05:31.000> that<00:05:31.240> are

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
exercises they're all exercises that are

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
exercises they're all exercises that are
going<00:05:31.449> to<00:05:31.510> teach<00:05:31.690> you<00:05:31.810> to<00:05:31.870> push<00:05:32.169> your

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
going to teach you to push your

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.589 
going to teach you to push your
potential<00:05:32.800> more<00:05:33.099> and<00:05:33.280> more<00:05:33.490> for<00:05:34.150> instance<00:05:34.479> if

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
potential more and more for instance if

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.180 
potential more and more for instance if
this<00:05:34.750> is<00:05:34.930> what<00:05:35.080> how<00:05:35.229> how<00:05:35.410> you<00:05:35.470> can<00:05:35.770> jump<00:05:35.949> now

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
this is what how how you can jump now

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.210 
this is what how how you can jump now
let's<00:05:36.580> say<00:05:36.789> it's<00:05:36.970> 18<00:05:37.510> inches<00:05:37.840> and<00:05:38.110> if<00:05:38.979> your

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
let's say it's 18 inches and if your

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.710 
let's say it's 18 inches and if your
training<00:05:39.699> teaches<00:05:40.060> you<00:05:40.150> to<00:05:40.180> jump<00:05:40.419> a<00:05:40.539> little

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
training teaches you to jump a little

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.420 
training teaches you to jump a little
higher<00:05:40.870> each<00:05:41.050> time<00:05:41.260> then<00:05:41.979> you're<00:05:42.099> going<00:05:42.190> to<00:05:42.250> be

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
higher each time then you're going to be

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.640 
higher each time then you're going to be
you're<00:05:43.210> going<00:05:43.270> to<00:05:43.419> be<00:05:43.510> increasing<00:05:44.050> that<00:05:44.199> level

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
you're going to be increasing that level

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.040 
you're going to be increasing that level
almost<00:05:45.220> each<00:05:45.789> workout<00:05:46.210> each<00:05:46.479> week<00:05:46.780> you're

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:47.050 
almost each workout each week you're

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.689 
almost each workout each week you're
going<00:05:47.169> to<00:05:47.260> see<00:05:47.470> slight<00:05:47.770> increases<00:05:48.190> and<00:05:48.580> that's

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:48.699 
going to see slight increases and that's

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:50.730 
going to see slight increases and that's
going<00:05:48.849> to<00:05:48.909> build<00:05:49.270> up<00:05:49.479> into<00:05:49.810> a<00:05:49.840> point<00:05:50.139> where

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
going to build up into a point where

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.500 
going to build up into a point where
you're<00:05:50.860> going<00:05:50.979> to<00:05:51.039> be<00:05:51.220> you<00:05:51.550> know<00:05:51.669> warmed<00:05:52.090> up<00:05:52.240> or

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
you're going to be you know warmed up or

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.939 
you're going to be you know warmed up or
you<00:05:52.690> know<00:05:52.780> you'll<00:05:52.960> just<00:05:53.169> have<00:05:53.380> played<00:05:53.620> a<00:05:53.650> game

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:53.949 
you know you'll just have played a game

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:56.219 
you know you'll just have played a game
and<00:05:54.220> you'll<00:05:54.849> realize<00:05:55.240> now<00:05:55.570> you<00:05:55.599> can<00:05:55.990> jump

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
and you'll realize now you can jump

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:57.960 
and you'll realize now you can jump
higher<00:05:56.500> than<00:05:56.740> you<00:05:56.889> ever<00:05:57.099> have<00:05:57.430> been<00:05:57.550> able<00:05:57.760> to

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
higher than you ever have been able to

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.740 
higher than you ever have been able to
before<00:05:59.520> so<00:06:00.520> once<00:06:00.789> again<00:06:00.909> if<00:06:01.150> u're<00:06:01.330> if<00:06:01.539> you<00:06:01.630> can

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
before so once again if u're if you can

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.830 
before so once again if u're if you can
jump<00:06:01.930> this<00:06:02.080> high<00:06:02.139> and<00:06:02.470> you<00:06:02.590> train<00:06:02.860> in<00:06:03.010> here

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
jump this high and you train in here

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.180 
jump this high and you train in here
it's<00:06:04.840> not<00:06:05.050> going<00:06:05.229> to<00:06:05.320> get<00:06:05.409> you<00:06:05.590> anywhere<00:06:05.830> it's

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
it's not going to get you anywhere it's

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.890 
it's not going to get you anywhere it's
going<00:06:06.250> to<00:06:06.430> get<00:06:06.550> you<00:06:06.760> endurance<00:06:07.449> which<00:06:07.690> is

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
going to get you endurance which is

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.960 
going to get you endurance which is
great<00:06:08.260> which<00:06:08.560> is<00:06:08.889> you<00:06:09.130> know<00:06:09.159> it's<00:06:09.520> a<00:06:09.789> good

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
great which is you know it's a good

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.189 
great which is you know it's a good
thing<00:06:10.180> but<00:06:10.419> it's<00:06:10.599> not<00:06:10.840> what<00:06:10.990> you're<00:06:11.139> looking

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 
thing but it's not what you're looking

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.290 
thing but it's not what you're looking
for<00:06:11.650> and<00:06:11.740> that's<00:06:11.860> not<00:06:12.130> why<00:06:12.280> you're<00:06:12.460> here<00:06:12.520> so<00:06:13.270> I

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.300 
for and that's not why you're here so I

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.969 
for and that's not why you're here so I
know<00:06:13.419> I've<00:06:13.599> been<00:06:13.630> real<00:06:13.960> redundant<00:06:14.470> about<00:06:14.740> this

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979 
know I've been real redundant about this

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:17.129 
know I've been real redundant about this
about<00:06:15.550> strength<00:06:16.090> plus<00:06:16.360> endurance<00:06:16.870> equals

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:17.139 
about strength plus endurance equals

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:19.230 
about strength plus endurance equals
explosion<00:06:17.770> about<00:06:18.159> not<00:06:18.550> training<00:06:19.090> your

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
explosion about not training your

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.290 
explosion about not training your
endurance<00:06:19.810> about<00:06:20.349> training<00:06:20.770> the<00:06:21.300> explosion

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
endurance about training the explosion

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.700 
endurance about training the explosion
that<00:06:22.449> your<00:06:22.599> muscles<00:06:22.960> have<00:06:23.110> that's<00:06:23.380> two

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
that your muscles have that's two

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.890 
that your muscles have that's two
different<00:06:23.860> types<00:06:24.250> of<00:06:24.490> muscles<00:06:24.909> and<00:06:25.090> so<00:06:25.780> the

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
different types of muscles and so the

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.740 
different types of muscles and so the
way<00:06:26.020> the<00:06:26.169> program<00:06:26.409> works<00:06:26.590> is<00:06:27.159> we<00:06:27.789> have<00:06:27.970> broken

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
way the program works is we have broken

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.409 
way the program works is we have broken
down<00:06:28.930> the<00:06:29.169> skill<00:06:29.919> levels<00:06:30.310> the<00:06:30.550> skill<00:06:30.970> sets<00:06:31.270> you

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
down the skill levels the skill sets you

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:33.930 
down the skill levels the skill sets you
need<00:06:31.630> to<00:06:31.780> jump<00:06:32.020> higher<00:06:32.260> into<00:06:32.710> ten<00:06:33.099> very

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:33.940 
need to jump higher into ten very

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.930 
need to jump higher into ten very
specific<00:06:34.599> categories<00:06:35.169> some<00:06:36.039> of<00:06:36.190> them<00:06:36.340> you<00:06:36.729> may

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
specific categories some of them you may

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:37.879 
specific categories some of them you may
have

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:37.889 
have

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:39.739 
have
already<00:06:38.310> for<00:06:38.520> instance<00:06:38.789> body<00:06:38.999> composition<00:06:39.419> is

00:06:39.739 --> 00:06:39.749 
already for instance body composition is

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:41.510 
already for instance body composition is
one<00:06:39.900> of<00:06:40.020> them<00:06:40.139> if<00:06:40.349> you're<00:06:40.860> overweight<00:06:41.129> that

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
one of them if you're overweight that

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.219 
one of them if you're overweight that
extra<00:06:42.150> weight<00:06:42.270> is<00:06:42.419> only<00:06:42.569> going<00:06:42.780> to<00:06:42.840> drag<00:06:43.080> you

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:43.229 
extra weight is only going to drag you

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:44.779 
extra weight is only going to drag you
down<00:06:43.439> so<00:06:43.710> that's<00:06:43.889> one<00:06:44.249> of<00:06:44.280> the<00:06:44.460> categories

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:44.789 
down so that's one of the categories

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:46.969 
down so that's one of the categories
there<00:06:45.449> are<00:06:45.539> 10<00:06:45.780> different<00:06:45.930> categories<00:06:46.740> that

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
there are 10 different categories that

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:48.709 
there are 10 different categories that
are<00:06:47.400> going<00:06:47.550> to<00:06:47.610> help<00:06:47.819> you<00:06:47.909> jump<00:06:48.150> higher<00:06:48.360> and<00:06:48.539> if

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:48.719 
are going to help you jump higher and if

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:51.110 
are going to help you jump higher and if
you're<00:06:48.840> able<00:06:48.960> to<00:06:49.169> maximize<00:06:49.409> each<00:06:50.069> one<00:06:50.430> you'll

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
you're able to maximize each one you'll

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.580 
you're able to maximize each one you'll
be<00:06:51.210> able<00:06:51.330> to<00:06:51.449> reach<00:06:51.659> what<00:06:51.900> we<00:06:52.050> call<00:06:52.289> your

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
be able to reach what we call your

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.879 
be able to reach what we call your
physical<00:06:53.370> explosion<00:06:54.240> capability<00:06:54.900> your<00:06:55.620> legs

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:55.889 
physical explosion capability your legs

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:57.739 
physical explosion capability your legs
can<00:06:56.159> only<00:06:56.249> create<00:06:56.639> some<00:06:56.909> look<00:06:57.090> so<00:06:57.599> much

00:06:57.739 --> 00:06:57.749 
can only create some look so much

00:06:57.749 --> 00:06:59.600 
can only create some look so much
explosion<00:06:58.409> so<00:06:58.620> there<00:06:58.770> is<00:06:58.889> a<00:06:58.919> limit<00:06:59.460> to<00:06:59.580> how

00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.610 
explosion so there is a limit to how

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.610 
explosion so there is a limit to how
high<00:06:59.879> you<00:06:59.939> can<00:07:00.240> jump<00:07:00.270> but<00:07:01.020> I'll<00:07:01.110> guarantee<00:07:01.319> you

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 
high you can jump but I'll guarantee you
