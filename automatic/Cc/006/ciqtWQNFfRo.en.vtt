00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:18.170 

first<00:03:04.930> we<00:03:05.170> will<00:03:05.290> do<00:03:05.500> BMO

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.330 

so<00:03:18.870> freeze<00:03:19.260> once<00:03:19.590> you<00:03:19.739> get<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:19.980> image<00:03:20.189> you

so freeze once you get the image you

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.800 
so freeze once you get the image you
want<00:03:20.569> you<00:03:21.569> can<00:03:21.720> do<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.900> quick<00:03:22.200> save<00:03:23.569> the<00:03:24.569> quick
