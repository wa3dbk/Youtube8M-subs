00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
best crossbow run in my history of

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.979 
best crossbow run in my history of
playing<00:00:46.530> Battlefield<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.520> was<00:00:48.329> nailing<00:00:48.600> shots

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
playing Battlefield I was nailing shots

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.810 
playing Battlefield I was nailing shots
left<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.440> right<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.770> was<00:00:50.010> being<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.370> sneaky

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
left and right I was being a sneaky

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.660 
left and right I was being a sneaky
little<00:00:50.940> assassin<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.920> too<00:00:52.920> much<00:00:53.160> fun<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.550> be

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
little assassin and too much fun to be

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.479 
little assassin and too much fun to be
had<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.750> reason<00:00:55.140> why<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.649> was<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.399> little

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
had so the reason why I was a little

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.459 
had so the reason why I was a little
surprised<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.510> they<00:00:57.840> thought<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.170> this

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
surprised that they thought that this

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.990 
surprised that they thought that this
weapon<00:00:58.770> was<00:00:58.890> terrible<00:00:59.309> was<00:00:59.460> because<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.940> think

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
weapon was terrible was because I think

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.630 
weapon was terrible was because I think
it<00:01:00.390> suits<00:01:00.629> some<00:01:01.050> setups<00:01:01.530> really<00:01:02.399> well

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
it suits some setups really well

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.600 
it suits some setups really well
especially<00:01:02.940> as<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.350> Recon<00:01:04.769> class<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
especially as the Recon class the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.280 
especially as the Recon class the
bolt-action<00:01:06.150> rifle<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.510> not<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.140> game

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
bolt-action rifle is not in this game

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.260 
bolt-action rifle is not in this game
are<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.770> lot<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.310> fun<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.700> use<00:01:08.850> they're<00:01:09.060> very

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
are a lot of fun to use they're very

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.880 
are a lot of fun to use they're very
challenging<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:10.080> one<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.260> their<00:01:10.439> weaknesses

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
challenging but one of their weaknesses

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.590 
challenging but one of their weaknesses
of<00:01:10.920> course<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.700> they<00:01:11.880> don't<00:01:12.119> do<00:01:12.570> very

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
of course is that they don't do very

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.359 
of course is that they don't do very
well<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.409> close<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.860> when<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.040> get<00:01:14.100> into<00:01:14.340> a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
well up close and when you get into a

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.370 
well up close and when you get into a
tight<00:01:14.670> spot<00:01:15.000> or<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.600> get<00:01:15.750> into<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> close

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
tight spot or you get into a close

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.760 
tight spot or you get into a close
encounter<00:01:17.299> situation<00:01:18.500> using<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
encounter situation using the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.039 
encounter situation using the
bolt-action<00:01:20.340> rifle<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.090> kind<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.780> your

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
bolt-action rifle is kind of your

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.960 
bolt-action rifle is kind of your
end-all<00:01:22.470> be-all<00:01:22.500> if<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.340> miss<00:01:23.610> you're

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
end-all be-all if you miss you're

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.429 
end-all be-all if you miss you're
probably<00:01:24.210> dead<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.869> can<00:01:24.990> switch<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.259> your

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
probably dead you can switch to your

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.020 
probably dead you can switch to your
pistol<00:01:25.860> but<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.340> not<00:01:26.460> very<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:26.759> not<00:01:26.880> as

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
pistol but it's not very it's not as

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.450 
pistol but it's not very it's not as
reliable<00:01:27.509> as<00:01:27.659> using<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.140> primary<00:01:28.560> weapon<00:01:28.740> but

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
reliable as using a primary weapon but

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.780 
reliable as using a primary weapon but
for<00:01:29.880> me<00:01:30.030> when<00:01:30.270> I'm<00:01:30.450> using<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.530> crossbow<00:01:32.460> it

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
for me when I'm using the crossbow it

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.270 
for me when I'm using the crossbow it
eliminates<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.780> weakness<00:01:34.320> altogether

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
eliminates that weakness altogether

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.429 
eliminates that weakness altogether
I<00:01:35.579> will<00:01:35.970> notice<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.450> if<00:01:36.570> someone<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.110> getting

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
I will notice that if someone is getting

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.980 
I will notice that if someone is getting
into<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.369> know<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.670> close<00:01:38.970> range<00:01:39.240> instead

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
into you know that close range instead

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.539 
into you know that close range instead
of<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.290> trying<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.680> snipe<00:01:40.920> them<00:01:41.130> or<00:01:41.280> maybe

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
of just trying to snipe them or maybe

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.980 
of just trying to snipe them or maybe
all<00:01:41.820> take<00:01:42.030> one<00:01:42.060> shot<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.689> then<00:01:42.780> go<00:01:42.869> behind

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
all take one shot and then go behind

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.899 
all take one shot and then go behind
cover<00:01:43.409> but<00:01:43.860> then<00:01:44.009> I'll<00:01:44.130> immediately<00:01:44.610> switch

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
cover but then I'll immediately switch

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.749 
cover but then I'll immediately switch
on<00:01:45.119> over<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.869> crossbow<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.710> when<00:01:47.640> they

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
on over to the crossbow and when they

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.249 
on over to the crossbow and when they
round<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.090> corner<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:48.420> take<00:01:48.750> them<00:01:48.899> out<00:01:49.020> in

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
round the corner just take them out in

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.429 
round the corner just take them out in
one<00:01:49.649> one<00:01:50.310> swoop<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.820> that's<00:01:51.540> that's<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
one one swoop and that's that's that and

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.080 
one one swoop and that's that's that and
it's<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.130> much<00:01:53.310> more<00:01:53.490> effective<00:01:54.000> than

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
it's so much more effective than

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.520 
it's so much more effective than
switching<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.540> over<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.869> your<00:01:54.990> pistol<00:01:55.290> at

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
switching on over to your pistol at

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.440 
switching on over to your pistol at
least<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.860> my<00:01:56.009> opinion<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.939> know<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.240> some

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
least in my opinion and I know that some

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.289 
least in my opinion and I know that some
people<00:01:57.479> do<00:01:58.020> not<00:01:58.229> like<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.649> fact<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.280> it<00:02:00.090> has

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
people do not like the fact that it has

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.780 
people do not like the fact that it has
such<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.899> slow<00:02:01.200> velocity<00:02:01.710> behind<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.340> it

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
such a slow velocity behind it and it

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.999 
such a slow velocity behind it and it
really<00:02:03.000> requires<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.869> line<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.590> your<00:02:04.740> shot

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
really requires you to line up your shot

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.980 
really requires you to line up your shot
and<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.460> lead<00:02:05.670> your<00:02:05.820> target<00:02:06.030> even<00:02:06.570> when

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
and to lead your target even when

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.859 
and to lead your target even when
they're<00:02:07.140> in<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.710> close<00:02:08.280> situation<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.239> but<00:02:09.720> for

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
they're in a close situation and but for

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.860 
they're in a close situation and but for
me<00:02:09.959> that's<00:02:10.170> what<00:02:10.289> makes<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:10.970> so<00:02:11.970> much<00:02:12.330> so

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
me that's what makes it so so much so

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.820 
me that's what makes it so so much so
much<00:02:13.020> fun<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.440> satis

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
much fun and satis

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.290 
much fun and satis
fine<00:02:14.010> because<00:02:14.250> you'll<00:02:14.490> go<00:02:14.640> on<00:02:14.820> these<00:02:14.970> streaks

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
fine because you'll go on these streaks

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
time and that can get you killed

time and that can get you killed
but<00:03:22.470> as<00:03:22.620> long<00:03:22.860> as<00:03:22.890> you're<00:03:23.160> not<00:03:23.190> using<00:03:23.580> it<00:03:23.700> like

I<00:03:24.060> am<00:03:24.090> into<00:03:24.780> today's<00:03:25.110> video<00:03:25.350> where<00:03:25.800> I'm<00:03:26.010> just

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
I am into today's video where I'm just

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.860 
I am into today's video where I'm just
kind<00:03:26.489> of<00:03:26.610> bouncing<00:03:27.000> in<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.150> out<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:27.540> taking

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
kind of bouncing in and out and taking

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.080 
kind of bouncing in and out and taking
people<00:03:28.200> out<00:03:28.380> after<00:03:29.310> every<00:03:29.580> time<00:03:29.760> I<00:03:29.940> go<00:03:30.060> through

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
people out after every time I go through

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.420 
people out after every time I go through
that<00:03:30.420> very<00:03:30.660> long<00:03:30.959> animation<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:32.070> really

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
that very long animation you really

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.590 
that very long animation you really
shouldn't<00:03:32.670> have<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.820> problem<00:03:32.910> because<00:03:33.420> you

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
shouldn't have a problem because you

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.320 
shouldn't have a problem because you
will<00:03:34.380> can<00:03:34.560> either<00:03:34.769> switch<00:03:35.100> on<00:03:35.280> over<00:03:35.550> to<00:03:35.790> your

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
will can either switch on over to your

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.630 
will can either switch on over to your
secondary<00:03:36.870> weapon<00:03:36.989> your<00:03:37.470> pistol<00:03:37.950> or<00:03:38.340> switch

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
secondary weapon your pistol or switch

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.280 
secondary weapon your pistol or switch
on<00:03:38.790> back<00:03:38.940> over<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.420> your<00:03:39.510> primary<00:03:40.019> so<00:03:40.170> there

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
on back over to your primary so there

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.750 
on back over to your primary so there
really<00:03:40.410> shouldn't<00:03:40.709> be<00:03:40.800> a<00:03:40.890> situation<00:03:41.160> where

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
really shouldn't be a situation where

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.170 
really shouldn't be a situation where
you<00:03:42.720> die<00:03:42.959> because<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:44.100> crossbow<00:03:44.610> had<00:03:44.910> to

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
you die because the crossbow had to

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.390 
you die because the crossbow had to
reload<00:03:45.510> but<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.320> would<00:03:46.500> love<00:03:46.769> to<00:03:46.860> know<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.190> guys

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
and I have absolutely no idea what I'm

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.810 
and I have absolutely no idea what I'm
talking<00:03:51.840> about<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:52.410> never<00:03:52.800> use<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.400> crossbow
