absorbs in a given amount of time so on
SLR<00:00:38.910> camera<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.300> might<00:00:39.420> have<00:00:39.600> ISO<00:00:40.079> 100<00:00:40.590> which

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
SLR camera you might have ISO 100 which

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.220 
SLR camera you might have ISO 100 which
is<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.610> sensor<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.450> sensor<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:43.280> taking<00:00:44.280> is

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
is the sensor the sensor is taking is

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.630 
is the sensor the sensor is taking is
it's<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> least<00:00:46.559> sensitive<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.399> has<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it's the least sensitive but it has the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.459 
it's the least sensitive but it has the
best<00:00:47.850> quality<00:00:48.030> as<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.930> increase<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
best quality as you increase the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.560 
best quality as you increase the
sensitivity<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.250> sensor<00:00:50.399> it's<00:00:51.329> going<00:00:51.510> to

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
sensitivity of the sensor it's going to

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.930 
sensitivity of the sensor it's going to
increase<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.110> gain<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.640> number<00:00:53.850> of

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
increase the gain and the number of

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.290 
increase the gain and the number of
amount<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.390> digital<00:00:54.899> noise<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.530> picture

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
amount of digital noise in the picture

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.000 
amount of digital noise in the picture
so<00:00:57.300> once<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.539> set<00:00:57.719> your<00:00:57.780> ISO<00:00:57.989> then<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:58.980> a

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
so once you set your ISO then you have a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.139 
so once you set your ISO then you have a
bunch<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.280> things<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.550> play<00:00:59.699> with<00:00:59.730> you<00:01:00.030> can

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
bunch of things to play with you can

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.490 
bunch of things to play with you can
open<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.079> shutter<00:01:01.340> for<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.399> longer<00:01:02.730> time<00:01:03.500> call

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
open the shutter for a longer time call

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.520 
open the shutter for a longer time call
the<00:01:04.589> shutter<00:01:04.799> speed<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.339> for<00:01:06.299> video<00:01:06.570> usually

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the shutter speed and for video usually

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.500 
the shutter speed and for video usually
you<00:01:07.770> want<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.010> use<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.340> shutter<00:01:08.640> speed<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.210> is

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
you want to use a shutter speed that is

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.460 
you want to use a shutter speed that is
about<00:01:10.430> twice<00:01:11.430> your<00:01:12.030> frame<00:01:12.299> rate<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:13.140> if<00:01:13.350> I'm

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
about twice your frame rate so if I'm

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.859 
about twice your frame rate so if I'm
shooting<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:13.890> at<00:01:14.100> 30<00:01:14.369> P<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.880> wanted<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> set<00:01:15.780> my

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
shooting this at 30 P I wanted to set my

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.740 
shooting this at 30 P I wanted to set my
shutter<00:01:15.900> at<00:01:16.229> 1<00:01:16.350> over<00:01:16.590> 60<00:01:17.240> that<00:01:18.240> produces<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
shutter at 1 over 60 that produces the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.010 
shutter at 1 over 60 that produces the
smoothest<00:01:19.170> motion<00:01:19.590> at<00:01:20.159> least<00:01:20.310> amount<00:01:20.549> of

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
smoothest motion at least amount of

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.410 
smoothest motion at least amount of
strobing<00:01:22.020> effect<00:01:22.580> secondly<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:24.060> gotta<00:01:24.240> set

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
strobing effect secondly you gotta set

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.840 
strobing effect secondly you gotta set
your<00:01:24.450> aperture<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.500> aperture<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.400> how<00:01:26.549> wide

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
your aperture so aperture is how wide

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.600 
your aperture so aperture is how wide
the<00:01:27.060> lens<00:01:27.240> opens<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.829> smaller<00:01:29.490> number

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the lens opens and a smaller number

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.730 
the lens opens and a smaller number
means<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.270> bigger<00:01:30.450> opening<00:01:30.930> if<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.590> have<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
means a bigger opening if you have a

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.249 
means a bigger opening if you have a
bigger<00:01:31.920> opening<00:01:32.119> that<00:01:33.119> means<00:01:33.390> there's<00:01:34.049> more

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
bigger opening that means there's more

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.819 
bigger opening that means there's more
light<00:01:34.470> being<00:01:34.770> led<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.450> so<00:01:36.450> typically<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:37.710> you

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
light being led in so typically if you

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.480 
light being led in so typically if you
have<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.979> really<00:01:38.220> sunny<00:01:38.460> day<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:40.310> you<00:01:41.310> probably

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
have a really sunny day and you probably

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.789 
have a really sunny day and you probably
want<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.759> set<00:01:41.939> your<00:01:42.030> aperture<00:01:42.270> quite<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> big

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
want to set your aperture quite a big

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.249 
want to set your aperture quite a big
number<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.390> that<00:01:45.390> opportunity<00:01:46.140> will<00:01:46.229> be

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
number so that opportunity will be

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.800 
number so that opportunity will be
smaller<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.070> less<00:01:47.310> light<00:01:47.549> will<00:01:47.700> come<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:49.399> so

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
smaller and less light will come in so

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.389 
smaller and less light will come in so
another<00:01:51.810> useful<00:01:51.990> tool<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.890> this<00:01:53.220> thing

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
another useful tool is this this thing

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.410 
another useful tool is this this thing
this<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> great<00:01:54.840> card<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:56.030> this<00:01:57.030> side<00:01:57.240> is

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
this is a great card and this side is

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.780 
this is a great card and this side is
18%<00:01:58.140> gray<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:59.100> if<00:01:59.369> you've<00:01:59.490> planned<00:01:59.729> your

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
18% gray so if you've planned your

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.050 
18% gray so if you've planned your
camera<00:02:00.210> at<00:02:00.299> 80<00:02:00.600> percent<00:02:00.719> gray<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.380> then

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
camera at 80 percent gray and then

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.520 
camera at 80 percent gray and then
calibrate<00:02:03.060> your<00:02:03.149> camera<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.630> be<00:02:03.780> neutral

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
calibrate your camera to be neutral

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.980 
calibrate your camera to be neutral
exposure<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:06.240> camera<00:02:06.540> will<00:02:06.630> be<00:02:06.719> actually

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
exposure the camera will be actually

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.080 
exposure the camera will be actually
accurate<00:02:07.380> exposure<00:02:07.619> for<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.039> light<00:02:08.220> but

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
accurate exposure for that light but

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.170 
accurate exposure for that light but
what<00:02:09.179> if<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.420> have<00:02:09.629> both<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.319> sunny<00:02:10.879> Sun<00:02:11.879> in<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
what if you have both a sunny Sun in the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.160 
what if you have both a sunny Sun in the
scene<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.569> the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
scene and the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.490 
scene and the
or<00:02:13.860> shade<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.060> Sun<00:02:15.420> how<00:02:16.020> do<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.230> set<00:02:16.380> the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
or shade and Sun how do you set the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.050 
or shade and Sun how do you set the
exposure<00:02:16.710> then<00:02:17.010> well<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.670> main<00:02:17.790> thing<00:02:17.970> I

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
exposure then well the main thing I

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.600 
exposure then well the main thing I
learned<00:02:18.209> from<00:02:18.300> my<00:02:18.420> course<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:18.930> weekend<00:02:19.290> was

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
learned from my course this weekend was

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.330 
learned from my course this weekend was
you<00:02:20.610> have<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.880> take<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.270> exposure<00:02:22.160> using<00:02:23.160> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
you have to take the exposure using the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.110 
you have to take the exposure using the
gray<00:02:23.490> card<00:02:23.760> in<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.870> Sun<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.610> then<00:02:26.610> check<00:02:27.030> it

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
gray card in the Sun and then check it

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.180 
gray card in the Sun and then check it
in<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.300> shade<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.750> find<00:02:28.530> out<00:02:28.620> how<00:02:28.770> many<00:02:28.830> stops

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
in the shade and find out how many stops

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.160 
in the shade and find out how many stops
it<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.459> difference<00:02:29.880> between<00:02:30.240> those<00:02:30.390> two<00:02:30.450> how

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
it is difference between those two how

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.140 
it is difference between those two how
much<00:02:31.320> light<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.650> different<00:02:31.980> between<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.700> Sun

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
much light is different between the Sun

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.150 
much light is different between the Sun
and<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.330> shade<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.780> then<00:02:34.350> depending<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:34.890> what

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
and the shade and then depending on what

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.980 
and the shade and then depending on what
you<00:02:35.250> have<00:02:35.459> in<00:02:35.490> your<00:02:35.700> scene<00:02:35.940> if<00:02:36.660> you've<00:02:36.810> got<00:02:36.959> a

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
you have in your scene if you've got a

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.880 
you have in your scene if you've got a
mostly<00:02:37.590> Sun<00:02:37.890> or<00:02:38.070> some<00:02:38.310> cloud<00:02:38.520> or<00:02:38.940> some<00:02:39.330> shadow

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
mostly Sun or some cloud or some shadow

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.050 
mostly Sun or some cloud or some shadow
you<00:02:40.890> will<00:02:41.010> adjust<00:02:41.070> your<00:02:41.520> exposure<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.880> be

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
you will adjust your exposure to be

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.970 
you will adjust your exposure to be
somewhere<00:02:42.330> in<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.510> middle<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:42.980> so

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
somewhere in the middle of that so

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.460 
somewhere in the middle of that so
yesterday<00:02:44.270> we<00:02:45.270> wrote<00:02:45.420> we're<00:02:45.750> actually<00:02:46.110> on

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
yesterday we wrote we're actually on

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.440 
yesterday we wrote we're actually on
Sunday<00:02:46.950> we<00:02:47.100> were<00:02:47.190> out<00:02:47.280> on<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:47.880> street<00:02:48.239> very

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
Sunday we were out on the street very

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.560 
Sunday we were out on the street very
sunny<00:02:49.140> day<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.680> we<00:02:49.830> measured<00:02:50.130> that<00:02:50.370> using<00:02:51.180> ISO

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
sunny day and we measured that using ISO

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.190 
sunny day and we measured that using ISO
100<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:53.360> shutter<00:02:54.360> speed<00:02:54.630> of<00:02:54.660> 1<00:02:55.110> over<00:02:55.290> 60<00:02:55.650> the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
100 and shutter speed of 1 over 60 the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.390 
100 and shutter speed of 1 over 60 the
aperture<00:02:58.200> required<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.890> make<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.070> good

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
aperture required to make a good

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.390 
aperture required to make a good
exposure<00:02:59.670> from<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.180> Sun<00:03:00.360> was<00:03:01.080> f-22<00:03:02.040> which<00:03:02.250> is

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
exposure from the Sun was f-22 which is

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.850 
exposure from the Sun was f-22 which is
the<00:03:02.519> maximum<00:03:03.000> aperture<00:03:03.720> number<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.620> lens

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
the maximum aperture number of that lens

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.580 
the maximum aperture number of that lens
and<00:03:05.989> then<00:03:06.989> the<00:03:07.140> shade<00:03:07.350> was<00:03:07.739> more<00:03:07.950> like<00:03:08.130> f-16<00:03:08.940> or

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
and then the shade was more like f-16 or

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.560 
and then the shade was more like f-16 or
14<00:03:10.590> so<00:03:10.950> we<00:03:11.670> actually<00:03:11.850> need<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.180> set<00:03:12.450> an

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
14 so we actually need to set an

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.130 
14 so we actually need to set an
exposure<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.260> between<00:03:13.680> those<00:03:13.860> numbers<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:15.140> my

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
exposure in between those numbers and my

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.990 
exposure in between those numbers and my
problem<00:03:16.530> was<00:03:16.680> actually<00:03:17.040> said<00:03:17.220> in<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.400> bit<00:03:17.579> to

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
problem was actually said in a bit to

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.150 
problem was actually said in a bit to
aperture<00:03:18.750> number<00:03:18.780> was<00:03:19.049> a<00:03:19.110> bit<00:03:19.260> too<00:03:19.410> small<00:03:19.650> so

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
aperture number was a bit too small so

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.550 
aperture number was a bit too small so
the<00:03:20.459> scene<00:03:20.640> was<00:03:20.790> very<00:03:20.820> much<00:03:21.180> overexposed<00:03:21.870> but

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
the scene was very much overexposed but

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.400 
the scene was very much overexposed but
now<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:22.709> know<00:03:22.860> that<00:03:23.160> if<00:03:23.370> you're<00:03:23.579> in<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:23.760> Sun<00:03:24.410> you

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
now I know that if you're in the Sun you

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.350 
now I know that if you're in the Sun you
need<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.590> measure<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:25.950> aperture<00:03:26.790> as<00:03:26.910> well<00:03:27.090> and

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
need to measure the aperture as well and

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.250 
need to measure the aperture as well and
then<00:03:27.840> another<00:03:28.019> thing<00:03:28.260> is<00:03:28.320> that<00:03:30.260> really

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
then another thing is that really

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.840 
then another thing is that really
important<00:03:31.680> if<00:03:31.950> you're<00:03:32.160> outside<00:03:32.430> in<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.640> Sun

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
important if you're outside in the Sun

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.490 
important if you're outside in the Sun
if<00:03:33.090> your<00:03:33.209> camera<00:03:33.480> doesn't<00:03:33.660> have<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:33.959> neutral

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
if your camera doesn't have a neutral

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.039 
if your camera doesn't have a neutral
density<00:03:34.530> filter<00:03:35.390> you<00:03:36.390> might<00:03:36.600> have<00:03:36.840> some

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
density filter you might have some

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.479 
density filter you might have some
problems<00:03:37.410> so<00:03:37.650> it's<00:03:37.890> good<00:03:38.010> idea<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.340> get<00:03:38.430> a

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
problems so it's good idea to get a

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.009 
problems so it's good idea to get a
neutral<00:03:38.790> density<00:03:38.850> filter<00:03:39.390> if<00:03:39.840> you're

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
neutral density filter if you're

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.780 
neutral density filter if you're
shooting<00:03:40.170> in<00:03:40.350> sunlight<00:03:40.680> so<00:03:40.890> I<00:03:41.130> know<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.519> lot<00:03:41.730> of

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
shooting in sunlight so I know a lot of

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.280 
shooting in sunlight so I know a lot of
this<00:03:41.880> stuff<00:03:42.120> might<00:03:42.269> not<00:03:42.390> make<00:03:42.510> sense<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:43.019> only

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
this stuff might not make sense and only

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.509 
this stuff might not make sense and only
have<00:03:43.470> time<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:43.739> explain<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.040> all<00:03:44.220> in<00:03:44.280> this

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519

the exposure somewhere in between and of
course<00:04:06.000> learning<00:04:06.180> about<00:04:06.420> things<00:04:06.690> like

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
course learning about things like

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.740 
course learning about things like
aperture<00:04:07.410> shutter<00:04:07.440> speed<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:08.370> ISO<00:04:08.970> or<00:04:09.510> gain

aperture shutter speed and ISO or gain

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.720 
aperture shutter speed and ISO or gain
is<00:04:10.019> very<00:04:10.320> important<00:04:10.650> as<00:04:10.739> well<00:04:10.829> to<00:04:10.890> control<00:04:11.609> the

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
is very important as well to control the

is very important as well to control the
exposure<00:04:11.970> so<00:04:12.780> hopefully<00:04:13.200> that<00:04:13.500> give<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:13.739> some

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
exposure so hopefully that give you some

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.729 
exposure so hopefully that give you some
ideas<00:04:14.220> for<00:04:14.549> future<00:04:14.730> research<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.739> definitely

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
ideas for future research and definitely
