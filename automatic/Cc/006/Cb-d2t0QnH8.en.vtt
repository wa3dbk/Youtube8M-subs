delete<00:03:01.720> your<00:03:01.870> saved<00:03:02.110> but<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:02.560> doesn't<00:03:02.800> look

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
delete your saved but it doesn't look

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:03.840 
delete your saved but it doesn't look
like<00:03:03.070> they<00:03:03.190> did<00:03:03.250> that

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
like they did that

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.880 
like they did that
it<00:03:03.910> looks<00:03:04.240> like<00:03:04.450> my<00:03:04.840> saves<00:03:05.140> still<00:03:05.500> there<00:03:05.710> on

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
it looks like my saves still there on

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.780 
it looks like my saves still there on
the<00:03:05.920> ps3<00:03:06.480> but<00:03:07.560> once<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.680> transfer<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:09.280> I<00:03:09.430> don't

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
the ps3 but once you transfer it I don't

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.240 
the ps3 but once you transfer it I don't
think<00:03:09.970> you<00:03:10.060> can<00:03:10.230> we'll<00:03:11.230> see<00:03:11.410> here<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:11.800> want<00:03:12.220> to

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
think you can we'll see here I want to

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.980 
think you can we'll see here I want to
see<00:03:12.400> if<00:03:12.490> there's<00:03:12.640> an<00:03:12.760> r1<00:03:13.180> or<00:03:13.210> anything<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:13.810> don't

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
see if there's an r1 or anything I don't

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.630 
see if there's an r1 or anything I don't
think<00:03:14.050> you<00:03:14.260> can<00:03:14.440> transfer<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:15.160> back<00:03:15.190> to<00:03:15.520> the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
think you can transfer it back to the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.570 
think you can transfer it back to the
ps3<00:03:15.910> once<00:03:16.420> this<00:03:16.540> is<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.840> ps4<00:03:17.340> it's<00:03:18.340> not

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
ps3 once this is the ps4 it's not

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.340 
ps3 once this is the ps4 it's not
backwards<00:03:18.850> compatible<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.660> Xbox<00:03:20.020> one<00:03:20.230> and

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
backwards compatible the Xbox one and

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.220 
backwards compatible the Xbox one and
Xbox<00:03:20.410> 360<00:03:20.860> are<00:03:21.370> but<00:03:22.240> the<00:03:22.330> ps4<00:03:22.570> is<00:03:22.960> more

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
Xbox 360 are but the ps4 is more

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.220 
Xbox 360 are but the ps4 is more
powerful<00:03:23.560> in<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.040> worlds<00:03:24.370> are<00:03:24.460> bigger<00:03:24.840> so<00:03:25.840> you

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
powerful in the worlds are bigger so you

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.150 
powerful in the worlds are bigger so you
cannot<00:03:27.220> really<00:03:27.520> do<00:03:27.790> that<00:03:27.970> with<00:03:28.180> that<00:03:28.330> version

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
cannot really do that with that version

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.210 
cannot really do that with that version
this<00:03:30.160> kind<00:03:30.430> of<00:03:30.490> sucks<00:03:30.760> but<00:03:31.620> hey<00:03:32.620> that's<00:03:32.920> how<00:03:33.130> it

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
this kind of sucks but hey that's how it

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.810
