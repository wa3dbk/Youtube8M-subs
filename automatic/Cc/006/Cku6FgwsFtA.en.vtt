00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
of them and not figured well they're

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.639 
of them and not figured well they're
pretty<00:02:00.210> cheap<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.750> might<00:02:00.930> as<00:02:01.020> well<00:02:01.140> pick<00:02:01.290> one<00:02:01.350> up

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
pretty cheap I might as well pick one up

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:08.150 
pretty cheap I might as well pick one up
and<00:02:03.320> so<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.619> did<00:02:05.100> um<00:02:05.930> really<00:02:06.930> cheap<00:02:07.439> about<00:02:07.890> 10

bucks for this knife you can probably

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.340 
bucks for this knife you can probably
get<00:02:11.580> them<00:02:11.610> cheaper<00:02:12.030> probably<00:02:12.690> pay<00:02:12.870> more<00:02:12.900> for

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350
