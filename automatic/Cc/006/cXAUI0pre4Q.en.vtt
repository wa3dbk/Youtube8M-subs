can check out there all over the place
when<00:00:25.590> making<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:26.359> switching<00:00:27.359> station<00:00:27.900> be<00:00:28.019> sure

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
when making a switching station be sure

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.060 
when making a switching station be sure
to<00:00:28.410> give<00:00:28.560> yourself<00:00:28.650> plenty<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:30.150> space<00:00:31.070> because

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
to give yourself plenty of space because

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.520 
to give yourself plenty of space because
it<00:00:32.099> can<00:00:33.059> be<00:00:33.090> pretty<00:00:33.480> spacious<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.380> only

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
it can be pretty spacious this is only

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.380 
it can be pretty spacious this is only
three<00:00:35.040> set<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.760> goes<00:00:36.000> pretty<00:00:36.360> straight

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
three set up and it goes pretty straight

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.389 
three set up and it goes pretty straight
it<00:00:39.390> goes<00:00:39.600> straight<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.290> tracks<00:00:41.010> which<00:00:41.219> are

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
it goes straight to the tracks which are

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.900 
it goes straight to the tracks which are
over<00:00:41.850> here<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.480> there's<00:00:42.989> no<00:00:43.200> curving<00:00:43.770> or<00:00:44.700> any

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
over here so there's no curving or any

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.970 
over here so there's no curving or any
of<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.780> he<00:00:46.170> could<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.469> like<00:00:46.680> come<00:00:46.950> over

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
of that so he could you like come over

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.220 
of that so he could you like come over
go<00:00:47.700> over<00:00:47.969> we<00:00:48.329> can<00:00:48.450> see<00:00:48.660> how<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.960> could<00:00:49.079> be

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
go over we can see how it could be

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.400 
go over we can see how it could be
pretty<00:00:49.829> spacious<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:51.020> already<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.320> an

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
pretty spacious I already have an

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.389 
pretty spacious I already have an
example<00:00:52.739> here<00:00:53.690> that<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:55.020> functioning<00:00:55.920> when<00:00:56.280> we

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
example here that is functioning when we

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.130 
example here that is functioning when we
get<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> reset<00:00:57.059> real<00:00:57.270> quick<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:59.690> set<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.840> and

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
get the reset real quick and set it and

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.479 
get the reset real quick and set it and
it<00:01:01.410> turns<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:03.090> three<00:01:03.899> accenture<00:01:04.650> 3y

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
it turns on I have three accenture 3y

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.300 
it turns on I have three accenture 3y
essentially<00:01:06.479> first<00:01:07.229> wire<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.740> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.189> be

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
essentially first wire is going to be

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.250 
essentially first wire is going to be
the<00:01:08.460> set<00:01:08.700> wire<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.150> comes<00:01:09.960> from<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the set wire and that comes from the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.310 
the set wire and that comes from the
button<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.890> splits<00:01:11.250> down<00:01:11.580> here<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.240> couple<00:01:12.990> of

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
button and splits down here a couple of

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.800 
button and splits down here a couple of
the<00:01:13.560> layers<00:01:13.920> here<00:01:14.460> they're<00:01:14.790> essentially<00:01:15.479> just

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
the layers here they're essentially just

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.280 
the layers here they're essentially just
repeaters<00:01:16.650> two<00:01:17.070> repeaters<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.720> comes<00:01:19.049> to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
repeaters two repeaters and it comes to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.630 
repeaters two repeaters and it comes to
our<00:01:19.500> RS<00:01:20.040> nor<00:01:20.310> latch<00:01:20.369> 0<00:01:21.770> RS<00:01:22.770> nor<00:01:22.979> latch<00:01:23.040> then

our RS nor latch 0 RS nor latch then
trans<00:01:24.060> Don<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.720> comes<00:01:24.930> over<00:01:25.170> here<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:26.000> there

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
trans Don and comes over here and there

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.830 
trans Don and comes over here and there
is<00:01:27.360> our<00:01:28.700> reset<00:01:29.700> wire<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:31.040> reset<00:01:32.040> wire<00:01:32.840> go

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
is our reset wire I reset wire go

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.740 
is our reset wire I reset wire go
straight<00:01:34.409> instead<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.009> breaking<00:01:35.220> off<00:01:35.750> comes

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
straight instead of breaking off comes

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.899 
straight instead of breaking off comes
over<00:01:36.990> here<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.320> an<00:01:37.799> or<00:01:38.070> gate<00:01:38.100> which<00:01:38.670> is

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
over here to an or gate which is

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.850 
over here to an or gate which is
basically<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:41.040> or<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.310> and

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
basically if this this or this and

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.359 
basically if this this or this and
continue<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:45.810> do<00:01:45.960> more<00:01:46.140> than<00:01:46.290> three<00:01:47.040> you'd

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
continue on to do more than three you'd

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.090 
continue on to do more than three you'd
have<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.700> do<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:48.689> let's<00:01:48.869> say<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.170> had<00:01:49.320> six<00:01:49.710> you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
have to do like let's say we had six you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.740 
have to do like let's say we had six you
do<00:01:50.280> another<00:01:50.579> or<00:01:50.850> gate<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.360> those<00:01:51.509> would<00:01:51.659> all

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
do another or gate and those would all

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.429 
do another or gate and those would all
go<00:01:51.960> together<00:01:52.140> man<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:52.860> another<00:01:53.430> or<00:01:53.700> gate

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
go together man you have another or gate

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.730 
go together man you have another or gate
that<00:01:55.439> would<00:01:55.909> go<00:01:56.909> together<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.930> we'll<00:01:58.530> just

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
that would go together and we'll just

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.450 
that would go together and we'll just
turn<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.820> reset<00:02:00.750> wire<00:02:00.930> down<00:02:01.229> here<00:02:01.649> at<00:02:02.130> just

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
turn on the reset wire down here at just

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.139 
turn on the reset wire down here at just
the<00:02:02.729> three<00:02:03.119> work<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.930> comes<00:02:04.110> over<00:02:04.380> here

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
the three work so it comes over here

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.770 
the three work so it comes over here
oops

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
oops

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.919 
oops
and<00:02:07.229> comes<00:02:08.039> up<00:02:08.220> here<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.759> we<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.600> come

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
and comes up here and we have it come

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.490 
and comes up here and we have it come
here<00:02:10.380> to<00:02:11.000> this<00:02:12.000> end<00:02:12.360> gate<00:02:12.980> which<00:02:13.980> is<00:02:14.160> needed<00:02:14.580> to

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
here to this end gate which is needed to

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.470 
here to this end gate which is needed to
reset<00:02:16.500> our<00:02:16.709> RS<00:02:17.250> nor<00:02:17.490> search<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.060> reason<00:02:18.330> we

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
reset our RS nor search the reason we

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.130 
reset our RS nor search the reason we
need<00:02:18.569> this<00:02:18.750> end<00:02:19.050> gate<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.470> because<00:02:21.110> let<00:02:22.110> me

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
need this end gate is because let me

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.370 
need this end gate is because let me
show<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:23.810> let's<00:02:24.810> say<00:02:25.020> it's<00:02:25.170> not<00:02:25.470> active<00:02:27.380> let's

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
show you let's say it's not active let's

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.729 
show you let's say it's not active let's
reset<00:02:28.770> you<00:02:28.950> can<00:02:29.100> see<00:02:29.280> how<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.489> returns<00:02:30.090> an<00:02:30.930> on

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
reset you can see how it returns an on

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.610 
reset you can see how it returns an on
state<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:33.180> let's<00:02:33.930> say<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.290> just

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
state so let's say this is just

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.559 
state so let's say this is just
connected<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.100> our<00:02:35.400> reset<00:02:35.850> why<00:02:36.000> we<00:02:36.209> could<00:02:36.360> see

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
connected to our reset why we could see

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.750 
connected to our reset why we could see
like<00:02:36.780> I<00:02:37.050> came<00:02:37.620> over<00:02:37.650> here<00:02:37.860> something<00:02:38.489> that<00:02:38.670> was

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
like I came over here something that was

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:46.040 
like I came over here something that was
on<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.330> would<00:02:39.680> try<00:02:40.680> resetting<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:42.140> other<00:02:45.050> the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
on it would try resetting the other the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.500 
on it would try resetting the other the
other<00:02:46.080> gates<00:02:46.920> so<00:02:47.370> what<00:02:47.550> I<00:02:47.580> do<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:48.090> check<00:02:48.330> to

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
other gates so what I do is I check to

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.000 
other gates so what I do is I check to
see<00:02:48.690> if<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.800> on<00:02:50.040> first<00:02:50.670> off<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.650> then<00:02:52.650> it

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
see if it is on first off and then it

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.820 
see if it is on first off and then it
goes<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.640> our<00:02:53.850> end<00:02:54.120> gate<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.690> turns<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.709> off

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
goes to our end gate and turns it off

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.650 
goes to our end gate and turns it off
and<00:02:56.400> there's<00:02:57.120> our<00:02:58.670> our<00:02:59.670> return<00:03:00.060> wires<00:03:00.330> what<00:03:00.630> I

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
and there's our our return wires what I

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.360 
and there's our our return wires what I
call<00:03:00.959> it<00:03:01.190> it<00:03:02.190> comes<00:03:02.489> up<00:03:02.670> here<00:03:03.030> on<00:03:03.950> which<00:03:04.950> is<00:03:05.130> off

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
call it it comes up here on which is off

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.430 
call it it comes up here on which is off
right<00:03:05.580> now<00:03:05.790> comes<00:03:06.750> over<00:03:06.989> here<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.550> lights

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
right now comes over here and lights

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.789 
right now comes over here and lights
they'e<00:03:10.440> torch<00:03:10.769> for<00:03:11.070> us<00:03:12.140> let's<00:03:13.140> go<00:03:13.290> ahead<00:03:13.530> and

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
they'e torch for us let's go ahead and

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.800 
they'e torch for us let's go ahead and
start<00:03:14.280> building<00:03:14.489> 1<00:03:14.880> i've<00:03:15.150> already<00:03:15.420> kind<00:03:15.750> of

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
start building 1 i've already kind of

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.350 
start building 1 i've already kind of
started<00:03:15.870> over<00:03:16.680> here<00:03:17.010> with<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:18.380> most<00:03:19.380> fun<00:03:19.920> jazz

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
started over here with the most fun jazz

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.380 
started over here with the most fun jazz
let's<00:03:21.360> build<00:03:21.989> our<00:03:22.140> RS<00:03:22.799> nor<00:03:23.070> latch<00:03:23.130> now<00:03:23.640> i'm

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
let's build our RS nor latch now i'm

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.380 
let's build our RS nor latch now i'm
doing<00:03:24.890> essentially<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.190> same<00:03:26.459> thing<00:03:26.519> that

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
doing essentially the same thing that

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:34.220 
doing essentially the same thing that
was<00:03:27.600> done<00:03:27.860> over<00:03:28.860> here<00:03:30.410> so<00:03:32.420> assuming<00:03:33.420> like<00:03:34.019> that

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
was done over here so assuming like that

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.620 
was done over here so assuming like that
said<00:03:34.470> earlier<00:03:34.890> that<00:03:34.980> you<00:03:35.220> know<00:03:35.519> a<00:03:35.790> little<00:03:36.150> bit

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
said earlier that you know a little bit

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:48.170 
said earlier that you know a little bit
about<00:03:39.620> all<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:40.680> this<00:03:45.829> here<00:03:46.829> is<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.579> RS<00:03:47.970> nor

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
about all of this here is the RS nor

00:03:48.180 --> 00:04:05.010 
about all of this here is the RS nor
latch<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.959> i<00:03:49.230> like<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.950> use

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.449 

look<00:04:06.020> there<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:08.050> our<00:04:09.050> reset<00:04:09.890> switch<00:04:10.160> will

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
look there and our reset switch will

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.670 
look there and our reset switch will
come<00:04:10.700> from<00:04:11.000> here<00:04:12.940> as<00:04:13.940> you<00:04:14.030> can<00:04:14.150> see<00:04:14.239> are<00:04:14.680> pretty

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
come from here as you can see are pretty

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.930 
come from here as you can see are pretty
much<00:04:15.770> identical<00:04:15.950> to<00:04:16.579> this<00:04:16.730> one<00:04:17.530> all<00:04:18.530> it<00:04:18.709> is<00:04:19.389> so

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
much identical to this one all it is so

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.390 
much identical to this one all it is so
after<00:04:22.940> that<00:04:23.389> let's<00:04:23.750> have<00:04:24.410> it<00:04:24.620> come<00:04:24.919> straight

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
after that let's have it come straight

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.180 
after that let's have it come straight
over<00:04:25.430> here<00:04:26.090> to<00:04:26.750> activate<00:04:27.350> or<00:04:27.830> deactivate<00:04:30.190> for

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
over here to activate or deactivate for

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.830 
over here to activate or deactivate for
some<00:04:31.400> reason<00:04:31.790> it<00:04:34.300> is<00:04:35.300> already<00:04:35.870> turned<00:04:36.320> on<00:04:37.840> like

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
some reason it is already turned on like

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.680 
some reason it is already turned on like
that's<00:04:39.110> something<00:04:40.030> of<00:04:41.030> course<00:04:41.300> that's<00:04:41.450> not

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
that's something of course that's not

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.510 
that's something of course that's not
going<00:04:41.840> to<00:04:41.930> work<00:04:41.960> because<00:04:42.320> we'll<00:04:43.220> have<00:04:43.250> a

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
going to work because we'll have a

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.740 
going to work because we'll have a

meet<00:04:55.010> art<00:04:55.310> and<00:04:55.610> getting<00:04:56.030> all<00:04:56.600> this<00:04:56.870> fun<00:04:57.139> stuff

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
meet art and getting all this fun stuff

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.760 
meet art and getting all this fun stuff
first<00:04:57.770> this<00:04:58.580> is<00:04:58.760> the<00:04:58.880> hardest<00:04:59.210> part<00:04:59.330> is

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
first this is the hardest part is

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:12.700 
first this is the hardest part is
finding<00:05:00.770> space<00:05:01.280> for<00:05:01.610> this<00:05:01.789> type<00:05:02.030> of<00:05:02.060> stuff<00:05:11.710> so

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
finding space for this type of stuff so

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.460 
finding space for this type of stuff so
where<00:05:13.039> should<00:05:13.220> I<00:05:13.310> put<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:14.080> n2<00:05:15.080> gate<00:05:17.470> right

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
where should I put the n2 gate right

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:43.110 
where should I put the n2 gate right
here

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:58.500 

let's<00:05:44.120> go<00:05:44.330> ahead<00:05:44.480> and<00:05:44.600> this<00:05:45.170> just<00:05:45.680> make<00:05:45.920> sure

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:05.159 

okay<00:05:59.320> perfect

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.489 

okay<00:06:06.169> this<00:06:06.319> cows<00:06:06.589> pissing<00:06:07.039> me<00:06:07.159> off<00:06:07.189> i<00:06:08.349> went<00:06:09.349> out

00:06:09.489 --> 00:06:09.499 
okay this cows pissing me off i went out

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:17.919 
okay this cows pissing me off i went out
someone<00:06:09.949> else<00:06:15.909> okay<00:06:16.909> so<00:06:16.969> we<00:06:17.269> have<00:06:17.299> our<00:06:17.449> reset

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:17.929 
someone else okay so we have our reset

00:06:17.929 --> 00:06:20.519 
someone else okay so we have our reset
wire<00:06:18.079> set<00:06:18.379> up<00:06:18.610> what<00:06:19.610> we<00:06:19.729> do<00:06:19.849> not<00:06:19.969> have<00:06:20.269> it

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:20.529 
wire set up what we do not have it

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:26.589 
wire set up what we do not have it
hooked<00:06:21.529> together<00:06:22.129> yet<00:06:24.789> need<00:06:25.789> to<00:06:25.969> have<00:06:26.419> the

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 
hooked together yet need to have the

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.090 

there<00:07:49.380> you<00:07:49.500> go<00:07:49.680> and<00:07:50.460> then<00:07:50.850> you<00:07:51.060> just<00:07:51.270> repeat

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:52.100 
there you go and then you just repeat

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.550 
there you go and then you just repeat
okay<00:07:53.100> so<00:07:53.160> I<00:07:53.460> my<00:07:54.030> head<00:07:54.270> and<00:07:54.600> repeated<00:07:55.410> myself

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 
okay so I my head and repeated myself

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.490 
okay so I my head and repeated myself
with<00:07:56.040> how<00:07:56.250> the<00:07:56.310> third<00:07:56.760> well<00:07:57.120> first<00:07:57.900> track<00:07:58.260> as<00:07:58.470> I

00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.500 
with how the third well first track as I

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.150 
with how the third well first track as I
have<00:07:58.740> it<00:07:58.950> displayed<00:07:59.520> it<00:07:59.730> all<00:07:59.880> works<00:08:00.210> correctly

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:01.160 
have it displayed it all works correctly

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:07.610 
have it displayed it all works correctly
and<00:08:02.160> that<00:08:03.050> concludes<00:08:04.050> my<00:08:04.760> tutorial<00:08:06.620> doesn't

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:07.620 
and that concludes my tutorial doesn't

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.660 
and that concludes my tutorial doesn't
work<00:08:07.830> though<00:08:08.150> just<00:08:09.150> because<00:08:09.750> of<00:08:10.140> my<00:08:10.800> set<00:08:11.220> sign

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:11.670 
work though just because of my set sign

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:16.330 
work though just because of my set sign
or<00:08:12.110> delays<00:08:13.110> down<00:08:13.410> here<00:08:13.620> I<00:08:13.650> need<00:08:13.860> more<00:08:14.160> of<00:08:14.280> them

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:16.340 
or delays down here I need more of them

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:19.340 
or delays down here I need more of them
yeah
