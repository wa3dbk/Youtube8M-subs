 [Music] 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.430
 at the beginning of this video of samples of 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.740
 this nice brand costume and sword 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.740
 and head and look like the trip 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.590
 to make the head let's draw a 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.660
 cube usually the cube has six 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.880
 but we're going to take it 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.360
 this face and each head of our cube 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.730
 will measure 28 x 28 cm I from 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.590
 my cell in this paper is called cardboard 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.020
 cable and they can get it in a 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.510
 big stationery in your paper can you 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.730
 identify because it is thick and one of 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.129
 their faces are white and the other is brown 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.820
 when you have drawn your cube, cut out your 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.250
 mold 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.590
 since I have cut the carton 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.300
 next step would be to assemble the box but 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.790
 what happens with this cardboard is that 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.559
 generally they have not rolled them and this 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.990
 will cause it to be remembered in this 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.909
 part when I put it together to avoid that I'm going 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.170
 to use these skewer sticks that 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.970
 you can get them in any 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.860
 supermarket and I'm going to stick them in this 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.140
 part of my box so that it looks straight 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.830
 for that you can use silicon not 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.830
 cold sylicon 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.300
 Now I'm going to put everything together 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.430
 [Music] 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.170
 when you have finished assembling your cube 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.120
 it's time to stick the steve's face 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.680
 here I already have the face printed I'm going to 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.570
 leave the templates on the page 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.520
 Polynesian plastic so that 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.260
 downloads and there are the instructions 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.570
 and I'll also leave the link in the 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.580
 description box on the page you are going to 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.620
 find the files one that is the one of 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.660
 the face and the other that is the hair 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.580
 I have here cut out all your 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.410
 impressions 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.150
 since you have to cut all the 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.280
 templates you are going to paste the to the box 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.290
 before hitting first face 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.880
 so that you do not make mistakes and now if 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.440
 you can start hitting it starts 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.630
 hitting the right side of your face 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.400
 completely to the shore and then come 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.360
 the left side is based talk it 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.880
 around the box in this way 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.970
 [Music] 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.970
 [Applause] 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.820
 [Music] 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.400
 [Applause] 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.670
 [Music] 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.190
 [Applause] 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.020
 when you have finished, trim the area 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.020
 blue eyes so you can see 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.409
 since you have finished cutting the 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:38.060
 eyes I'll give you a tip this is for 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.040
 when you put it on, do not move 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.230
 the box with its sponge rings for 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.269
 cars you're going to cut it with a knife 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.209
 saw the size that fits your head 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.889
 since you have cut your sponges 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.819
 to stick them in such a way that they remain 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.819
 above your ears 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.410
 and place to stay your sponges stuck 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.920
 and this serves so that the head is not 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.580
 move and ready so at the head of the 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.580
 church 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.109
 Now I'll teach you to do 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.209
 sword and the mold are left in the 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.609
 Polynesian practice page and they have 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.769
 have to print five sheets to do the 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.390
 sword I will use unicel and a 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.489
 material called screens is going to 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.260
 serve to reinforce it but if you do not 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.569
 find more to use later 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.909
 any other resistant material like 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.859
 cardboard or paper shell cut all 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.440
 pieces of your sword and stick them on your 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.480
 paperboard 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.150
 then with a cutter or scissors 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.710
 trim the outline of the sword and when 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.710
 end up with it, michelle 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.530
 to cut the unicel he used a 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.530
 hot knife or a cutter 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.540
 unicel 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.540
 and dry your sword when you're finished 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.660
 you can print the template twice 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.600
 so that it stays like this 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.580
 to finish use a green beach or 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.580
 blue like you for example 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.150
 tutorial 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.590
 your friends 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.680
