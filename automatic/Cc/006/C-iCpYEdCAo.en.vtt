lighthouse<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:04.890> saw<00:00:05.549> there's<00:00:05.759> some<00:00:05.850> interest

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
lighthouse I saw there's some interest

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.480 
lighthouse I saw there's some interest
on<00:00:06.480> tutorial<00:00:07.290> on<00:00:07.470> how<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.099> set<00:00:08.370> up<00:00:08.400> the

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
on tutorial on how to set up the

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.209 
on tutorial on how to set up the
Redstone<00:00:09.050> so<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:10.080> put<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:10.860> video<00:00:11.010> together

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
Redstone so I put this video together

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.759 
Redstone so I put this video together
with<00:00:11.759> three<00:00:12.389> different<00:00:12.509> sizes<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:13.019> rotating

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
with three different sizes of rotating

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.670 
with three different sizes of rotating
beacons<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:15.020> we're<00:00:16.020> going<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.170> start<00:00:16.410> with

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
beacons and we're going to start with

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.349 
beacons and we're going to start with
the<00:00:16.890> small<00:00:17.340> one<00:00:17.460> we're<00:00:17.670> going<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.850> go<00:00:18.000> right

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
the small one we're going to go right

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.230 
the small one we're going to go right
through<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:18.990> large<00:00:19.170> one<00:00:20.060> so<00:00:21.060> we'll<00:00:21.180> start

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
through to the large one so we'll start

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.320 
through to the large one so we'll start
with<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.570> small<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:21.930> here<00:00:22.189> and<00:00:23.189> as<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:23.970> see<00:00:24.210> it's

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
with a small in here and as you see it's

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.470 
with a small in here and as you see it's
just<00:00:24.539> for<00:00:25.230> sticky<00:00:25.680> pistons<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.220> set<00:00:27.210> up<00:00:27.300> like

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
just for sticky pistons and set up like

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.650 
just for sticky pistons and set up like
so<00:00:27.810> with<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> space<00:00:28.320> in<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.470> middle<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.660> first

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
so with a space in the middle and first

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.619 
so with a space in the middle and first
off<00:00:30.840> we'll<00:00:31.140> put<00:00:31.500> down<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:32.809> Peters<00:00:37.250> put<00:00:38.250> for

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
off we'll put down the Peters put for

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.709 
off we'll put down the Peters put for
right<00:00:39.629> there<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:39.989> inside<00:00:40.579> and<00:00:41.600> put<00:00:42.600> down

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
right there on the inside and put down

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.860 
right there on the inside and put down
the<00:00:42.840> ones<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.140> outside<00:00:43.170> like<00:00:43.590> so

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.760 

so<00:00:47.770> I<00:00:47.800> look<00:00:48.070> like<00:00:48.219> from<00:00:48.370> above<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.870> we'll<00:00:50.500> keep

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
so I look like from above and we'll keep

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.770 
so I look like from above and we'll keep
the<00:00:50.949> ones<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.219> middle<00:00:51.430> at<00:00:51.640> one<00:00:51.969> and<00:00:52.239> we'll<00:00:52.570> set

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
the ones the middle at one and we'll set

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:03.180 
the ones the middle at one and we'll set
the<00:00:52.989> repeaters<00:00:53.739> in<00:00:53.769> the<00:00:53.860> outside<00:00:54.129> at<00:00:54.250> four

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.500 

and<00:01:03.760> just<00:01:03.940> control<00:01:04.239> with<00:01:04.540> redstone

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.320 

and<00:01:09.010> start<00:01:10.010> it<00:01:10.130> all<00:01:10.580> i<00:01:10.640> have<00:01:10.760> to<00:01:10.790> do<00:01:10.940> is<00:01:11.120> put<00:01:11.300> a

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
and start it all i have to do is put a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.780 
and start it all i have to do is put a
torch<00:01:11.570> redstone<00:01:12.290> torch<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:13.250> outside<00:01:13.550> till

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
torch redstone torch the outside till

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.960 
torch redstone torch the outside till
they're<00:01:13.910> all<00:01:13.940> set<00:01:14.710> turn<00:01:15.710> it<00:01:15.800> off<00:01:15.860> and<00:01:16.160> we'll

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
they're all set turn it off and we'll

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.740 
they're all set turn it off and we'll
break<00:01:17.300> this<00:01:17.540> redstone<00:01:19.450> wire<00:01:20.450> right<00:01:20.690> here

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
break this redstone wire right here

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.560 
break this redstone wire right here
until<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:21.890> first<00:01:22.220> one<00:01:22.460> turns<00:01:23.000> off<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:23.450> we'll

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
until the first one turns off and we'll

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.710 
until the first one turns off and we'll
turn<00:01:23.750> it<00:01:23.840> right<00:01:24.020> back<00:01:24.050> on<00:01:25.390> so<00:01:26.390> you<00:01:26.480> can<00:01:26.600> see

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
turn it right back on so you can see

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.250 
turn it right back on so you can see
it's<00:01:26.870> just<00:01:27.050> a<00:01:27.520> simple<00:01:28.520> circuit<00:01:29.510> of<00:01:30.400> redstone

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
it's just a simple circuit of redstone

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.500 
it's just a simple circuit of redstone
Pistons<00:01:33.260> turning<00:01:33.560> on<00:01:33.680> and<00:01:33.800> off<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:35.360> add<00:01:35.480> a

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
Pistons turning on and off to add a

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.230 
Pistons turning on and off to add a
second<00:01:35.990> row<00:01:36.500> of<00:01:36.650> lights<00:01:36.860> to<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.880> small<00:01:38.120> one

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
second row of lights to the small one

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.840 
second row of lights to the small one
here<00:01:38.270> we're<00:01:39.230> just<00:01:39.290> going<00:01:39.470> to<00:01:39.500> build<00:01:40.250> the<00:01:40.490> exact

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
here we're just going to build the exact

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.530 
here we're just going to build the exact
same<00:01:41.000> setup<00:01:41.270> up<00:01:41.510> top<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.970> turn<00:01:43.970> it<00:01:44.090> on<00:01:44.180> and

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
same setup up top and turn it on and

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.040 
same setup up top and turn it on and
time<00:01:44.900> them<00:01:45.080> correctly<00:01:45.380> I'm<00:01:46.250> gonna<00:01:46.370> have<00:01:46.670> to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
time them correctly I'm gonna have to

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.340 
time them correctly I'm gonna have to
build<00:01:48.050> some<00:01:48.820> sort<00:01:49.820> of<00:01:50.000> staircase<00:01:50.960> for<00:01:51.229> the

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
build some sort of staircase for the

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.850 
build some sort of staircase for the
redstone<00:01:55.450> we<00:01:56.450> will<00:01:56.600> quite<00:01:57.200> connect<00:01:57.590> it<00:01:57.710> yet

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
redstone we will quite connect it yet

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.280 
redstone we will quite connect it yet
first<00:01:58.610> we're<00:01:58.820> gonna<00:01:58.880> turn<00:01:59.120> all<00:01:59.300> the<00:01:59.990> bottom

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
first we're gonna turn all the bottom

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.030 
first we're gonna turn all the bottom
row<00:02:00.410> on

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.840 

and<00:02:03.520> set<00:02:04.030> into<00:02:04.270> motion

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.760 

and<00:02:09.420> we'll<00:02:09.570> just<00:02:09.600> connect<00:02:09.990> here<00:02:12.590> as<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.740> see

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
and we'll just connect here as you see

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:21.620 
and we'll just connect here as you see
it<00:02:14.310> just<00:02:15.500> slowly<00:02:16.500> rotates<00:02:16.980> for<00:02:17.910> each<00:02:18.000> side

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.380 

here's<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.320> function<00:02:22.590> very<00:02:22.740> well<00:02:23.180> as<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.300> can

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
here's a function very well as you can

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.170 
here's a function very well as you can
see<00:02:24.480> here<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:24.900> cover<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.680> all<00:02:25.860> up<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.790> can<00:02:26.970> just

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
see here I cover it all up you can just

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.210 
see here I cover it all up you can just
get<00:02:27.840> rid<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.110> stairs<00:02:28.500> after<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:28.890> said<00:02:29.100> it

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
get rid of the stairs after you said it

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.240 
get rid of the stairs after you said it
because<00:02:29.580> it'll<00:02:29.850> just<00:02:30.030> keep<00:02:30.150> on<00:02:30.300> going<00:02:31.250> aligned

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
because it'll just keep on going aligned

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.370 
because it'll just keep on going aligned
with<00:02:32.370> each<00:02:32.400> other<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:33.810> can<00:02:33.960> cover<00:02:34.170> it<00:02:34.230> all<00:02:34.350> up

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
with each other you can cover it all up

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.980 
with each other you can cover it all up
easily<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:35.030> if<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.090> Sudanese<00:02:36.480> whatever<00:02:36.750> blocks

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
easily and if I Sudanese whatever blocks

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
easily and if I Sudanese whatever blocks
you<00:02:37.140> want<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:38.610> any<00:02:39.200> specific<00:02:40.200> shape<00:02:40.770> you<00:02:40.920> want

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.710 
you want to any specific shape you want
to<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:42.690> looks<00:02:42.810> pretty<00:02:42.900> cool<00:02:44.180> all<00:02:45.180> right<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:45.600> as

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
to it looks pretty cool all right and as

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.830 
to it looks pretty cool all right and as
for<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.080> medium-sized<00:02:47.010> one<00:02:47.480> this<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.630> the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
for the medium-sized one this is the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.890 
for the medium-sized one this is the
ground<00:02:49.380> layout<00:02:49.680> for<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.540> this<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.690> where<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
ground layout for it this is where the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:03:01.080 
ground layout for it this is where the
repeaters<00:02:52.230> go

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.199 

so<00:03:01.599> you<00:03:01.720> see<00:03:02.230> we<00:03:02.349> get<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:03.430> three<00:03:03.670> outside<00:03:04.000> we

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
so you see we get the three outside we

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.180 
so you see we get the three outside we
do<00:03:04.360> three<00:03:05.140> right<00:03:05.290> next<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.590> it<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:05.860> then<00:03:06.040> we

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
do three right next to it and then we

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.720 
do three right next to it and then we
put<00:03:06.430> one<00:03:06.959> for<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.110> one<00:03:08.650> on<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:08.980> diagonal<00:03:09.430> edge

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
put one for the one on the diagonal edge

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.690 
put one for the one on the diagonal edge
and<00:03:10.379> you<00:03:11.379> got<00:03:11.530> before<00:03:11.680> on<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.069> inside<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.550> go

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
and you got before on the inside that go

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.589 
and you got before on the inside that go
here<00:03:13.000> here<00:03:15.480> here<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:17.819> we<00:03:18.819> put<00:03:19.150> redstone

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
here here here and we put redstone

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:28.460 
here here here and we put redstone
everywhere<00:03:20.410> except<00:03:20.769> for<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:20.980> middle<00:03:21.190> block

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.700 

alright<00:03:29.250> and<00:03:29.630> settler<00:03:30.630> Peters<00:03:31.230> will<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.530> put

take it out

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.470 
take it out
break<00:04:05.380> that<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.800> as<00:04:06.190> that<00:04:06.430> repeater<00:04:07.090> goes

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
break that and as that repeater goes

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.060 
break that and as that repeater goes
white<00:04:07.750> are<00:04:07.990> off<00:04:08.320> put<00:04:09.280> it<00:04:09.370> back<00:04:09.460> in<00:04:10.350> and<00:04:11.350> there

white are off put it back in and there

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:13.970 
white are off put it back in and there
you<00:04:12.190> go<00:04:12.220> got<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:12.820> rotating<00:04:13.210> beacon<00:04:13.330> inlet

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
you go got the rotating beacon inlet

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.360 
you go got the rotating beacon inlet
unfortunately<00:04:14.980> you<00:04:15.100> can't<00:04:16.890> you<00:04:17.890> can't<00:04:18.160> get

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
unfortunately you can't you can't get

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.370 
unfortunately you can't you can't get
two<00:04:18.970> rows<00:04:19.180> of<00:04:19.209> lights<00:04:19.810> in<00:04:20.019> here<00:04:20.170> because

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
two rows of lights in here because

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.480 
two rows of lights in here because
there's<00:04:20.709> just<00:04:20.859> not<00:04:21.370> enough<00:04:21.430> room<00:04:23.070> but<00:04:24.070> it

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
there's just not enough room but it

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.630 
there's just not enough room but it
still<00:04:24.790> comes<00:04:25.030> out<00:04:25.240> pretty<00:04:25.360> good<00:04:26.310> as<00:04:27.310> you<00:04:27.520> can

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
still comes out pretty good as you can

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.710 
still comes out pretty good as you can
see<00:04:27.850> over<00:04:28.060> here<00:04:28.350> which<00:04:29.350> is<00:04:29.470> a<00:04:30.450> completely<00:04:31.450> fit

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
see over here which is a completely fit

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.740 
see over here which is a completely fit
and<00:04:31.900> finish<00:04:32.050> one

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.770 

at<00:04:39.710> night<00:04:39.950> you<00:04:40.070> would<00:04:40.190> notice<00:04:40.310> a<00:04:40.660> beam<00:04:41.660> of

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
at night you would notice a beam of

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.440 
at night you would notice a beam of
light<00:04:41.900> following<00:04:42.680> a<00:04:43.150> going<00:04:44.150> around<00:04:44.360> in

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
light following a going around in

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.000 
light following a going around in
circles<00:04:47.380> finally<00:04:48.380> I'll<00:04:48.500> show<00:04:48.710> you<00:04:48.770> how<00:04:48.830> to<00:04:48.920> do

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
circles finally I'll show you how to do

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.070 
circles finally I'll show you how to do
the<00:04:49.130> large<00:04:49.610> size<00:04:49.820> one<00:04:50.060> I<00:04:50.240> have<00:04:50.720> the<00:04:50.810> layout

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
the large size one I have the layout

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.980 
the large size one I have the layout
down<00:04:51.650> here<00:04:51.830> on<00:04:51.890> the<00:04:51.920> ground<00:04:51.980> already<00:04:52.990> since

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
down here on the ground already since

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:17.040 
down here on the ground already since
we're<00:04:54.140> the<00:04:54.170> repeaters<00:04:54.560> go

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.320 

so<00:05:18.050> that's<00:05:18.170> the<00:05:18.350> outside<00:05:19.250> repairs<00:05:20.030> and<00:05:20.270> now

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
so that's the outside repairs and now

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.070 
so that's the outside repairs and now
for<00:05:20.540> the<00:05:20.600> inside<00:05:20.720> once<00:05:22.630> just<00:05:23.630> put<00:05:23.840> it<00:05:23.930> on<00:05:24.020> the

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
for the inside once just put it on the

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.810 
for the inside once just put it on the
edge<00:05:26.320> just<00:05:27.320> one<00:05:27.470> space<00:05:27.710> back<00:05:28.340> from<00:05:28.580> each<00:05:28.670> of

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
edge just one space back from each of

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:36.520 
edge just one space back from each of
the<00:05:29.950> corners<00:05:30.950> of<00:05:30.980> the<00:05:31.370> sets<00:05:31.850> of<00:05:31.970> four<00:05:34.300> and<00:05:35.530> when

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
the corners of the sets of four and when

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:53.980 
the corners of the sets of four and when
you<00:05:36.590> just<00:05:36.740> fill<00:05:36.950> in<00:05:37.130> the<00:05:37.760> rest<00:05:37.910> with<00:05:38.240> redstone

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.820 

so<00:05:54.950> it<00:05:55.040> looks<00:05:55.100> like<00:05:55.240> but<00:05:56.240> then<00:05:56.570> we<00:05:57.440> got<00:05:57.470> to<00:05:57.650> set

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
so it looks like but then we got to set

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.010 
so it looks like but then we got to set
all<00:05:57.920> the<00:05:58.010> repeaters<00:05:58.390> so<00:05:59.390> we're<00:05:59.600> set<00:05:59.750> all<00:05:59.870> the

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
all the repeaters so we're set all the

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:10.360 
all the repeaters so we're set all the
inside<00:06:00.560> ones<00:06:00.800> 24

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.029 

and<00:06:11.370> just<00:06:11.789> like<00:06:11.879> the<00:06:12.030> other<00:06:12.150> ones<00:06:12.360> we'll<00:06:13.039> just

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
and just like the other ones we'll just

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:21.730 
and just like the other ones we'll just
to<00:06:14.689> make<00:06:15.689> a<00:06:15.720> each<00:06:16.020> set<00:06:16.289> of<00:06:16.319> 4<00:06:17.240> 1<00:06:18.240> through<00:06:18.389> 4<00:06:18.599> so

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:31.640 

do<00:06:22.740> that<00:06:27.110> for<00:06:28.110> all<00:06:29.930> as<00:06:30.930> we<00:06:31.080> look<00:06:31.199> seconds<00:06:31.500> all

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
do that for all as we look seconds all

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.339 
do that for all as we look seconds all
done<00:06:31.860> and<00:06:32.280> it<00:06:33.150> started<00:06:33.479> just<00:06:33.629> put<00:06:33.990> a<00:06:34.050> torch

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:34.349 
done and it started just put a torch

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:40.850 
done and it started just put a torch
right<00:06:34.710> here<00:06:34.889> let<00:06:35.669> it<00:06:35.789> all<00:06:36.349> light<00:06:37.349> up<00:06:38.750> and<00:06:39.860> break

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
right here let it all light up and break

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.209 
right here let it all light up and break
the<00:06:40.979> torch<00:06:42.199> break<00:06:43.199> this<00:06:43.319> redstone<00:06:43.680> and<00:06:43.830> right

back to get that cycle started and there

00:06:53.039 --> 00:07:01.100 
back to get that cycle started and there
you<00:06:53.129> go<00:06:54.770> and<00:06:56.030> to<00:06:57.030> add<00:06:57.180> a<00:06:57.210> second<00:06:57.690> layer<00:07:00.020> all<00:07:01.020> you

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.150 
right side right height so you can get

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.100 
right side right height so you can get
the<00:07:06.529> Pistons<00:07:07.699> pushing<00:07:08.699> the<00:07:08.879> blocks<00:07:09.810> of

do<00:07:24.130> the<00:07:24.310> similar<00:07:24.820> thing<00:07:25.060> like<00:07:25.270> we<00:07:25.420> did<00:07:25.570> with

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:25.810 
do the similar thing like we did with

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.870 
do the similar thing like we did with
the<00:07:26.050> real<00:07:26.620> small<00:07:26.860> one<00:07:27.040> just<00:07:27.990> build<00:07:28.990> the<00:07:29.880> stairs

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:44.210 
the real small one just build the stairs
but<00:07:31.090> we'll<00:07:32.400> start<00:07:33.400> the<00:07:33.490> bottom<00:07:33.610> one<00:07:33.850> first

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.220 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:51.240 

just<00:07:45.220> climb<00:07:45.490> it<00:07:45.640> up<00:07:47.700> it<00:07:48.700> should<00:07:48.910> be<00:07:48.970> all<00:07:49.060> set<00:07:50.250> so

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:51.250 
just climb it up it should be all set so

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.460 
just climb it up it should be all set so
it's<00:07:51.370> a<00:07:51.490> conclusion<00:07:51.940> might<00:07:52.180> retort<00:07:52.360> I<00:07:52.660> hope

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:53.470
