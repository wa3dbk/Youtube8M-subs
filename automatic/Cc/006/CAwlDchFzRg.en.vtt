of kids sleeping and sleeping bags in a

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.969 
park and those two have somehow become
disparate<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.780> our<00:01:48.930> imaginations<00:01:49.560> because<00:01:49.890> we

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
disparate in our imaginations because we

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.080 
disparate in our imaginations because we
have<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.310> sort<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:50.520> mainstream<00:01:50.939> political

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
have this sort of mainstream political

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.969 
have this sort of mainstream political
discourse<00:01:51.689> about<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.470> middle<00:01:52.710> class<00:01:52.950> and

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
discourse about the middle class and

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.130 
discourse about the middle class and
main<00:01:53.369> scripts<00:01:53.640> getting<00:01:53.909> screwed<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:54.990> have

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
main scripts getting screwed and we have

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.289 
main scripts getting screwed and we have
lost<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.770> think<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.130> some<00:01:56.310> ways<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.610> conception

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
lost I think in some ways the conception

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.359 
lost I think in some ways the conception
of<00:01:57.450> politics<00:01:58.229> outside<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.920> those<00:01:59.040> channels

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
of politics outside of those channels

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.249 
of politics outside of those channels
and<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.759> think<00:01:59.969> what<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.360> exciting<00:02:01.229> about

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
and I think what is exciting about

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.660 
and I think what is exciting about
Occupy<00:02:01.680> Wall<00:02:01.710> Street<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.219> think<00:02:02.369> what<00:02:02.520> has

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
Occupy Wall Street and I think what has

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.039 
Occupy Wall Street and I think what has
captured<00:02:02.880> people's<00:02:03.180> imagination<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.020> a

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
captured people's imagination is a

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.080 
captured people's imagination is a
feeling<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:05.040> normal<00:02:05.399> channels<00:02:05.640> don't

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
feeling that the normal channels don't

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.700 
feeling that the normal channels don't
feel<00:02:06.390> like<00:02:06.540> they're<00:02:06.689> working<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.320> think

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
feel like they're working that I think

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.650 
feel like they're working that I think
is<00:02:07.860> really<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.459> thing<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.479> most

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
is really the thing that is most

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.059 
is really the thing that is most
powerful<00:02:10.259> about<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.860> thing<00:02:10.890> that

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
powerful about it and the thing that

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.860 
powerful about it and the thing that
people<00:02:11.370> share<00:02:11.610> is<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.819> people<00:02:12.599> feel<00:02:12.750> like

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
people share is that people feel like

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.650 
people share is that people feel like
the<00:02:12.959> normal<00:02:13.200> channel

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
the normal channel

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.140 
the normal channel

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
actually in the opening is a really

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.910 
actually in the opening is a really
important<00:03:51.970> one<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.750> very<00:03:53.140> perverse<00:03:53.680> and

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
important one the very perverse and

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.710 
important one the very perverse and
vicious<00:03:54.190> cycle<00:03:54.520> of<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.790> disparate<00:03:55.239> sort<00:03:55.630> of

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
vicious cycle of the disparate sort of

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.940 
vicious cycle of the disparate sort of
recoveries<00:03:56.200> we<00:03:56.350> have<00:03:56.500> is<00:03:56.620> that<00:03:56.739> there's<00:03:56.890> even

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
recoveries we have is that there's even

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.350 
recoveries we have is that there's even
more<00:03:57.130> money<00:03:57.489> in<00:03:57.670> Wall<00:03:57.820> Street<00:03:57.850> now<00:03:58.150> and

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
more money in Wall Street now and

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.390 
more money in Wall Street now and
politicians<00:03:59.140> are<00:03:59.230> growing<00:03:59.530> more<00:03:59.920> dependent

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
politicians are growing more dependent

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.530 
politicians are growing more dependent
on<00:04:00.430> fundraising<00:04:00.700> from<00:04:01.000> Wall<00:04:01.180> Street<00:04:01.209> which<00:04:01.510> is

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
on fundraising from Wall Street which is

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.840 
on fundraising from Wall Street which is
really<00:04:01.840> really<00:04:02.230> perverse<00:04:02.800> so<00:04:03.310> I<00:04:03.340> think<00:04:03.730> that

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
really really perverse so I think that

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.490 
really really perverse so I think that
that<00:04:03.880> message<00:04:04.360> is<00:04:04.450> diluted<00:04:04.930> by<00:04:05.050> the<00:04:05.110> campaign

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
that message is diluted by the campaign

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.229 
that message is diluted by the campaign
finance<00:04:05.920> system<00:04:06.070> we<00:04:06.370> have<00:04:06.400> where<00:04:06.940> it<00:04:07.090> is

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
finance system we have where it is

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.180 
finance system we have where it is
harder<00:04:07.750> for<00:04:07.930> people<00:04:08.050> to<00:04:08.230> credibly<00:04:08.800> believe

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
harder for people to credibly believe

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.580 
harder for people to credibly believe
the<00:04:09.730> distinction<00:04:10.209> is<00:04:10.510> as<00:04:11.080> great<00:04:11.350> as<00:04:11.500> they

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
the distinction is as great as they

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.930 
the distinction is as great as they
would<00:04:11.709> want<00:04:11.830> it<00:04:12.010> to<00:04:12.100> be<00:04:12.250> and<00:04:12.489> then<00:04:12.820> it's

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
would want it to be and then it's

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.699 
would want it to be and then it's
partially<00:04:13.420> a<00:04:13.720> product<00:04:14.350> of<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.500> fact<00:04:14.680> that

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
partially a product of the fact that

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.650 
partially a product of the fact that
Republicans<00:04:14.860> are<00:04:15.280> able<00:04:15.640> to<00:04:15.790> obstruct<00:04:16.359> and

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
Republicans are able to obstruct and

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.420 
Republicans are able to obstruct and
subvert<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:17.530> destroy<00:04:17.890> a<00:04:17.919> lot<00:04:18.250> of<00:04:18.340> the

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
subvert and destroy a lot of the

impotence of direct action politics
which<00:04:34.820> i<00:04:34.940> think<00:04:35.000> is<00:04:35.180> just<00:04:35.389> a<00:04:35.510> class<00:04:35.750> to<00:04:36.020> sing<00:04:36.200> it

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
which i think is just a class to sing it

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.040 
which i think is just a class to sing it
which<00:04:36.770> is<00:04:36.889> just<00:04:37.070> that<00:04:37.639> about<00:04:37.940> that<00:04:38.090> as<00:04:38.840> a

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
which is just that about that as a

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.140 
which is just that about that as a
political<00:04:39.290> tactic<00:04:39.770> as<00:04:39.860> a<00:04:39.980> class<00:04:40.190> as<00:04:40.460> it

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
political tactic as a class as it

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.610 
political tactic as a class as it
doesn't<00:04:41.480> go<00:04:41.750> away<00:04:41.840> and<00:04:42.110> as<00:04:42.200> it<00:04:42.320> spreads<00:04:42.560> to
