00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
back into the game we had some good

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.540 
back into the game we had some good
pressure<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:49.570> get<00:01:49.660> credit<00:01:50.020> for<00:01:50.140> that<00:01:50.310> base<00:01:51.310> to

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
pressure to get credit for that base to

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.130 
pressure to get credit for that base to
set<00:01:51.790> plays<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:52.360> as<00:01:52.479> you<00:01:52.630> can<00:01:52.720> see<00:01:52.900> there<00:01:53.110> I

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
set plays and as you can see there I

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.200 
set plays and as you can see there I
think<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:54.190> luck<00:01:54.340> on<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.610> day<00:01:54.729> you<00:01:54.880> do<00:01:55.000> need<00:01:55.150> a

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
think the luck on the day you do need a

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.510 
think the luck on the day you do need a
better<00:01:55.390> luck<00:01:55.570> remember<00:01:56.229> a<00:01:56.259> few<00:01:57.070> seasons<00:01:57.430> ago

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
better luck remember a few seasons ago

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.550 
better luck remember a few seasons ago
and<00:01:57.790> a<00:01:57.820> little<00:01:58.030> bit<00:01:58.150> a<00:01:58.180> lot<00:01:58.330> myself<00:01:58.479> so<00:01:58.930> I<00:01:59.140> don't

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
and a little bit a lot myself so I don't

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.190 
and a little bit a lot myself so I don't
begrudge<00:01:59.680> your<00:01:59.979> that<00:02:00.450> or<00:02:01.450> congratulate<00:02:02.020> them

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
begrudge your that or congratulate them

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.960 
begrudge your that or congratulate them
at<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.650> same<00:02:02.830> time<00:02:02.890> it's<00:02:03.250> very<00:02:03.280> hard<00:02:03.640> to<00:02:03.700> take

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
at the same time it's very hard to take

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.270 
at the same time it's very hard to take
when<00:02:04.000> we've<00:02:04.810> put<00:02:05.020> so<00:02:05.170> much<00:02:05.259> into<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.619> game<00:02:05.740> how

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
when we've put so much into the game how

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.889 
when we've put so much into the game how
far<00:02:06.580> do<00:02:06.759> you<00:02:06.850> believe<00:02:07.030> loot<00:02:07.240> enough<00:02:07.450> concerts

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
far do you believe loot enough concerts

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.160 
far do you believe loot enough concerts
you<00:02:08.020> came<00:02:08.229> in<00:02:08.410> I<00:02:08.679> think<00:02:09.340> you<00:02:10.240> guys<00:02:10.479> have

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
you came in I think you guys have

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.840 
you came in I think you guys have
watched<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.560> lot<00:02:11.680> of<00:02:11.740> it<00:02:11.920> this<00:02:12.040> season<00:02:12.280> in<00:02:12.670> maybe

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
watched a lot of it this season in maybe

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.309 
watched a lot of it this season in maybe
probably<00:02:13.210> more<00:02:13.300> qualified<00:02:13.750> than<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:14.050> but<00:02:14.260> I

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
probably more qualified than I but I

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.870 
probably more qualified than I but I
think<00:02:14.860> we've<00:02:14.980> come<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.220> long<00:02:15.310> way<00:02:15.550> I<00:02:15.580> think<00:02:15.610> our

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
think we've come a long way I think our

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.790 
think we've come a long way I think our
energy<00:02:16.180> levels<00:02:16.480> at<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.500> end<00:02:17.650> were

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
energy levels at the end were

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.800 
energy levels at the end were
exceptional<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.430> thought<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:19.030> second<00:02:19.480> half<00:02:19.600> it

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
exceptional I thought the second half it

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.930 
exceptional I thought the second half it
was<00:02:19.870> all<00:02:20.050> us<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.830> it<00:02:21.250> was<00:02:21.340> in<00:02:21.460> a<00:02:21.520> controlled

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
was all us and it was in a controlled

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.430 
was all us and it was in a controlled
manner<00:02:22.000> okay<00:02:22.390> we<00:02:22.690> got<00:02:22.840> at<00:02:22.960> this<00:02:23.110> were<00:02:23.260> at<00:02:23.380> the

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
manner okay we got at this were at the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.800 
manner okay we got at this were at the
end<00:02:23.560> with<00:02:23.650> some<00:02:23.830> sort<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.550> silly<00:02:25.420> strikes

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
end with some sort of silly strikes

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.940 
end with some sort of silly strikes
around<00:02:26.020> the<00:02:26.260> box<00:02:26.440> where<00:02:26.650> we<00:02:26.680> could<00:02:26.860> have

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
around the box where we could have

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.410 
around the box where we could have
worked<00:02:27.069> it<00:02:27.250> but<00:02:27.370> I<00:02:27.400> can't<00:02:28.000> be<00:02:28.150> in<00:02:28.180> doing

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
worked it but I can't be in doing

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.580 
worked it but I can't be in doing
billable<00:02:28.720> hours<00:02:28.810> for<00:02:29.050> that<00:02:29.140> it's<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.500> little

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
billable hours for that it's a little

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.199 
billable hours for that it's a little
bit<00:02:29.680> desperation<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.430> end<00:02:30.550> but<00:02:30.700> we<00:02:31.030> work

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
bit desperation of the end but we work

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.240 
bit desperation of the end but we work
the<00:02:31.360> ball<00:02:31.540> very<00:02:31.750> well<00:02:31.810> our<00:02:32.560> fitness<00:02:32.890> levels
