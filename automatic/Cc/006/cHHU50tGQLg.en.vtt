00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.010
 ah 

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.010
 to 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.710
 Hi, how are you talking angelo rico y 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.960
 I remember two very interesting anecdotes 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.449
 from the time in which I started to win 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.509
 very good money in the stock market there in the 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.790
 year 2007 the first of them has to 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.940
 see with the fact that despite winning 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.760
 very good money spent a while 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.910
 important before changing my style of 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.030
 life and before also increase my 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.610
 level of expenses for example I remember that 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.370
 despite earning very good money despite 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.250
 of earning a lot of money really and of 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.219
 can buy me practically the 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.489
 car I wanted, I kept taking 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.580
 public transport was still taking 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:07.610
 bus I was content to think that 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.340
 possibly in a single month 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.070
 I could earn much more than 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.430
 could win all the people that I 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.070
 they surrounded in a full year of work 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.130
 I remember that once I got off the 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.820
 bus one day in the morning to go to 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.210
 the office some client gave me from his 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.370
 he saluted me and when I 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.460
 I came to the office he called me at 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.979
 phone he claimed me laughing 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.740
 because we were friends that as it was 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.040
 possible that I took public transport 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.369
 if only with what he generated me I 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.500
 I could buy any car myself 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.710
 I simply answered also between 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.110
 laughs I have to save I have to 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.830
 save and that was my biggest concern 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.530
 at that time because if something is 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.270
 difficult when you earn a lot is not 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.189
 spend a lot 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.380
 the second anecdote that has to do 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.989
 with this topic it has to do with another 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.080
 customer one of the largest customers 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.239
 of the firm in which he operated in his 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.629
 best time this client came to have 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.660
 in its portfolio about 40 million 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:23.660
 dollars was your money but I remember 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.510
 also that on par with his success was his 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.049
 level of expenses I remember that sometime 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.620
 He invited me to lunch or to eat with others 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:36.950
 20 people that day in that community we 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.360
 we spend for people close to 400 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.269
 Dollars 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.360
 I remember swear never to go out again with 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:47.450
 him not for the money or for being stingy 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.390
 but because I found a way of life 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.329
 extravagant and in a lifestyle that 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.329
 when you earn very good money you can 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:03:00.019
 back contagious but the problem of him 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:02.510
 Nor was that the real problem and 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.060
 go to the types of risk that I assumed 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.610
 when they invested the markets 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.989
 he performed strong operations 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:15.260
 high-risk speculative and with a 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.840
 also elevated leverage in each 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.750
 operation he exposed all his capital 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.620
 his entire portfolio when the 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.140
 crisis of 2008 he was totally 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.470
 exposed was very leveraged and what 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.330
 he lost practically all this was done 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.260
 evident when he had to sell his 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:39.380
 company had to sell it all out of 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.200
 the office and besides that go live 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.709
 with his parents at that time he had 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.709
 50 years all this happened until a 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.170
 day he called me at the office and told me that 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.660
 I was collecting some money to 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.180
 send their children to school that year what 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.700
 last thing I knew about this client was that 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.790
 had gone to live in the USA and that 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.880
 I worked at a gas station but because 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.670
 I tell you all this, ask yourself what 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.870
 would have happened to this gentleman if in 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.599
 place to risk 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.299
 all its assets all its capital the 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.449
 40 million dollars if instead of 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:19.430
 risk everything in every operation 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:21.889
 would have tucked under the mattress or 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.400
 saved in a bank account 20 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:28.610
 million dollars or 5 or at least one 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.910
 million if he had ever done this 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.580
 I would have been poor again to me for the 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.729
 opposite and I say it with humility the 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.460
 crisis of 2008 came when I had a lot 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:43.240
 liquidity put into bank accounts or 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:47.090
 under the mattress I practically pass 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:51.350
 the entire crisis between 2008 and the 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:54.440
 2009 buying shares by investing in 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:57.070
 the markets and when this crisis and 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.330
 all the investments you make 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.449
 they paid off 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:05.479
 I became financially free to save 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:08.630
 it was the origin of all gentlemen because 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:11.900
 as important as winning is to conserve 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.400
 nobody wants to be poor again after 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.910
 to be rich but 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:20.690
 we can be wrong try that when 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:23.720
 you're wrong do not throw overboard years 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.449
 and years of investment with discipline every 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.300
 Once you make money do not leave everything in 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:32.570
 the broker account transfers part of 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.360
 the benefits to a deposit or a 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:38.150
 bank account and or part of the 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:41.840
 I dedicate them to invest in 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:44.210
 assets with fixed profitability that's my 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.970
 Safety mattress is what I 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.639
 allows you to sleep at night and that is what 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:52.840
 that makes me think that lifestyle 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:55.520
 that I now enjoy can only improve 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.660
 very well this is all I wanted them 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.199
