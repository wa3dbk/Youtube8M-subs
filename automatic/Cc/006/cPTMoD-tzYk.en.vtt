00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:10.610
 he clears his pupil energy 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.530
 after which the pose is adopted 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:25.760
 relaxation allowing more subtly 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:29.900
 manage weaker energy flows 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:33.230
 follow their movement inside the bodies 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.230
 doing exercises 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:54.360
 the body of both can intuitively 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.650
 look for the positions he needs in particular 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.230
 the initiator in blue is trying to identify 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:10.280
 most comfortable position 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:10.280
 head and foot strengthen folding 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.920
 intuitively feeling the need of tide 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.740
 energy head 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.390
 managers change fingers movie 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.720
 red turtles allow 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:41.440
 notice how it is done 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:45.880
 allowing free energies from both 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:49.950
 bodies penetrate each other while doing 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:57.820
 head pressure is applied to the head 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:02:02.550
 the vague of the forms of the closure of the peaks of energy 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.550
 bodies rushes to their heads 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.149
 Folding spontaneously modified 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.130
 muscle tension 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:24.120
 allows you to saturate the area which is not 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.120
 had enough energy 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:33.120
 followed by a pose 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:41.290
 more relaxed and with less effort 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:50.590
 and with side closing 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:54.090
 heads for energy exchange used 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.090
 ear zone 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.819
 there was a need to warm it 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:13.200
 performing an exercise rubs about 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:16.890
 the initiator is so purely mechanical 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:24.270
 impact attracting 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:29.000
 energy to this zone this case is 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:35.850
 not the ear but the side of the neck 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:41.730
 jaw lower abutment of ears allows 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:45.590
 redirect energy through these zones to 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.590
 each other's heads 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.690
 discreet motion outs shake the body 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.360
 happens 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.360
 mutual exchange of energies
