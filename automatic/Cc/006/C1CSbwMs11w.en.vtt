00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:08.590
 Losing in local Okinawa for the first time by play last year 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:12.120
 finals missed the Ryukyu Golden Kings 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.120
 Only beauty cheap was remaining 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.140
 There is only 9 esta but of course 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.330
 Urawa Strongly 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.550
 n Yaoi w 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.250
 is unus 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:34.290
 Aan 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:40.760
 Only because I have fought against Spring last year with the regrets that lost the playoffs imminent 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.760
 The same spirit also conveys a strong desire to put into the playoffs than the average year 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:52.390
 One year since that time King's was Isao Tsutomu Head Coach Note 43 9 9 league history history 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.480
 Uchitate No. 2 victory had 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:03.200
 I came back to the playoffs in the West area No. 1 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:05.770
 This season, there is no way to go such as the injury of the commanding tower Kishimoto or the large black pole McHenry 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:11.510
 There was no flat 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:14.750
 Each person tried to level up and became thick in overall power 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:21.080
 First at all costs It is the first race day 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:23.600
 Would be what kind of good because tourism Oh Rukke any form but went How to score so good at what 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.480
 Please give us their own basketball 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:33.490
 I think I want to protect this home port absolutely 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:36.110
 This season's captain in the playoffs has a strong feeling 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:42.600
 I am Shigeki Kinjo 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:46.189
 Surprising answer came back I asked about what was left of the captain 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.189
 It does not change at all disagree 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.630
 Great team why 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.550
 Especially correction 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.650
 Well I'd was hobbling around 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:59.130
 I can not break it up to there 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.130
 End up buying 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:10.270
 I thought that it was 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:15.810
 Kinjo players who have been playing since the team's first year of operation have performed surgery on the right knee in these four years 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:20.990
 Overcoming the difficult times and achieved a complete revival of this season 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.280
 That's why I have the pleasure of putting on a coat as a professional 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.200
 It It was a little tight in other words 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.930
 I'd had even when it is not deaf Benz registration 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.310
 Now Innovation also if 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.390
 It becomes memories mind was a little 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.390
 Also fun to chat 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.750
 The opponents of the Kings' playoffs were Hamamatsu Tomi, who ranked 4th in the regular season 1 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.230
 felix 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:47.630
 Although Onshin content has undefeated Kings 6 races 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:52.080
 It does not take adversaries only to flush the high-capacity players 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.490
 Say the kana off guard that of most of the enemy that are buying 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.900
 The motto is mochi 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.860
 There is does not have the pages, such as to apply hustle 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:05.480
 I think it will be difficult 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:09.740
 The whole team has been fighting so far this year with the regret of a year ago 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.660
 We have finally doing when the game 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.210
 Also from here 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.000
 I don't think it's like a tactic 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.630
 The moving team also has a strong feeling 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.980
 If you 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.190
 I think I can get the best thing again 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.300
 I'm already feeling strong and fighting with the whole team 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.300
 I want to fight 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.190
 All because of the revenge of that day 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.730
 And then the league champion game 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:42.350
 With the power of unity the King is a team slogan 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.350
 Fight through the way off
