00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
and it's really kind of remarkable 5k

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.840 
and it's really kind of remarkable 5k
means<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:13.950> 14<00:00:14.400> point<00:00:14.670> 7<00:00:14.870> megapixels<00:00:15.870> the

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:16.850 
means this is 14 point 7 megapixels the

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.670 
means this is 14 point 7 megapixels the
resolution<00:00:17.850> on<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.320> mind-boggling

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
resolution on this is mind-boggling

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.870 
resolution on this is mind-boggling
it<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:20.340> not<00:00:20.520> 4k<00:00:20.990> it's<00:00:21.990> 5k<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:22.830> it's<00:00:23.100> which<00:00:23.730> is

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
it is not 4k it's 5k so it's which is

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.089 
it is not 4k it's 5k so it's which is
actually<00:00:24.300> double<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.810> standard<00:00:25.289> iMac

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
actually double the standard iMac

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.550 
actually double the standard iMac
resolution<00:00:26.820> which<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.420> normally<00:00:27.720> 1440<00:00:28.470> so

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
resolution which is normally 1440 so

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.990 
resolution which is normally 1440 so
this<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.800> 2880<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.060> then<00:00:30.779> it's<00:00:30.960> what<00:00:31.170> it's<00:00:31.349> a

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
this is 2880 and then it's what it's a

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.880 
this is 2880 and then it's what it's a
50/50<00:00:33.000> one<00:00:33.210> forty<00:00:33.809> five<00:00:34.170> thousand<00:00:34.710> five

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
one kind of computer that could do this

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.670 
one kind of computer that could do this
a<00:01:50.970> computer<00:01:51.689> with<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.200> screen<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.590> the

using Lightroom or iPhoto or you're
playing<00:03:31.260> back<00:03:31.470> videos<00:03:32.010> it'll<00:03:32.519> use<00:03:32.819> every<00:03:33.209> dot

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
playing back videos it'll use every dot

and<00:03:45.780> frankly<00:03:46.379> because<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.829> screen<00:03:47.099> is<00:03:47.129> so

good<00:03:47.669> it's<00:03:48.329> only<00:03:48.540> 27<00:03:49.230> inches<00:03:49.440> even<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.829> menus

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
good it's only 27 inches even the menus

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.640 
good it's only 27 inches even the menus
do<00:03:50.489> work<00:03:50.730> the<00:03:50.910> icons<00:03:51.269> can<00:03:51.510> be<00:03:51.599> made<00:03:51.780> bigger<00:03:52.019> but

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
do work the icons can be made bigger but

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.530 
do work the icons can be made bigger but
you<00:03:52.739> see<00:03:52.889> that<00:03:53.069> it<00:03:53.280> really<00:03:53.669> made<00:03:53.910> all<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.209> text

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
you see that it really made all the text

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.150 
you see that it really made all the text
a<00:03:54.629> whole<00:03:55.019> heck<00:03:55.199> of<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.410> lot<00:03:55.530> smaller<00:03:55.919> that's

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
a whole heck of a lot smaller that's

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.149 
a whole heck of a lot smaller that's
because<00:03:56.489> we<00:03:57.120> have<00:03:57.239> doubled<00:03:58.139> the<00:03:58.349> resolution

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
because we have doubled the resolution

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.399 
because we have doubled the resolution

the MacBooks resolution this is not the

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
full display the 2880 it's 2560 so it's

full display the 2880 it's 2560 so it's
close<00:05:00.240> and<00:05:00.510> you<00:05:01.289> see<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.650> scaler<00:05:02.010> works

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.159 
close and you see the scaler works
really<00:05:02.699> well<00:05:03.030> you<00:05:03.240> don't<00:05:03.270> see<00:05:03.539> any<00:05:03.660> artifacts

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
really well you don't see any artifacts

from the scaling you see really gorgeous

image so it is exactly in every other
respect<00:05:10.440> like<00:05:10.830> the<00:05:10.949> old<00:05:11.100> iMac<00:05:11.550> 5<00:05:11.850> millimeters

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479

on<00:05:12.660> the<00:05:12.780> edge<00:05:12.960> it's<00:05:13.320> really<00:05:13.560> kind<00:05:13.770> of<00:05:13.830> amazing

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
on the edge it's really kind of amazing

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.439 
on the edge it's really kind of amazing
it's<00:05:14.400> a<00:05:14.460> little<00:05:14.669> bit<00:05:14.760> of<00:05:14.820> an<00:05:14.910> optical<00:05:15.210> illusion

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
it's a little bit of an optical illusion

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:17.840 
it's a little bit of an optical illusion
because<00:05:15.780> of<00:05:16.440> course<00:05:16.710> it<00:05:17.010> has<00:05:17.160> to<00:05:17.310> get<00:05:17.430> fatter

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
because of course it has to get fatter

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.060 
because of course it has to get fatter
as<00:05:18.240> it<00:05:18.960> goes<00:05:19.110> to<00:05:19.320> the<00:05:19.440> middle<00:05:19.590> here<00:05:19.889> that's

as it goes to the middle here that's

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.890 
as it goes to the middle here that's

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
you do uses a single core this is

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.600 
you do uses a single core this is
actually<00:07:09.450> faster<00:07:10.020> than<00:07:10.050> the<00:07:10.260> Mac<00:07:10.440> Pro<00:07:10.710> it<00:07:10.980> is<00:07:11.460> a

actually faster than the Mac Pro it is a
