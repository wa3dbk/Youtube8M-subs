00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:23.165
Mazda! A car brand that has been awful quiet lately. The 6 got a facelift, same with the 3 and the 2.

00:00:24.716 --> 00:00:29.115
The Mazda5 was the only new car, but it is not really a big hit.

00:00:28.915 --> 00:00:35.458
This car is brand new: the CX-5. A medium size SUV like the VW Tiguan and Ford Kuga.

00:00:35.867 --> 00:00:39.722
It has that new design language and, very important: is has Sky-active technology.

00:00:47.402 --> 00:00:51.721
So what do you see when you look around: a lot of back stuff. That is so Mazda-like...

00:00:52.497 --> 00:00:57.123
The Mazda6 has the same atmosphere. dark and black and not very happy, so to speak.

00:00:58.696 --> 00:01:10.700
If you look closely, you can however spot nice details. Like the climate controle and the relief you can see in the speedometers.

00:01:15.993 --> 00:01:25.808
The most important thing on this car is the Sky-active. That is for Mazda what Effecient Dynamics is to BMW.

00:01:26.463 --> 00:01:30.414
It is a lot of small changes that make the whole car more fuel efficient.

00:01:32.335 --> 00:01:40.893
For example this car doesn't weigh very much, less then 1.300 kg. That makes it drive better aswell.

00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:57.333
And we see some new technologies. So has the engine a compression ratio of 1:14, which is a lot for e petrol engine.

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:04.403
The result: more low end torque, more power and less emission. 

00:02:06.212 --> 00:02:11.562
Therefor, this car does 139 grams of CO2/km. Not much for a SUV like this. For example this car doesn't weigh very much.

00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:44.865
But the engine is not only fuel efficent, but also very good to drive Very smooth with all that torque. 

00:02:47.994 --> 00:03:03.248
The drive is very Mazda-like.So very dynamic, with heavy steering and a gearbox that resembles the MX-5 one. 

00:03:07.482 --> 00:03:17.673
The suspension is very stiff, but not very comfortable. That makes the car a good drivers car, just know what you get into!

00:03:19.568 --> 00:03:25.086
If you look at a BMW X3, that is e drivers car aswell, but a little more comfortabel then this one.

00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:44.557
So Mazda was a little quiet lately, but this car is a real Mazda ones again. Very sporty, lightweight en good technology. 

00:03:45.803 --> 00:03:56.592
It a feels like it can handle a lot, very reliable. And the value for money is okay: a full version for less then 30k. euro's. 

00:04:08.327 --> 00:04:14.350
+ good engine, good drive - not that comfortabel, interior not very sparkling.
