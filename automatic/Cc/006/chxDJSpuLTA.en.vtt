close<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.220> lash<00:01:53.399> line<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:54.119> way<00:01:54.240> later

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
close to the lash line so that way later

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.660 
close to the lash line so that way later
on<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.290> go<00:01:55.439> ahead<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.979> adjust<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
on you can go ahead and adjust the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.420 
on you can go ahead and adjust the
thickness

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
thickness

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.960 
thickness
desire<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:59.200> again<00:01:59.500> use<00:01:59.830> very<00:02:00.190> small<00:02:00.340> strokes

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
desire so again use very small strokes

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.700 
desire so again use very small strokes
until<00:02:01.420> you<00:02:01.510> get<00:02:01.720> used<00:02:01.900> to<00:02:02.080> this<00:02:02.260> if<00:02:02.470> you<00:02:02.590> are

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
until you get used to this if you are

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.390 
until you get used to this if you are
very<00:02:02.890> new<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:04.030> winged<00:02:04.930> liner<00:02:05.320> or<00:02:05.710> just<00:02:05.950> a<00:02:06.040> crisp

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
very new to winged liner or just a crisp

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.240 
very new to winged liner or just a crisp
clean<00:02:06.910> line<00:02:07.300> and<00:02:07.630> when<00:02:08.470> I<00:02:08.500> end<00:02:08.800> up<00:02:08.920> doing<00:02:09.070> this

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
clean line and when I end up doing this

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.340 
clean line and when I end up doing this
anyway<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.970> shape<00:02:10.300> kind<00:02:10.630> of<00:02:10.750> looks<00:02:11.020> a<00:02:11.200> little

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
anyway the shape kind of looks a little

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.620 
anyway the shape kind of looks a little
bit<00:02:11.650> like<00:02:11.920> almond<00:02:12.460> shape<00:02:12.760> so<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.180> stays<00:02:13.420> very

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
bit like almond shape so it stays very

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.900 
bit like almond shape so it stays very
thin<00:02:14.110> on<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.440> inner<00:02:14.620> corner<00:02:15.040> of<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.160> eye<00:02:15.250> and

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
thin on the inner corner of the eye and

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.580 
thin on the inner corner of the eye and
it<00:02:16.000> gets<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.270> little<00:02:16.450> bit<00:02:16.660> thicker<00:02:16.690> as<00:02:17.230> it<00:02:17.260> goes

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
it gets a little bit thicker as it goes

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.710 
it gets a little bit thicker as it goes
towards<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.100> outside<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:19.240> make<00:02:19.390> sure<00:02:19.570> your

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
towards the outside to make sure your

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.570 
towards the outside to make sure your
wings<00:02:19.930> are<00:02:20.140> symmetrical<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:20.980> both<00:02:21.160> eyes<00:02:21.370> look

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
wings are symmetrical and both eyes look

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.140 
wings are symmetrical and both eyes look
the<00:02:21.700> same

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
the same

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.970 
the same
make<00:02:22.300> your<00:02:22.480> liner<00:02:22.720> point<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.320> end<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.830> your

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
make your liner point to the end of your

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.040 
make your liner point to the end of your
eyebrow<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.940> way<00:02:25.150> both<00:02:25.360> eyes<00:02:25.630> will<00:02:25.900> look

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
eyebrow that way both eyes will look

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.710 
eyebrow that way both eyes will look
identical<00:02:26.230> so<00:02:27.160> I<00:02:27.190> like<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.580> take<00:02:27.820> one<00:02:28.420> line

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
identical so I like to take one line

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.320 
identical so I like to take one line
where<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.140> want<00:02:29.500> my<00:02:29.560> liner<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:30.160> end<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.790> then<00:02:31.270> I

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
where I want my liner to end and then I

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.240 
where I want my liner to end and then I
go<00:02:31.480> back<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:32.020> top<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:32.709> like<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.070> take

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
go back to the top and I like to take

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.970 
go back to the top and I like to take
another<00:02:33.700> line<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:34.300> connect<00:02:35.050> to<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.709> outer

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
another line and connect to the outer

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.580 
another line and connect to the outer
corner<00:02:36.490> of<00:02:36.700> my<00:02:36.730> eye<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.420> it's<00:02:37.570> very<00:02:37.840> fluid<00:02:38.170> and

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
corner of my eye so it's very fluid and

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.430 
corner of my eye so it's very fluid and
very<00:02:38.790> thin<00:02:39.790> so<00:02:40.180> that<00:02:40.209> way<00:02:40.690> later<00:02:40.959> on<00:02:41.050> if<00:02:41.350> you

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
very thin so that way later on if you

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.230 
very thin so that way later on if you
want<00:02:41.620> to<00:02:41.680> make<00:02:41.800> it<00:02:41.920> thicker<00:02:42.190> which<00:02:42.820> is<00:02:43.000> what<00:02:43.209> I

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
want to make it thicker which is what I

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.360 
want to make it thicker which is what I
am<00:02:43.420> about<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.690> do<00:02:43.959> now<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.320> can<00:02:44.800> go<00:02:44.950> back<00:02:45.160> in

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
am about to do now you can go back in

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.270 
am about to do now you can go back in
add<00:02:45.580> because<00:02:45.970> again<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:47.080> can<00:02:47.470> keep<00:02:48.010> adding

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
add because again you can keep adding

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.430 
add because again you can keep adding
but<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.730> can't<00:02:49.030> take<00:02:49.240> away<00:02:49.420> obviously<00:02:50.170> so

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
but you can't take away obviously so

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.860 
but you can't take away obviously so
really<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.340> is<00:02:51.490> pretty<00:02:51.910> much<00:02:52.060> as<00:02:52.300> simple<00:02:52.510> as

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
really it is pretty much as simple as

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.020 
really it is pretty much as simple as
that<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.140> can<00:02:53.350> make<00:02:53.680> your<00:02:53.920> wing<00:02:54.220> as<00:02:54.459> long<00:02:54.850> as

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
that you can make your wing as long as

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.000 
that you can make your wing as long as
you'd<00:02:55.180> like<00:02:55.390> or<00:02:55.630> as<00:02:55.750> thick<00:02:55.959> as<00:02:56.080> you<00:02:56.230> like<00:02:56.470> just

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
you'd like or as thick as you like just

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.620 
you'd like or as thick as you like just
keep<00:02:57.190> working<00:02:57.520> in<00:02:57.640> very<00:02:57.820> small<00:02:57.910> strokes<00:02:58.450> and

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
keep working in very small strokes and

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.350 
keep working in very small strokes and
start<00:02:59.110> very<00:02:59.770> very<00:03:00.100> simple<00:03:00.760> so<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.030> way<00:03:01.300> you

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
start very very simple so that way you

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.050 
start very very simple so that way you
can<00:03:01.510> add<00:03:01.750> on<00:03:01.900> later<00:03:02.200> if<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:03.100> wish<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:03.550> here's

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
can add on later if you wish so here's

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.210 
can add on later if you wish so here's
the<00:03:04.239> process<00:03:04.630> all<00:03:04.810> over<00:03:04.840> again<00:03:05.200> this<00:03:05.680> time<00:03:05.980> I

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
the process all over again this time I

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.520 
the process all over again this time I
am<00:03:06.370> using<00:03:06.400> gel<00:03:07.060> liner<00:03:07.300> just<00:03:08.019> to<00:03:08.140> kind<00:03:08.410> of<00:03:08.470> show

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
am using gel liner just to kind of show

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.009 
am using gel liner just to kind of show
you<00:03:08.709> how<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:09.640> two<00:03:09.910> kind<00:03:10.209> of<00:03:10.300> differentiate<00:03:10.989> a

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
you how the two kind of differentiate a

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.410 
you how the two kind of differentiate a
little<00:03:11.320> bit<00:03:11.470> with<00:03:12.070> gel<00:03:12.430> liner<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.910> only<00:03:13.180> real

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
little bit with gel liner the only real

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.120 
little bit with gel liner the only real
difference<00:03:13.630> is<00:03:14.170> although<00:03:14.530> you're<00:03:14.890> working

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
difference is although you're working

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.170 
difference is although you're working
with<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.310> brush<00:03:15.519> you're<00:03:15.760> going<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:15.970> want<00:03:16.120> to

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
with the brush you're going to want to

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.270 
with the brush you're going to want to
clean<00:03:16.420> it<00:03:16.450> off<00:03:16.660> after<00:03:17.110> every<00:03:17.290> few<00:03:17.920> strokes

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
clean it off after every few strokes

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.699 
clean it off after every few strokes
because<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:19.360> product<00:03:19.750> gets<00:03:19.900> kind<00:03:20.200> of<00:03:20.260> clumpy

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
because the product gets kind of clumpy

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.590 
because the product gets kind of clumpy
and<00:03:20.830> built<00:03:21.160> on<00:03:21.370> your<00:03:21.489> brush<00:03:21.730> so<00:03:21.970> just<00:03:22.269> wipe<00:03:22.450> it

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
and built on your brush so just wipe it

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.020 
and built on your brush so just wipe it
off<00:03:22.780> after<00:03:23.470> every<00:03:23.680> few<00:03:24.040> strokes<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.640> then<00:03:24.820> go

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
off after every few strokes and then go

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.110 
off after every few strokes and then go
ahead<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.600> apply

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
ahead and apply

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.240 
ahead and apply
little<00:03:26.269> bit<00:03:26.360> more<00:03:26.390> product<00:03:26.780> so<00:03:27.230> here<00:03:27.830> is<00:03:28.010> the

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
little bit more product so here is the
