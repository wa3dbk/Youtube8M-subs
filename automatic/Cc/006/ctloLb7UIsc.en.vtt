00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
with the results and I think that looks

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.889 
with the results and I think that looks
beautiful<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.180> we're<00:01:45.360> gonna<00:01:45.509> leave<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.869> like

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
beautiful so we're gonna leave it like

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.190 
beautiful so we're gonna leave it like
that<00:01:47.570> so<00:01:48.570> that's<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:49.020> first<00:01:49.350> step<00:01:50.930> next<00:01:51.930> what

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
that so that's the first step next what

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.429 
that so that's the first step next what
I<00:01:52.229> did<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.040> applied<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.970> layer<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:55.020> topcoat
