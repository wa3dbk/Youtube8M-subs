00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.390
 for any more explanation 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.390
 not easy because she's her arena havrais marley 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.989
 and a powerful team 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:15.659
 for the moment one day always for me for my anger 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:21.310
 % for short term remains not for the moment possible even in the field 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.499
 a difficult time 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:28.569
 so to make this partner also outside as a commander 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:30.829
 messi 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:31.879
 after 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:32.930
 very bad idea 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.750
 a good dynamic 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.880
 jobs in August though on the first leg 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.880
 against reindeer 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.110
 she is almost domineering so 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.420
 for me it's a strong team and sure of my team that's clear and 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.290
 his author 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.160
 to the point that the producers 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
 good days a 2% of government 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.800
 but also probably to start his preparation of orders for gamers 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.000
 so that his heart 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.210
 a man takes short trust so after year 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.040
 he has helped his content and to progress they are very demanding 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.310
 saturday at reindeer had happened was otherwise the current 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.360
 we were in a year the deputy rpr at Christmas we dreamed of iron to take 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.370
 his time so for the championship so much so not a problem 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.150
 11:41 p.m. 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.160
 m it will come and I even told my players that when I got to 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.100
 reindeer played the job because we were very very bad at the 17th team 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.320
 to the one who hold the days 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.360
 and believe me it was complicated there I can tell you that for my 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.610
 successor took because of the team in other circumstances I see I 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.440
 misunderstanding 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.610
 to tell you 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.900
 the 17th at the arrival of paris that these gardens to the recipe leave the fight 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.970
 we finish 6th 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.200
 that's all the harm we can wish my people 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.380
 currently in all this and that would be good 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.500
 but for a hundred and a year and a half I repeated to the players and I 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.500
 remind players that all clubs early in the season 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.580
 at the beginning 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.070
 on the starting line I stand there two missed outings of very very 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.840
 this year's tight so the regular 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.700
 not a lot of weight in between others 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.620
 more about his clips in our hands the facets maybe it's a parliament 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.930
 who is one who hosted just under 39 after the 14th minute corner 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:32.069
 ccm 7th place gaillac% at kuru points 9 points not much, although 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.969
 often like that in France very very tight 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.969
 and the extra big defenders 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.859
 for the moment between mm 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:45.439
 they show this text leaving understanding so a little bit of content 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.209
 there are some who think that we will play we will not play the job in 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.510
 radiotherapy that plays it 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.009
 and conversely with all the clubs arrive at that 

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:56.859
 from now to the 15th day the haven aquaculture mans we can talk 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:57.779
 future media 

00:02:57.779 --> 00:02:59.149
 that's for sure 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:02.219
 of crisis in the theoretical field it makes me happy that we speak 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.479
 of that because it's a bit of humility that's what I said 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:08.359
 at the beginning of the season I was worried about that 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.359
 but I'm not stronger 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:12.669
 after
