00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
seems like too much I guess as a

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.190 
seems like too much I guess as a
question<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.879> kind<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.149> maybe<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.569> little<00:02:09.780> needs

allows a smartphone to basically just

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.660 
allows a smartphone to basically just
scan<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.730> link<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.389> that<00:03:04.190> works<00:03:05.190> very<00:03:05.310> nicely

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670

with<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.049> thousand<00:03:31.530> dollars<00:03:31.829> seems<00:03:32.190> like<00:03:32.430> too

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
with a thousand dollars seems like too

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.030 
with a thousand dollars seems like too
much<00:03:32.790> part<00:03:33.269> but<00:03:34.199> the<00:03:34.440> rest<00:03:34.620> of<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.889> letter

much part but the rest of the letter
actually<00:03:35.280> works<00:03:35.819> well<00:03:36.260> simple<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.440> point

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
actually works well simple to the point

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.900 
actually works well simple to the point
and<00:03:38.099> nicely<00:03:38.840> put<00:03:39.840> together<00:03:40.049> I<00:03:40.760> wanted<00:03:41.760> to

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
and nicely put together I wanted to

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.939 
and nicely put together I wanted to
share<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.150> second<00:03:42.750> letter<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.290> this<00:03:43.410> is<00:03:43.620> from

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
this is slightly a different approach

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.319
