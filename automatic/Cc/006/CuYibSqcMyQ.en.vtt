00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
this shed built today as a wheelbarrow

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.160 
this shed built today as a wheelbarrow
that<00:03:22.260> brought<00:03:22.650> all<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:23.010> stuff<00:03:23.220> from<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.519> car

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
that brought all the stuff from the car

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.740 
that brought all the stuff from the car
and<00:03:25.170> it's<00:03:25.590> time<00:03:25.799> to<00:03:26.090> get<00:03:27.090> working<00:03:27.269> on<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.540> shed

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
and it's time to get working on the shed

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.789 
and it's time to get working on the shed
our<00:03:28.370> walls<00:03:29.370> are<00:03:29.549> done<00:03:30.379> that<00:03:31.379> was<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.650> easy

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
our walls are done that was the easy

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:37.129 
our walls are done that was the easy
part<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:32.190> think<00:03:35.329> now<00:03:36.329> we<00:03:36.389> have<00:03:36.569> to<00:03:36.720> put<00:03:36.930> in<00:03:37.049> the

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
part I think now we have to put in the

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:46.190 
part I think now we have to put in the
roof<00:03:37.319> and<00:03:37.530> doors

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.640 

I<00:03:46.230> think<00:03:46.830> it's<00:03:46.950> holding<00:03:47.250> up<00:03:47.430> well<00:03:48.410> we'll<00:03:49.410> see

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
I think it's holding up well we'll see

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.570 
I think it's holding up well we'll see
how<00:03:49.830> it<00:03:50.010> went<00:03:50.220> how<00:03:50.550> it<00:03:50.670> goes<00:03:52.100> when<00:03:53.100> I<00:03:53.190> put<00:03:53.430> the

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
how it went how it goes when I put the

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.160 
how it went how it goes when I put the
roof<00:03:53.790> on<00:03:56.090> now<00:03:57.090> we'll<00:03:57.300> see<00:03:57.510> if<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.720> thing<00:03:57.960> works

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
roof on now we'll see if the thing works

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.580 
roof on now we'll see if the thing works
out<00:03:59.240> hopefully<00:04:00.240> it'll<00:04:00.360> be<00:04:00.480> okay<00:04:03.590> we're

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
out hopefully it'll be okay we're

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.270 
out hopefully it'll be okay we're
getting<00:04:04.920> there

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
getting there

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.640 
getting there
we're<00:04:05.490> getting<00:04:05.760> there<00:04:06.320> and<00:04:07.320> there<00:04:07.560> you<00:04:07.620> have

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
we're getting there and there you have

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.320 
we're getting there and there you have
it<00:04:08.070> it's<00:04:08.760> all<00:04:08.880> done<00:04:09.500> took<00:04:10.910> quite<00:04:11.910> a<00:04:11.940> bit<00:04:12.150> longer

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
it it's all done took quite a bit longer

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.330 
it it's all done took quite a bit longer
to<00:04:12.600> put<00:04:12.780> on<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.990> roof<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.350> things<00:04:13.920> like<00:04:14.070> that

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
to put on the roof and things like that

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.430 
to put on the roof and things like that
much<00:04:14.700> longer<00:04:14.970> than<00:04:15.090> I<00:04:15.120> thought<00:04:15.180> it<00:04:15.690> actually

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
much longer than I thought it actually

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.840 
much longer than I thought it actually
got<00:04:16.739> dark<00:04:17.070> I<00:04:17.549> wasn't<00:04:18.239> able<00:04:18.299> to<00:04:19.640> take<00:04:20.640> some

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
got dark I wasn't able to take some

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.460 
got dark I wasn't able to take some
video<00:04:21.090> of<00:04:21.150> it<00:04:21.359> last<00:04:21.600> night<00:04:21.750> when<00:04:21.989> I<00:04:22.049> finished

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
video of it last night when I finished

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.950 
video of it last night when I finished
because<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:22.980> just<00:04:23.100> was<00:04:23.310> too<00:04:23.340> dark<00:04:23.720> rain<00:04:24.720> this

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
because it just was too dark rain this

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.450 
because it just was too dark rain this
morning<00:04:25.290> that's<00:04:25.470> why<00:04:25.620> it's<00:04:25.740> so<00:04:25.950> wet<00:04:26.160> so<00:04:26.400> I

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
morning that's why it's so wet so I

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.070 
morning that's why it's so wet so I
thought<00:04:26.669> after<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.150> stopped<00:04:27.450> that<00:04:27.600> come<00:04:27.930> out

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
thought after it stopped that come out

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.820 
thought after it stopped that come out
and<00:04:28.910> take<00:04:29.910> some<00:04:30.120> footage<00:04:30.330> of<00:04:30.630> it<00:04:30.870> one<00:04:31.680> thing

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
and take some footage of it one thing

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.270 
and take some footage of it one thing
I'm<00:04:31.950> still<00:04:32.130> going<00:04:32.280> to<00:04:32.340> do<00:04:32.520> is<00:04:32.730> in<00:04:32.910> between<00:04:33.030> the

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
I'm still going to do is in between the

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.250 
I'm still going to do is in between the
where<00:04:35.280> things<00:04:35.520> connect<00:04:36.030> like<00:04:36.540> the<00:04:36.720> walls<00:04:36.930> and

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
where things connect like the walls and

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.170 
where things connect like the walls and
things<00:04:37.440> I'm<00:04:38.340> going<00:04:38.520> to<00:04:38.610> get<00:04:38.760> some<00:04:38.940> silicone

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
things I'm going to get some silicone

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.390 
things I'm going to get some silicone
and<00:04:40.400> put<00:04:41.400> it<00:04:41.550> in<00:04:41.669> there<00:04:41.970> that<00:04:42.410> way<00:04:43.410> to<00:04:43.470> prevent

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
and put it in there that way to prevent

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.140 
and put it in there that way to prevent
any<00:04:44.700> leaks<00:04:44.940> and<00:04:45.210> things<00:04:45.300> like<00:04:45.510> that<00:04:47.150> even

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
any leaks and things like that even

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.370 
any leaks and things like that even
though<00:04:48.330> it<00:04:48.419> rained<00:04:48.600> quite<00:04:48.990> hard<00:04:49.230> it

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
though it rained quite hard it

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.280 
though it rained quite hard it
surprisingly<00:04:49.919> didn't<00:04:50.930> didn't<00:04:51.930> leak<00:04:52.080> I

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
surprisingly didn't didn't leak I

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.950 
surprisingly didn't didn't leak I
thought<00:04:52.530> that<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:54.150> way<00:04:54.300> there<00:04:54.510> the<00:04:54.540> roof

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
thought that the way there the roof

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.550 
thought that the way there the roof
combines<00:04:56.510> that<00:04:57.510> it'll<00:04:57.780> leak<00:04:57.930> a<00:04:58.020> bit<00:04:58.200> but<00:04:58.440> it

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
combines that it'll leak a bit but it

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.000 
combines that it'll leak a bit but it
did<00:04:58.680> it<00:04:58.800> so<00:04:59.040> that's<00:04:59.220> good<00:05:02.810> so<00:05:03.810> but<00:05:04.470> it's<00:05:04.830> pretty

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
did it so that's good so but it's pretty

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.469 
did it so that's good so but it's pretty
much<00:05:05.190> done

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.909 

I'm<00:05:08.319> gonna<00:05:08.470> put<00:05:08.740> in<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:09.610> things<00:05:09.879> in<00:05:10.120> there

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
I'm gonna put in the things in there

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.260 
I'm gonna put in the things in there
hopefully<00:05:11.919> it'll<00:05:12.069> last<00:05:12.129> a<00:05:12.520> while<00:05:12.669> not<00:05:13.240> the

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
hopefully it'll last a while not the

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.830 
hopefully it'll last a while not the
best<00:05:13.569> of<00:05:13.720> sheds<00:05:13.960> cheap<00:05:14.379> plastic<00:05:14.860> but<00:05:15.750> what<00:05:16.750> are

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
best of sheds cheap plastic but what are

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.619 
best of sheds cheap plastic but what are
you<00:05:16.900> gonna<00:05:16.990> do<00:05:17.229> I<00:05:19.710> think<00:05:20.710> for<00:05:20.889> now<00:05:21.539> it'll<00:05:22.539> be

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:22.629 
you gonna do I think for now it'll be

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:23.249 
you gonna do I think for now it'll be
fine

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
fine
