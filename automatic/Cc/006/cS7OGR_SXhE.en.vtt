00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:03.440
 all the old r myself I also understood the steles 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.900
 cascade I like a man like ratas 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.950
 the end of course 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.029
 but others came as a whole 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:10.989
 Today I want to tell you protasy 

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:12.450
 some recommendations 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.920
 Although there is a well-adjusted accounting lock idea for 10 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.560
 acres 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.610
 so it will be necessary to check it is not 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.290
 continuing its congregation alarms 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.220
 Tatarstan 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.020
 in our opinion October 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.670
 and such came out on Russian gas it 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.910
 July this year gave us this 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:25.919
 michael movie 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.429
 It is also known film 500 meters network and such 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:29.999
 wild hockey beasts 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:31.430
 beginning in October 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.100
 so if you haven't looked at it yet 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.670
 very often market or go and buy 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.160
 all drives 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.140
 donor look 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.260
 and I must say a completely legitimate story 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.129
 formation and rags calculations spiders 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.019
 figure out the primitive ones I'll say a little 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.260
 later industries wear thoroughly 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.570
 Peter lives here children bites him 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.610
 pollux started around the room in a meeting 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.690
 Poznan si and creates lizards 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.120
 fights with a pangolin trying 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.930
 restore 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.820
 remains weak 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.060
 appreciating kill kill lizard pollock 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.140
 large lizard doctor 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.630
 konrad everyone is happy 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.890
 everything is just super 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.050
 but I had to say that in this story 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.430
 such as in this and not too much 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.630
 Podolsky epic through it stands 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.940
 see for yourself you will not hear purely according to art. 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.909
 because what happened there so 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.030
 all this banter to watch 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.170
 well and now we ourselves innovation dreams 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.070
 in this film 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.730
 in the first UAH now we are not here 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.270
 what writers stick to 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.910
 plots 7 m place nhl commendable 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.940
 Lena is also a prize some nuances 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.320
 for example uah language 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.010
 the brightest expressive were 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.490
 unimportant in learning a and here in this film 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.990
 is a guarantee st smart and 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.310
 and older however of such a site as 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.490
 no way and says 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.820
 Osaka post 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.820
 all about how learning performances 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.200
 fret saved 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.250
 Secondly, the children did not say macaroni 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.700
 once asked to write it is only the beginning and 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.350
 parade of the year, the beginning of the fact that but not 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.210
 could be a man without this phrase machines 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.010
 exist my presentation 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.100
 Well, pleased that there is at least 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.290
 forever replacements 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.080
 Yes, and in the second film there is no and so aware of it 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.110
 what can be avoided 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.539
 at the same time sense 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.719
 but the design is of course cool but boots me 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:11.869
 all good 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:14.959
 The fourth session is our duty Alexis 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.219
 read the shelf friendly and was glad 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.539
 to help the police 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.809
 as a result, non-capital efforts to try 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:24.669
 solve these parents this present 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.529
 she looks like a policeman 400 policy 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.949
 primates girl left 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.539
 these are classic balls 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:33.199
 it was a ride Kokoity homage 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:35.659
 to this character is the sixth lizard 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.759
 Putin's Serbs and Albanians of the universe 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:39.869
 george die under the rubble the battlefield 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:42.319
 scary girl here sometimes lizards 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.169
 many then started recently what 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.329
 but alas, while there was a taxi where Chanovsky devil 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:48.749
 on this post survived 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.269
 in fact it did not happen so much 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.099
 there were antidotes in the air 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.129
 even if they do here 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.669
 that captain so much then such 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:58.809
 connection signals 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:01.809
 seventh and I did not have to sell hotel volumes 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:04.549
 she appeared only at the end of the film and on 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:06.609
 downtrend in the picture with it 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.999
 no less famous jaden james 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:11.479
 but if you pay attention to these and 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:14.069
 cooling at 16 we can say that akimat 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.089
 how good 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:17.229
 and not yet a thousand organization 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.359
 restart this movie is interesting for him 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.729
 calculating a little ethic excellent martial 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:22.749
 scenes 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:25.189
 finally era joking for 10 years they joke 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:26.769
 there are some 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.099
 the third is terrible like the grapes of the previous 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.439
 movies 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.519
 on this same me just this movie is the main 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.419
 villain box he does evil not because he 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.319
 angry not because he has to do it and we 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:37.359
 provide 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.039
 but because 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.149
 I want to create a world of business 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:44.209
 due to low 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.889
 it is not clear how 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:46.949
 without flaws 

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:50.309
 look understand him 

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:52.739
