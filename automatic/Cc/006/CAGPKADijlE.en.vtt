and you don't use crushed ice the recipe

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.200 
and you don't use crushed ice the recipe
actually<00:04:24.800> calls<00:04:25.010> for<00:04:25.430> crushed<00:04:25.640> X<00:04:25.880> will<00:04:26.060> just

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
actually calls for crushed X will just

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.790 
actually calls for crushed X will just
to<00:04:26.300> Langley<00:04:26.570> depression<00:04:26.990> so<00:04:27.140> it<00:04:27.260> use<00:04:27.500> this<00:04:27.650> as

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
to Langley depression so it use this as

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.840 
to Langley depression so it use this as
it<00:04:27.920> works<00:04:28.010> to<00:04:29.590> their<00:04:30.590> level<00:04:30.830> down<00:04:31.220> which<00:04:31.400> is<00:04:31.550> in

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
it works to their level down which is in

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.360 
it works to their level down which is in
your<00:04:32.000> bed<00:04:35.050> you<00:04:36.050> can<00:04:36.230> have<00:04:36.410> more<00:04:36.680> like<00:04:36.890> if<00:04:37.250> you
