00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
fiber

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.470

lots<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.059> slow<00:00:39.690> complex<00:00:40.879> slow<00:00:41.879> digesting

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
lots of slow complex slow digesting

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.529 
lots of slow complex slow digesting
carbohydrates<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.590> one<00:00:43.829> full<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.539> one

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
carbohydrates this is one full can one

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
take my chances so I'm in the oven we

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.770 
take my chances so I'm in the oven we
have<00:01:25.650> just<00:01:26.369> warming<00:01:26.850> here<00:01:27.000> now<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.240> cook<00:01:27.600> this

in the oven it's just staying warm

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.499 
in the oven it's just staying warm
because<00:01:29.520> already<00:01:29.729> cooked<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.270> stove

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509

percent<00:01:41.520> lean<00:01:41.869> 7%<00:01:42.869> fat<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.380> can<00:01:43.500> get<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.619> little

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
percent lean 7% fat you can get a little

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.010 
percent lean 7% fat you can get a little
leaner<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:45.119> going<00:01:45.240> leaders<00:01:45.630> were<00:01:45.750> really

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
leaner but the going leaders were really

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.460 
leaner but the going leaders were really
expensive<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.680> we<00:01:46.770> already<00:01:46.950> spent<00:01:47.220> enough

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
expensive and we already spent enough

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.980

of garlic it's it's it's awesome
especially<00:03:05.160> if<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.340> don't<00:03:05.820> eat<00:03:05.970> it<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.360> lot<00:03:06.630> of

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
especially if you don't eat it a lot of

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.980 
especially if you don't eat it a lot of
sugar<00:03:07.110> like<00:03:07.320> us<00:03:07.500> so<00:03:07.740> these<00:03:08.250> probably<00:03:08.700> have<00:03:08.990> 40

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
sugar like us so these probably have 40

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.610 
sugar like us so these probably have 40
to<00:03:10.080> 50<00:03:10.440> calories<00:03:10.950> in<00:03:11.100> each<00:03:11.190> pepper<00:03:11.550> not<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:11.940> lot

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
to 50 calories in each pepper not a lot

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.340 
to 50 calories in each pepper not a lot
some<00:03:13.620> natural<00:03:14.010> sugars<00:03:14.430> again<00:03:14.790> some<00:03:15.030> more

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
some natural sugars again some more

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.720 
some natural sugars again some more
carbohydrates<00:03:16.350> but<00:03:16.680> I'm<00:03:17.250> gonna<00:03:17.459> go<00:03:17.550> ahead<00:03:17.610> and

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
carbohydrates but I'm gonna go ahead and

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.370 
carbohydrates but I'm gonna go ahead and
say<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:18.060> is<00:03:18.209> 100<00:03:18.570> calories<00:03:18.990> here<00:03:19.200> that's

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
say this is 100 calories here that's

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.350 
say this is 100 calories here that's
probably<00:03:19.650> way<00:03:19.860> over<00:03:20.130> estimating<00:03:20.730> but<00:03:20.940> again<00:03:21.209> I

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
probably way over estimating but again I

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.120 
probably way over estimating but again I
like<00:03:21.600> to<00:03:21.750> overestimate<00:03:22.050> I<00:03:22.380> like<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.740> stay<00:03:22.920> lean

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
like to overestimate I like to stay lean

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.670 
like to overestimate I like to stay lean
so<00:03:23.570> 1,850<00:03:24.570> calories<00:03:24.990> we'll<00:03:25.140> split<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.440> three

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
so 1,850 calories we'll split it three

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.260 
so 1,850 calories we'll split it three
ways<00:03:25.709> we'll<00:03:26.040> have<00:03:26.130> just<00:03:26.340> over<00:03:26.580> 600<00:03:26.880> calories

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
ways we'll have just over 600 calories

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.900 
ways we'll have just over 600 calories
per<00:03:27.600> plate<00:03:27.870> we'll<00:03:28.470> have<00:03:28.680> over<00:03:28.980> 40<00:03:29.520> grams<00:03:29.730> of

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
per plate we'll have over 40 grams of

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.580 
per plate we'll have over 40 grams of
protein<00:03:30.270> per<00:03:30.480> plate<00:03:30.720> we'll<00:03:31.140> have<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.290> ton<00:03:31.560> of

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
protein per plate we'll have a ton of

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.920 
protein per plate we'll have a ton of
complex<00:03:32.100> carbohydrates<00:03:32.660> it's<00:03:33.660> gonna<00:03:33.750> be<00:03:33.900> a

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
complex carbohydrates it's gonna be a

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.320 
complex carbohydrates it's gonna be a
perfect<00:03:34.080> meal<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.890> that's<00:03:35.550> about<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.970> extent
