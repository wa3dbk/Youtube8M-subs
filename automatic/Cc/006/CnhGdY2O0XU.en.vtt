00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
I can build these defenses around it by

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.520 
I can build these defenses around it by
hitting<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.390> little<00:01:15.630> hammer<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.229> bottom

hitting the little hammer on the bottom
the<00:01:17.159> hammer<00:01:17.430> means<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.060> build<00:01:19.049> things<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.680> don't

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the hammer means to build things I don't

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.890 
the hammer means to build things I don't
know<00:01:20.250> if<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.400> knew<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.909> by<00:01:21.750> building

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
know if you knew that and by building

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.109 
know if you knew that and by building
blocks<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.009> turrets<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.580> top<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.000> the

blocks<00:01:25.159> of<00:01:26.159> course<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.580> costs<00:01:26.970> money

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
blocks of course it costs money

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.380

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
and that's moving up by so using just

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.240 
and that's moving up by so using just
tapping<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.820> resource<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:10.500> my<00:02:10.679> player

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
tapping on the resource and my player

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.520 
tapping on the resource and my player
will<00:02:11.430> walk<00:02:11.610> over<00:02:11.640> there<00:02:12.000> if<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.780> actually<00:02:12.990> hold

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
destroy them so accidentally build a

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.350 
destroy them so accidentally build a
block<00:02:43.800> on<00:02:44.010> top<00:02:44.070> of<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.520> tree<00:02:44.820> which<00:02:45.030> is<00:02:45.150> cool

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
block on top of a tree which is cool

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.320 
block on top of a tree which is cool
gets<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.020> give<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.290> higher<00:02:46.440> angle<00:02:47.000> I'm<00:02:48.000> okay

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
gets to give the higher angle I'm okay

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.210 
gets to give the higher angle I'm okay
with<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.630> I'm<00:02:48.870> building<00:02:49.470> these<00:02:49.560> various<00:02:50.070> and

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
with that I'm building these various and

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.250 
with that I'm building these various and
power<00:02:50.459> blocks<00:02:50.940> not<00:02:51.660> quite<00:02:51.840> sure<00:02:51.870> what<00:02:52.080> they<00:02:52.200> do

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
power blocks not quite sure what they do

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.110 
power blocks not quite sure what they do
but<00:02:52.920> they<00:02:53.010> look<00:02:53.190> cool<00:02:53.340> when<00:02:53.459> they<00:02:53.610> shine<00:02:53.850> so

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
but they look cool when they shine so

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.660 
but they look cool when they shine so
I'm<00:02:54.660> guessing<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.080> gives<00:02:55.470> more<00:02:55.739> resources

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
I'm guessing that gives more resources

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.610 
I'm guessing that gives more resources
or<00:02:56.940> sucking<00:02:57.390> out<00:02:57.480> more<00:02:57.660> resources<00:02:57.989> at<00:02:58.350> that

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
or sucking out more resources at that

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.410 
or sucking out more resources at that
point<00:02:59.840> okay<00:03:01.010> now<00:03:02.010> up<00:03:02.670> here<00:03:02.910> comes<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.360> bad<00:03:03.510> guy
