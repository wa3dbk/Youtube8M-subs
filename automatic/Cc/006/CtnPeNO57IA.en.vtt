00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.270
 people what is going on again a new kelter 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.900
 daily you want to show here 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.900
 and you have to survive on the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.529
 So start a depot 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.610
 fight for survival and yes does not go on 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.850
 we will be here 10 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.170
 and we start now and we 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.399
 must now follow 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.899
 leaves run right so now 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.429
 Here we go over the little barricade 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.980
 So you can go straight but 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:51.539
 then climb into the sleeping mode 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.570
 So go and grow on it now here 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:58.739
 no mode in and then you have to 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.199
 Seeing it will work first 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.220
 so that was wrong mission more distance 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.010
 so to the wall and jump and zack are 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.200
 your turn in the wall so now you can 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.460
 Dismantle everything from here and so on 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.290
 nobody can meet you 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.549
 that means you can do the whole thing now 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.600
 pretty soon finish that 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.159
 survival battle without you die you 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.090
 get for each child to hold still rp 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.719
 so what is it once 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.250
 legal thing to make so much money there 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:35.030
 it includes something from the rockstar 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.229
 error is in my opinion so 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.240
 you see, you can just do that 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.829
 all people zap who themselves can 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.929
 also do not know who know where 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:46.340
 You're pulling on you too 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:48.770
 but nothing happens with yes and completely on 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.700
 several people are doing that now 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.829
 Let's see this here 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.920
 colleague with purely so everything is no 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.920
 problem 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.130
 the turn is cut 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.250
 so they can shoot down the rockets 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.670
 So avoid this the works already 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.670
 everything 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.470
 Now we see the colleague here 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.240
 can also there and I think to myself 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.520
 then stop with a man so many 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.240
 people as well as there in the fight for survival 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.240
 watch out 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.620
 here we also see air canada the 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.620
 Rocket launch without problems 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.270
 yes, then I should say that 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.710
 has liked video and we have more of it 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.570
 want to see from such pretty to 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.390
 something like that would be about me 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.300
 call happy and yes if you have the video 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.060
 it could also show yours 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.900
 friends so that would just stop and see 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.050
 yes, I would say it is so there is 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.050
