00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:07.689
 pop 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.050
 hello and welcome to the cozy presents me 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.660
 the eye of Quebec chef de cuisine du 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.920
 restaurant so the cozy at reims 30 sarah 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.250
 buret and right next to the square 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.260
 of erlon 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.570
 I propose here a kitchen 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.480
 Mediterranean with some notations 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.429
 to Asian and African makes all the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.089
 Mediterranean basin plus a little bit of 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:50.760
 world cuisine I introduced you to a 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:53.100
 omar tiramisu so for those we have 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.620
 need eight egg yolks of 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.039
 mascarpone 250 g of 500 g of cream 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.749
 liquid rises from 2 chopped shallots 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.239
 a slice of country bread to 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:04.260
 lobsters and for the decoration of young 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.960
 couserannais that allows view 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.200
 to bring a little spike years after the end 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.030
 interesting too 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.080
 so to make the recipe for the term and 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.960
 under two brands we clarified 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.150
 yolk and yakuza will separate the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.290
 white yellows of course we keep them 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.170
 blanks for another use 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.820
 so next we'll put the 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.400
 mascarpone with egg yolks 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.880
 it's a triple specialty cream 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 Italian 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.640
 we have between butter and cream 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.570
 so to the drummer we could not see 35 just 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.070
 to prevent this policy 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.100
 as long as the mascarpone pick up a little 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.260
 of its consistency I prefer it is 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.670
 to have the end are we going when 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.590
 even add the lobster we will add 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.390
 still the cream the cream mounted 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.130
 so if we know the start is stung 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.540
 it's missing we will still retouch salt 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.580
 so it's better here we are but we do 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.000
 all in the end well let's give it that 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.000
 will be largely sufficient 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.770
 then we will incorporate the 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.119
 Fox discs directly us 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.570
 must in the mascarpone mix and 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.490
 Egg yolk 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.720
 it's like you're making soup 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.060
 of fish except that it is done 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.090
 lobster so well then we mix 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.929
 everything after this step long for and 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.640
 whipped cream 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.510
 we have to arrive, that's what we want 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.860
 this is called constancy 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.750
 with a bin 2 actually when you take 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.160
 the whip and you climb them that you 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.160
 make a tip on the whipped cream 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.150
 so by leading the good of all in 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.280
 being very careful not to overdo 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.160
 celebrate for not that cream says robert 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.480
 and grain face in the device 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.890
 here we go just booked a few 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.720
 moments to cool we will take care of the 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.569
 lobster that I probably killed so 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.430
 in a broth with 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.620
 I like rosemary korian a 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.180
 little bit of white wine of water and then 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.670
 coarse salt 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.349
 so here we're just going to serve the tail 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.670
 to shell the duck lake led 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.349
 just leaning on the shell 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.870
 once she cracked wanting 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.329
 to dismiss you take back the flesh all well 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.829
 alone there is no problem 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.629
 we're just going to take off a little bit 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.799
 green part that is good but not very 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.739
 appetizing at the color level 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.840
 secor iphone apps and coral so there 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.459
 we will just cut into two parts where we 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.230
 will look for the presentation and 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.629
 this one not only the cut and a 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:16.090
 little taste so then we go 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.299
 still for and lobster in the 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.299
 Tiramisu 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:28.120
 then and hot 6 and now we're going 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:31.209
 furrow the sky we will recruit 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.629
 a little cognac up to 2.3 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.489
 centilitres and we go along the whole 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.139
 you are leaving from the top of your container 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.060
 and you turn the peace story into the same 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.139
 time to avoid that too beat and 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.049
 then that my cream 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:45.220
 makrem beer what simply 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.780
 then we will take care of the training 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.430
 so me to train I use a 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.159
 little glass so others no 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.689
 campaign a little cookie cutter a whole 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.540
 slightly smaller than diameters 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:56.919
 lunar pages to put in the bottom this is what 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.810
 what you really need is to have bought 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:01.689
 a good ben laden two beds of taste so 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.040
 a panel me it's still great 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:04.500
 white bread you either so if you want 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.030
 find a novel a good country bread 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.790
 a cereal bread for example it's 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.750
 it's not over yet then for 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.049
 dress up we will serve as a pocket to 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.810
 socket 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.250
 the worm is finally we will close to the pocket 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.169
 a small incision 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.210
 and that's so we 'll start with a 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:28.300
 first layer we will give small 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:31.659
 end of lobster then we will put some 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:37.150
 a second layer of bread and 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:39.449
 start again we finish with a little bit 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.449
 lobster 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:45.729
 I received the decoration so their two 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.439
 little black spaghetti is optional 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.240
 but I like working on 

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:50.229
 very floral volumes and it's still 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.879
 a good hour or two hours at 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.680
 fridge after that but they are well 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:55.120
 cold is still better than 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.740
 it's cool and that if you put 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.990
 a little salad what you have a little 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.629
 of muscle a little bit of rockets well 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.400
 season then go for the game 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.319
 offers you a little dog so a 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.849
 Sauvignon that will go very well with this dish 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:10.210
 because of its computing power 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:12.669
 who will still want to mascarpone 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.139
 with the tiramisu terraces lacking 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.479
 something very valuable in addition 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:24.150
 there are t-notes of mangoes that 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:24.150
 fit very well with the entrance to
