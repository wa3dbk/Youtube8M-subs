up your mouse sometimes it tends to

based<00:00:48.930> gamer<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.410> don't<00:00:49.680> tend<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.890> pick<00:00:50.039> it

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.910 
based gamer so I don't tend to pick it
up<00:00:50.219> as<00:00:50.370> often<00:00:50.989> however<00:00:51.989> some<00:00:52.350> my<00:00:52.469> buddies<00:00:52.739> they

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
up as often however some my buddies they

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.770 
up as often however some my buddies they
pick<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.190> up<00:00:53.309> they'll<00:00:53.699> prefer<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.300> mouse<00:00:54.600> that

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
pick it up they'll prefer a mouse that

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
doesn't do that as much this one he's

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.549 
doesn't do that as much this one he's
pretty<00:00:57.059> good<00:00:57.300> about<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.809> don't<00:00:58.050> notice<00:00:58.320> it

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
pretty good about it I don't notice it

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.069 
pretty good about it I don't notice it
as<00:00:58.710> bad<00:00:58.949> as<00:00:59.640> with<00:00:59.879> some<00:01:00.090> sometimes<00:01:00.690> if<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.840> clunk

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
as bad as with some sometimes if I clunk

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.930 
as bad as with some sometimes if I clunk
my<00:01:01.199> mouse<00:01:01.379> back<00:01:01.620> down<00:01:01.829> it'll<00:01:02.489> shake<00:01:02.730> off<00:01:02.910> a

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
my mouse back down it'll shake off a

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.490 
my mouse back down it'll shake off a
little<00:01:03.270> bit<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:03.660> elsewise<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.140> pretty<00:01:04.350> good

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
little bit but elsewise it's pretty good

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.050 
little bit but elsewise it's pretty good
one<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.280> other<00:01:05.369> great<00:01:05.580> features<00:01:05.909> about

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
one of the other great features about

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.270 
one of the other great features about
this<00:01:06.720> mouse<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.860> switches

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
this mouse is that it switches

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.950 
this mouse is that it switches
sensitivity<00:01:08.909> really<00:01:09.240> fast<00:01:09.510> some<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
sensitivity really fast some of the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.390 
sensitivity really fast some of the
other<00:01:10.080> mice<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.560> had<00:01:10.710> when<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.220> click

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
other mice that have had when you click

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.710 
other mice that have had when you click
it<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.610> change<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.909> sensitivity<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.540> takes

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
it to change of sensitivity it takes

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.020 
it to change of sensitivity it takes
forever<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.590> when<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.010> change<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.369> down<00:01:14.549> for

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
forever so when you change it down for

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.330 
forever so when you change it down for
DPI<00:01:15.380> sometimes<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.530> split<00:01:16.799> second<00:01:17.130> will<00:01:17.220> be

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
DPI sometimes that split second will be

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.859 
DPI sometimes that split second will be
enough<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> get<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.820> killed<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.240> between<00:01:18.600> you

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
enough to get you killed in between you

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.210 
enough to get you killed in between you
know<00:01:18.960> running<00:01:19.200> around<00:01:19.530> with<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> machine<00:01:20.159> gun

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
know running around with a machine gun

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.800 
know running around with a machine gun
and<00:01:20.520> switching<00:01:20.790> over<00:01:20.880> your<00:01:21.119> sniper<00:01:21.360> or<00:01:21.630> vice

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and switching over your sniper or vice

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.560 
and switching over your sniper or vice
versa<00:01:22.080> really<00:01:22.920> helps<00:01:23.280> especially<00:01:24.270> with<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
versa really helps especially with the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.170 
versa really helps especially with the
movement<00:01:24.720> involved<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.740> backs<00:01:26.159> packaging<00:01:26.640> as

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
movement involved so backs packaging as

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.490 
movement involved so backs packaging as
you<00:01:27.360> can<00:01:27.479> see<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.780> box<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.140> pretty<00:01:28.170> standard

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
you can see the box is pretty standard

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.679 
you can see the box is pretty standard
looks<00:01:28.890> similar<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.670> spawn<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.180> center<00:01:30.420> so

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
looks similar to spawn in the center so

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.690 
looks similar to spawn in the center so

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
pretty solid braided cable it's actually

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.120 
pretty solid braided cable it's actually
quite<00:03:25.810> long<00:03:26.110> so<00:03:26.140> which<00:03:26.470> is<00:03:26.500> nice<00:03:26.739> if<00:03:26.920> you<00:03:26.980> keep

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
differently the weight the size the way

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.450 
differently the weight the size the way
it<00:04:54.419> contours<00:04:54.840> this<00:04:55.500> one's<00:04:55.710> pretty<00:04:55.889> nice<00:04:56.130> it's

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
it contours this one's pretty nice it's

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.689 
it contours this one's pretty nice it's
a<00:04:57.349> you<00:04:58.349> know<00:04:58.470> covers<00:04:59.009> my<00:04:59.160> hands<00:04:59.310> pretty<00:04:59.490> well

I've<00:04:59.970> got<00:05:00.060> long<00:05:00.419> fingers<00:05:00.449> so<00:05:00.990> mine<00:05:01.139> goes<00:05:01.349> just

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
I've got long fingers so mine goes just

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.499 
I've got long fingers so mine goes just
over<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.830> top<00:05:01.860> so<00:05:02.759> depending<00:05:03.210> on<00:05:03.270> the<00:05:03.330> kind<00:05:03.419> of
