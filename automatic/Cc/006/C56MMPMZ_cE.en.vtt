sexcellent and their left hand is just

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.169 
sexcellent and their left hand is just

00:00:46.169 --> 00:00:46.179 
lagging and please okay first of all my

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.430 
lagging and please okay first of all my
left<00:00:46.420> hand<00:00:46.570> is<00:00:46.659> not<00:00:46.809> as<00:00:46.899> good<00:00:47.019> as<00:00:47.109> my<00:00:47.260> right

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
left hand is not as good as my right

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.700 
left hand is not as good as my right
either<00:00:47.620> so<00:00:48.219> we<00:00:48.429> all<00:00:48.960> probably<00:00:49.960> have<00:00:50.140> one<00:00:50.409> hand

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
either so we all probably have one hand

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.559 
either so we all probably have one hand
that's<00:00:51.010> weaker<00:00:51.640> that's<00:00:51.909> just<00:00:52.089> the<00:00:52.239> nature<00:00:52.449> of

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:52.569 
that's weaker that's just the nature of

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:55.979 
that's weaker that's just the nature of
the<00:00:52.749> game<00:00:52.899> but<00:00:53.620> most<00:00:54.370> people<00:00:54.839> exacerbate<00:00:55.839> the

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
the game but most people exacerbate the

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.389 
the game but most people exacerbate the
problem<00:00:56.409> by<00:00:56.739> their<00:00:56.920> position

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
problem by their position

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.250 
problem by their position
okay<00:00:58.390> so<00:00:58.780> matched<00:00:59.289> grip<00:00:59.679> simply<00:01:00.429> means<00:01:00.670> not

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
okay so matched grip simply means not

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.329 
okay so matched grip simply means not
traditional<00:01:02.260> right<00:01:02.620> where<00:01:02.979> this<00:01:03.100> hands

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
traditional right where this hands

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:05.700 
traditional right where this hands
upside<00:01:03.579> down<00:01:03.940> made<00:01:04.540> for<00:01:04.750> it<00:01:04.839> tilted<00:01:05.110> drum<00:01:05.350> all

upside down made for it tilted drum all

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.850 
upside down made for it tilted drum all
right<00:01:05.950> so<00:01:06.670> matched<00:01:07.509> grip<00:01:07.869> from<00:01:08.229> there<00:01:08.500> you

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
right so matched grip from there you

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.030 
right so matched grip from there you
have<00:01:09.070> three<00:01:09.549> main<00:01:10.240> types<00:01:10.630> you<00:01:11.409> have<00:01:11.439> German

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
which is flat hands thumbs on the side

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.950 
which is flat hands thumbs on the side
and<00:01:14.579> then<00:01:15.579> I<00:01:15.700> can<00:01:15.880> put<00:01:16.060> the<00:01:16.149> sticks<00:01:16.390> down<00:01:16.600> and

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
and then I can put the sticks down and

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.620 
and then I can put the sticks down and
holding<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:17.740> stick<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.070> same<00:01:18.250> way<00:01:18.430> hmm<00:01:18.969> go

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
holding the stick the same way hmm go

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.149 
holding the stick the same way hmm go
all<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:19.869> way<00:01:19.960> to<00:01:20.020> French<00:01:20.350> that's<00:01:20.799> hands

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
all the way to French that's hands

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.249 
all the way to French that's hands
vertical<00:01:21.640> with<00:01:21.759> thumb<00:01:21.909> on<00:01:22.060> top<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:22.659> then<00:01:23.140> in

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
vertical with thumb on top and then in

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.800 
vertical with thumb on top and then in
the<00:01:23.350> middle<00:01:23.560> is<00:01:23.799> American<00:01:24.250> grip<00:01:24.490> so<00:01:24.969> basically

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
the middle is American grip so basically

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.510 
the middle is American grip so basically
at<00:01:25.960> about<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.140> 45<00:01:26.649> degree<00:01:26.680> angle<00:01:26.979> with<00:01:27.280> that

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
at about a 45 degree angle with that

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.999 
at about a 45 degree angle with that
thumb<00:01:27.789> that's<00:01:28.509> where<00:01:28.689> the<00:01:28.780> hand<00:01:28.960> sits<00:01:29.259> now

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
thumb that's where the hand sits now

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.459 
thumb that's where the hand sits now
first<00:01:30.310> of<00:01:30.490> all<00:01:30.549> I<00:01:30.850> think<00:01:31.659> Americans<00:01:32.109> the<00:01:32.289> most

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
first of all I think Americans the most

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:33.990 
first of all I think Americans the most
natural<00:01:33.009> and<00:01:33.100> most<00:01:33.250> effective<00:01:33.789> most

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
natural and most effective most

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.090 
natural and most effective most
Universal<00:01:34.570> way<00:01:34.719> to<00:01:34.780> do<00:01:34.990> it<00:01:35.109> if<00:01:35.560> you<00:01:35.740> pick<00:01:35.950> up

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
Universal way to do it if you pick up

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.920 
Universal way to do it if you pick up
your<00:01:36.250> hand<00:01:36.520> it<00:01:37.060> comes<00:01:37.270> up<00:01:37.420> like<00:01:37.450> that<00:01:37.719> it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
your hand it comes up like that it

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.069 
your hand it comes up like that it
doesn't<00:01:38.109> come<00:01:38.350> up<00:01:38.469> flat<00:01:38.680> alright<00:01:39.579> so<00:01:40.329> a<00:01:40.570> lot<00:01:41.049> of

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
doesn't come up flat alright so a lot of

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.340 
doesn't come up flat alright so a lot of
people<00:01:41.619> are<00:01:41.890> taught<00:01:42.340> German<00:01:43.329> grip<00:01:43.689> flat<00:01:44.049> hands

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
people are taught German grip flat hands

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.490 
people are taught German grip flat hands
day<00:01:44.680> one<00:01:44.950> it's<00:01:45.159> a<00:01:45.250> very<00:01:45.280> standard<00:01:45.850> method

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
day one it's a very standard method

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.109 
day one it's a very standard method
which<00:01:47.500> I<00:01:47.890> kind<00:01:48.130> of<00:01:48.189> think<00:01:48.399> is<00:01:48.609> a<00:01:48.640> bit<00:01:48.909> outdated

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
which I kind of think is a bit outdated

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.800 
which I kind of think is a bit outdated
and<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:49.869> whole<00:01:50.140> pedagogy<00:01:50.979> scene<00:01:51.880> so<00:01:52.479> the

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
and the whole pedagogy scene so the

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.169 
and the whole pedagogy scene so the
difference<00:01:53.229> between<00:01:53.350> most<00:01:53.859> people's<00:01:54.310> really

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
difference between most people's really

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.080 
difference between most people's really
smooth<00:01:55.539> and<00:01:55.929> sweet<00:01:56.340> rebounding<00:01:57.340> quick<00:01:57.700> agile

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090

smooth and sweet rebounding quick agile
right<00:01:58.780> hand<00:01:59.049> and<00:01:59.320> they're<00:02:00.130> so<00:02:01.119> sad<00:02:01.479> and

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.480 
lagging kind of stiff hating life left
hand<00:02:04.179> is<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:05.020> positions<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.770> see<00:02:06.159> it<00:02:06.249> all<00:02:06.369> the

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
hand is the positions I see it all the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.760 
hand is the positions I see it all the
time<00:02:06.549> where<00:02:07.030> the<00:02:07.630> right<00:02:07.840> hand<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.440> in<00:02:08.679> an

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
time where the right hand is in an

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.220 
time where the right hand is in an
American<00:02:09.220> position<00:02:09.600> mainly<00:02:10.600> because<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:11.050> also

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
American position mainly because it also

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.780 
American position mainly because it also
knows<00:02:11.530> how<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.769> play<00:02:11.920> French<00:02:12.220> grip<00:02:12.400> on<00:02:12.670> that

knows how to play French grip on that

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.280 
knows how to play French grip on that
right<00:02:13.000> symbol<00:02:13.390> so<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.629> finger<00:02:13.930> control

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
right symbol so the finger control

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.559 
right symbol so the finger control
French<00:02:14.830> grip<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.340> place<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.760> be<00:02:15.909> for

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
French grip is the place to be for

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.239 
French grip is the place to be for
right<00:02:16.780> some<00:02:16.989> well<00:02:17.109> you<00:02:17.260> know<00:02:17.349> finger<00:02:17.920> control

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:18.249 
right some well you know finger control

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:20.489 
right some well you know finger control
or<00:02:18.370> rather<00:02:18.459> so<00:02:19.299> they<00:02:19.480> got<00:02:19.629> that<00:02:19.780> going<00:02:20.079> on<00:02:20.230> and

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:20.499 
or rather so they got that going on and

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:21.959 
or rather so they got that going on and
then<00:02:20.590> American<00:02:21.040> grip<00:02:21.249> is<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.519> best<00:02:21.700> of<00:02:21.849> both

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:21.969 
then American grip is the best of both

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.360 
then American grip is the best of both
worlds<00:02:22.450> where<00:02:23.109> basically<00:02:23.560> you<00:02:23.709> can<00:02:23.859> move<00:02:24.159> that

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
worlds where basically you can move that

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.780 
worlds where basically you can move that
thumb<00:02:24.730> position<00:02:25.239> to<00:02:25.769> get<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:26.920> attributes<00:02:27.519> of

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
thumb position to get the attributes of

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.360 
thumb position to get the attributes of
French<00:02:28.239> or<00:02:28.480> German<00:02:28.780> so<00:02:29.439> anyway<00:02:29.709> now<00:02:30.159> on<00:02:30.280> the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
French or German so anyway now on the

French or German so anyway now on the
left<00:02:30.549> hand<00:02:30.670> is<00:02:30.939> pretty<00:02:31.150> much<00:02:31.239> German<00:02:31.719> all<00:02:31.900> day

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.109

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:33.660 
left hand is pretty much German all day
long<00:02:32.379> and<00:02:32.650> this<00:02:32.769> is<00:02:32.859> the<00:02:32.950> worst<00:02:33.189> place<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:33.519> be

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
long and this is the worst place to be

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.580 
long and this is the worst place to be
for<00:02:33.909> finger<00:02:34.180> control<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:35.049> they<00:02:35.170> end<00:02:35.290> up<00:02:35.379> in<00:02:35.500> a
