00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.760
 at least christophe I love 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.320
 especially times the boils quiniou and if 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.580
 you prefer what I actually do 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.440
 this kind of videos where I give several 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.880
 information tell me in the bar 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.529
 comments from people would do without 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.910
 no problem even that requires a little more 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.560
 of work we will talk today about 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.380
 fifa is new solid for speed 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.390
 which will be presented at e3 2015 which will 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.930
 will run from June 16 to 18 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.160
 of course this year a necessarily 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.870
 so which is a big games room 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.460
 video and where we will be presenting often and 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.570
 well the new great games that are going 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.580
 go out with fifa 16 who's been who's been 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.080
 pronounced in any case with some 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.989
 little information of the style some 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.809
 players with their laurent will tell their 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.489
 level their level in general average 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.430
 for example when we find the nose of 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.890
 messi who on fifa 15 months and is at 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.500
 84.93 increased to 94 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.440
 despite all this ronaldo will stay at 93 and 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.140
 for example we also know that neymar 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.920
 junior will pass 88 knowing he was at 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.750
 86 so he went back 2.2 points 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.830
 so I 'm pretty good that's 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.510
 little tricks here there have been some 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.259
 little information or about that about 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.630
 players 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.659
 what we also know is of course mom 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.189
 it will be presented at e3 2015 with 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.869
 information little more precise what we 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.310
 also know is that he'll see a whole 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.640
 little bit a little bit more 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.320
 things 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.119
 it has been clarified as well as 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.280
 improvement of the terriÃ¨re electronic mode 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.530
 art having exclusive rights 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.020
 on the primeira division they make 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.210
 16 coming out on the 24th of September, that I 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.890
 did not specify, by and large, 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.630
 will have teams that will be together 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.079
 in only one of the visions and I believe 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.399
 that normally it's something like 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.149
 players from thirty new clubs 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.249
 Argentine 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.619
 so there will be a little more of the team 

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:53.179
 argentina because he had I believe he 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.130
 there was the removal or something like that 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.350
 in the old fifa who has a fine and 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.390
 more so there we will end up with a 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.979
 little more stuff a little more sees his 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.110
 it should be a little fun but good 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.300
 it's not 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.500
 Huge things so it remains to be seen 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.150
 a cash loan that will create 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.320
 what are they going to add to this 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.310
 game there it may be a little more 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.869
 interesting for now is not 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.080
 Too much information is just that 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.850
 so we're going to say the cheek finally 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.310
 give back what he was not going 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.220
 before or about divisions and 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.110
 everything so that will go with the new 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.990
 need for speed is no name had a 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.180
 kind of small teaser a little trailer 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.740
 that I will show you also on the image 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.290
 of course this game is available on pc 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.760
 ps3 and xbox one have positive to 16 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.360
 I do not really know for now 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.440
 but we're going to say ps 4 pc xbox one 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.030
 badges generation of consoles 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.380
 maybe but it's not sure I think 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.310
 that yes because often fifa they 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.290
 also come out on the older generation 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.150
 consoles men's when there are the 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.320
 new generations of consoles 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.150
 for a little while so is it 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.770
 this time exceeded in passing I do not know 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.330
 not finally short after that this kind 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.100
 information can be seen very 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.239
 quickly what is good against 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.580
 actuate for speed by the way the 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.950
 trailer the teaser is gorgeous like 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.090
 usually they are very good at it 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.810
 kind of things is often after 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.390
 when playing the game 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.810
 it's a little different but in any case 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.580
 here they also listened normally 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.650
 the audience so something pretty 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.180
 positive since they finally improved 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.390
 we're going to say push things to the 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.630
 level of customization at the level of 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.700
 vehicles also word level of a kind 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.560
 of hope and black so a game much more 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.340
 immersive that we could find in the 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.900
 other need for speed 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.040
 so it might be interesting there 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.330
 in here that could all at the level 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.490
 information for today 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.540
 of speed and fifa efforts 16 months without 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.340
 think Toussaint in the share of 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.020
 comments but I m stems and 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.160
 threat to put as you want it 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.570
 is super fun anyway it's done 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.010
 always very happy 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.120
 and then also to come often thought 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.770
 when I make videos with you 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.380
 more information about 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.540
 several games and I can also do 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.820
 safe sure safe electronic devices 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.680
 or stuff like that if you see if you 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.600
 prefer to have several months already 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.340
 more information in one 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.470
 video than to just have a theme a 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.810
 subject and that's how basterds are 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.710
 it's over here is the kind but two for 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.270
 three games could possibly put in 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.070
 three in training in a video nocar 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.030
 press to see you and y and then it's 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.080
 pretty much everything I leave you but 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.260
 especially the genres could you tell the 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.379
 next show biz out 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.379
 no
