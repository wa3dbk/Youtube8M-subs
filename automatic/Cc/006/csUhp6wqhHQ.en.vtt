hey viewers so this drawing was

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.420 
hey viewers so this drawing was
basically<00:00:04.319> up<00:00:04.470> reference<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:04.950> my<00:00:05.069> surface

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
basically up reference to my surface

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.980 
basically up reference to my surface
design<00:00:05.549> class<00:00:07.280> there's<00:00:08.280> like<00:00:08.429> this<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:09.090> would

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
design class there's like this I would

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.419 
design class there's like this I would
like<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.110> show<00:00:10.200> some<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.530> my<00:00:10.590> other<00:00:10.800> examples

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
like to show some of my other examples

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.310 
like to show some of my other examples
but<00:00:11.940> i'm<00:00:12.240> pretty<00:00:12.420> sure<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.719> green<00:00:12.900> swim<00:00:13.110> take

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
but i'm pretty sure the green swim take

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.359 
but i'm pretty sure the green swim take
it<00:00:13.410> away<00:00:13.500> like<00:00:13.799> let's<00:00:14.490> just<00:00:14.690> see<00:00:15.690> if<00:00:15.719> this<00:00:16.369> most

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
it away like let's just see if this most

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.980 
it away like let's just see if this most
likely<00:00:17.699> you'll<00:00:17.970> probably<00:00:18.150> see<00:00:18.359> no<00:00:18.480> arm<00:00:18.750> or

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
likely you'll probably see no arm or

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.720 
likely you'll probably see no arm or
something<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.890> want<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.220> see<00:00:20.340> what<00:00:20.460> i<00:00:20.490> did<00:00:20.580> for

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
something you want to see what i did for

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.390 
something you want to see what i did for
that<00:00:20.910> surface<00:00:21.210> design<00:00:21.390> project<00:00:22.080> i<00:00:22.320> would<00:00:23.160> show

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
that surface design project i would show

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.700 
that surface design project i would show
you<00:00:23.430> but<00:00:23.609> it's<00:00:23.880> also<00:00:24.029> green<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.810> it's<00:00:25.170> best<00:00:25.439> if

you go home to my to be art and check it
there<00:00:27.990> yeah<00:00:28.650> work<00:00:28.949> scale<00:00:29.340> version<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:29.970> and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
there yeah work scale version of it and

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.780 
there yeah work scale version of it and
these<00:00:30.720> are<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> reed<00:00:31.160> and<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.369> will<00:00:32.460> show<00:00:32.610> up

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
these are the reed and it will show up

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.729 
these are the reed and it will show up
my<00:00:33.090> green<00:00:33.390> screen<00:00:33.600> won't<00:00:33.899> like<00:00:34.110> make<00:00:34.559> it

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
my green screen won't like make it

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.580 
my green screen won't like make it
disappear<00:00:35.300> so<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.450> reason<00:00:36.660> why<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.079> relates

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
disappear so the reason why it relates

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.459 
disappear so the reason why it relates
to<00:00:37.710> my<00:00:37.890> surface<00:00:38.280> does<00:00:38.460> not<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.760> class<00:00:38.910> is

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
to my surface does not in class is

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.139 
to my surface does not in class is
because<00:00:40.469> i<00:00:40.500> was<00:00:40.980> using<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.399> song<00:00:41.640> don't

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
because i was using the song don't

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
unplug me for that project and it got me

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.979 
unplug me for that project and it got me
thinking<00:00:45.570> about<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.289> i<00:00:46.649> want<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.950> draw<00:00:47.989> what

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
thinking about and i want to draw what

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
prepared for some interesting results

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.939 
prepared for some interesting results
for<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.750> prong<00:00:55.050> because<00:00:55.350> i<00:00:55.440> took<00:00:55.860> a

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
for this prong because i took a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:19.149 
for this prong because i took a
different<00:00:56.100> approach<00:00:56.280> for<00:00:56.699> this

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:30.469

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.740 

so<00:04:16.130> I<00:04:16.160> take<00:04:16.310> no<00:04:16.430> more<00:04:16.609> graphical<00:04:17.180> approach<00:04:17.269> to

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
so I take no more graphical approach to

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.659 
so I take no more graphical approach to
the<00:04:17.810> strong<00:04:18.079> since<00:04:18.859> there's<00:04:19.039> barely<00:04:19.370> no

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
the strong since there's barely no

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:24.879 
the strong since there's barely no
shading<00:04:20.150> or<00:04:20.419> any<00:04:21.009> dimension<00:04:22.009> of<00:04:22.330> form<00:04:23.470> so<00:04:24.470> it

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
shading or any dimension of form so it

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.700 
shading or any dimension of form so it
was<00:04:25.340> a<00:04:25.400> different<00:04:25.580> approach<00:04:26.419> to<00:04:27.259> be<00:04:27.380> sure<00:04:27.560> to

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
was a different approach to be sure to

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.260 
was a different approach to be sure to
check<00:04:27.740> out<00:04:28.070> my<00:04:28.099> facebook<00:04:28.690> my<00:04:29.690> Twitter<00:04:30.500> and<00:04:30.770> my
