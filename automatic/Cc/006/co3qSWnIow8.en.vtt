00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
when we speak and most of us would make

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.470 
when we speak and most of us would make
gestures<00:00:26.020> like<00:00:26.110> shrugging<00:00:26.710> our<00:00:26.919> shoulders

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
finger back in the day maybe even still

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.990 
finger back in the day maybe even still
now<00:00:32.230> these<00:00:32.559> are<00:00:32.739> all<00:00:32.860> gestures<00:00:33.430> that<00:00:33.579> we<00:00:33.760> make

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
now these are all gestures that we make

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.569 
now these are all gestures that we make
and<00:00:34.300> we<00:00:34.809> make<00:00:35.020> the<00:00:35.200> gestures<00:00:35.620> to<00:00:35.770> add<00:00:35.920> meaning

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
and we make the gestures to add meaning

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.190 
and we make the gestures to add meaning
to<00:00:36.969> what<00:00:37.149> it<00:00:37.300> is<00:00:37.420> that<00:00:37.630> we're<00:00:37.750> saying<00:00:37.930> so<00:00:38.079> it's

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
to what it is that we're saying so it's

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.810 
to what it is that we're saying so it's
to<00:00:38.320> give<00:00:38.469> another<00:00:38.739> level<00:00:39.070> or<00:00:39.309> another<00:00:39.399> layer

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
to give another level or another layer

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.639 
to give another level or another layer
perhaps<00:00:40.120> to<00:00:40.780> what<00:00:40.960> it<00:00:41.079> is<00:00:41.199> that<00:00:41.350> we're<00:00:41.469> saying

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:41.649 
perhaps to what it is that we're saying

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:44.250 
perhaps to what it is that we're saying
to<00:00:41.829> this<00:00:41.949> to<00:00:42.219> the<00:00:42.309> listener<00:00:42.609> but<00:00:43.600> gestures<00:00:44.050> can

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
to this to the listener but gestures can

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.779 
to this to the listener but gestures can
also<00:00:44.410> be<00:00:44.710> at<00:00:44.980> difficult<00:00:45.309> things<00:00:45.550> because

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
also be at difficult things because

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:48.239 
also be at difficult things because
gestures<00:00:46.239> then<00:00:46.390> get<00:00:46.600> all<00:00:46.780> caught<00:00:47.170> up<00:00:47.379> in<00:00:47.679> in

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:48.249 
gestures then get all caught up in in

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:50.099

to<00:01:55.770> be<00:01:55.860> honest<00:01:56.160> but<00:01:56.400> it<00:01:56.790> does<00:01:57.030> serve<00:01:57.300> the

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
to be honest but it does serve the

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.990 
to be honest but it does serve the
function<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.870> explaining<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:59.160> by<00:01:59.490> default

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
function of explaining that by default

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.390 
function of explaining that by default
we<00:02:00.450> will<00:02:00.480> do<00:02:00.840> what<00:02:01.050> somebody<00:02:01.350> does<00:02:01.800> sooner

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
we will do what somebody does sooner

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.760

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
than we'll do what somebody says so if

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.350

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
than what you're saying so when it comes

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.440 
than what you're saying so when it comes
back<00:02:28.710> to<00:02:28.770> gestures<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.550> role<00:02:29.820> modeling<00:02:30.300> when

back to gestures and role modeling when
role<00:02:30.630> modeling<00:02:30.990> is<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.170> important<00:02:31.620> bit<00:02:31.650> and

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
role modeling is the important bit and

role modeling is the important bit and
then<00:02:32.520> it's<00:02:32.640> really<00:02:32.820> important<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.660> we<00:02:33.900> do

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
then it's really important that we do

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.650 
then it's really important that we do
what<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.950> is<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.490> we<00:02:35.640> say<00:02:35.880> there's<00:02:36.240> no<00:02:36.390> point

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
what it is that we say there's no point

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.360 
what it is that we say there's no point
in<00:02:36.780> us<00:02:36.900> giving<00:02:37.290> one<00:02:37.440> message<00:02:37.800> verbally<00:02:38.250> and

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
then doing something completely

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.380 
then doing something completely
