00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
came back gorgeous as it was before I

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.590 
came back gorgeous as it was before I
did<00:01:12.560> use<00:01:12.770> a<00:01:12.860> different<00:01:13.100> conditioner<00:01:13.700> design<00:01:14.150> I

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
did use a different conditioner design I

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.860 
did use a different conditioner design I
use<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:15.560> Pantene<00:01:16.160> for<00:01:17.060> women<00:01:17.270> of<00:01:17.360> color<00:01:17.570> and

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
use the Pantene for women of color and

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:22.240 
use the Pantene for women of color and
the<00:01:18.500> hair<00:01:18.680> does<00:01:18.920> feel<00:01:19.250> a<00:01:19.460> lot<00:01:19.729> a<00:01:19.970> lot<00:01:20.300> softer<00:01:21.250> so

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
the hair does feel a lot a lot softer so

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.430 
the hair does feel a lot a lot softer so
I<00:01:22.280> think<00:01:22.400> just<00:01:22.880> using<00:01:23.420> products<00:01:24.080> women<00:01:24.350> of

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
I think just using products women of

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.469 
I think just using products women of
color<00:01:24.680> is<00:01:24.830> probably<00:01:25.040> gonna<00:01:25.790> work<00:01:26.000> best<00:01:26.270> with

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
color is probably gonna work best with

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.930 
color is probably gonna work best with
this<00:01:26.660> hair<00:01:26.960> because<00:01:27.530> it<00:01:27.830> does<00:01:27.979> tend<00:01:28.280> to<00:01:28.400> dry

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
this hair because it does tend to dry

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.790 
this hair because it does tend to dry
out<00:01:28.970> just<00:01:29.509> like<00:01:29.600> african-american<00:01:30.410> hair<00:01:30.650> so
