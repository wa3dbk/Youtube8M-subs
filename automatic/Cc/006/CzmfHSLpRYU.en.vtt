will retune is the D string here we're

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.670 
will retune is the D string here we're
going<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:21.910> tune<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.300> down<00:02:22.540> one<00:02:22.810> half-step<00:02:23.140> to

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
going to tune that down one half-step to

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.640 
going to tune that down one half-step to
a<00:02:23.709> C<00:02:23.980> sharp<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.580> help<00:02:25.450> me<00:02:25.570> do<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:26.200> press

need to tune down the D string until it

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.480 
need to tune down the D string until it
sounds<00:02:37.090> like<00:02:37.269> that

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
just going to tune it down a whole step

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.530 
just going to tune it down a whole step
and<00:03:45.409> a<00:03:45.469> half<00:03:45.500> step<00:03:45.879> it's<00:03:46.879> going<00:03:47.000> to<00:03:47.090> be<00:03:47.180> an<00:03:47.299> e

and a half step it's going to be an e

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.690 
and a half step it's going to be an e
it's<00:03:47.840> just<00:03:48.049> not<00:03:48.200> going<00:03:48.379> to<00:03:48.439> sound<00:03:48.620> as<00:03:48.739> low<00:03:48.950> but

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
it's just not going to sound as low but

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.449 
it's just not going to sound as low but
when<00:03:49.790> you<00:03:49.879> pluck<00:03:50.120> this<00:03:50.450> e<00:03:50.659> string<00:03:51.230> and<00:03:51.500> tune

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
when you pluck this e string and tune

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.339 
when you pluck this e string and tune
the<00:03:52.640> g<00:03:52.670> string<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.090> sound<00:03:53.359> like<00:03:53.540> that<00:03:53.719> you

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
the g string to sound like that you

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:16.300 
the g string to sound like that you
should<00:03:54.620> be<00:03:54.769> able<00:03:54.859> to<00:03:55.010> tell<00:03:55.280> when<00:03:55.579> you<00:03:55.609> hit<00:03:55.849> an<00:03:55.969> E

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.850 

there<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:17.430> go<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:18.870> next<00:04:19.170> string<00:04:19.380> will<00:04:19.530> retune

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:19.860 
there you go the next string will retune

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.020 
there you go the next string will retune
is<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.820> B<00:04:21.030> string<00:04:21.420> down<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.410> an<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:23.010> we<00:04:24.000> have

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
is the B string down to an a and we have

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.510 
is the B string down to an a and we have
an<00:04:24.420> A<00:04:24.600> up<00:04:24.780> here<00:04:25.050> so<00:04:25.950> we're<00:04:26.100> going<00:04:26.220> to<00:04:26.280> turn<00:04:26.400> our

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
an A up here so we're going to turn our

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:39.620 
an A up here so we're going to turn our
B<00:04:26.730> string<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.300> sound<00:04:27.930> like<00:04:28.140> an<00:04:29.010> A<00:04:29.220> this<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.240> here

there<00:04:51.550> you<00:04:51.639> go<00:04:51.819> not<00:04:52.509> only<00:04:52.659> leaves<00:04:52.930> us<00:04:53.110> one

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:53.469 
there you go not only leaves us one

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:56.070 
there you go not only leaves us one
string<00:04:53.830> we<00:04:53.979> need<00:04:54.129> to<00:04:54.219> retune<00:04:54.610> and<00:04:54.900> that's<00:04:55.900> the

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
string we need to retune and that's the

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.080 
string we need to retune and that's the
high<00:04:56.229> e-string<00:04:56.469> that<00:04:57.340> we<00:04:57.430> need<00:04:57.580> to<00:04:57.669> tune<00:04:57.879> down

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
high e-string that we need to tune down

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.779 
high e-string that we need to tune down
one<00:04:58.449> whole<00:04:58.659> step<00:04:58.810> and<00:04:59.199> a<00:04:59.349> half<00:04:59.379> step<00:04:59.759> to<00:05:00.759> a

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
one whole step and a half step to a

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.749 
one whole step and a half step to a
c-sharp<00:05:01.330> and<00:05:01.599> as<00:05:02.499> you<00:05:02.650> know<00:05:02.800> now<00:05:03.009> we<00:05:03.580> have<00:05:03.729> a

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 
c-sharp and as you know now we have a

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.330 
c-sharp and as you know now we have a
c-sharp<00:05:04.270> right<00:05:04.569> here<00:05:04.900> on<00:05:05.050> our<00:05:05.740> fourth<00:05:06.039> string

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
c-sharp right here on our fourth string

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.820 
c-sharp right here on our fourth string
so<00:05:07.210> we're<00:05:07.300> going<00:05:07.389> to<00:05:07.449> tune<00:05:07.689> down<00:05:07.840> or<00:05:08.050> e<00:05:08.289> until

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
so we're going to tune down or e until

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:19.670 
so we're going to tune down or e until
it<00:05:08.949> sounds<00:05:09.249> like<00:05:09.400> that

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:31.550
