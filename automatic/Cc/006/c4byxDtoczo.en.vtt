g negra though the prototype i drove
didn't<00:02:03.180> give<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.570> impression<00:02:04.040> so<00:02:05.040> how<00:02:05.220> does

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
didn't give that impression so how does

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.790 
didn't give that impression so how does
it<00:02:05.430> drive<00:02:05.700> well<00:02:06.510> at<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.690> moment<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.320> sounds

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
it drive well at the moment it sounds

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.650 
it drive well at the moment it sounds
like<00:02:07.830> a<00:02:07.950> motorboat<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:09.179> feels<00:02:09.420> like<00:02:09.630> a

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
like a motorboat and it feels like a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.840 
like a motorboat and it feels like a
bread<00:02:09.960> van<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.860> designers<00:02:11.370> say<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.610> will<00:02:11.760> be

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
bread van the designers say it will be

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.690 
bread van the designers say it will be
greatly<00:02:12.120> improved<00:02:12.390> by<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.930> end<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.410> year

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
greatly improved by the end of the year

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.160 
greatly improved by the end of the year
certainly<00:02:14.700> if<00:02:14.880> they<00:02:15.150> keep<00:02:15.360> their<00:02:15.540> promises<00:02:15.990> on

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
certainly if they keep their promises on

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.830 
certainly if they keep their promises on
price<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.680> fuel<00:02:17.190> efficiency<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:18.060> will<00:02:18.480> sell

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
price and fuel efficiency it will sell

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.720 
price and fuel efficiency it will sell
you<00:02:19.140> could<00:02:19.800> just<00:02:20.070> be<00:02:20.190> looking<00:02:20.340> at<00:02:20.640> the

you could just be looking at the
