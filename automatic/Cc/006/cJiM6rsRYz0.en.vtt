to use for the floor so as you can see
there's<00:00:19.080> one<00:00:19.230> piece<00:00:19.529> here<00:00:20.570> and<00:00:21.570> I'm<00:00:21.689> using

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
there's one piece here and I'm using

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.230 
there's one piece here and I'm using
tongue<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.439> groove<00:00:22.710> that's<00:00:23.519> just<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.880> personal

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
tongue and groove that's just a personal

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.790 
tongue and groove that's just a personal
preference<00:00:24.510> you<00:00:24.810> don't<00:00:24.990> need<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.350> use<00:00:25.560> that

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
preference you don't need to use that

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.900 
preference you don't need to use that
but<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.730> does<00:00:27.029> prevent<00:00:27.930> any<00:00:28.939> warping<00:00:29.939> or<00:00:31.910> you

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
but it does prevent any warping or you

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.420 
but it does prevent any warping or you
know<00:00:33.000> any<00:00:33.420> unevenness<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.590> keeps<00:00:35.040> it<00:00:35.219> tight

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
know any unevenness it keeps it tight

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.250 
know any unevenness it keeps it tight
and<00:00:35.579> snug<00:00:35.700> together<00:00:36.239> more<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.600> an<00:00:36.690> even<00:00:36.899> flat

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
and snug together more of an even flat

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.740 
and snug together more of an even flat
surface<00:00:37.739> as<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.670> can<00:00:38.940> see<00:00:39.120> I've<00:00:39.270> cut<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
surface as you can see I've cut the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.590 
surface as you can see I've cut the
third<00:00:40.200> piece<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.649> have<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.950> cut<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:42.570> a

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
third piece you have to cut it in to a

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.600 
third piece you have to cut it in to a
four<00:00:42.840> by<00:00:42.960> four<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.710> reason<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.280> is

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
four by four the reason for that is

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.650 
four by four the reason for that is
you're<00:00:44.760> going<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.940> want<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.210> play<00:00:46.610> the

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
you're going to want to play the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.049 
you're going to want to play the
flooring<00:00:48.660> perpendicular<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.800> joists<00:00:50.309> so

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.840 

this<00:00:54.059> way<00:00:54.270> this<00:00:54.510> way<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.050> way<00:00:55.190> but<00:00:56.190> that

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
this way this way in this way but that

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.430 
this way this way in this way but that
wouldn't<00:00:57.149> be<00:00:59.329> so<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.480> need<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.809> rip<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
wouldn't be so you just need to rip the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.979 
wouldn't be so you just need to rip the
one<00:01:01.680> piece<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.370> half<00:01:02.690> there's<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> other<00:01:03.899> half

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
one piece in half there's the other half

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.179 
one piece in half there's the other half
and<00:01:05.180> it's<00:01:06.180> gonna<00:01:06.299> go<00:01:06.510> right<00:01:06.540> there<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:10.439> then

couple<00:01:24.659> things<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.990> point<00:01:25.170> out<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.070> sides

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
couple things to point out on the sides

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.429 
couple things to point out on the sides
here<00:01:26.780> you<00:01:27.780> want<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:27.990> do<00:01:28.340> the<00:01:29.340> nails<00:01:29.579> about<00:01:30.030> a

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
six inches put in two and I used eight

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:54.300 
six inches put in two and I used eight
eight<00:01:43.320> pound<00:01:43.590> nails

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.580 

and<00:01:54.759> I<00:01:54.909> just<00:01:55.119> had<00:01:55.299> one<00:01:55.659> one<00:01:55.899> pound<00:01:56.170> box<00:01:56.439> of

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
and I just had one one pound box of

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.100 
and I just had one one pound box of
nails<00:01:57.340> was<00:01:57.610> just<00:01:58.210> about<00:01:58.420> perfect

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
nails was just about perfect

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.279 
nails was just about perfect
the<00:01:59.590> other<00:01:59.710> trick<00:02:00.569> that<00:02:01.569> I<00:02:01.600> wanted<00:02:01.929> to<00:02:02.049> point

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
the other trick that I wanted to point

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.100 
the other trick that I wanted to point
out<00:02:02.439> is<00:02:02.679> when<00:02:03.609> you're<00:02:03.789> joining<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.840> OSB

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
out is when you're joining the OSB

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.709 
out is when you're joining the OSB
together<00:02:05.710> if<00:02:05.920> you<00:02:06.039> use<00:02:06.250> OSB<00:02:06.819> and<00:02:07.299> as<00:02:07.420> you<00:02:07.569> can

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
together if you use OSB and as you can

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.320 
together if you use OSB and as you can
see<00:02:08.009> this<00:02:09.009> is<00:02:09.190> what<00:02:09.369> it<00:02:09.459> looks<00:02:09.610> like<00:02:09.849> it's<00:02:10.179> got

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
see this is what it looks like it's got

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.420 
see this is what it looks like it's got
a<00:02:10.390> groove<00:02:10.660> on<00:02:10.869> one<00:02:11.080> side<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:14.129> this<00:02:15.129> little

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
a groove on one side and this little

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.059 
a groove on one side and this little
tongue<00:02:16.000> on<00:02:16.269> the<00:02:16.390> other<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:17.230> this<00:02:17.410> tongue<00:02:17.739> just

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
tongue on the other so this tongue just

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.729 
tongue on the other so this tongue just
basically<00:02:18.519> fits<00:02:18.790> inside<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.569> groove<00:02:19.840> but

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
basically fits inside the groove but

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.920 
basically fits inside the groove but
it's<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.280> snug<00:02:21.579> fit<00:02:21.610> so<00:02:22.180> what<00:02:22.329> you<00:02:22.450> want<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.750> do

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
it's a snug fit so what you want to do

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.750 
it's a snug fit so what you want to do
is<00:02:23.920> you<00:02:24.160> want<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:25.019> get<00:02:26.019> a<00:02:26.079> little<00:02:26.760> sledgehammer

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
is you want to get a little sledgehammer

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.650 
is you want to get a little sledgehammer
and<00:02:28.799> use<00:02:29.799> a<00:02:29.829> just<00:02:30.370> a<00:02:30.459> spare<00:02:30.760> two-by-four<00:02:31.420> piece
