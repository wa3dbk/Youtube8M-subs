00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.939 
see this is the missions testing so
green<00:00:47.550> means<00:00:47.579> it'll<00:00:48.359> pass<00:00:48.539> emissions<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
green means it'll pass emissions and

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.090 

with<00:03:18.180> all<00:03:18.330> these<00:03:18.510> icons<00:03:18.720> up<00:03:19.290> here<00:03:19.320> tell<00:03:19.950> you

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:37.570 

I<00:03:31.850> just<00:03:32.850> wanted<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.240> add<00:03:33.830> this<00:03:34.830> thing<00:03:35.130> has<00:03:35.430> its

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
I just wanted to add this thing has its

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.320 
I just wanted to add this thing has its
charts<00:03:38.580> on<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:40.580> like<00:03:41.580> if<00:03:41.730> you're<00:03:41.880> looking<00:03:42.180> at

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
charts on it like if you're looking at

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.880 
charts on it like if you're looking at
the<00:03:43.130> short<00:03:44.130> term<00:03:44.490> fuel<00:03:45.030> trims<00:03:45.500> come<00:03:46.500> down<00:03:46.710> here

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
the short term fuel trims come down here

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.170 
the short term fuel trims come down here
and<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.040> press<00:03:47.280> this<00:03:47.460> little<00:03:47.610> middle<00:03:48.000> button

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
and you press this little middle button

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.590 
and you press this little middle button
here<00:03:48.570> and<00:03:49.340> it<00:03:50.340> shows<00:03:50.550> you<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.790> live<00:03:51.090> moving

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
here and it shows you a live moving

00:03:51.600 --> 00:04:03.660 
here and it shows you a live moving
scale<00:03:55.790> that's<00:03:56.790> pretty<00:03:57.210> neat

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.750 

so<00:04:04.330> if<00:04:04.480> you<00:04:04.600> go<00:04:04.750> down<00:04:04.780> to<00:04:05.230> there's<00:04:06.040> long<00:04:06.400> term

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
so if you go down to there's long term

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:17.229 
so if you go down to there's long term
fuel<00:04:07.090> trims<00:04:08.250> engine<00:04:09.250> rpm

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.879 

speed<00:04:19.549> mass<00:04:20.549> flow

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:46.000 

throughout<00:04:24.889> a<00:04:25.009> position<00:04:25.639> sensor

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.430 

so<00:04:46.610> that's<00:04:46.880> pretty<00:04:47.060> good<00:04:47.210> it's<00:04:47.600> got<00:04:47.750> live

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
so that's pretty good it's got live

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:56.070 
so that's pretty good it's got live
moving<00:04:48.790> charts<00:04:49.790> on<00:04:50.000> it

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.129
