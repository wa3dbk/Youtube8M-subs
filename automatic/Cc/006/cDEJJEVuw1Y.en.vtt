00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:10.599
 accumulators 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.990
 my name is blandi I am a thief for me 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.260
 region and I am also noble of white 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.260
 brown 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.480
 I am a warlord and I would help 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.720
 start being more responsible so that 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.789
 can stay with your house and when here 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.390
 there is 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.399
 many things are the udes I have the udes 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.000
 where did you get them I check many 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.000
 corpses 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.050
 and a warrior but I can not continue 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.150
 living among the woman because you need 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.250
 dragon bones you know to do 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.440
 blacksmith 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.820
 the code of the board of dragons clear 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.450
 I will read it soon 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.360
 it's about dragons that came together 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:10.340
 for something I'm clear that we have here to 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.340
 the aragonian maiden to hot 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.960
 between piles of bows and arrows and Brazil 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.890
 find something terrifying this is a 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.890
 stool heap 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.860
 good for potions yes I guess it's a 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.830
 disgust 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:31.460
 this food needs to be refrigerated and what 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.380
 you are going to do with everything is with good is 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.010
 harder for me to pick up things because 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.440
 I'm in third person mode 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.890
 I do not even try it I'm in third 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.890
 person 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.140
 what do you do I need them in case 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.380
 I need to kill someone urgently I do not 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.110
 I can continue with this I can not go 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.710
 stop thickly turn off the camera I can not 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.710
 I can not 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.090
 I need you to help me, let's see 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.450
 I need to keep this in case I find 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.550
 the obvious power belt 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.610
 this I keep it to change it just 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.970
 increase my reasoning ability 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.569
 these will be very valuable some day 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.230
 I think I can get rid of 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.230
 this 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.180
 I have a bad feeling about this 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.660
 I'm sorry, I'm a damn nobleman of white 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.030
 man and after the speech with Libya alone 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.930
 I think I did not know what I was expecting 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.130
 when he offered to rescue me and now 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:48.610
 who feels this idea 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.610
 good heals and follow it always 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.490
 I used to be adventurous like you but 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.560
 I took a health night class 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.070
 public I took an evening health class 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.070
 public
