00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
scaling mr you want to be tanky so it's

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.889 
scaling mr you want to be tanky so it's

because<00:00:47.050> your<00:00:47.620> queue<00:00:47.980> resets<00:00:48.430> your<00:00:48.520> auto

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
because your queue resets your auto

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.299 
because your queue resets your auto
attack<00:00:49.059> and<00:00:49.329> so<00:00:50.320> you<00:00:50.379> don't<00:00:50.500> really<00:00:51.010> need<00:00:51.250> that

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
attack and so you don't really need that

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.010 
attack and so you don't really need that
much<00:00:51.489> tank<00:00:51.850> speed<00:00:52.120> and<00:00:52.329> you<00:00:52.390> get<00:00:52.540> a<00:00:52.570> text<00:00:52.840> from

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
much tank speed and you get a text from

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:21.410 
much tank speed and you get a text from
BW<00:00:53.590> so<00:00:53.890> I<00:00:54.129> prefer<00:01:06.960> 84<00:01:13.140> route<00:01:14.310> masteries<00:01:18.510> I<00:01:20.369> do

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
BW so I prefer 84 route masteries I do

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.090

nine<00:01:22.420> points<00:01:22.630> in<00:01:22.840> of<00:01:22.990> 9<00:01:23.320> 20<00:01:23.560> 10<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:25.479> is<00:01:26.100> doing

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
nine points in of 9 20 10 this is doing

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.920

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
bunch of stuff in defense you become a

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.030 
bunch of stuff in defense you become a
stanky<00:01:41.650> as<00:01:41.740> possible<00:01:42.159> and<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:44.530> makes<00:01:44.770> take

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:47.030 
and flash away from skill shots and
stuff<00:02:38.859> so<00:02:39.299> it's<00:02:40.299> really<00:02:40.420> good<00:02:44.159> then<00:02:45.159> for<00:02:45.969> items

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
stuff so it's really good then for items

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.979 
stuff so it's really good then for items
in<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.219> season<00:02:48.549> 3<00:02:48.579> jungle<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.269> pretty<00:02:49.900> much

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
in the season 3 jungle I pretty much

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.280 
in the season 3 jungle I pretty much
start<00:02:50.530> machete<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.849> five<00:02:52.209> potions<00:02:52.659> on<00:02:52.900> almost

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
start machete and five potions on almost

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.830 
start machete and five potions on almost
every<00:02:53.709> jungler<00:02:57.239> especially<00:02:58.239> on<00:02:58.299> trundle<00:02:58.719> it

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
every jungler especially on trundle it

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.409 
every jungler especially on trundle it
gives<00:02:59.049> you<00:02:59.230> a<00:02:59.560> lot<00:03:00.040> faster<00:03:00.280> clears<00:03:00.819> because<00:03:01.269> if

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:01.419 
gives you a lot faster clears because if

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:12.599 
gives you a lot faster clears because if
I<00:03:01.510> your<00:03:01.719> queue<00:03:01.989> works<00:03:11.159> so<00:03:12.159> you<00:03:12.219> want<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.519> buy

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
I your queue works so you want to buy

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.649 
I your queue works so you want to buy
like<00:03:12.879> this<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:14.159> this<00:03:15.159> adds<00:03:15.430> 10<00:03:15.939> true<00:03:16.359> damage

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
like this and this adds 10 true damage

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.420 
like this and this adds 10 true damage
on<00:03:16.840> every<00:03:17.079> attack<00:03:17.439> and<00:03:17.739> ten<00:03:18.010> percent<00:03:18.310> more

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
on every attack and ten percent more

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.479 
on every attack and ten percent more
damage<00:03:18.699> so<00:03:19.030> it's<00:03:19.780> your<00:03:19.930> cue<00:03:20.230> you<00:03:20.620> reset<00:03:21.459> your

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
damage so it's your cue you reset your

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.159 
damage so it's your cue you reset your
auto<00:03:21.790> attack<00:03:22.090> timer<00:03:22.329> so<00:03:22.629> you<00:03:22.659> hit<00:03:22.870> it<00:03:22.989> once

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
auto attack timer so you hit it once

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.319 
auto attack timer so you hit it once
then<00:03:23.409> you<00:03:23.560> need<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:23.829> to<00:03:23.980> queue<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.430> you're

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
then you need you to queue and you're

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.360 
then you need you to queue and you're
going<00:03:25.419> to<00:03:25.510> do<00:03:25.659> to<00:03:25.900> two<00:03:26.530> attacks<00:03:26.829> like<00:03:27.129> almost

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
going to do to two attacks like almost

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.890 
going to do to two attacks like almost
at<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.609> same<00:03:27.760> time<00:03:28.000> and<00:03:28.239> you<00:03:28.419> get<00:03:28.569> to<00:03:28.750> shoot

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
at the same time and you get to shoot

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.349 
at the same time and you get to shoot
damage<00:03:29.169> on<00:03:29.319> both<00:03:29.470> so<00:03:29.829> drunk<00:03:30.699> gets<00:03:30.939> pretty<00:03:31.150> fast

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
damage on both so drunk gets pretty fast

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.879 
damage on both so drunk gets pretty fast
