00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hello and welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.150
 black ops two gameplay today 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.120
 not a gameplay from me but from 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.759
 xpg gaming is when we do so that I am not 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.639
 Gameplay had because I hardly firstly 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.690
 played black ops 2 and then had 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.890
 I once had a playful 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.270
 of course , my recording module again 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.430
 not because I played halo before 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.720
 and then I never take live on one 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.050
 because now so beautiful in the cinema record 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.340
 can 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.769
 and then I forgot my 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.930
 recording mode and yes then 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.369
 I am in a good gameplay 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.610
 landed and that were not in the cinema 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.469
 right 126 65 to four or so in seven 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.440
 minutes or so that was it was already 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.530
 not bad i mega good but that was 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.629
 not bad but no, unfortunately 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.920
 that was nothing you do not stop in the cinema and 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.410
 so take your goal of ex cdu 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.550
 gaming thank you for that as well as in 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.320
 the description looks over 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.840
 maybe leave a comment or a 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.879
 abo and yes I have the gameplay myself 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.809
 not seen yet i wanted her 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.420
 Now here's the video 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.800
 because I realized that I was 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.409
 full little moment upload 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.689
 that's because I'm not black ops 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.520
 Do not play good gameplay in the game 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.229
 moment although it really needs to be better 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.490
 I say it gets a lot better 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.430
 there are a few things that stop then 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.780
 mess up 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.330
 yes, I have no black ops 2 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.340
 gameplays I do not always want others 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.409
 use gameplays and yes have threads 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.619
 I do not always and well I have 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.850
 it was meant to be so, yes, if before 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.680
 all the matter with the topics 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.600
 I thought maybe that's the way it is 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.189
 I make live comments more often 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.509
 it's doing so again with facetime and 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.930
 That's because that was really good for me back then 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.970
 on 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.500
 Of course, there were a few people 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.550
 senseless thirsty in the comments 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.050
 have delivered but in the end it was 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.820
 also quite popular is also right 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.620
 many clicks for my relationships and 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.510
 the ratings are also good so if 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.490
 her something like that I wanted so then 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.940
 and sometimes more will upload then upload 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.560
 do you say that please because always so 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.330
 This always comment on theme 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.820
 invent blah like also notes 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.800
 do or so yes I do not know it 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.390
 not so horny police as well 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.890
 like to do but I think so live 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.360
 not really even have to bad 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.100
 I stop to look like it 's fun for me 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.170
 and yet he would be me then I do 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.540
 my new micro ab would have been mine 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.860
 get blue yeti that likes ps too or has 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.709
 maybe a real study micro 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.880
 I have to look just because I 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.250
 In any case, better quality 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.540
 offer and live it comes then 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.220
 so a little easier with him 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.140
 record or even if I skype over 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.450
 is just a lot to record 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.800
 That's why I'll look 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.150
 and yes, but I always thought so 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.590
 bit about what i have in mine 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.330
 childhood should be done in the leisure time 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.180
 have and what you compare to today 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.350
 So I make a difference what the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.950
 We did that before, so I did 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.989
 have two brothers who are much older 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.100
 when I was six seven or so years old 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.200
 approximately 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.150
 and well with those we had earlier 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.260
 always done something and then with me 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.180
 neighbors and with all the people 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.810
 who are here in the village respectively 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.840
 were 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.380
 and yes, we really like it 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.430
 war like to play yes war 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.170
 actually funny because I am yes 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.420
 Nowadays people like to play war 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.950
 do not go out there 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.989
 yes, back then that was how we got here 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.720
 then we have a forest with us 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.600
 sometimes a team had its base in the woods 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.180
 Other team had his base with us 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.280
 the tree house and then it started mach 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.170
 I was fighting through the area 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.280
 sneaked up and then when the opponent 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.280
 seen there one has played dead and dead 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.630
 then the opponent was holding and he has to 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.760
 then back to his base and it was 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.840
 then something like respawn so you could 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.080
 say that I have previously from the 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.960
 investigated which was actually and he have so 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.390
 Real time for us really fat 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.010
 Distributed just as real time 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.870
 and I have to say it honestly 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.820
 Actually, that is sooner 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.070
 you could do something simpler a lot easier 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.140
 You can not do any of these days 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.170
 16-year-old or I do not know if that 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.460
 with children still can 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.840
 to impress with something like that 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.600
 Just say yao, let's go out 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.940
 play war first plasticker who the 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.250
 shoots with laser noise sound gizmos 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.050
 and that is really great and 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.760
 You can not do that today 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.800
 so come early for quite hours 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.340
 you stay outside because you see your people 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.890
 wanted and just played war 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.030
 So I found myself real why you always 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.100
 becomes more demanding in such a 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.920
 regard times quite honestly have fun 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.220
 yes, you can also many simple art and 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.560
 wise and wise man 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.400
 no, of course, not different 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.560
 I believe that way, yes, yes 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.750
 In any case you want to have fun 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.540
 always something extravagant somehow something 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.040
 awkward I am who of you 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.840
 somehow goes out somehow today 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.090
 plays war hide games or something 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.680
 although I could imagine that 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:47.100
 hide but be pretty funny 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.170
 could be that way now so one is older or something 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.120
 but you do not do that anymore 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.590
 the age because you somehow 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.870
 it gets more challenging somehow 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.220
 childish though he does it some things 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.540
 are the maybe kindes but they are 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.790
 also a damn funny 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.020
 So I can never do it myself somehow 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.300
 answer correctly why we always 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.020
 become more demanding 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.720
 and I do not even know why 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.680
 so far are now digressed 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:13.380
 actually wanted to talk about what 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:14.580
 as a child I've done so much 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.700
 always not always so great about a thing 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.440
 Concentrate when televisions count but 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.670
 Well then we come back to know 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.650
 So I did earlier earlier 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:26.400
 really very much very much 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.410
 outside war then played generally 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.560
 Much done with friends outside 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.540
 somehow yes no idea held so 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.100
 this one is described as done 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.470
 We would have our own bar and have 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.270
 Sold to imaginary people and things 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.130
 so it was already funny what 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.940
 you did earlier and then something like that 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.860
 Also not embarrassing because that somehow 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.379
 it was childish 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.699
 when a child was and at a general 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:47.000
 almost nothing embarrassing in the past 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.419
 was 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.800
 So, to be honest, it had to be said earlier 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.319
 everything easier as you have fun 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.110
 it was already schiller it was 

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:58.520
 kinda funnier but well that does 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.080
 I do not believe any more nowadays 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.180
 I personally am not what I am in my age 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.889
 I do not know if that kinda kids 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.030
 again at eight or so or she 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:06.319
 maybe that's just how they will be 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.229
 still playing with their nintendo wii 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:10.939
 everything that is not nintendo wii or 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:13.159
 any console or outside 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:14.419
 really used when 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:15.620
 has any brothers or so 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.939
 could be the yes ask 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.919
 I really find it interesting 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:19.939
 and well how do spend nowadays 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.879
 our time 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:24.830
 We are chilling somewhere with friends 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:27.590
 that was quite great stadtkyller the 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.830
 finance the city chill or us 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:33.020
 celebrate stop so spend today no 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.169
 time and time was just something completely 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.069
 I'm still war games outside 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:38.990
 actually, I think quite a lot 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:40.039
 quite funny , please write in 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.150
 the comments made her so earlier 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:41.870
 because it's for everyone 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.340
 fall interesting 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.870
 maybe that's how they liked it too 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.400
 played and what you had to fix it 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.250
 and so what would be really interesting for example 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.849
 could not leaning through the fence 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.990
 So I hope you liked it 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:52.430
 of which is a rating and writes 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.629
 me the comments like it with you 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.830
 At that time he looked like he did it today 

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:56.830
 compares until next time Zschau
