00:05:17.489 --> 00:05:17.499 
which was made necessary by the much

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:20.489 
which was made necessary by the much

00:05:20.489 --> 00:05:20.499 
thinner built of the s6 edge and when I

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:22.739 
thinner built of the s6 edge and when I
say<00:05:20.709> a<00:05:20.739> decrease<00:05:21.159> I<00:05:21.309> mean<00:05:21.489> from<00:05:21.639> the<00:05:21.819> galaxy<00:05:22.330> s5

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:22.749 
say a decrease I mean from the galaxy s5

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:25.169 
say a decrease I mean from the galaxy s5
but<00:05:23.080> anyway<00:05:23.949> not<00:05:24.279> only<00:05:24.519> that<00:05:24.610> but<00:05:24.819> something

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:25.179 
but anyway not only that but something

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:28.139 
but anyway not only that but something
also<00:05:25.539> went<00:05:25.929> for<00:05:26.259> a<00:05:26.429> unibody<00:05:27.429> design<00:05:27.550> which

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:28.149 
also went for a unibody design which

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:30.779 
also went for a unibody design which
usually<00:05:28.389> translates<00:05:29.199> into<00:05:29.439> a<00:05:29.589> more<00:05:30.309> battery

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:30.789 
usually translates into a more battery

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:32.279 
usually translates into a more battery
because<00:05:30.969> all<00:05:31.419> of<00:05:31.479> this<00:05:31.689> has<00:05:31.869> to<00:05:32.019> be<00:05:32.110> put

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
because all of this has to be put

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.669 
because all of this has to be put
together<00:05:32.439> and<00:05:33.309> it's<00:05:33.429> a<00:05:33.550> much<00:05:33.699> different

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:34.679 
together and it's a much different

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:01.259 
and that because that's because the new
Exynos<00:05:58.869> processor<00:05:59.050> on<00:05:59.949> the<00:06:00.099> basics<00:06:00.759> as<00:06:00.939> I<00:06:01.029> said

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:01.269 
Exynos processor on the basics as I said

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:04.529 
Exynos processor on the basics as I said
earlier<00:06:02.009> is<00:06:03.009> supposed<00:06:03.909> to<00:06:04.029> be<00:06:04.119> more<00:06:04.300> power

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
earlier is supposed to be more power

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:08.069 
earlier is supposed to be more power
efficient<00:06:05.019> than<00:06:05.349> the<00:06:05.429> snapdragon<00:06:06.429> 805<00:06:07.389> of<00:06:07.869> the

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:08.079 
efficient than the snapdragon 805 of the

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:12.629 
efficient than the snapdragon 805 of the
Nexus<00:06:08.949> 6<00:06:09.579> in<00:06:09.849> fact<00:06:10.349> some<00:06:11.349> subsided<00:06:11.889> numbers<00:06:12.429> of

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 
Nexus 6 in fact some subsided numbers of

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.219 
Nexus 6 in fact some subsided numbers of
up<00:06:12.759> to<00:06:12.909> twenty<00:06:13.209> percent<00:06:13.509> more<00:06:13.779> efficient

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
up to twenty percent more efficient

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.259 
up to twenty percent more efficient
which<00:06:14.860> is<00:06:15.099> going<00:06:15.339> to<00:06:15.429> be<00:06:15.519> pretty<00:06:15.729> impressive

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:16.269 
which is going to be pretty impressive

00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:19.259 
which is going to be pretty impressive
considering<00:06:16.539> the<00:06:16.779> dr<00:06:17.229> snapdragon<00:06:18.039> 805<00:06:18.639> is<00:06:18.999> q<00:06:19.240> a

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:19.269 
considering the dr snapdragon 805 is q a

00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:21.869 
considering the dr snapdragon 805 is q a
very<00:06:19.599> recent<00:06:20.079> processor<00:06:20.979> kisses<00:06:21.399> so<00:06:21.579> that's

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:21.879 
very recent processor kisses so that's

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:24.569 
very recent processor kisses so that's
about<00:06:22.029> it<00:06:22.240> we<00:06:22.629> did<00:06:22.869> something<00:06:23.110> galaxy<00:06:23.949> s6<00:06:24.339> edge

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:24.579 
about it we did something galaxy s6 edge

00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:26.819 
about it we did something galaxy s6 edge
work<00:06:24.819> within<00:06:25.119> X<00:06:25.329> with<00:06:25.539> X<00:06:25.749> once<00:06:26.349> again<00:06:26.559> thanks

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:26.829 
work within X with X once again thanks

00:06:26.829 --> 00:06:28.109 
work within X with X once again thanks
for<00:06:26.860> thanks<00:06:27.279> guys<00:06:27.429> for<00:06:27.459> watching<00:06:27.669> this<00:06:27.969> was
