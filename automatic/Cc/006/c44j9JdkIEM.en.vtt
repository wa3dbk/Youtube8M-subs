00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
let's have a look and see how it works

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.669 
let's have a look and see how it works
so<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.490> box<00:00:29.730> here<00:00:30.269> we've<00:00:30.689> got<00:00:30.990> all<00:00:31.470> the

and see what it can do okay so here I
have<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.920> say<00:00:41.930> connect<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.050> up<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.700> let<00:00:44.700> me<00:00:46.700> show

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
have it say connect it up so let me show

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.930 
have it say connect it up so let me show
how<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:47.969> works<00:00:48.469> take<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.590> off<00:00:49.680> here<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.129> we've

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
how this works take it off here so we've

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.240 
how this works take it off here so we've
got<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.449> grip<00:00:52.079> for<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.289> iPad<00:00:52.649> I'll<00:00:52.800> slot<00:00:53.039> near

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
got the grip for the iPad I'll slot near

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.920 
got the grip for the iPad I'll slot near
iPad<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.180> moment<00:00:54.539> then<00:00:55.110> we've<00:00:55.350> got<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:56.930> ball

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
iPad in a moment then we've got a ball

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.439 
iPad in a moment then we've got a ball
joint<00:00:58.230> there<00:00:58.980> which<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.489> contain<00:00:59.910> as<00:01:00.239> well

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
joint there which you contain as well

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.650 
joint there which you contain as well
that's<00:01:01.199> holding<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.829> iPad<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.460> place<00:01:02.730> and

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
that's holding the iPad in place and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.429 
that's holding the iPad in place and
then<00:01:03.780> you've<00:01:03.930> got<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.229> grip<00:01:04.500> here<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:06.409> with<00:01:07.409> a

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
then you've got the grip here and with a

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.399 
then you've got the grip here and with a
screw<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.700> can<00:01:08.960> do<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.170> different

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
screw so that you can do it on different

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.120 
screw so that you can do it on different
thickness<00:01:11.400> poles<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:13.170> think<00:01:13.770> for<00:01:14.010> this

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
thickness poles so I think for this

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.280 
thickness poles so I think for this
example<00:01:14.490> I'm<00:01:14.670> gonna<00:01:14.939> grip<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.689> onto<00:01:15.960> here<00:01:16.140> on

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
example I'm gonna grip it onto here on

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.600 
example I'm gonna grip it onto here on
the<00:01:16.380> side<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.979> just<00:01:19.979> screw<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
the side so you just just screw to the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.770 
the side so you just just screw to the
thickness<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:21.150> need<00:01:23.270> here<00:01:26.509> it's<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.600> pretty

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
thickness you need here it's a pretty

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.920 
thickness you need here it's a pretty
much<00:01:28.049> fit<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.380> anything<00:01:29.119> pop<00:01:30.119> anything<00:01:30.659> that's

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
much fit on anything pop anything that's

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.280 
much fit on anything pop anything that's
round<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.220> grip<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.610> there<00:01:33.049> so<00:01:34.049> there

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
round that it can grip on there so there

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.420 
round that it can grip on there so there
now<00:01:35.250> take<00:01:35.880> my<00:01:36.090> iPad

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.840 

I'm<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.830> in<00:01:43.830> that<00:01:46.370> and<00:01:47.370> they<00:01:47.520> I've<00:01:47.580> got<00:01:47.730> my

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
I'm just in that and they I've got my

you could have a music score program on

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.800 
you could have a music score program on
there<00:01:54.920> look<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.040> understand<00:01:56.580> you<00:01:57.420> could<00:01:57.630> have

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
there look I understand you could have

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.130 
there look I understand you could have
it<00:01:57.960> get<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.470> onto<00:01:58.680> your<00:01:59.250> keyboard<00:02:00.140> mounting

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
it get it onto your keyboard mounting

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.830 
it get it onto your keyboard mounting
system<00:02:01.590> or<00:02:02.150> anything<00:02:03.150> you<00:02:03.330> can<00:02:03.480> grip<00:02:03.690> onto

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
system or anything you can grip onto

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.930 
system or anything you can grip onto
really<00:02:04.650> so<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.130> could<00:02:05.280> use<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.550> for<00:02:05.730> a<00:02:05.760> variety

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
really so you could use it for a variety

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.790 
really so you could use it for a variety
of<00:02:06.210> different<00:02:06.480> ways<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:07.290> flexing<00:02:07.680> off

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
of different ways it's flexing off

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.609 
of different ways it's flexing off
flexible<00:02:08.520> enough<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.940> be<00:02:09.929> able<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.140> position

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
flexible enough to be able to position

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.060 
flexible enough to be able to position
it<00:02:10.740> exactly<00:02:11.120> how<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.180> want<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.570> play<00:02:13.070> and

then getting the iPad out is easy you
can<00:02:15.750> just<00:02:16.280> slide<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.430> out<00:02:17.550> like<00:02:17.880> that<00:02:19.520> so<00:02:20.520> a

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
can just slide it out like that so a

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.030 
can just slide it out like that so a
really<00:02:20.940> nice

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
really nice

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.590 
really nice
I'm<00:02:23.300> very<00:02:24.300> solid<00:02:24.780> in<00:02:25.200> way<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:26.570> matching<00:02:27.570> your

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600
