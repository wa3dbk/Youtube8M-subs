the neck let's turn that switch off play
the<00:01:25.200> same<00:01:25.380> thing<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.130> bridge

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.590 

all<00:01:38.890> right<00:01:39.040> now<00:01:39.520> that<00:01:40.270> we've<00:01:40.360> looked<00:01:40.479> at

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
all right now that we've looked at

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.860 
all right now that we've looked at
controls<00:01:41.050> let's<00:01:41.350> get<00:01:41.530> some<00:01:41.710> sounds<00:01:42.810> okay<00:01:43.810> so

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
controls let's get some sounds okay so

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.570 
controls let's get some sounds okay so
now<00:01:44.140> this<00:01:44.320> is<00:01:44.500> a<00:01:44.530> distortion<00:01:44.950> pedal<00:01:45.100> not<00:01:45.430> an

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
now this is a distortion pedal not an

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.460 
now this is a distortion pedal not an
overdrive<00:01:46.030> pedal<00:01:46.060> so<00:01:46.600> it's<00:01:46.900> definitely<00:01:47.260> got

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
overdrive pedal so it's definitely got

the gain and a little past noon level at

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.850 
the gain and a little past noon level at
about<00:02:29.810> two<00:02:30.260> o'clock<00:02:30.910> highs<00:02:31.910> at<00:02:32.209> about<00:02:32.420> noon

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
about two o'clock highs at about noon

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.839 
about two o'clock highs at about noon
mids<00:02:33.860> at<00:02:33.980> about<00:02:34.190> 11:30<00:02:34.760> lows<00:02:35.750> at<00:02:35.959> about<00:02:36.140> eleven

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
mids at about 11:30 lows at about eleven

00:02:36.849 --> 00:03:15.760 
mids at about 11:30 lows at about eleven
here<00:02:37.849> we<00:02:37.940> go

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.490 

so<00:03:16.770> that's<00:03:16.980> more<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.240> kind<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.959> classic

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
so that's more of a kind of a classic

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.980 
so that's more of a kind of a classic
hard<00:03:19.920> rock<00:03:19.950> sound<00:03:20.400> if<00:03:21.390> I<00:03:21.570> want<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.780> dial

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
hard rock sound if I want to dial

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.840 
hard rock sound if I want to dial
something<00:03:22.380> in<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.530> little<00:03:22.740> more<00:03:22.860> modern<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.640> a

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
something in a little more modern and a

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.000 
something in a little more modern and a
little<00:03:24.060> more<00:03:24.270> metal<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.350> guess

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
little more metal I guess

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.860 
little more metal I guess
turn<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.820> body<00:03:26.970> switch<00:03:27.330> off<00:03:27.540> I'm<00:03:27.750> gonna

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
turn the body switch off I'm gonna

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.350 
turn the body switch off I'm gonna
really<00:03:28.080> crank<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.620> gain<00:03:28.860> scoop<00:03:29.790> out<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.000> mids

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
really crank the gain scoop out the mids

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:58.570 
really crank the gain scoop out the mids
boost<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.870> lows<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.110> little<00:03:31.470> bit

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.080 

okay<00:04:00.860> if<00:04:01.860> I<00:04:01.920> turn<00:04:02.100> the<00:04:02.220> body<00:04:02.370> switch<00:04:02.670> on<00:04:02.880> and

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
okay if I turn the body switch on and

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.250 
okay if I turn the body switch on and
leave<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.300> controls<00:04:03.600> pretty<00:04:03.750> much<00:04:03.990> the<00:04:04.080> same

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
leave the controls pretty much the same

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.810 
leave the controls pretty much the same
I'm<00:04:04.440> going<00:04:04.560> to<00:04:04.620> cut<00:04:04.740> the<00:04:04.860> lows<00:04:05.070> back<00:04:05.340> down<00:04:05.580> and

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
I'm going to cut the lows back down and

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:36.620 
put the cup of highs a little bit put
mids<00:04:09.300> at<00:04:09.570> about<00:04:09.810> noon

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.210 

okay<00:04:37.630> let's<00:04:38.230> listen<00:04:38.380> how<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:38.620> pedal<00:04:38.980> cleans

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
okay let's listen how the pedal cleans

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.500 
okay let's listen how the pedal cleans
up<00:04:39.460> I'm<00:04:39.580> gonna<00:04:39.700> leave<00:04:39.910> the<00:04:40.090> gain<00:04:40.330> at<00:04:40.860> about

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
up I'm gonna leave the gain at about

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.110 
up I'm gonna leave the gain at about
three<00:04:43.510> o'clock<00:04:43.600> and<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:45.400> body<00:04:45.580> switched<00:04:45.940> on

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
three o'clock and the body switched on

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.240 
three o'clock and the body switched on
and<00:04:46.480> I'm<00:04:46.540> gonna<00:04:46.630> manipulate<00:04:47.320> the<00:04:47.800> volume

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
and I'm gonna manipulate the volume

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.680 
and I'm gonna manipulate the volume
control<00:04:48.610> in<00:04:48.790> the<00:04:48.880> bridge<00:04:49.060> position

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
control in the bridge position

00:04:49.690 --> 00:05:13.820 
control in the bridge position
so<00:04:49.930> here's<00:04:50.200> full<00:04:50.680> volume

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.460 

you

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.360 

so<00:05:18.470> as<00:05:18.530> you<00:05:18.650> can<00:05:18.740> hear<00:05:18.800> when<00:05:19.010> I<00:05:19.070> turn<00:05:19.220> the

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
so as you can hear when I turn the

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.250 
so as you can hear when I turn the
volume<00:05:19.400> down<00:05:19.730> the<00:05:20.060> pedal<00:05:20.300> is<00:05:20.390> very<00:05:20.600> responsive

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
volume down the pedal is very responsive

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.890 
volume down the pedal is very responsive
it's<00:05:21.350> very<00:05:21.590> amp<00:05:21.830> like<00:05:22.130> in<00:05:23.060> that<00:05:23.300> way<00:05:23.570> it<00:05:23.750> also

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
it's very amp like in that way it also

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.110 
it's very amp like in that way it also
responds<00:05:24.740> very<00:05:24.860> well<00:05:25.070> to<00:05:25.220> picking<00:05:25.670> dynamics

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
responds very well to picking dynamics

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.250 
responds very well to picking dynamics
which<00:05:26.270> is<00:05:26.420> something<00:05:26.630> you<00:05:26.870> really<00:05:26.960> want<00:05:27.080> to

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
which is something you really want to

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.650 
which is something you really want to
look<00:05:27.350> for<00:05:27.410> in<00:05:27.650> all<00:05:27.740> distortion<00:05:28.190> pedals<00:05:28.660> okay

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
look for in all distortion pedals okay

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.180 
look for in all distortion pedals okay
so<00:05:29.720> that's<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.260> Bloody<00:05:30.650> Mary<00:05:30.950> from<00:05:31.550> t-rex
