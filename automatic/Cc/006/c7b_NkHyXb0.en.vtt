should be president for historical

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.800 
should be president for historical
reasons<00:01:33.340> but<00:01:33.700> also<00:01:33.850> that<00:01:34.149> women<00:01:34.630> are

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
reasons but also that women are

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.679 
reasons but also that women are
naturally<00:01:35.619> better<00:01:36.369> leaders<00:01:36.969> they<00:01:37.209> govern<00:01:37.539> in

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
naturally better leaders they govern in

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:38.819 
naturally better leaders they govern in
a<00:01:37.749> way<00:01:37.869> that's<00:01:38.079> different<00:01:38.109> from<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.529> way<00:01:38.619> men

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
a way that's different from the way men

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.819 
a way that's different from the way men
govern<00:01:39.130> do<00:01:39.219> you<00:01:39.279> think<00:01:39.429> that's<00:01:39.579> true<00:01:40.829> well

govern do you think that's true well
look<00:01:42.009> I<00:01:42.159> think<00:01:42.219> good<00:01:43.179> leadership<00:01:43.569> requires

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
look I think good leadership requires

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.160 
look I think good leadership requires
transparency<00:01:45.159> in<00:01:45.939> candor<00:01:46.509> which<00:01:46.810> Hillary

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
transparency in candor which Hillary

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.769 
transparency in candor which Hillary
Clinton<00:01:47.499> has<00:01:47.950> not<00:01:48.189> displayed<00:01:48.729> I<00:01:48.999> think<00:01:49.689> it

00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:49.779 
Clinton has not displayed I think it

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:51.989 
Clinton has not displayed I think it
requires<00:01:49.929> collaboration<00:01:50.649> which<00:01:51.609> I<00:01:51.880> don't

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:51.999 
requires collaboration which I don't

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:53.940 
requires collaboration which I don't
think<00:01:52.179> she's<00:01:52.509> particularly<00:01:52.959> displayed<00:01:53.649> I

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
think she's particularly displayed I

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.489 
think she's particularly displayed I
think<00:01:54.490> it<00:01:54.579> also<00:01:54.729> requires<00:01:55.359> a<00:01:55.509> track<00:01:56.020> record<00:01:56.200> of

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:56.499 
think it also requires a track record of

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:58.469 
think it also requires a track record of
accomplishment<00:01:57.249> and<00:01:57.369> honestly<00:01:57.880> she<00:01:58.149> doesn't

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
accomplishment and honestly she doesn't

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.319 
accomplishment and honestly she doesn't
have<00:01:58.630> much<00:01:58.869> so<00:01:59.289> while<00:01:59.950> I<00:01:59.979> certainly<00:02:00.819> think<00:02:01.119> a

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
have much so while I certainly think a

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.209 
have much so while I certainly think a
woman<00:02:01.479> is<00:02:01.749> capable<00:02:01.959> of<00:02:02.380> being<00:02:02.590> president<00:02:03.039> and

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
woman is capable of being president and

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:05.519 
woman is capable of being president and
I<00:02:03.579> will<00:02:03.909> probably<00:02:04.090> be<00:02:04.539> running<00:02:04.719> for<00:02:05.079> president

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:05.529 
I will probably be running for president

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:07.949 
I will probably be running for president
and<00:02:05.649> a<00:02:05.740> few<00:02:05.950> short<00:02:06.130> weeks<00:02:06.369> I<00:02:06.669> also<00:02:07.450> think<00:02:07.840> that

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
and a few short weeks I also think that

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.779 
and a few short weeks I also think that
gender<00:02:08.319> shouldn't<00:02:08.830> be<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.099> basis<00:02:09.490> upon<00:02:09.580> which

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
gender shouldn't be the basis upon which

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.120 
gender shouldn't be the basis upon which
we<00:02:10.149> make<00:02:10.330> that<00:02:10.539> decision<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:11.140> that's<00:02:11.349> why<00:02:11.560> if

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
we make that decision and that's why if

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.490 
we make that decision and that's why if
Hillary<00:02:12.520> Clinton<00:02:12.880> faces<00:02:13.090> me<00:02:13.510> on<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.810> general
