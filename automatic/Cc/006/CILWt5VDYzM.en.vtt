00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.400
 Without a doubt, it was the great surprise of 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.040
 past three is the final remake 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.260
 fantasy 7 finally announced something that 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.480
 many players we had been waiting 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.280
 we had been dreaming for a long time 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.870
 with a game like that but well this is not 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.910
 the news now the news now 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.730
 it's precisely new information about 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.070
 of this remake of final fantasy 7 and it's 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.680
 that apparently square enix would be 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.730
 Experimenting with the combat system 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.740
 of this final fantasy 7 remake something that 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.899
 has pissed off some users in the 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.660
 networks and eyes rightly because obviously 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.940
 it's a game that you have a lot of 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.280
 love especially the original is not a 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.329
 combat system and others in turns 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.850
 that essence purely a role was of 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.530
 those times not of those years and 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.840
 that on this occasion, it does upset 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.030
 so much maybe you can get away from the 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.489
 original experience obviously not us 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.280
 they are going to put exactly the same system 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.110
 of fights in turns but attentive to what 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.300
 what the 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.000
 the guys specifically has been maybe 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.250
 the one who has talked about this the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.130
 producer of final fantasy 7 remake on 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.440
 Mr. Yoshinori Kitase, he said 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.020
 We are starting to see the address 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.640
 visual that is going to have the game we are 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.950
 now he is working on your system 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.470
 combat in a trial and error phase 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.390
 eye because the word error has appeared 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.880
 something that the truth is that it surprises me 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.390
 much with the company the name the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.070
 word error in front of the one that puts it 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.780
 side of a game that is developing 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.640
 which is supposed to say 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.229
 good things to generate more confidence 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.910
 in the users but here also it 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.119
 demonstrates the confidence they already have in 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.830
 if the users in this remake 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.690
 precisely because they love the original and 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.850
 They are looking forward to seeing it but not good 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.410
 it also says how the possibility exists 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.630
 that the battle system 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.460
 old commands could not work 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.590
 today we are thinking a lot about 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.720
 the kind of direction we can take 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.970
 the truth is that they do not have it very clear 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.100
 it also says normally when you make a 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.860
 remake comes to resemble more a game 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.680
 action role 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.899
 so we are studying what we can 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.480
 what can we do with a final fantasy 7 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.160
 to surprise the players by 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.260
 both boys and girls I from here not 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.590
 you were asked a question what do you think 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.780
 about this that they focus it much more 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.640
 action not think it's pulling 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.650
 what is going to be even final fantasy 15 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.600
 I think it's going to be that basically the 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.030
 combat system that will have this 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.459
 remake of final fantasy 7 you want that 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.400
 I really would have it so to speak 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.070
 bring that turn-based fight that the 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.820
 first delivery sorry the final fantasy 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:43.280
 7 original this time to the remake or 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.470
 you think it's good experimental is 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.870
 good to adapt the combat system as 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.090
 well they say something with more action not 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.850
 something to what would be more a role play 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.410
 of the current generation we will be 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.850
 to see what is it that they do 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.740
 the truth is that I'm a little bit I do not know 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.590
 it gives me a little bit of fear what they can 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:07.069
 do with that combat system 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.069
 but there is a lot of desire for life
