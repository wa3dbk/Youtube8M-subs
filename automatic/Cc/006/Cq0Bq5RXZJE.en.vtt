00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:04.620 
what a little small I mean like okay
this<00:03:57.640> is<00:03:57.780> perfect<00:03:58.780> see<00:03:59.370> about<00:04:00.370> this<00:04:00.700> wine<00:04:03.630> okay

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
this is perfect see about this wine okay

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.730 
this is perfect see about this wine okay
so<00:04:04.690> this<00:04:05.380> is<00:04:05.590> how<00:04:05.770> it<00:04:05.830> looks<00:04:05.890> compared<00:04:06.610> to<00:04:06.820> it

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
so this is how it looks compared to it

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:17.910 
so this is how it looks compared to it
see<00:04:10.470> below<00:04:11.490> its<00:04:12.510> left<00:04:13.510> library<00:04:15.600> so<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:17.709> want

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
see below its left library so you want

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.000 
see below its left library so you want
to<00:04:18.160> make<00:04:18.190> sure<00:04:19.200> that's<00:04:20.200> a<00:04:20.500> little<00:04:20.530> longer

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
to make sure that's a little longer

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:30.420 
to make sure that's a little longer
though<00:04:21.450> so<00:04:22.450> you<00:04:22.900> just<00:04:23.200> tape<00:04:23.620> it<00:04:28.980> then<00:04:29.980> you<00:04:30.130> cut

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
though so you just tape it then you cut

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.940 
though so you just tape it then you cut
it<00:04:30.660> by<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.720> size<00:04:32.140> of<00:04:32.290> one<00:04:33.450> okay<00:04:34.590> know<00:04:35.590> that<00:04:35.800> you

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
it by the size of one okay know that you

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.410 
it by the size of one okay know that you
have<00:04:36.070> this<00:04:36.310> you<00:04:36.630> just<00:04:38.550> like<00:04:39.550> cut<00:04:39.940> it<00:04:40.060> into<00:04:40.240> a

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
have this you just like cut it into a

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:45.580 
have this you just like cut it into a
blade<00:04:40.720> shape<00:04:43.140> so

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
blade shape so

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:55.360 
blade shape so
then<00:04:46.590> you<00:04:46.879> just<00:04:47.879> tape<00:04:48.270> that<00:04:48.569> side

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.550 

all<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:56.639> way

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:14.870 

and<00:05:00.680> then<00:05:01.550> you<00:05:02.330> do<00:05:02.690> be<00:05:03.020> on<00:05:03.169> their<00:05:03.410> side

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:25.840 

ok<00:05:15.840> so<00:05:16.790> just<00:05:17.790> tape<00:05:18.150> it

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.010 

so<00:05:26.850> now<00:05:27.350> looks<00:05:28.350> like

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
so now looks like

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.719 
so now looks like
she<00:05:30.680> looks<00:05:30.949> something<00:05:31.340> like<00:05:31.550> this<00:05:33.520> this<00:05:34.520> is

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
she looks something like this this is

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.390 
she looks something like this this is
why<00:05:34.910> I'd<00:05:35.060> recommend<00:05:35.389> using<00:05:35.720> oil<00:05:36.169> because<00:05:36.710> if

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
why I'd recommend using oil because if

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.100 
why I'd recommend using oil because if
you<00:05:37.550> did<00:05:37.789> it<00:05:37.910> all<00:05:38.060> the<00:05:38.090> way<00:05:38.330> to<00:05:38.389> the<00:05:38.599> tip<00:05:38.900> it

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
you did it all the way to the tip it

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.869 
you did it all the way to the tip it
looks<00:05:39.139> like<00:05:39.409> crap<00:05:39.889> but<00:05:41.860> well<00:05:42.860> not<00:05:43.370> like<00:05:43.580> wrap

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:43.879 
looks like crap but well not like wrap

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:47.469 
looks like crap but well not like wrap

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:44.360 

okay<00:07:40.430> and<00:07:41.430> just<00:07:41.460> take<00:07:41.940> it<00:07:42.530> it<00:07:43.530> helps<00:07:43.830> lock<00:07:44.159> up

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:44.370 
okay and just take it it helps lock up

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:52.159 
okay and just take it it helps lock up
more<00:07:44.639> that<00:07:44.940> looks<00:07:45.150> pretty<00:07:45.389> good<00:07:48.050> so

00:07:52.159 --> 00:07:52.169 

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:54.810 

this<00:07:52.830> is

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:54.820 
this is

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:57.320 
this is
so

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:57.330 
so

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:02.990 
so
comes<00:07:58.020> out<00:07:58.259> easily<00:07:58.470> but<00:07:59.430> it<00:07:59.819> still<00:08:00.180> lacks<00:08:02.000> now

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.000 
comes out easily but it still lacks now

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.029 
comes out easily but it still lacks now
