00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:15.530
 or the virus videos as they are are 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:18.690
 welcome to a new video tutorial 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.750
 where will I show you a new roma stop 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.090
 for the poster because one is rom comes 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.820
 preloaded with some applications that 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.810
 They are very useful for our device 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.420
 friends 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.640
 the creator of this rom is a friend 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.640
 called cristian arteaga that has 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.440
 kissed been your role to my channel so 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.359
 let's create subscriptions 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.399
 so next summer that is the 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:44.839
 estimate of the rom 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.839
 so let's go to the excavation 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.360
 good friends already within our 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.739
 device what we would have to do 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.739
 is to turn it off 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.920
 where we can hope it is poor 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.430
 completely 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.100
 ok after that we would enter what 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:12.200
 would be the recovery mode using the 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:14.680
 volume key up and power us 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.680
 we push 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.869
 but uncertain that communicates ok when 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.270
 they get us we have a new record 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:29.659
 we decided the first one that would be where 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.020
 it says white datafactory reset that it 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.880
 it highlights limited perfect reset it 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.400
 we would give in the power button to 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:43.120
 select we give would give me very is 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.950
 I would not give it because he already did it and then 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.810
 of that we go to whatever the part 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.140
 where it says advanced that in the last 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.780
 official part here is chris evans 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.380
 we go there and we would go to the part says 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.540
 uy pedal big h we would give you there and you 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.970
 we would give in the part where it says yes 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.810
 wilde albÃ­n cachete I will not do it because 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.750
 ya luisa ok after that of haberte 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.840
 sometime we will go out in 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.800
 this menu and in this menu we will go to 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.360
 go where it says go back we go out and 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.570
 we go to the part where it says 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.230
 instance are dedicate we are here 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:26.380
 we go to the first option that 18 are 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.330
 scenic or that the new one here we're going to 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.610
 the folder where we have saved 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.590
 our rom in this case I have it in 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.140
 the root of the sd 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.760
 ok it's called the rom it's called this 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.750
 we would be power button to select 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:47.050
 in the installs docks area I will not do it 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:51.430
 because he says ok after that the 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.980
 phone will start to install it and 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.650
 we will wait a while that is would be the 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.019
 the installation or that there is no 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.240
 progress the phone will restart 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.569
 normal way 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.379
 A) Yes 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.659
 and you will see that the img animation that is the 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.499
 that it brings from the factory will change and now 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:12.499
 it will be this 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.050
 and as you can see it changes 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:29.709
 while you restart your phone you can 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.930
 be that it takes longer because it's the first 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.600
 time the phone starts with that 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.330
 Red 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.390
 that there are friends 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.480
 that's all from part of the installation and 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:47.160
 see you to see the review of how he has 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.410
 Goodbye good friends , we have already 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.290
 installed the rom and this is the interface 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.120
 of how it looks like you can see it can be 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.950
 that if you have not changed it 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.110
 be the same and see that it has not changed 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.220
 nothing but the icons have changed as 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:06.570
 those that would be from galleries and these two 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.850
 applications these are these two 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.880
 I told him that they are essential for our 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.240
 Android device that error we 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.870
 allows to manage 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.389
 some files that with a browser 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:25.789
 normal browser does not allow it 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:30.470
 also this is not the control it serves to 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:33.330
 see how it is 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:38.720
 on that phone 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.720
 to see if it is performing well 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.110
 also as you can see has changed what 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.510
 which is the notification bar more 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.750
 pretty 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:53.070
 you can distinguish well and also I 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:56.400
 I feel that this is very fluid and I think that 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:59.529
 my friend cristian has made a good 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.430
 I work with this course 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:04.820
 as well 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:09.440
 the android model of this rom is 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:13.110
 still and day 4.4 points 2 kitkat as 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.230
 can see and is very good 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.970
 so we'll see each other until the next 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.440
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:24.440
