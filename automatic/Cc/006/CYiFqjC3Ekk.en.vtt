00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.480
 hello youtube friends here then with a 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.410
 new video and a new news and that is 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.719
 good today to be a filter because the 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.230
 added that will have the new 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.699
 playstation 4 update 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.730
 First, I tell you that it will be the 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.199
 2.5 update on the rumors 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.380
 they commented that it was going to be in the 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:31.070
 3.0 update but it has not been confirmed 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.680
 what would be 2.5 and so good what are 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.050
 the additions that will bring you comment not 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.870
 they are great this added but they are 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.450
 interesting the first is that you're going to 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:46.309
 to be able to delete from your trophy section 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.440
 games which you have in 0% to what 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.480
 I mean for example if you got off a 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.969
 game from playstation clubs that at 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.550
 you better not play it in the beginning and not 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.160
 you liked it just because you already left it 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.809
 to play all those games that 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.809
 better you did not get even a single trophy 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:06.710
 they are registered in the section 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.350
 where your trophies come and they remain in 0% 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.090
 the games are going to be erasable and 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.460
 this mostly worked for the best 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.740
 for people who are hunters of 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.260
 trophies that they like to talk about their 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.540
 games like this let's see your record of 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.880
 trophies are no longer going to be spotted with 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.280
 a game to which you did not take any 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.710
 trophy or I think to take out and so you're going to 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.810
 be able to fly this 0% second 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.119
 feature that they will add is that 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.310
 good the option to be play this option 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.820
 where you can share a game to 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.039
 a friend so you can enjoy it without 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.080
 that you have it physically if you do not know 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:45.350
 we can continue to lend so to speak 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.320
 online will already allow the 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.330
 games run at 60 frames per second 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.310
 obviously this also after 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.950
 will depend a lot on your connection to 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.360
 internet and the latest and the most 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.610
 interesting of all these 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.149
 characteristics that are going to add is that 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.700
 you are going to add the sleep mode as 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.429
 it is this suspension mode well it is 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.770
 that now let's say you can be 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.830
 playing some video game that you 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.810
 for example I do not know about the two you are not 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.700
 playing but you need to get out a couple of 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.790
 this is what you are going to be able to do 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.490
 is to pause the game and put in 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.620
 sleep mode the playstation 4 what 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.720
 does the sleep mode is that it's not going 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.940
 to close the application or it is not going to 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.970
 close the game just say let's put 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.030
 to playstation 4 in hibernation mode and 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.300
 when you play the playstation will resume 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.820
 right where you left the game I do not know to 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.440
 where you pause when you put 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.320
 learn the playstation you will appear 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.480
 that first image then is the 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.950
 difference let's say to the rest mode that 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.460
 is another option that also has the 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.950
 playstation 4 that the sleep mode you 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.140
 closes applications and in the case of 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.390
 suspend mode will not close them 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.640
 where after good is also a good 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.040
 added this I already understand that already what 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.380
 did both the foot speed and also what 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.400
 does the playstation vita where after 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.950
 Good thing it also reaches 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.720
 playstation 4 so far then 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.530
 good are the characteristics that have 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.360
 commented 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.459
 that are going to be added in this 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.410
 update I do not know if they are the only 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.840
 but for the moment it is what they have 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.550
 commented so good friends like 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.350

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.350
 news and until the next video
