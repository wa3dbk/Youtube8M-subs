I guess I'm kind of with the Christian

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.030 
I guess I'm kind of with the Christian
Right<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.020> Catholics<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.650> stuff<00:02:24.890> I

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
Right and the Catholics and stuff I

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.790 
Right and the Catholics and stuff I
guess<00:02:25.070> I<00:02:25.790> think<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.960> Christmas<00:02:27.200> is<00:02:27.590> a

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
guess I think that Christmas is a

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.950 
guess I think that Christmas is a
religious<00:02:28.220> holiday<00:02:28.330> it's<00:02:29.330> not<00:02:29.540> secular

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
religious holiday it's not secular

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.000 
religious holiday it's not secular
enough<00:02:30.350> for<00:02:30.590> me

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
enough for me

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.060 
enough for me
but<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.220> think<00:02:31.280> it's<00:02:32.620> still<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.680> Christian

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
but I think it's still a Christian

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.750 
but I think it's still a Christian
holiday<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:36.500> probably<00:02:36.950> should<00:02:37.160> be<00:02:37.370> a

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
holiday and probably should be a

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.900 
holiday and probably should be a
Christian<00:02:38.240> holiday<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:40.100> I<00:02:40.250> think<00:02:40.459> Hanukkah

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
Christian holiday and I think Hanukkah

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.330 
Christian holiday and I think Hanukkah
is<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:41.930> Jewish<00:02:42.020> holiday<00:02:42.410> it<00:02:42.800> probably<00:02:43.130> should

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
is a Jewish holiday it probably should

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.300 
is a Jewish holiday it probably should
be<00:02:43.520> a<00:02:43.760> Jewish<00:02:44.150> holiday<00:02:44.470> I'm<00:02:45.470> trying<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.190> be
