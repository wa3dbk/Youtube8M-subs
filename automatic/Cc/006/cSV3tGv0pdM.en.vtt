00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
it's very huge I think it's a you know

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.460 
it's very huge I think it's a you know
because<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.150> don't<00:02:27.450> think<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.840> Middle<00:02:28.110> East<00:02:28.260> as

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470

any<00:02:28.620> different<00:02:28.740> from<00:02:29.100> India<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:29.730> think<00:02:30.300> we<00:02:30.750> have

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
any different from India I think we have

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.420 
any different from India I think we have
a<00:02:30.870> huge<00:02:31.230> amount<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.650> connect<00:02:31.980> in<00:02:32.070> terms<00:02:32.280> of

around<00:02:48.300> now<00:02:48.570> but<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.760> as<00:02:51.180> business<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:51.810> think

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
around now but and as business I think

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.800 
around now but and as business I think
it's<00:02:52.140> extremely<00:02:52.680> important<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.370> my<00:02:54.360> last<00:02:54.540> film

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
it's extremely important I my last film

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.990 
it's extremely important I my last film
my<00:02:54.930> name<00:02:55.050> is<00:02:55.170> Khan<00:02:55.380> and<00:02:55.860> also<00:02:56.370> even<00:02:56.490> round<00:02:56.760> I

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
my name is Khan and also even round I

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.280 
my name is Khan and also even round I
think<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.690> bulk<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.170> business

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
think the bulk of the business

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.260 
think the bulk of the business
internationally<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.580> from<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.000> Middle<00:03:00.210> East

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
internationally is from the Middle East

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.510 
internationally is from the Middle East
and<00:03:00.560> people<00:03:01.560> seem<00:03:01.770> to<00:03:01.830> like<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.190> film<00:03:02.340> they

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
and people seem to like the film they

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.980 
and people seem to like the film they
enjoy<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.850> music<00:03:03.210> and<00:03:04.100> it<00:03:05.100> becomes<00:03:05.520> a<00:03:05.780> if<00:03:06.780> your

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
enjoy the music and it becomes a if your

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.360 
enjoy the music and it becomes a if your
film<00:03:07.200> does<00:03:07.410> well<00:03:07.710> in<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:07.980> Middle<00:03:08.280> East

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
film does well in the Middle East

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.940 
film does well in the Middle East
chances<00:03:09.180> are<00:03:09.300> that<00:03:09.330> internationally<00:03:10.020> it<00:03:10.740> has

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
chances are that internationally it has

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.010 
chances are that internationally it has
kind<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.220> done<00:03:11.400> extremely<00:03:12.270> well<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.720> it's<00:03:12.870> not

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
kind of done extremely well and it's not

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.300 
kind of done extremely well and it's not
only<00:03:13.170> true<00:03:13.320> for<00:03:13.350> Bollywood<00:03:13.800> films<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.130> think

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
only true for Bollywood films I think

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.610 
only true for Bollywood films I think
it's<00:03:14.430> true<00:03:14.550> for<00:03:14.580> any<00:03:15.330> film<00:03:15.600> to<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:16.320> know<00:03:16.440> so

it's true for any film to you know so

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.110 
it's true for any film to you know so
I'm<00:03:16.950> sure<00:03:17.130> people<00:03:17.430> like<00:03:17.700> Mission<00:03:18.030> Impossible

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
them all of them are very

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:18.320 
them all of them are very
internationally<00:05:17.520> honed<00:05:17.729> in<00:05:17.849> terms<00:05:18.060> of<00:05:18.240> what

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
internationally honed in terms of what

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.420 
internationally honed in terms of what
they<00:05:18.449> want<00:05:18.599> to<00:05:18.629> do<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:19.020> they<00:05:19.650> have<00:05:19.830> I<00:05:20.340> think

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
they want to do and they have I think

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.129

the<00:05:20.699> talent<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:21.210> the<00:05:21.330> creativity<00:05:21.629> of<00:05:21.960> any

international artist in any aspect even
technically<00:05:25.229> I<00:05:25.349> think<00:05:25.409> so<00:05:26.069> it's<00:05:26.250> your<00:05:26.400> choice

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
technically I think so it's your choice

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.700 
technically I think so it's your choice
if<00:05:27.270> you<00:05:27.419> don't<00:05:27.569> mind<00:05:27.750> spending<00:05:27.870> nine<00:05:28.440> months

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
if you don't mind spending nine months

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.890 
if you don't mind spending nine months

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
do it I like staying back home with the

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:34.459 
do it I like staying back home with the
kids<00:05:32.969> so<00:05:33.240> if<00:05:33.750> they<00:05:33.840> call<00:05:33.990> me<00:05:34.080> four<00:05:34.229> nine<00:05:34.319> ten

months<00:05:34.620> I'm<00:05:34.830> a<00:05:34.860> little<00:05:35.130> odd<00:05:35.219> you<00:05:36.180> have<00:05:36.300> said

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
months I'm a little odd you have said

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.490 
months I'm a little odd you have said
that<00:05:37.039> script<00:05:38.039> writers<00:05:38.490> need<00:05:38.699> to<00:05:38.880> change<00:05:39.500> to

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
that script writers need to change to

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.589 
that script writers need to change to
appeal<00:05:40.800> to<00:05:40.979> the<00:05:41.069> international<00:05:41.340> audience<00:05:41.969> do

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
appeal to the international audience do

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:43.790 
appeal to the international audience do
you<00:05:42.690> think<00:05:42.900> this<00:05:43.050> is<00:05:43.229> the<00:05:43.319> process<00:05:43.710> of

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
you think this is the process of

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.879 
you think this is the process of
evolution<00:05:44.069> or<00:05:44.669> do<00:05:45.090> you<00:05:45.180> think<00:05:45.240> it<00:05:45.599> will<00:05:45.889> stay

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
evolution or do you think it will stay

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:49.550 
evolution or do you think it will stay
as<00:05:47.099> it<00:05:47.130> is<00:05:47.659> screenplay<00:05:48.659> actually<00:05:49.080> is<00:05:49.229> a<00:05:49.259> very

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
as it is screenplay actually is a very

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.809 
as it is screenplay actually is a very
scientific<00:05:49.710> process<00:05:50.340> you<00:05:50.460> know<00:05:50.580> and<00:05:50.610> I<00:05:50.759> think

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:50.819 
scientific process you know and I think

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:52.790 
scientific process you know and I think
in<00:05:51.330> India<00:05:51.630> we<00:05:51.779> do<00:05:51.930> require<00:05:52.289> to<00:05:52.469> make<00:05:52.620> it<00:05:52.770> a

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
in India we do require to make it a

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.170 
in India we do require to make it a
little<00:05:52.979> more<00:05:53.250> scientific<00:05:53.490> than<00:05:53.789> it<00:05:53.909> is<00:05:54.029> right

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
little more scientific than it is right

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.909 
little more scientific than it is right
now<00:05:54.389> and<00:05:54.599> not<00:05:55.289> only<00:05:55.319> just<00:05:55.650> for

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
now and not only just for

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.439 
now and not only just for
internationalism<00:05:56.520> just<00:05:56.759> to<00:05:56.849> be<00:05:56.940> able<00:05:57.060> to<00:05:57.270> make

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
internationalism just to be able to make

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.779 
internationalism just to be able to make
good<00:05:57.569> films<00:05:57.719> back<00:05:58.229> home<00:05:58.409> it's<00:05:59.099> the<00:05:59.279> core<00:05:59.550> the

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
good films back home it's the core the

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.279 
good films back home it's the core the
content<00:06:00.210> the<00:06:00.330> writing<00:06:00.690> is<00:06:00.810> the<00:06:00.930> core<00:06:01.139> of

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
content the writing is the core of

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.350 
content the writing is the core of
making<00:06:01.590> a<00:06:01.680> film<00:06:01.919> and<00:06:02.069> the<00:06:02.699> more<00:06:02.849> you<00:06:02.969> can<00:06:03.120> learn

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
making a film and the more you can learn

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.959 
making a film and the more you can learn
see<00:06:03.930> the<00:06:04.139> the<00:06:04.620> western<00:06:05.279> film<00:06:05.460> industry<00:06:05.849> has

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:05.969 
see the the western film industry has

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:08.269 
see the the western film industry has
been<00:06:06.180> a<00:06:06.240> little<00:06:06.479> ahead<00:06:06.690> in<00:06:06.810> terms<00:06:06.990> of<00:06:07.279> making

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:08.279 
been a little ahead in terms of making

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:09.950 
been a little ahead in terms of making
it<00:06:08.520> scientific<00:06:08.969> I<00:06:09.210> think<00:06:09.569> there's<00:06:09.690> a<00:06:09.750> huge

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
it scientific I think there's a huge

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.170 
it scientific I think there's a huge
learning<00:06:10.139> curve<00:06:10.319> for<00:06:10.889> Indian<00:06:11.190> films<00:06:11.460> to<00:06:11.969> just

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
learning curve for Indian films to just

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.240 
learning curve for Indian films to just
go<00:06:12.300> and<00:06:12.419> see<00:06:12.629> how<00:06:12.900> they<00:06:13.080> hone<00:06:13.319> up<00:06:13.349> writers<00:06:13.830> they

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
go and see how they hone up writers they

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.830 
go and see how they hone up writers they
keep<00:06:14.400> on<00:06:14.550> producing<00:06:14.969> new<00:06:15.090> writers<00:06:15.449> what<00:06:15.750> are

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
keep on producing new writers what are

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.999 
keep on producing new writers what are
the<00:06:15.900> opportunities<00:06:16.169> there's<00:06:16.680> get<00:06:16.830> what<00:06:16.919> are

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:17.009 
the opportunities there's get what are

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:19.459 
the opportunities there's get what are
the<00:06:17.099> schooling<00:06:17.490> they<00:06:17.610> get<00:06:17.840> so<00:06:18.840> I<00:06:18.900> think<00:06:18.960> having

00:06:19.459 --> 00:06:19.469 
the schooling they get so I think having

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:21.890 
the schooling they get so I think having
institutions<00:06:20.129> like<00:06:20.310> that<00:06:20.520> and<00:06:20.699> would<00:06:21.690> only

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
institutions like that and would only

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.999 
institutions like that and would only
not<00:06:22.169> only<00:06:22.349> help<00:06:22.500> Bollywood

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009 
not only help Bollywood

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:24.260 
not only help Bollywood
I<00:06:23.039> think<00:06:23.460> it'll<00:06:23.580> also<00:06:23.699> help<00:06:23.940> us<00:06:24.120> go

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
I think it'll also help us go

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.670 
I think it'll also help us go
international<00:06:24.750> like<00:06:24.840> you<00:06:24.960> say<00:06:25.110> so<00:06:25.529> I<00:06:25.560> think

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
international like you say so I think

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.080 
international like you say so I think
yeah<00:06:25.889> that's<00:06:26.069> that's<00:06:26.250> a<00:06:26.370> department<00:06:26.879> which<00:06:26.969> I

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.090 
yeah that's that's a department which I

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.260 
yeah that's that's a department which I
feel<00:06:27.419> is<00:06:27.629> a<00:06:28.080> little<00:06:28.319> weak<00:06:28.650> even<00:06:29.520> now<00:06:29.699> I<00:06:30.000> think

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
feel is a little weak even now I think

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.019 
feel is a little weak even now I think
we<00:06:30.659> still<00:06:30.840> right<00:06:31.770> from<00:06:32.009> the<00:06:32.129> heart<00:06:32.279> I<00:06:32.520> think<00:06:32.849> we

00:06:33.019 --> 00:06:33.029 
we still right from the heart I think we

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:34.519 
we still right from the heart I think we

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.219 
think
they'll<00:06:41.090> be<00:06:41.180> bigger<00:06:41.389> exposure<00:06:41.780> there'll<00:06:42.110> be<00:06:42.139> a

they'll be bigger exposure there'll be a

they'll be bigger exposure there'll be a
different<00:06:42.560> language<00:06:42.740> and<00:06:43.220> it's<00:06:43.550> time<00:06:43.759> I<00:06:43.789> think

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
different language and it's time I think

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.939 
different language and it's time I think
Indians<00:06:44.569> started<00:06:44.720> doing<00:06:45.050> that<00:06:45.199> you're<00:06:45.830> also

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:45.949 
Indians started doing that you're also

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:48.189 
Indians started doing that you're also
very<00:06:46.580> accomplished<00:06:47.120> businessman<00:06:47.900> and

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 
very accomplished businessman and

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.659 
very accomplished businessman and
recently<00:06:48.919> of<00:06:49.099> course<00:06:49.160> you<00:06:49.460> have<00:06:49.639> your

recently of course you have your

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:52.330 
recently of course you have your
animation<00:06:50.479> studio<00:06:50.990> how<00:06:51.560> important<00:06:52.130> do<00:06:52.250> you

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:52.340 
animation studio how important do you

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.029 
animation studio how important do you
think<00:06:52.639> that<00:06:53.060> is<00:06:53.300> and<00:06:53.780> do<00:06:54.380> you<00:06:54.470> think<00:06:54.680> it<00:06:54.800> can

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 
think that is and do you think it can

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.040 
think that is and do you think it can
compete<00:06:55.550> with<00:06:55.610> the<00:06:55.880> likes<00:06:56.030> of<00:06:56.270> Pixar<00:06:56.780> and

compete with the likes of Pixar and
Disney<00:06:57.080> I'm<00:06:58.009> hardly<00:06:58.580> a<00:06:58.669> businessman<00:06:59.270> actually

00:06:59.620 --> 00:06:59.630 
Disney I'm hardly a businessman actually

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:01.960 
Disney I'm hardly a businessman actually
I<00:06:59.660> I<00:07:00.229> just<00:07:00.440> do<00:07:00.770> things<00:07:01.250> which<00:07:01.490> I<00:07:01.610> feel<00:07:01.819> like

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:01.970 
I I just do things which I feel like

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.850 
I I just do things which I feel like
doing<00:07:02.210> so<00:07:02.750> I<00:07:02.780> have<00:07:02.900> a<00:07:02.960> cricket<00:07:03.229> team<00:07:03.319> I<00:07:03.710> have<00:07:03.830> a

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:03.860 
doing so I have a cricket team I have a

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.159 
doing so I have a cricket team I have a
production<00:07:04.190> house<00:07:04.460> and<00:07:04.759> I<00:07:05.240> have<00:07:05.360> a<00:07:05.389> VFX<00:07:05.780> 2d<00:07:06.050> I'm

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:06.169 
production house and I have a VFX 2d I'm

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:07.990 
production house and I have a VFX 2d I'm
very<00:07:06.349> interested<00:07:06.949> in<00:07:07.250> visual<00:07:07.520> effects<00:07:07.789> I

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 
very interested in visual effects I

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.370 
very interested in visual effects I
think<00:07:08.300> that<00:07:08.599> would<00:07:08.750> be<00:07:08.780> the<00:07:08.900> next<00:07:09.229> step

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:09.380 
think that would be the next step

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.320 
think that would be the next step
forward<00:07:09.680> for<00:07:09.770> India<00:07:10.009> and<00:07:10.190> we<00:07:11.000> do<00:07:11.090> it<00:07:11.210> much

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.330 
forward for India and we do it much

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.629 
forward for India and we do it much
cheaper<00:07:11.650> if<00:07:12.650> you<00:07:12.710> can<00:07:12.919> do<00:07:13.009> it<00:07:13.099> all<00:07:13.190> the<00:07:13.280> quality

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 
cheaper if you can do it all the quality

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:15.909 
cheaper if you can do it all the quality
and<00:07:14.090> I<00:07:14.690> think<00:07:14.900> Raman<00:07:15.199> kind<00:07:15.409> of<00:07:15.530> proved<00:07:15.770> that

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 
and I think Raman kind of proved that

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:18.219 
and I think Raman kind of proved that
that<00:07:16.490> we<00:07:16.610> are<00:07:16.729> able<00:07:16.970> to<00:07:17.240> make<00:07:17.509> special<00:07:17.930> effects

00:07:18.219 --> 00:07:18.229 
that we are able to make special effects

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:21.089 
that we are able to make special effects
visual<00:07:18.530> effects<00:07:18.860> indigenously<00:07:19.729> of<00:07:20.509> the<00:07:20.690> world

00:07:21.089 --> 00:07:21.099 
visual effects indigenously of the world

00:07:21.099 --> 00:07:23.320 
visual effects indigenously of the world
standard<00:07:22.099> and<00:07:22.250> I<00:07:22.639> think<00:07:22.819> it's<00:07:22.940> important

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:23.330 
standard and I think it's important

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.760 
standard and I think it's important
because<00:07:23.449> technically<00:07:24.080> your<00:07:24.229> films<00:07:24.470> have<00:07:24.500> to

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:24.770 
because technically your films have to

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.890 
because technically your films have to
keep<00:07:24.919> moving<00:07:25.069> forward<00:07:25.370> I<00:07:25.699> work<00:07:26.300> for<00:07:26.449> 20<00:07:26.690> years

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:26.900 
keep moving forward I work for 20 years

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.149 
keep moving forward I work for 20 years
and<00:07:27.110> I<00:07:27.259> don't<00:07:27.440> know<00:07:27.530> what<00:07:27.680> I'm<00:07:27.800> going<00:07:27.949> to<00:07:28.039> give

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:28.159 
and I don't know what I'm going to give

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:29.649 
and I don't know what I'm going to give
back<00:07:28.340> to<00:07:28.849> the<00:07:28.970> film<00:07:29.150> industry<00:07:29.270> which<00:07:29.630> has

00:07:29.649 --> 00:07:29.659 
back to the film industry which has

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:31.719 
back to the film industry which has
given<00:07:29.900> me<00:07:30.020> so<00:07:30.289> much<00:07:30.440> so<00:07:30.979> one<00:07:31.159> of<00:07:31.190> the<00:07:31.340> aspects

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:31.729 
given me so much so one of the aspects

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:34.149 
given me so much so one of the aspects
which<00:07:31.819> I<00:07:31.940> like<00:07:32.180> is<00:07:32.360> a<00:07:32.870> visual<00:07:33.560> effects<00:07:33.830> and<00:07:33.979> I'm

00:07:34.149 --> 00:07:34.159 
which I like is a visual effects and I'm

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:36.100 
which I like is a visual effects and I'm
hoping<00:07:34.550> I'm<00:07:35.000> able<00:07:35.300> to<00:07:35.419> build<00:07:35.599> it<00:07:35.690> up<00:07:35.780> to<00:07:35.840> such

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.110 
hoping I'm able to build it up to such

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.010 
hoping I'm able to build it up to such
an<00:07:36.229> extent<00:07:36.620> that<00:07:37.090> three<00:07:38.090> four<00:07:38.300> years<00:07:38.389> down<00:07:38.599> the

an extent that three four years down the

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.930 
an extent that three four years down the
line<00:07:39.050> the<00:07:39.710> best<00:07:39.919> visual<00:07:40.099> effects<00:07:40.490> come<00:07:40.699> out<00:07:40.819> of

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:40.940 
line the best visual effects come out of
