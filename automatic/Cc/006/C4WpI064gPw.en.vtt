the breed and really it's not at that
point<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.170> matters<00:01:34.530> whether<00:01:34.710> they<00:01:34.979> buy<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
point that it matters whether they buy a

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.670 
point that it matters whether they buy a
puppy<00:01:35.520> from<00:01:35.850> me<00:01:36.060> or<00:01:36.150> not<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:37.350> be<00:01:37.380> very

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
puppy from me or not so be very

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.280 
puppy from me or not so be very
important<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.430> go<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.329> an<00:01:39.540> experienced

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
important to go to an experienced

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.260 
important to go to an experienced
breeder<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.920> think<00:01:41.369> that's<00:01:41.549> one<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.970> most

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
breeder I think that's one of the most

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.030 
breeder I think that's one of the most
important<00:01:42.960> things<00:01:43.229> because<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.829> have<00:01:44.009> a

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
important things because you have a

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.520 
important things because you have a
background<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.850> wealth<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.479> information<00:01:45.720> and

background of wealth of information and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.090 
background of wealth of information and
knowledge<00:01:47.509> which<00:01:48.509> most<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.259> them<00:01:49.439> are<00:01:49.590> very

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
knowledge which most of them are very

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.139 
knowledge which most of them are very
willing<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.670> share<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.560> you<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:53.009> also<00:01:53.939> an

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
willing to share and you have also an

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.450 
willing to share and you have also an
immense<00:01:54.509> amount<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:55.229> aftercare<00:01:55.860> from<00:01:56.219> them

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
immense amount of aftercare from them

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.700 
immense amount of aftercare from them
you<00:01:57.450> know<00:01:57.570> if<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.810> run<00:01:58.020> into<00:01:58.290> problems
