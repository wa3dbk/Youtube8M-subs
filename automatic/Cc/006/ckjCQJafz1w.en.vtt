00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.480
 hi how are you gave this opportunity 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.430
 I wanted to talk to you about what I am 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.680
 eating my diet lately to win 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.850
 muscle size quickly without 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.710
 need to even take 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.640
 supplements 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.210
 all right 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.730
 supplements is very important 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.369
 because casually they need give us the 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.800
 extra contribution we need to get there 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.559
 to build our muscles 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.300
 they take a normal diet eating things 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.300
 normal we can achieve to have a 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.000
 important change in the body 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:47.610
 that we are going to go directly to 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.600
 degree of these 112 bananas and two 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.899
 bananas 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.360
 or three or four eggs without the 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:58.280
 clear the yolks of the yellow part no 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.170
 with this contribution of proteins 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.330
 important plus the potassium consume of the 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.140
 banana and banana will make us 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.120
 each company said very well with 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.920
 We are going to add a lot of anguish 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.240
 little royal jelly that knows how to make a 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.640
 video dedicated especially the family 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.820
 real because the truth since I met 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.740
 this product the amount of advantages 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.390
 how could I explain it of energy that 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.090
 They have given is really amazing 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.490
 midmorning we can with a plate of 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.510
 pasta in a pasta dish as per 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.470
 example 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.150
 aircraft spaghetti videos 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.040
 and also it is not 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.020
 with this we will still achieve 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.090
 emphasize more energy we concentrate it 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.700
 more we can contribute very carbohydrates 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.110
 high considering that one 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.230
 one plate of spaghetti dish 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.970
 good noodles gives us 70 for 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.850
 hundred of carbohydrates that we're on 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.850
 day or be a pretty explosive energy 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.399
 We can after training by 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.789
 now ideal to train would be between the 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:07.440
 midday past noon you can 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.330
 train or lunch time 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.550
 it would be good to eat coffee 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.560
 if you are a vegetarian or you are 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.860
 a person who does not have as much taste with 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.280
 the red meat as is a steak in addition 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.520
 cow beef core that yes no 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.890
 you tolerate well the fish fish 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.230
 fatty remember that the fish 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.230
 fatty for more than the word of day of 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.930
 cases that are good fats I always 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.370
 I recommend in this channel I think that 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.860
 everyone already knows tuna and sardines 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:44.250
 they are always fish excellent fish 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.650
 fatty states considered blue times 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.330
 blue which are not going to give a contribution 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.740
 protein vitamin 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.030
 very high very interesting and that the truth 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.780
 to say it without turns is going to 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.350
 build muscles 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.360
 in the snack to take in the snack 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.970
 good in the snack I recommend them 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.740
 eat something light if something that we 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.690
 prepare for dinner but let us leave 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.820
 with hunger I sing for just 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.330
 they vacation obstinately with America like this 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.570
 which can be a small salad a 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:22.230
 Pieces of fruits can be pears can 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.630
 be oranges can be banana 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.630
 again banana 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.100
 there may be several things but the fruits 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.020
 alone will not constitute us 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.120
 muscle will improve what is 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.040
 our immune system what are 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.260
 our vitamins the energies what 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.450
 is our force field against 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.400
 diseases and others at the same time we 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.730
 will provide more energy 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.400
 final cereals is very important this 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.049
 pin is very good but it is expensive to 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.790
 most countries but it's very 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.319
 good because you see a lot of fiber too 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.690
 that helps since they are going to move the body 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.550
 the bowel movements and so on 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.010
 you can put milk skim milk 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.000
 skimmed milk are like the days in your 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.680
 country 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.490
 towards the dinner that we have eaten as the 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.630
 back although there are people who 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.150
 based on that then they go to sleep 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.330
 between 6 to 8 hours is convenient is a 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.940
 strong food this can not 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.920
 against produced because if we have 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.110
 many meals but taken at night 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.140
 it's going to cost us more sleep 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.730
 to cost to fall asleep if there 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.510
 people who go to bed and spend a 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.430
 hour or up to two hours and can not sleep 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.330
 and in many cases you do not know what it is 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.849
 just for the stomach food 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.729
 for consequent they have to if you go to 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:42.069
 eat heavy food at night what you do 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.050
 but accompanying with something light by 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:46.479
 example live also let's eat no 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:49.240
 let's drink cold water do not have cold water 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:52.360
 we have something more or less the temperature 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.159
 environment a cube or others 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.379
 if you are one of the people who eat strong 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:05:00.360
 like stuffed pasta cannelloni and more 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:00.360
 that as is a moderate amount 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.490
 I'm opting for the moment with 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.639
 soy milanesas that although they are not 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.449
 complete proteins are very good 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:13.220
 because they satisfy or leave me satisfied 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:14.870
 together with a small salad and the 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.759
 I'm really ready with the card for the 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.729
 another day of the city and without having 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:21.919
 stomach problems if 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.319
 well I hope you count these 10 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:27.560
 actions will ultimately serve them if more 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:29.780
 that this would be a diet 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.460
 and remember that for example in the 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.350
 citrus fruits to eat your tree a juice 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.480
 orange can do it but away from 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.820
 the food always for the juice justly 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.300
 when falling very acid makes it more 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:45.940
 quick the description then so much 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.940
 juices like milk away from food 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.580
 good old that you consult or if 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.289
