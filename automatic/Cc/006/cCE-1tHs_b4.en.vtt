sort of came into the Covenant barracks
here<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:23.779> I'm<00:00:24.779> just<00:00:24.990> gonna<00:00:25.580> go<00:00:26.580> check<00:00:26.970> out<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
here and I'm just gonna go check out the

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.029 
here and I'm just gonna go check out the
other<00:00:27.510> side<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.900> main<00:00:28.080> base<00:00:28.349> which<00:00:28.769> is

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
other side of the main base which is

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.669 
other side of the main base which is
this<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.609> main<00:00:29.789> base<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:31.289> other<00:00:31.410> side

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
this is the main base so the other side

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:41.139 
this is the main base so the other side
would<00:00:31.890> be<00:00:32.070> over<00:00:32.309> here

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.600 

and<00:00:41.719> here<00:00:42.350> is<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:43.010> mine<00:00:43.309> some<00:00:44.059> locusts<00:00:44.660> and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
and here is the mine some locusts and

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.830 
and here is the mine some locusts and
this<00:00:46.610> appears<00:00:46.910> to<00:00:47.000> be<00:00:47.090> a<00:00:47.120> recent<00:00:47.360> covenant

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
this appears to be a recent covenant

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.170 
this appears to be a recent covenant
mining<00:00:48.079> operation<00:00:48.680> may<00:00:49.039> have<00:00:49.190> must<00:00:49.910> to<00:00:50.030> use

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
mining operation may have must to use

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.639 
mining operation may have must to use
these<00:00:50.329> locusts<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:50.930> mine<00:00:51.079> out<00:00:51.230> that<00:00:51.410> Hill

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
these locusts to mine out that Hill

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.500 
these locusts to mine out that Hill
where<00:00:52.339> they<00:00:52.550> found<00:00:52.790> might<00:00:53.000> be<00:00:53.149> the<00:00:53.239> reason

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
where they found might be the reason

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.229 
where they found might be the reason
they're<00:00:53.629> gone<00:00:53.780> I<00:00:54.489> guess<00:00:55.489> I<00:00:55.610> don't<00:00:55.670> really<00:00:55.910> need

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
they're gone I guess I don't really need

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.060 
they're gone I guess I don't really need
this<00:00:56.390> base<00:00:56.719> schematic<00:00:57.379> anymore<00:00:57.800> I'm<00:00:57.890> just

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
this base schematic anymore I'm just

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.549 
this base schematic anymore I'm just
gonna<00:00:58.159> get<00:00:59.149> some<00:00:59.390> of<00:00:59.449> these<00:00:59.510> plasma<00:00:59.839> batteries

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
gonna get some of these plasma batteries

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.229 
gonna get some of these plasma batteries
here<00:01:00.979> I<00:01:03.100> mean<00:01:04.100> here's<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.460> locust<00:01:04.879> and<00:01:05.089> uh

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
here I mean here's the locust and uh

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.680 
here I mean here's the locust and uh
think<00:01:05.750> you<00:01:05.840> heard<00:01:06.080> just<00:01:06.229> some<00:01:06.649> kind<00:01:06.860> right<00:01:07.690> so

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
torches yep or you want you can use the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:21.190 
torches yep or you want you can use the
plasma<00:01:14.360> batteries<00:01:16.780> yes<00:01:19.780> torches<00:01:20.780> go<00:01:21.050> down

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
plasma batteries yes torches go down

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.760 
plasma batteries yes torches go down
this<00:01:21.350> cave<00:01:22.509> this<00:01:23.509> is<00:01:23.570> basically<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.320> Covenant

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
this cave this is basically the Covenant

this cave this is basically the Covenant
mining<00:01:25.070> operation<00:01:26.590> because<00:01:27.590> you<00:01:27.679> know<00:01:27.800> this

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
mining operation because you know this

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.540 
mining operation because you know this
is<00:01:28.159> my<00:01:28.520> evolved<00:01:29.270> so<00:01:30.039> they're<00:01:31.039> mining<00:01:31.399> this

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
is my evolved so they're mining this

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.710 
is my evolved so they're mining this
