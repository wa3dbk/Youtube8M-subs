so<00:01:00.620> Tim<00:01:00.859> tell<00:01:01.219> me<00:01:01.370> why<00:01:01.640> is<00:01:01.699> this<00:01:02.600> lift

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
so Tim tell me why is this lift

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.620 
so Tim tell me why is this lift
demonstrating<00:01:04.460> this<00:01:04.549> limitation<00:01:05.059> look<00:01:05.420> like

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
demonstrating this limitation look like

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.420 
demonstrating this limitation look like
well<00:01:06.259> there's<00:01:06.560> an<00:01:06.680> interaction<00:01:06.950> that<00:01:07.340> occurs

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
well there's an interaction that occurs

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.550 
well there's an interaction that occurs
between<00:01:07.939> the<00:01:08.509> corona<00:01:08.869> wire<00:01:09.080> which<00:01:09.320> runs

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
between the corona wire which runs

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.380 
between the corona wire which runs
around<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.890> top<00:01:10.100> and<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.670> foil<00:01:10.970> underneath

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
around the top and the foil underneath

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.960 
around the top and the foil underneath
yeah<00:01:12.049> and<00:01:12.290> there's<00:01:12.530> a<00:01:12.619> 3<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.040> 4<00:01:13.220> centimeter<00:01:13.729> air

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
yeah and there's a 3 to 4 centimeter air

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.389 
yeah and there's a 3 to 4 centimeter air
gap<00:01:14.240> in<00:01:14.479> between<00:01:14.630> there<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.380> literally<00:01:16.009> a

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
gap in between there and literally a

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.539 
gap in between there and literally a
high-voltage<00:01:17.060> electric<00:01:17.810> field<00:01:18.140> occur

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
high-voltage electric field occur

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.070 
high-voltage electric field occur
there's<00:01:19.549> been<00:01:19.700> some<00:01:19.880> controversy<00:01:20.090> is<00:01:20.750> this<00:01:20.930> an

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
there's been some controversy is this an

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.139 
there's been some controversy is this an
eye<00:01:21.259> on<00:01:21.289> great<00:01:21.649> effect<00:01:22.009> is<00:01:22.580> it<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:22.970> high

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
eye on great effect is it the high

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.120 
eye on great effect is it the high
voltage<00:01:23.180> literally<00:01:24.049> taking<00:01:24.380> air<00:01:24.590> molecules

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
voltage literally taking air molecules

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.550 
voltage literally taking air molecules
with<00:01:25.430> it<00:01:25.610> and<00:01:25.850> creating<00:01:26.180> an<00:01:26.240> upward<00:01:26.509> for<00:01:26.750> us<00:01:26.869> or

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
with it and creating an upward for us or

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.380 
with it and creating an upward for us or
something<00:01:28.009> more<00:01:30.250> nobody<00:01:31.250> knows<00:01:31.520> for<00:01:31.550> sure<00:01:31.789> how

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
something more nobody knows for sure how

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.260 
something more nobody knows for sure how
the<00:01:32.450> lift<00:01:32.810> of<00:01:32.960> flies<00:01:33.229> but<00:01:34.159> one<00:01:34.399> popular<00:01:34.940> theory

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
the lift of flies but one popular theory

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.210 
the lift of flies but one popular theory
is<00:01:35.569> that<00:01:35.630> high<00:01:36.050> voltage<00:01:36.440> current<00:01:36.770> flows

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
is that high voltage current flows

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.730 
is that high voltage current flows
between<00:01:37.429> the<00:01:37.759> wires<00:01:38.319> suspended<00:01:39.319> on<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.470> top

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
between the wires suspended on the top

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.399 
between the wires suspended on the top
of<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:39.979> craft<00:01:40.250> through<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:41.299> end<00:01:41.479> down<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.319> the

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
of the craft through the end down to the

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.760 
of the craft through the end down to the
aluminium<00:01:42.649> foil<00:01:43.310> wrapped<00:01:43.700> around<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:44.179> frame

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
aluminium foil wrapped around the frame

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.469 
aluminium foil wrapped around the frame
the<00:01:45.770> current<00:01:46.250> literally<00:01:46.880> drags<00:01:47.240> air

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
the current literally drags air

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.930 
the current literally drags air
molecules<00:01:48.080> down<00:01:48.350> with<00:01:48.619> it<00:01:48.850> creating<00:01:49.850> a

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
molecules down with it creating a

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.960 
molecules down with it creating a
downforce<00:01:50.539> called<00:01:51.319> an<00:01:51.530> iron<00:01:51.920> winds<00:01:52.190> which

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
downforce called an iron winds which

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.630 
downforce called an iron winds which
provides<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.659> thrusts<00:01:54.200> needed<00:01:54.679> to<00:01:55.130> lift<00:01:55.369> the

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
provides the thrusts needed to lift the

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.620 
provides the thrusts needed to lift the
airframe<00:01:56.119> skywards<00:01:57.759> this<00:01:58.759> technology<00:01:59.479> not

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
airframe skywards this technology not

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.419 
airframe skywards this technology not
just<00:01:59.780> the<00:02:00.110> lifter<00:02:00.440> but<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.709> social<00:02:00.979> scope<00:02:01.280> of

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:01.429 
just the lifter but the social scope of

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:03.550 
just the lifter but the social scope of
technologies<00:02:02.030> is<00:02:02.509> almost<00:02:02.869> like<00:02:03.080> looking<00:02:03.259> at

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
technologies is almost like looking at

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.319 
technologies is almost like looking at
the<00:02:03.770> internal<00:02:04.130> combustion<00:02:04.579> engine<00:02:04.909> back<00:02:05.210> in

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
the internal combustion engine back in

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.660 
the internal combustion engine back in
the<00:02:05.390> 1800's<00:02:06.020> we're<00:02:06.710> trying<00:02:06.979> to<00:02:07.100> take<00:02:07.310> it<00:02:07.490> and

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
the 1800's we're trying to take it and

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.729 
the 1800's we're trying to take it and
say<00:02:08.090> look<00:02:08.329> these<00:02:08.539> are<00:02:08.600> real<00:02:08.989> technologies

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
say look these are real technologies

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.830 
say look these are real technologies
they<00:02:10.009> have<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.280> same<00:02:10.549> flaws<00:02:11.000> that<00:02:11.390> any<00:02:11.690> other

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
they have the same flaws that any other

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.840 
they have the same flaws that any other
technology<00:02:12.109> does<00:02:12.620> but<00:02:13.280> hopefully<00:02:13.670> they<00:02:13.790> can

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
technology does but hopefully they can

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.569 
technology does but hopefully they can
do<00:02:14.060> things<00:02:14.239> out<00:02:14.510> of<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.630> technologies<00:02:15.140> can't

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:15.579 
do things out of the technologies can't

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.220 
do things out of the technologies can't
so<00:02:16.579> do<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:16.820> think<00:02:17.060> what<00:02:17.239> we're<00:02:17.480> watching<00:02:17.690> here

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
so do you think what we're watching here

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.170 
so do you think what we're watching here
could<00:02:18.650> be<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.920> modest<00:02:19.310> beginnings<00:02:19.910> of<00:02:20.090> a

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
could be the modest beginnings of a

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.349 
could be the modest beginnings of a
whole<00:02:20.420> new<00:02:20.840> industry<00:02:21.470> I<00:02:21.850> think<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:22.970> lifter<00:02:23.329> is

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:23.359 
whole new industry I think the lifter is

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.930 
whole new industry I think the lifter is
literally<00:02:23.989> sort<00:02:24.590> of<00:02:24.680> like<00:02:24.799> the<00:02:24.950> tricycle<00:02:25.579> and

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
literally sort of like the tricycle and

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.460 
literally sort of like the tricycle and
it<00:02:26.329> may<00:02:26.510> not<00:02:26.630> end<00:02:26.870> up<00:02:26.989> becoming<00:02:27.200> the

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
it may not end up becoming the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.380 
it may not end up becoming the
technology<00:02:28.130> that<00:02:28.160> builds<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:28.670> starships<00:02:29.239> of

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
technology that builds the starships of
