00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
oil cooler is bypassed but it needs to

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.319 
oil cooler is bypassed but it needs to
be<00:00:32.180> replaced<00:00:32.920> and<00:00:33.920> the<00:00:34.520> car<00:00:34.700> needs<00:00:34.879> rust<00:00:35.120> work

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
be replaced and the car needs rust work

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.209 
be replaced and the car needs rust work
on<00:00:35.660> the<00:00:35.780> bottom<00:00:36.140> it's<00:00:36.440> certainly<00:00:36.710> really<00:00:36.980> good

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
on the bottom it's certainly really good

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:39.840 
on the bottom it's certainly really good
for<00:00:37.460> a<00:00:37.520> 115<00:00:38.090> body<00:00:38.329> here<00:00:38.660> in<00:00:38.750> the<00:00:38.840> Northeast<00:00:39.260> but

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
for a 115 body here in the Northeast but

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.520 
for a 115 body here in the Northeast but
needs<00:00:40.850> total<00:00:41.030> restoration<00:00:41.480> and<00:00:42.050> this<00:00:42.410> is

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
needs total restoration and this is

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.760 
needs total restoration and this is
going<00:00:42.650> to<00:00:42.710> be<00:00:42.829> my<00:00:42.980> project<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:44.440> this<00:00:45.440> car<00:00:45.650> was

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
going to be my project so this car was

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.060 
going to be my project so this car was
not<00:00:45.890> originally<00:00:46.400> black<00:00:46.610> this<00:00:47.090> is<00:00:47.150> a<00:00:48.070> poorly

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
not originally black this is a poorly

aged of a 20 year old mako paint job so

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.010 
aged of a 20 year old mako paint job so
it<00:00:53.390> was<00:00:53.480> originally<00:00:53.989> maroon<00:00:54.350> but<00:00:55.250> actually<00:00:56.120> it

mechanically<00:01:06.979> sorted<00:01:07.369> out<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:07.610> interior<00:01:07.820> is

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
mechanically sorted out the interior is

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.700 
mechanically sorted out the interior is
pretty<00:01:08.149> good<00:01:08.479> I'll<00:01:08.930> show<00:01:09.079> you<00:01:09.170> that<00:01:11.710> doors

pretty good I'll show you that doors

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.169 
pretty good I'll show you that doors
that<00:01:12.890> still<00:01:13.070> open<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:13.490> close<00:01:13.670> like<00:01:13.700> a<00:01:13.939> bank

00:01:14.169 --> 00:01:14.179 
that still open and close like a bank

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:18.699

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
backing out of the driveway there and

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.649 
backing out of the driveway there and
sounds<00:01:21.219> it<00:01:22.219> sounds<00:01:22.549> incredibly<00:01:23.090> weak<00:01:23.359> so<00:01:23.600> I'm

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
sounds it sounds incredibly weak so I'm

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.709 
sounds it sounds incredibly weak so I'm
gonna<00:01:23.780> have<00:01:24.020> to<00:01:25.179> put<00:01:26.179> a<00:01:26.209> new<00:01:26.329> one<00:01:26.450> in<00:01:26.569> there

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
gonna have to put a new one in there

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.059 
gonna have to put a new one in there
this<00:01:27.649> is<00:01:27.829> a<00:01:27.979> 72<00:01:28.880> 220<00:01:29.630> D<00:01:29.779> that<00:01:30.020> is<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.319> OM<00:01:30.740> six

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:31.069 
this is a 72 220 D that is the OM six

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:33.519 
this is a 72 220 D that is the OM six
one<00:01:31.249> five<00:01:31.429> engine<00:01:31.909> with<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.529> four-speed

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:33.529 
one five engine with the four-speed

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:36.760 
one five engine with the four-speed
manual<00:01:33.560> transmission<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:35.590> linkage<00:01:36.590> there

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
manual transmission the linkage there

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.169 
manual transmission the linkage there
needs<00:01:36.979> a<00:01:37.039> little<00:01:37.279> bit<00:01:37.459> of<00:01:37.520> work<00:01:37.729> but<00:01:37.999> I've

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
needs a little bit of work but I've

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.089 
needs a little bit of work but I've
never<00:01:38.659> felt<00:01:38.869> a<00:01:38.990> more<00:01:39.139> solid<00:01:39.469> shifting<00:01:39.799> car<00:01:39.950> in

00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:40.099 
never felt a more solid shifting car in

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.539 
never felt a more solid shifting car in
the<00:01:40.189> world

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
the world

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.300 
the world
I<00:01:40.639> mean<00:01:40.789> it's<00:01:40.909> just<00:01:41.029> that<00:01:41.950> that<00:01:42.950> shift<00:01:43.219> linkage

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
I mean it's just that that shift linkage

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.179 
I mean it's just that that shift linkage
just<00:01:43.759> feels<00:01:43.939> awesome<00:01:44.149> I<00:01:44.859> guess<00:01:45.859> I<00:01:45.950> need<00:01:46.130> some

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
just feels awesome I guess I need some

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.749 
just feels awesome I guess I need some
floor<00:01:46.490> work<00:01:46.929> interiors<00:01:47.929> pretty<00:01:48.049> good<00:01:48.759> Bobby's

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
floor work interiors pretty good Bobby's

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.899 
floor work interiors pretty good Bobby's
pretty<00:01:49.909> good<00:01:50.149> for<00:01:50.389> a<00:01:50.420> northeastern<00:01:51.349> car

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
pretty good for a northeastern car

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.069 
pretty good for a northeastern car
mechanically<00:01:52.909> it's<00:01:53.029> still<00:01:53.299> more<00:01:53.749> or<00:01:53.840> less<00:01:53.929> on

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
mechanically it's still more or less on

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.089 
mechanically it's still more or less on
the<00:01:54.139> unknown<00:01:54.439> side<00:01:54.709> but<00:01:54.859> I<00:01:54.889> know<00:01:55.009> the

00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:55.099 
the unknown side but I know the

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:56.469 
the unknown side but I know the
transformation<00:01:55.490> works<00:01:55.849> the<00:01:56.060> clutch<00:01:56.270> works

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
transformation works the clutch works

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.169 
transformation works the clutch works
the<00:01:56.810> engine<00:01:57.139> works<00:01:57.349> so<00:01:58.029> everything<00:01:59.029> from

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
the engine works so everything from

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.300 
the engine works so everything from
there<00:01:59.359> I<00:01:59.389> can<00:01:59.630> probably<00:01:59.779> sort<00:02:00.200> it<00:02:00.319> out<00:02:00.439> and<00:02:00.859> I'm

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
there I can probably sort it out and I'm

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.389 
there I can probably sort it out and I'm
looking<00:02:01.669> forward<00:02:01.969> to<00:02:01.999> this<00:02:02.149> project
