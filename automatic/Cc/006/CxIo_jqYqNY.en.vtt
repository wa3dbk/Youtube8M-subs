 May 9, everyone knows that the most expensive is 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:15.599
 world eternal memory to those who gave for it 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:19.050
 life I will tell you and the tanks that 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.380
 also contributed to the defeat of the fascist 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.330
 invaders 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.050
 suitable scared 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.050
 asked here 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.680
 legendary t-34 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.400
 known worldwide but they are less 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.480
 well-deserved light tank t-70 do not know 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.699
 all designed it in just six months 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.650
 in Kobe Gorky Automobile Plant under 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.620
 leadership of nicholas island 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.500
 and made from April 42 on 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.579
 October 43 in bitter sverdlovsk in 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.010
 Kirov armor hull made of extra strong 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.140
 cold rolled steel dumped separately 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.600
 on the Murom steam locomotive 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.600
 factory and several other enterprises 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:17.710
 he is much less famous t-34 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:19.720
 and the armor here is much thinner in that 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.470
 70 five road wheels each 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.810
 parties 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.160
 leading sprocket in front or not view 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.440
 rear torsion bar suspension in rotating 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.720
 octahedral welded tower located 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.040
 forty five millimeter cannon and 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.700
 Degtyaryov machine gun 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.240
 ammunition about 70 shot see 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.360
 what he is asymmetrical and now understand 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.700
 why but first i have to get 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.210
 inside for this there is a top and front 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.210
 at 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.170
 getting into a tank is comfortable enough even with 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.840
 my height and leverage is not necessary 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.630
 squirm in order to take the proper pose 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.420
 but the most important thing even grew th man 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.759
 it is quite comfortable to sit on the seat of the mechanical input 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.910
 driver's seat shifted to the left a 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.400
 on the right is the power unit Sparka 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.650
 of two carburetor six-cylinder 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.890
 the bottom valve of their engines gas eleven 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.200
 with a total power of 140 horsepower these 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.540
 engines developed on gas in front 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.549
 war itself and put on different 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.370
 cars and trucks up to 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.420
 90s fuel aviation gasoline 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.670
 b-70 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.610
 unlike diesel and worked very 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.610
 quiet resource was only 100 hours 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.099
 but that was enough gearbox 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.319
 the same car from the ZIS-5 my 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.019
 head knob rotation of the appliance tower on 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.660
 shield with luminous phosphoric scales 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.510
 speedometer I know such stood on 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.910
 lorry and zisa here everything is like in a tractor 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.450
 side friction control levers 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.450
 pedals 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.940
 Well, I'm looking for a motor algorithm is simple 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.280
 ugliness mass 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.159
 check neutral toggle switch 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.159
 Ignition starter button and everything probably 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:18.430
 I was given a hard time with the crew of the neighborhood 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:18.430
 this lumbering hot engine 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.480
 the tank starts from the second speed with 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.650
 the agility of an ordinary car 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.650
 only very hard 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.010
 10 ton car accelerates on asphalt 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.360
 up to forty kilometers per hour and speed by 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.060
 country road twice as low 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.770
 cruising range with full tanks 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.770
 about 320 kilometers 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.200
 control in motion of a combat vehicle 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.209
 quite comfortable 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.040
 her nose you react to levers changes 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.080
 trajectory get into the sixth 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.120
 and maneuverable 7 dozen heavy and 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.330
 the sluggish German tank was not 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:13.580
 just then the t-70 had time to go round 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.580
 rival and hit the vulnerable spot 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.410
 drop the spoon out where it is now 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.570
 sits the operator settled his commander 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.000
 had to perform a lot of duties 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.520
 After all, under and charging gunner and 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.800
 gunners radio operators machine gunner here we are 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.190
 the help of another person but for 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.900
 there is no third crew member 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.900
 radio communication is unreliable so in 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.990
 mostly people have a little hatch 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.500
 t-70 for flag communication despite 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.740
 modest armor protection forehead 35-45 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.590
 mask 50 millimeters effectively fought 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.720
 under Stalingrad and Kursk 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.870
 much less noisy than diesel they 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:03.990
 were used in reconnaissance besides t-70 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.450
 was easier to learn and control is small 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.990
 trained drivers that on my 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.830
 example 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.830
 especially visible 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:21.539
 t-70 was the second largest tank 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:24.270
 after t-34 he was recognized as one of the best 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:27.360
 light tanks of the second world war 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.509
 total was made more than 8007 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.710
 a dozen decent combat vehicles did 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:35.340
 in our country 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:38.490
 weapons of the winner I congratulate dear 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.300
 veterans with great victory overestimate 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.939
 the value of which is simply impossible 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.360
 health to you well-being and long years 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:47.360
 of life
