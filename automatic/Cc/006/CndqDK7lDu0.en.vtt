00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:22.689
 and what's up everyone welcome on 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.320
 this video the peeps and I hope that 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.509
 you are fine 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.560
 we meet again for the osiris video 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.880
 in which I give you some 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.619
 advice to not strategies 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.599
 since it's true that you always have to 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.070
 adapt to the movement of the enemy 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.969
 so the strategy will never be the same 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.170
 especially you will see in this 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.309
 part that every strategy has 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.870
 never been the same of a round and at a 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.610
 other but that's rather than a few 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.250
 advice so first of all I was 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.329
 accompanied by killer and snow 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.000
 so it went very well at the end 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.360
 9 0 we get to the farges believe in 40 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.070
 minutes 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.600
 so that was just one hour ago 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.130
 time to play a little halo taf 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.780
 in 40 minutes we were at the park 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.730
 frankly it was pretty good we did not 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.460
 too much trouble on this part I 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.140
 know more if we win 5-0 5-1 so here 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.940
 my arms you always see thistle and 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.290
 at the free deep spear I know 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.970
 that again who are going to talk about coal 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.890
 who will say yes the coal blindness and 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.240
 interests and those of accor the coal 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.860
 the chessboard but I want to sign up for 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.140
 the screen nothing a player on two who plays 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.340
 to the thistle whose osiris tournament so 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.860
 I do not see why I could not 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.570
 not play with that one day they 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.650
 lower the stages of coal this will 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.960
 all the better for everyone I think 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.220
 So you saw that one exclusion 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.870
 docsis time so two titans 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.850
 assailants and had snow who is a 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.979
 pistolero hunter so here is so 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.479
 no reason did not have a reason and that 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.760
 went pretty smoothly you 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.690
 seen that in fact the opponents they 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.340
 change of you will see that they 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.600
 change their strategy at every 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.619
 sleeves and so here he was gone 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.060
 left when they left to 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.970
 sporty right nike at the bottom of the map there 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.049
 down and that's so no he got a 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.240
 little bit to see you go see I 'm going 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.460
 succeed in having two hop 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.130
 the first the second goal behind and 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.420
 of a 3rd massa ip and so that's why 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.830
 that actually not as unique really 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.020
 a lot really much talked about as well 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.100
 you are if you are with guys who 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.330
 have microphones guys because there 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.290
 you saw I spoke to who theirs in 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.580
 done at that time that I did vasile 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.290
 and all the others in pincers peace you 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.450
 can go there he was with his chariot there 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.830
 what's the smoke for me and that's it 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.180
 went pretty well you go 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.340
 see again the next round that go 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.860
 still change strategy so here is 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.929
 if I have any advice to already give you 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.280
 according to the vinotheque of the way 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.239
 which you play see me I remain 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.129
 rather indented so I took a 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.800
 snipe those who are looking for here take 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.240
 rather pump guns a d 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.220
 you shotgun that falls badly 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.240
 then at the packaging level I can 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.380
 not advise you it's a guy 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.940
 which you are most comfortable mode 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.920
 cooperative tall is so rather rapacious 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.050
 black thistle behind fierce love 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.280
 not too much but afterwards if you are rather 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.480
 comfortable with red death etc 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.070
 there are other very good weapons there are 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.500
 the messenger who is very very good too 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.610
 a high level of osiris and so here 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.660
 there you see frankly the announced of 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.980
 bonuses it was very bad last 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.620
 ball that one shot a same in their 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.670
 head and that's so I also know there are 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.720
 who complained to these artists of 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.150
 messages like playing there were 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.830
 subscribers yes you abuse you play with 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.590
 the last bullet the researcher from the 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.120
 launches prices says but why the la 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.440
 ability to go on india why I 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.320
 would deprive me of putting the last ball 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.280
 here it is I shot that after it takes 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.620
 play with what we are also given a 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.420
 you have to be there, you have to be between 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.500
 clever quotes they were playing what we 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.850
 name there you saw he camped 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.620
 thankfully clearly super it got me 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.720
 allowed to kill him he was camping the little 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.770
 bastard in the corner there he kill me when 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.840
 even though it's not very successful at him 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.370
 put my little super so it's the same 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.170
 is also careful of the guys out 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.040
 set your classes so tell me in 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.810
 the comments if you want I can 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.400
 you make a video in the cage for 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.990
 show you how to properly adjust your 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.670
 classes versus your super by 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.050
 report to your grenades etc 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.370
 if you want in any case done well 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.720
 be careful to choose your grenades 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.520
 for example the hunter pistolero this 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.440
 will be the laser grenade etc 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.489
 I could everyone and all the names 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.959
 grenades to you saw besides at 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.700
 passage the little shot of shouldered he is 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.050
 not dead the guy that so I do not know if 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.340
 the pile-pile side at the right time in all 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.900
 case there he took the hit of the poles of 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.640
 killer but so weird he did not take the 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.500
 mine then I was stuck to him we went 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.570
 really that I was going to kill him finally 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.010
 here and you'll see for the sleeve 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.570
 heavy so we did it really 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.209
 to all parties actually who has snow 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.140
 who gets it back very quickly then 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.470
 I know even more we do it on this 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.000
 vuelta 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.680
 if we do it it seems to me there is this thing 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.330
 super him very very quickly actually 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.770
 are great at each of the heats 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.060
 so in fact what does that go 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.770
 snap his super directly at 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.440
 the enemy each round including super 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.760
 you will see and again a hatch 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.200
 different from the usual emi they 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.090
 camp and slender not why a 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.020
 fork and meaning he loses with nothing 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.580
 I really did not understand 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.560
 to the enemies then there you have about 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.030
 c-50 I take a 5 0 like that the 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.100
 gameplay it is shorter than doing 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.330
 when we lost 5 1 it was the part 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.940
 the hardest is a 5 1 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.930
 that we have won forgiveness and therefore see 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.780
 you are reproaching him they hurt 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.919
 played the shot again on this 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.970
 here they are reanimated a little everything 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.410
 close who puts two balls of tanks whose 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.820
 I believe he is dead 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.080
 I'm not sure we 're not going too 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.760
 understood this case that the emir there you see 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.780
 in addition typically an example of this 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.280
 that we must not lose what we did 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.410
 the enemy there if you search the 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.450
 heavy without great frankly for me 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.890
 you are dead 1 - - unless you are 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.180
 truly effective in the early 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.290
 halls to 3 is to get to kill the 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.870
 three entrance but it's far 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.100
 it's going to be very very complicated so there 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.420
 the last cheapest I saw I 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.250
 think he's successful anymore they're still going 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.360
 change strategy no but here are the 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.620
 things again yesterday by your left 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.910
 that's weird because 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.890
 frankly you have a stratum 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.180
 kiroulbien as much to keep it but there 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.990
 they 're fine they're looking for one 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.070
 little bit guys it's pretty weird 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.450
 finally here is the end of this gameplay 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.800
 Guys I hope you liked me 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.400
 will leave you doubts at the end of 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.450
 the video 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.620
 if you have other questions 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.940
 do not hesitate to put them in 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.380
 comments but it's a gift to people 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.830
 who are very good at pvp who are watching 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.390
 videos 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.950
 so I know that they can help you 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.780
 also his present in the space of 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.790
 comments there is no problem I 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.200
 wanted this one with a little there is a 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.820
 little bonus at the end of the video I 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.320
 managed to make a small column in 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.550
 osiris and frankly it's pretty rare 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.800
 this is my second only the first 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.730
 I did not capture but that's okay 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.080
 always pleasure a little glue 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.340
 achieved do a double over three 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.260
 players frankly it's pretty good 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.970
 go I hope the video call you 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.310
 was not also to leave you your 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.570
 small your little tips in the east 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.590
 in the comment space I you 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.610
 say very soon the mistakes took 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.610
 care of handsome boy 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:45.499
 your team is leading 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.410
 you the enemies have been eliminated
