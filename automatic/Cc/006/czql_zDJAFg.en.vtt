00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
get the e-tron to 60 in 4.2 seconds and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.270 
get the e-tron to 60 in 4.2 seconds and
that's<00:01:05.630> what<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.810> range<00:01:05.990> of<00:01:06.110> 215<00:01:06.679> kilometers

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280

that's what the range of 215 kilometers
or<00:01:07.429> about<00:01:07.820> 134<00:01:08.720> miles<00:01:08.990> on<00:01:09.289> a<00:01:09.350> single<00:01:09.679> charge<00:01:10.009> oh

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
or about 134 miles on a single charge oh

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.940 
or about 134 miles on a single charge oh
well<00:01:11.330> if<00:01:11.899> technology<00:01:12.500> improves

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
well if technology improves
