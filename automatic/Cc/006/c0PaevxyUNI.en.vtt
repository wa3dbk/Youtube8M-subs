00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
I just found basically the VFD that is

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.860 
I just found basically the VFD that is
the<00:00:12.379> neutral<00:00:12.679> wire<00:00:13.190> I<00:00:13.519> have<00:00:14.030> disconnected<00:00:14.509> and

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
the neutral wire I have disconnected and

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.589 
the neutral wire I have disconnected and
it<00:00:14.990> still<00:00:15.259> works<00:00:15.380> perfectly<00:00:15.860> fine<00:00:16.240> as<00:00:17.240> I'll

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:17.599

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
pointed out on the forums you basically

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.230 
pointed out on the forums you basically
don't<00:00:21.619> need<00:00:21.859> that<00:00:22.039> it<00:00:22.609> says<00:00:22.910> l3<00:00:23.510> /

poultry / mutual right there I hooked it
up<00:00:29.330> anyways<00:00:29.750> but<00:00:30.140> it<00:00:30.770> doesn't<00:00:31.070> need<00:00:31.130> to<00:00:31.189> be

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
up anyways but it doesn't need to be

hooked up I'll disconnected I mean if

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.049 
hooked up I'll disconnected I mean if
it's<00:00:33.050> not<00:00:33.530> going<00:00:33.650> to<00:00:33.739> give<00:00:33.890> me<00:00:34.010> any<00:00:34.160> more<00:00:34.340> any

disconnect it right now the whole system
is<00:00:41.329> running<00:00:44.019> basically<00:00:45.019> we're<00:00:45.170> blinking<00:00:45.530> in

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
is running basically we're blinking in

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.270 
is running basically we're blinking in

system<00:00:49.280> light<00:00:49.460> is<00:00:49.670> ready<00:00:49.970> to<00:00:50.090> roll<00:00:50.269> there's<00:00:50.600> no

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
system light is ready to roll there's no

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.840 
system light is ready to roll there's no
e<00:00:50.780> stoplights<00:00:51.820> and<00:00:54.040> step<00:00:55.040> in<00:00:55.250> those<00:00:55.580> are<00:00:55.730> the

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
e stoplights and step in those are the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.890 
e stoplights and step in those are the
direction<00:00:56.420> LEDs<00:00:57.230> right<00:00:57.559> there<00:00:57.769> hold<00:00:58.699> on<00:00:58.900> sit

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
direction LEDs right there hold on sit

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.299 
direction LEDs right there hold on sit
down<00:01:00.309> this<00:01:01.309> is<00:01:01.460> pretty<00:01:01.820> cool<00:01:02.030> here<00:01:03.070> so<00:01:04.070> I'll

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
down this is pretty cool here so I'll

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.460 
down this is pretty cool here so I'll
run<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:04.879> basically<00:01:05.630> all<00:01:06.970> basically<00:01:07.970> I<00:01:08.119> can

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
run the basically all basically I can

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.230 
run the basically all basically I can
change<00:01:09.470> those<00:01:09.650> LEDs<00:01:10.130> obviously<00:01:10.700> they'll<00:01:10.940> tell

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
change those LEDs obviously they'll tell

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.969 
change those LEDs obviously they'll tell
me<00:01:11.360> if<00:01:11.450> this<00:01:11.659> is<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.810> y-axis<00:01:12.049> that's<00:01:12.590> like<00:01:12.799> he

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
me if this is the y-axis that's like he

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.670 
me if this is the y-axis that's like he
right<00:01:13.100> now<00:01:13.240> if<00:01:14.240> I<00:01:14.360> move<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:14.990> then<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:15.560> other

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
right now if I move and then the other

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.969 
right now if I move and then the other
one<00:01:16.720> is<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:17.780> x-axis<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:19.330> top<00:01:20.330> one<00:01:20.630> is<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.799> z

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
one is the x-axis the top one is the z

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.929 
one is the x-axis the top one is the z
axis<00:01:22.299> which<00:01:23.299> is<00:01:23.659> here<00:01:24.260> page<00:01:24.860> down

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
axis which is here page down

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.510 
axis which is here page down
is<00:01:27.939> on<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.299> page<00:01:28.479> up<00:01:28.979> all<00:01:29.979> right<00:01:30.130> now<00:01:30.310> we<00:01:30.369> have

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
is on the page up all right now we have

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.520 
is on the page up all right now we have
no<00:01:30.549> oil<00:01:30.729> it<00:01:31.060> will<00:01:31.090> let's<00:01:31.570> let's<00:01:31.869> turn<00:01:32.079> the<00:01:32.200> LEDs

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
no oil it will let's let's turn the LEDs

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.399 
no oil it will let's let's turn the LEDs
on<00:01:32.770> in<00:01:33.009> one<00:01:33.189> direction<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.979> see<00:01:35.979> when<00:01:37.409> all

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
on in one direction and see when all

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.789 
on in one direction and see when all
right<00:01:38.590> so<00:01:39.520> basically<00:01:40.060> I<00:01:40.149> have<00:01:40.299> the<00:01:40.630> all<00:01:41.530> the

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
right so basically I have the all the

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.149 
right so basically I have the all the
LEDs<00:01:41.920> on<00:01:42.340> their<00:01:42.670> going<00:01:42.909> one<00:01:43.090> direction<00:01:44.159> they

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
LEDs on their going one direction they

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.969 
LEDs on their going one direction they
haven't<00:01:45.310> changed<00:01:45.850> and<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.630> system<00:01:47.320> light<00:01:47.500> is

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
haven't changed and the system light is

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.279 
haven't changed and the system light is
on<00:01:48.729> but<00:01:49.060> as<00:01:49.539> soon<00:01:49.810> as<00:01:50.049> I<00:01:50.640> turn<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.820> VFD<00:01:52.390> on<00:01:52.539> okay

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
on but as soon as I turn the VFD on okay

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.859 
on but as soon as I turn the VFD on okay
everything's<00:01:53.799> fun<00:01:54.100> right<00:01:54.340> now<00:01:54.490> these<00:01:55.420> lights

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
everything's fun right now these lights

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.840 
everything's fun right now these lights
don't<00:01:56.140> change<00:01:56.380> either<00:01:56.560> when<00:01:57.070> I<00:01:57.130> trim<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.429> VFD

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
don't change either when I trim the VFD

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.110 
don't change either when I trim the VFD
on<00:01:58.030> while<00:01:58.270> she's<00:01:58.509> out<00:01:58.689> at<00:01:58.840> ease

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.870 

turn<00:02:02.720> off<00:02:02.930> flickr<00:02:04.060> system<00:02:05.060> light<00:02:05.270> turns<00:02:05.630> off

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
turn off flickr system light turns off

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.250 
turn off flickr system light turns off
smooth<00:02:07.880> stepper<00:02:08.300> lights<00:02:08.510> still<00:02:08.869> on<00:02:08.930> and

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
smooth stepper lights still on and

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.660 
smooth stepper lights still on and
blinking<00:02:09.680> mouth<00:02:09.860> I'm<00:02:10.130> going<00:02:10.250> to<00:02:10.310> turn<00:02:10.460> it<00:02:10.640> back

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
blinking mouth I'm going to turn it back

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:18.640 
blinking mouth I'm going to turn it back
off<00:02:11.060> there<00:02:11.480> we<00:02:11.570> go<00:02:13.120> her<00:02:14.120> mom<00:02:17.080> stays<00:02:18.080> back<00:02:18.410> on

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
off there we go her mom stays back on

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.940 
off there we go her mom stays back on
all<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.310> lights<00:02:19.490> flicker<00:02:20.480> come<00:02:21.050> back<00:02:21.290> on<00:02:21.530> I

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
all the lights flicker come back on I

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.560 
all the lights flicker come back on I
think<00:02:24.950> I<00:02:25.100> have<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.280> problem<00:02:25.550> with<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.180> breakout

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
think I have a problem with the breakout

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.890 
think I have a problem with the breakout
board<00:02:28.570> so<00:02:29.570> let's<00:02:30.020> do<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.260> once<00:02:30.410> more<00:02:31.720> see<00:02:32.720> here

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
board so let's do it once more see here

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:40.440 
board so let's do it once more see here
I'll<00:02:32.990> get<00:02:33.200> back<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:33.410> see<00:02:34.250> here<00:02:34.550> and

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.020 

so<00:02:41.440> they<00:02:41.650> turn<00:02:41.830> it<00:02:41.950> on<00:02:42.069> all<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.489> lights<00:02:42.730> turn

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
so they turn it on all the lights turn

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.619 
so they turn it on all the lights turn
off<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:44.200> go<00:02:44.379> close<00:02:44.739> enough<00:02:45.099> the<00:02:45.940> direction<00:02:46.390> of

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
off you go close enough the direction of

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.199 
off you go close enough the direction of
the<00:02:46.959> Z<00:02:47.379> the<00:02:47.860> direction<00:02:48.129> of<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.519> why<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.120> the

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
the Z the direction of the why and the

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.199 
the Z the direction of the why and the
direction<00:02:50.019> of<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.440> eggs<00:02:50.709> are<00:02:51.459> all<00:02:51.610> blinking

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
direction of the eggs are all blinking

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.640 
direction of the eggs are all blinking
but<00:02:52.690> not<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:53.140> step<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.769> there<00:02:54.160> is<00:02:54.280> no<00:02:54.459> error

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
but not the step and there is no error

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.540 
but not the step and there is no error
but<00:02:56.650> if<00:02:56.950> you<00:02:57.099> turn<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.370> off<00:02:57.750> right<00:02:58.750> away<00:02:59.550> cool

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
but if you turn it off right away cool

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.880 
but if you turn it off right away cool
it<00:03:00.670> down<00:03:04.349> like<00:03:05.349> magic<00:03:05.849> I'm<00:03:06.849> throw<00:03:07.060> it<00:03:07.120> back<00:03:07.299> on

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
it down like magic I'm throw it back on

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.020 
it down like magic I'm throw it back on
didn't<00:03:08.890> even<00:03:09.069> notice<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.370> before<00:03:09.549> because

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
didn't even notice that before because

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.050 
didn't even notice that before because
my<00:03:10.620> keypad<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:12.700> all<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.239> way<00:03:13.360> over<00:03:13.390> there<00:03:15.060> so

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
my keypad is all the way over there so

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.940 
my keypad is all the way over there so
hopefully<00:03:16.420> that<00:03:16.870> I<00:03:16.900> mean<00:03:17.110> that<00:03:17.319> is<00:03:17.500> obviously

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
hopefully that I mean that is obviously

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.130 
hopefully that I mean that is obviously
my<00:03:18.190> issue<00:03:18.340> I've<00:03:18.700> been<00:03:18.940> started<00:03:19.420> up<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.810> my

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
my issue I've been started up and my

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.170 
my issue I've been started up and my
breakout<00:03:20.470> board<00:03:20.709> completely<00:03:21.370> goes<00:03:21.549> basically

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
breakout board completely goes basically

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.729 
breakout board completely goes basically
dead<00:03:22.360> freaks<00:03:22.959> out<00:03:23.110> it<00:03:23.860> goes<00:03:24.010> off<00:03:24.250> status<00:03:24.730> and

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
dead freaks out it goes off status and

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.319 
dead freaks out it goes off status and
smooth<00:03:26.739> stepper<00:03:27.069> still<00:03:27.340> strong<00:03:27.819> still

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:28.329 
smooth stepper still strong still

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.420

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
blinking thrown never fault there drew

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.750 
blinking thrown never fault there drew
anything<00:03:30.760> like<00:03:30.910> that<00:03:30.940> but<00:03:32.010> I'm<00:03:33.010> basically

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
anything like that but I'm basically

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.680 
anything like that but I'm basically
sending<00:03:34.299> info<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:34.989> my<00:03:35.519> my<00:03:36.519> my<00:03:37.060> smooth<00:03:37.360> stepper

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
sending info to my my my smooth stepper

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.729 
sending info to my my my smooth stepper
and<00:03:37.780> it's<00:03:37.930> probably<00:03:38.140> making<00:03:38.349> it<00:03:38.530> through<00:03:38.680> my

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
and it's probably making it through my

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.530 
and it's probably making it through my
smooth<00:03:39.099> step<00:03:39.340> or<00:03:39.519> thrown<00:03:39.760> it<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.030> my<00:03:40.150> breakout

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
smooth step or thrown it to my breakout

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.240 
smooth step or thrown it to my breakout
board<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:41.019> my<00:03:41.170> break<00:03:41.380> a<00:03:41.410> board<00:03:41.680> is<00:03:41.829> obviously

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
board and my break a board is obviously

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.520 
board and my break a board is obviously
not<00:03:42.519> even<00:03:42.849> the<00:03:43.269> system<00:03:44.110> why<00:03:44.230> it<00:03:44.290> isn't<00:03:44.590> even<00:03:44.799> on

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
not even the system why it isn't even on

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.099 
not even the system why it isn't even on
so<00:03:47.530> i<00:03:47.560> think<00:03:47.889> i<00:03:48.250> think<00:03:48.819> i<00:03:48.910> may<00:03:49.060> be<00:03:49.120> good<00:03:49.420> as<00:03:50.049> long

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
so i think i think i may be good as long

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:52.170 
so i think i think i may be good as long
as<00:03:50.380> i<00:03:50.470> can<00:03:50.530> figure<00:03:50.769> this<00:03:51.040> out<00:03:51.250> I<00:03:51.579> think

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
as i can figure this out I think

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.020 
as i can figure this out I think
everything<00:03:52.450> else<00:03:52.780> everything<00:03:53.850> else<00:03:54.850> will

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
everything else everything else will

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.449 
everything else everything else will
work<00:03:55.060> out<00:03:55.420> so<00:03:55.690> hopefully<00:03:56.019> that<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:57.310> people

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
work out so hopefully that the people

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:58.860 
work out so hopefully that the people
can<00:03:57.609> point<00:03:57.850> me<00:03:57.910> in<00:03:58.000> the<00:03:58.030> right<00:03:58.120> direction<00:03:58.209> and

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
can point me in the right direction and

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.080 
can point me in the right direction and
I<00:03:59.350> can<00:03:59.680> get<00:04:00.069> a<00:04:00.100> hold<00:04:00.310> of<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.489> right<00:04:00.609> people<00:04:00.790> at

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
I can get a hold of the right people at

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.120 
I can get a hold of the right people at
all<00:04:01.209> know<00:04:02.170> what's<00:04:02.350> going<00:04:02.620> on<00:04:04.470> but<00:04:05.470> thanks<00:04:06.010> for

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
all know what's going on but thanks for

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.830 
all know what's going on but thanks for
watching<00:04:06.489> and<00:04:06.670> we<00:04:07.180> will<00:04:07.209> do<00:04:07.450> it<00:04:07.569> once<00:04:07.750> more

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
watching and we will do it once more

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.830 
watching and we will do it once more
just<00:04:08.260> for<00:04:08.380> the<00:04:08.470> heck<00:04:08.590> of<00:04:08.620> it<00:04:08.799> and<00:04:09.660> when<00:04:10.660> I<00:04:10.690> do

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
just for the heck of it and when I do

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.360 
just for the heck of it and when I do
turn<00:04:11.170> it<00:04:11.319> on<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:11.980> motors<00:04:12.489> do<00:04:12.959> back-and-forth

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
turn it on the motors do back-and-forth

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.529 
turn it on the motors do back-and-forth
slight<00:04:15.370> you<00:04:15.549> could<00:04:15.730> feel<00:04:15.910> like<00:04:16.030> put<00:04:16.269> your<00:04:16.329> hand

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
slight you could feel like put your hand

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:17.640 
slight you could feel like put your hand
on<00:04:16.660> it<00:04:16.720> feels<00:04:16.989> like<00:04:17.139> someone's<00:04:17.410> in<00:04:17.500> there

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
on it feels like someone's in there

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.170 
on it feels like someone's in there
rocking<00:04:18.039> it<00:04:18.130> around<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:18.639> you<00:04:18.729> can<00:04:18.880> hear<00:04:19.090> them

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
rocking it around and you can hear them

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.350 
rocking it around and you can hear them
too<00:04:19.450> because<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:20.680> there's<00:04:21.609> no<00:04:21.760> step<00:04:22.120> of<00:04:22.300> the

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
too because the there's no step of the

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.600 
too because the there's no step of the
direction<00:04:22.660> is<00:04:23.080> blinking<00:04:23.560> so<00:04:23.800> fast<00:04:24.070> i<00:04:24.370> think

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
direction is blinking so fast i think

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.760 
direction is blinking so fast i think
the<00:04:24.789> the<00:04:24.820> step<00:04:25.539> they<00:04:25.990> are<00:04:26.139> going<00:04:26.349> back<00:04:26.590> and

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
the the step they are going back and

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.440 
the the step they are going back and
forth<00:04:27.010> maybe<00:04:27.220> they're<00:04:27.340> not<00:04:27.460> receiving<00:04:28.180> any

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
forth maybe they're not receiving any

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.629 
forth maybe they're not receiving any
signal<00:04:29.289> for<00:04:29.560> step<00:04:29.800> but<00:04:30.039> they're<00:04:30.520> definitely

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
signal for step but they're definitely

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.730 
signal for step but they're definitely
changing<00:04:31.150> direction<00:04:31.270> but<00:04:31.660> there's<00:04:32.530> one<00:04:32.620> more

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
changing direction but there's one more

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.200 
changing direction but there's one more
time

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210

instilling that's only at a hundred
Hertz<00:04:38.050> you<00:04:39.050> can<00:04:39.199> turn<00:04:39.349> it<00:04:39.410> up<00:04:39.620> more

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800
