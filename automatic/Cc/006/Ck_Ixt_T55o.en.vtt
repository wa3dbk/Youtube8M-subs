one of them now this hide belt was going
to<00:01:16.380> drop<00:01:16.590> no<00:01:16.860> matter<00:01:17.070> what<00:01:17.960> this<00:01:18.960> is

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
to drop no matter what this is

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.840 
to drop no matter what this is
determined<00:01:19.560> first<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.220> know<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.580> game

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.480 
determined first you know the game
engine<00:01:21.210> decides<00:01:21.600> okay<00:01:21.770> skeleton<00:01:22.770> number<00:01:23.280> four

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.700 
engine decides okay skeleton number four
is<00:01:23.640> going<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.850> drop<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.119> hide<00:01:24.420> belt<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.990> then<00:01:25.380> it

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
is going to drop a hide belt and then it

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.380 
is going to drop a hide belt and then it
takes<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.280> look<00:01:26.520> at<00:01:26.670> your<00:01:26.820> magic<00:01:27.180> find

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
takes a look at your magic find

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.420 
takes a look at your magic find
percentage<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.560> determines<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
percentage and that determines the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.219 
percentage and that determines the
likelihood<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.390> high<00:01:30.630> belt<00:01:30.990> will

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
likelihood that this high belt will

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.010 
likelihood that this high belt will
actually<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:32.030> magical<00:01:33.030> instead<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
actually be magical instead of just the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.310 
actually be magical instead of just the
regular<00:01:34.409> one<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.829> found<00:01:35.189> or<00:01:35.990> rare<00:01:36.990> or

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
regular one that I found or rare or

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.609 
regular one that I found or rare or
after<00:01:37.920> retail<00:01:38.310> launch<00:01:38.610> set<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.329> legendary<00:01:40.259> so

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
after retail launch set and legendary so

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.969 
after retail launch set and legendary so
I<00:01:40.860> think<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.790> pretty<00:01:41.939> obvious<00:01:42.060> why<00:01:42.979> focusing

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
I think it's pretty obvious why focusing

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.670 
I think it's pretty obvious why focusing
on<00:01:44.130> magic<00:01:44.549> find<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.060> always<00:01:45.479> having<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:46.079> decent

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
on magic find and always having a decent

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.910 
on magic find and always having a decent
amount<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.220> magic<00:01:47.520> find<00:01:47.790> equipped<00:01:48.570> is<00:01:48.920> very

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
amount of magic find equipped is very

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.100 
amount of magic find equipped is very
important<00:01:50.369> when<00:01:50.490> playing<00:01:50.759> through<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.030> game

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
important when playing through the game

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.590 
important when playing through the game
especially<00:01:52.110> during<00:01:52.770> boss<00:01:53.369> kills<00:01:53.899> or<00:01:54.899> killing

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
especially during boss kills or killing

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.080 
especially during boss kills or killing
champion<00:01:57.600> monsters<00:01:58.110> or<00:01:58.439> even<00:01:58.740> rare<00:01:59.159> monster

chance<00:03:43.459> of<00:03:43.640> dropping<00:03:44.269> a<00:03:44.510> really<00:03:44.900> good<00:03:45.079> gear

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
chance of dropping a really good gear

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.649 
chance of dropping a really good gear
for<00:03:45.560> you<00:03:45.650> so<00:03:46.430> I<00:03:46.459> mean<00:03:46.760> monster<00:03:47.150> level<00:03:47.450> is

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
for you so I mean monster level is

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.210 
for you so I mean monster level is
something<00:03:48.409> you're<00:03:48.560> going<00:03:48.650> to<00:03:48.709> be<00:03:48.890> a<00:03:48.920> little

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
something you're going to be a little

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.710 
something you're going to be a little
less<00:03:49.489> conscious<00:03:49.970> of<00:03:50.180> because<00:03:50.480> you<00:03:50.599> know<00:03:50.689> as

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
less conscious of because you know as

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.030 
less conscious of because you know as
you<00:03:50.900> progress<00:03:51.079> through<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.470> game<00:03:51.500> monster

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
you progress through the game monster

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.470 
you progress through the game monster
levels<00:03:52.310> obviously<00:03:52.670> going<00:03:52.819> to<00:03:52.909> increase<00:03:53.209> and

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
levels obviously going to increase and

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.720 
levels obviously going to increase and
more<00:03:53.689> and<00:03:53.930> better<00:03:54.349> items<00:03:54.620> are<00:03:54.920> going<00:03:55.069> to<00:03:55.159> drop

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
more and better items are going to drop

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.429 
more and better items are going to drop
but<00:03:56.000> it's<00:03:56.120> still<00:03:56.329> an<00:03:56.510> important<00:03:56.930> sort<00:03:57.349> of

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 
but it's still an important sort of

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:59.949 
but it's still an important sort of
piece<00:03:57.590> to<00:03:58.310> just<00:03:58.909> keep<00:03:59.060> in<00:03:59.239> mind<00:03:59.450> but<00:03:59.569> most

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
piece to just keep in mind but most

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.379 
piece to just keep in mind but most
importantly<00:04:00.469> focus<00:04:00.829> on<00:04:00.980> magic<00:04:01.370> fine<00:04:01.549> I<00:04:01.790> really

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
importantly focus on magic fine I really

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.390 
importantly focus on magic fine I really
like<00:04:02.569> the<00:04:02.900> changes<00:04:03.650> that<00:04:03.680> Blizzard<00:04:04.129> is<00:04:04.220> made

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
there's going to be a lot more overlap

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:30.189 
there's going to be a lot more overlap
in<00:04:26.750> d3<00:04:27.139> which<00:04:28.130> just<00:04:28.520> if<00:04:28.699> it<00:04:29.389> feels<00:04:29.570> better<00:04:29.780> and

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
in d3 which just if it feels better and

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:33.070 
in d3 which just if it feels better and
it<00:04:30.349> makes<00:04:30.380> more<00:04:30.830> sense<00:04:31.270> one<00:04:32.270> final<00:04:32.570> note<00:04:32.720> that

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
it makes more sense one final note that

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.320 
it makes more sense one final note that
I'll<00:04:33.199> add<00:04:33.380> about<00:04:33.620> magic<00:04:34.130> find<00:04:34.370> is<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:35.060> rule

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
I'll add about magic find is the rule

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.750 
I'll add about magic find is the rule
that<00:04:35.360> it<00:04:35.750> plays<00:04:36.020> in<00:04:36.349> co-op<00:04:37.159> because<00:04:37.580> there's

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
that it plays in co-op because there's

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.820 
that it plays in co-op because there's
actually<00:04:38.000> a<00:04:38.060> lot<00:04:38.090> of<00:04:38.360> drama<00:04:38.659> about<00:04:38.870> this<00:04:39.260> how

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
actually a lot of drama about this how

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.029 
actually a lot of drama about this how
you<00:04:39.860> can<00:04:40.250> have<00:04:40.370> a<00:04:40.400> party<00:04:40.639> of<00:04:40.849> four<00:04:41.090> players<00:04:41.419> and

benefit a lot from just sitting back and

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.409 
benefit a lot from just sitting back and

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
play more casual and keeping a high

magic fighting score and kind of
leeching<00:05:28.130> off<00:05:28.190> the<00:05:28.400> other<00:05:28.520> party<00:05:28.940> members

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
leeching off the other party members

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.909 
leeching off the other party members
that<00:05:29.479> maybe<00:05:29.660> don't<00:05:29.870> have<00:05:30.110> as<00:05:30.199> much<00:05:30.319> magic<00:05:30.530> find

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
that maybe don't have as much magic find

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:32.890 
that maybe don't have as much magic find
and<00:05:31.160> thus<00:05:31.400> they're<00:05:31.910> doing<00:05:32.270> more<00:05:32.419> damage<00:05:32.599> so

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
and thus they're doing more damage so

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.330 
and thus they're doing more damage so
there's<00:05:33.050> a<00:05:33.110> lot<00:05:33.229> of<00:05:33.289> drama<00:05:33.650> sort<00:05:34.009> of<00:05:34.069> around

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
there's a lot of drama sort of around

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.760 
there's a lot of drama sort of around
that<00:05:34.550> and<00:05:34.789> is<00:05:34.970> that<00:05:35.419> a<00:05:35.449> good<00:05:35.660> idea<00:05:35.720> or<00:05:36.139> should

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
that and is that a good idea or should

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.620 
that and is that a good idea or should
Blizzard<00:05:37.130> maybe<00:05:37.310> average<00:05:37.759> out<00:05:37.940> magic<00:05:38.389> find

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
Blizzard maybe average out magic find

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.200 
Blizzard maybe average out magic find
and<00:05:38.930> have<00:05:39.349> it<00:05:39.500> applied<00:05:39.800> towards<00:05:40.340> more<00:05:40.880> members

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
and have it applied towards more members

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.510 
and have it applied towards more members
in<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.419> party<00:05:41.780> I<00:05:42.470> mean<00:05:42.770> that's<00:05:42.889> up<00:05:43.130> to<00:05:43.220> debate

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
in the party I mean that's up to debate

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.189 
in the party I mean that's up to debate
but<00:05:43.729> certainly<00:05:44.270> something<00:05:44.570> important<00:05:45.139> to

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
but certainly something important to

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.710 
but certainly something important to
keep<00:05:45.380> in<00:05:45.500> mind<00:05:45.740> how<00:05:46.340> it<00:05:46.759> can<00:05:46.970> be<00:05:47.120> a<00:05:47.150> little<00:05:47.509> bit

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
keep in mind how it can be a little bit

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.230 
keep in mind how it can be a little bit
unfair<00:05:48.110> during<00:05:48.560> co-op<00:05:48.919> play<00:05:49.250> to<00:05:49.849> have<00:05:50.000> a<00:05:50.030> whole

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
unfair during co-op play to have a whole

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.510 
unfair during co-op play to have a whole
bunch<00:05:50.360> of<00:05:50.539> magic<00:05:50.840> find<00:05:51.080> and<00:05:51.380> let<00:05:51.800> the<00:05:52.039> rest<00:05:52.340> of

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 
bunch of magic find and let the rest of

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.640 
bunch of magic find and let the rest of
your<00:05:52.580> party<00:05:52.820> members<00:05:53.110> deal<00:05:54.110> most<00:05:54.380> of<00:05:54.560> the

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
your party members deal most of the

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.430 
your party members deal most of the
damage<00:05:55.479> so<00:05:56.479> now<00:05:56.599> that<00:05:56.630> I<00:05:56.840> think<00:05:56.990> you<00:05:57.139> guys<00:05:57.259> have

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
damage so now that I think you guys have

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.589 
damage so now that I think you guys have
a<00:05:57.470> better<00:05:57.680> sense<00:05:57.919> of<00:05:58.190> how<00:05:58.460> exactly<00:05:58.970> magic<00:05:59.360> find

00:05:59.589 --> 00:05:59.599 
a better sense of how exactly magic find

00:05:59.599 --> 00:06:01.990 
a better sense of how exactly magic find
works<00:05:59.930> and<00:06:00.199> of<00:06:00.740> course<00:06:00.770> the<00:06:01.159> importance<00:06:01.639> of<00:06:01.759> it

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
works and of course the importance of it

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.469 
works and of course the importance of it
way<00:06:02.389> into<00:06:02.720> the<00:06:02.870> late<00:06:03.080> game<00:06:03.380> I<00:06:03.849> think<00:06:04.849> that

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:05.479 
way into the late game I think that

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:07.089 
way into the late game I think that
we're<00:06:05.630> just<00:06:05.810> going<00:06:05.930> to<00:06:05.990> cut<00:06:06.470> off<00:06:06.500> this<00:06:06.770> video

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:07.099

they don't require a huge amount of

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.810 
they don't require a huge amount of
explanation<00:06:15.229> but<00:06:15.770> they<00:06:15.979> are<00:06:16.190> important
