here's the sticking pattern I used to

I'm using here are based on a technique

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.610 
I'm using here are based on a technique
called<00:00:31.189> the<00:00:31.669> level<00:00:32.119> system<00:00:32.570> which<00:00:32.990> consists

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
called the level system which consists

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.090 
called the level system which consists
of<00:00:33.710> full<00:00:34.040> path<00:00:34.430> and<00:00:34.730> low<00:00:35.000> strokes<00:00:35.390> and<00:00:35.600> was

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
of full path and low strokes and was

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.980 
of full path and low strokes and was
originally<00:00:37.100> used<00:00:37.340> by<00:00:37.700> both<00:00:38.180> George<00:00:38.720> Lawrence

stone and Billy Gladstone notice the
starting<00:00:42.110> position<00:00:42.530> of<00:00:42.620> my<00:00:42.800> hands<00:00:43.280> the<00:00:43.610> first

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
starting position of my hands the first

starting position of my hands the first
right<00:00:44.570> hand<00:00:44.780> stroke<00:00:45.170> accent<00:00:45.800> is<00:00:45.980> produced<00:00:46.460> by

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
right hand stroke accent is produced by

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.880 
right hand stroke accent is produced by
simply<00:00:47.120> throwing<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.720> stick<00:00:47.960> down<00:00:48.260> from<00:00:48.740> the

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
simply throwing the stick down from the

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.400 
simply throwing the stick down from the
full<00:00:49.160> stroke<00:00:49.460> level<00:00:49.910> using<00:00:50.480> a<00:00:50.720> wrist<00:00:50.960> stroke

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
full stroke level using a wrist stroke

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.070 
full stroke level using a wrist stroke
and<00:00:51.590> stopping<00:00:52.310> my<00:00:52.640> wrist<00:00:52.970> at<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:53.570> low<00:00:53.720> stroke

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
and stopping my wrist at the low stroke

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.320 
and stopping my wrist at the low stroke
level<00:00:54.470> the<00:00:54.800> next<00:00:54.980> left<00:00:55.520> hand<00:00:55.790> stroke<00:00:56.090> is

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
level the next left hand stroke is

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.290 
level the next left hand stroke is
unaccented<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.590> I<00:00:57.620> use<00:00:57.950> a<00:00:57.980> wrist<00:00:58.340> stroke<00:00:58.820> from

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
unaccented so I use a wrist stroke from

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.480 
unaccented so I use a wrist stroke from
the<00:00:59.510> low<00:00:59.660> level<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:00.500> next<00:01:00.650> right<00:01:00.980> hand<00:01:01.190> stroke

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.490 
the low level the next right hand stroke

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.299 
the low level the next right hand stroke
is<00:01:01.700> also<00:01:02.090> on<00:01:02.240> accented<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.080> I<00:01:03.110> use<00:01:03.440> another<00:01:03.920> low

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
is also on accented so I use another low

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.399 
is also on accented so I use another low
level<00:01:04.670> wrist<00:01:04.939> stroke<00:01:05.360> but<00:01:05.840> for<00:01:06.049> the<00:01:06.170> next

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
level wrist stroke but for the next

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.280 
level wrist stroke but for the next
right<00:01:07.100> hand<00:01:07.369> stroke<00:01:07.759> I<00:01:07.970> use<00:01:08.390> a<00:01:08.420> finger<00:01:09.140> and

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
right hand stroke I use a finger and

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.830 
right hand stroke I use a finger and
then<00:01:09.770> I<00:01:09.800> allow<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:10.250> stick<00:01:10.790> level<00:01:11.180> to<00:01:11.390> come<00:01:11.630> up

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
then I allow the stick level to come up

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.170 
then I allow the stick level to come up
to<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.260> full<00:01:12.530> stroke<00:01:12.830> position<00:01:13.430> check<00:01:14.030> out

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
to the full stroke position check out

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.330 
to the full stroke position check out
the<00:01:14.330> efficiency<00:01:14.840> of<00:01:15.020> this<00:01:15.290> I'm<00:01:15.500> getting<00:01:16.100> in

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
the efficiency of this I'm getting in

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.030 
the efficiency of this I'm getting in
position<00:01:16.520> to<00:01:17.270> play<00:01:17.510> the<00:01:17.720> upcoming<00:01:18.380> right<00:01:18.680> hand

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
position to play the upcoming right hand

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.660 
position to play the upcoming right hand
accent<00:01:19.940> two<00:01:20.480> strokes<00:01:21.020> before<00:01:21.409> I<00:01:21.650> need<00:01:21.980> it<00:01:22.159> most

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
accent two strokes before I need it most

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.670 
accent two strokes before I need it most
drummers<00:01:22.970> don't<00:01:23.360> play<00:01:23.690> like<00:01:23.930> this<00:01:24.140> which<00:01:24.650> is

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
drummers don't play like this which is

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.710 
drummers don't play like this which is
why<00:01:25.010> they<00:01:25.220> can't<00:01:25.520> get<00:01:25.730> the<00:01:25.909> maximum<00:01:26.420> speed

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
why they can't get the maximum speed

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.170 
why they can't get the maximum speed
possible<00:01:27.409> the<00:01:27.890> next<00:01:28.070> left-hand<00:01:28.670> stroke<00:01:29.000> is

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
possible the next left-hand stroke is

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.930 
possible the next left-hand stroke is
unaccented<00:01:29.630> so<00:01:30.409> it's<00:01:30.590> a<00:01:30.710> wrist<00:01:30.980> stroke<00:01:31.490> at<00:01:31.670> the

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
unaccented so it's a wrist stroke at the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.210 
unaccented so it's a wrist stroke at the
low<00:01:32.120> level<00:01:32.480> position<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.560> final<00:01:34.040> left

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
low level position and the final left

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.460 
low level position and the final left
hand<00:01:34.490> stroke<00:01:34.850> also<00:01:35.570> on<00:01:35.720> accent<00:01:36.229> it<00:01:36.380> is

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
hand stroke also on accent it is

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.399 
hand stroke also on accent it is
produced<00:01:37.310> with<00:01:37.820> a<00:01:37.850> finger<00:01:38.300> stroke<00:01:38.600> then<00:01:39.080> with

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
produced with a finger stroke then with

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.350 
produced with a finger stroke then with
our<00:01:39.560> hands<00:01:39.860> back<00:01:40.159> in<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.520> initial<00:01:40.970> starting
