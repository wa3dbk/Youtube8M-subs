00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:13.030
 Hello, I want to show you 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.920
 a major purchase is a bustling 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.630
 juicer 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.630
 I have long wanted to buy a juicer 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:30.640
 finally bought help shoot 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.640
 video you will love either say hi 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:41.780
 yes she is with us always my helpers 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:46.140
 helps want home first see 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:52.410
 Generally if she represents how 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:55.739
 understands such a world pusher for 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.820
 fruit vegetables apples elect she 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.820
 pretty easy 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:26.900
 from stainless steel . 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:26.900
 this does not mean arson capacity 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.500
 principle, here's another so she understands 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.840
 more and more does not understand that is 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.460
 to wash this part of it do not touch a 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.810
 maybe so much 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.290
 directly those parts that 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.290
 in contact with products 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.990
 so it goes to such a reservoir 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:58.580
 for juice 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.580
 it's small for only 500 milliliters 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:22.790
 enough try show you how much 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.790
 juice she squeezes 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:35.780
 loved for example let's take 5 small 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:41.050
 apples such they just fit here 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:46.610
 here it is not very good that is how 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:51.140
 stated here and wolves sting for 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:56.480
 serving whole fruits and vegetables and large 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:03:00.250
 i'm where they are; well that's it too 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:06.440
 Well, that's basically it slipped 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:12.220
 so also here there is such here 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:16.660
 illumination around the switch from 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.880
 juicers 2 speeds 1 and 2 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.960
 well basically for squeezing apples and 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:28.310
 carrots are not enough 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:30.740
 1 2 not yet used so that 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.100
 scare you class so like a juicer 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:39.220
 roars I do not know there are those who 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.220
 no promise at all doubt 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.550
 I think at high power any 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.500
 juicer will still make noise 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.620
 now I mean squeeze these apples 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.620
 carrots and accordingly show you how 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:59.370
 pak got from here this amount 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.260
 products like this juicer 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:09.410
 looks immediately after the end 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:17.780
 I just got the work done 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:17.780
 but 450 milliliters 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:36.470
 itself such a state that is 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:43.340
 tight on but here is not all accumulated 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:47.030
 fly into the tank to press to but principle 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:55.880
 works and does not reflect the reservoir 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:05:01.100
 with all you have to think so 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:04.070
 pretty dry don't know less than 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:07.370
 compare since the juicer doesn't 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:13.430
 was still and the same steel mother 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:17.080
 juicer I can not say more, plus 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:20.810
 this juicer is that there is 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:23.120
 shutdown as much as mine if 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.250
 something in the process will go wrong then 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.870
 turns on 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:30.410
 maybe out of some sort of stick from apples 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:34.100
 It falls well that here is something that's big 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:37.220
 there is a kind of fuse against 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:46.160
 breakage she washes too pretty 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:50.560
 easy overall i like i think that 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.560
 this is a necessary thing lady 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:57.860
 porsche in general, like so thanks for that 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:57.860
