have<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.270> cut<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.420> down<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.780> as<00:00:51.870> well<00:00:52.110> but

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
have to cut it down here as well but

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.959 
have to cut it down here as well but
it's<00:00:52.770> no<00:00:52.890> big<00:00:53.070> deal<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.309> just<00:00:53.340> took<00:00:53.550> an<00:00:53.699> angle

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
it's no big deal I just took an angle

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.930 
it's no big deal I just took an angle
grinder<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.390> chop-chop<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.550> you<00:00:56.550> know<00:00:56.640> this

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
grinder and chop-chop and you know this

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.250 
grinder and chop-chop and you know this
test<00:00:57.180> fitted<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.539> made<00:00:57.690> sure<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.840> fit<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.170> then

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
test fitted it made sure it fit and then

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.720 
test fitted it made sure it fit and then
it's<00:00:58.469> done

stainless<00:01:02.730> steel<00:01:02.989> brake<00:01:03.989> lines<00:01:04.260> here<00:01:04.589> I

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
stainless steel brake lines here I

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.219 
stainless steel brake lines here I
didn't<00:01:06.360> really<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.689> how<00:01:06.810> close<00:01:07.049> they<00:01:07.200> came

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
didn't really like how close they came

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.200 
didn't really like how close they came
to<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.530> sway<00:01:07.740> barn<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.310> stuff<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> put<00:01:09.060> this

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
to the sway barn and stuff so I put this

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.120 
to the sway barn and stuff so I put this
5/16<00:01:09.840> fuel<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.260> I'd<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.500> split<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.830> lengthwise

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
5/16 fuel on I'd to split it lengthwise

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.070 
5/16 fuel on I'd to split it lengthwise
wrapped<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.150> around<00:01:12.210> there<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.600> zip<00:01:12.750> tied<00:01:12.930> it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
wrapped it around there and zip tied it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.690 
wrapped it around there and zip tied it
and<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.290> just<00:01:13.500> gives<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.220> more<00:01:14.310> abrasion

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
and that just gives it more abrasion

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.380 
and that just gives it more abrasion
resistance<00:01:16.520> you<00:01:17.520> can<00:01:17.549> see<00:01:17.759> my<00:01:17.909> ball<00:01:18.150> joint

in the way it didn't come with the

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.320 
in the way it didn't come with the
reservoir<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.610> had<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.850> go<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.090> junkyard

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
reservoir so I had to go to a junkyard

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.600 
reservoir so I had to go to a junkyard
and<00:02:18.480> get<00:02:18.690> get<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.020> reservoir<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.740> v6<00:02:20.130> 4runner

and get get a reservoir the v6 4runner

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.630 
and get get a reservoir the v6 4runner
2nd<00:02:21.270> gen<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.630> had<00:02:22.350> a<00:02:22.380> dual<00:02:23.040> diaphragm<00:02:23.430> brake

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
2nd gen I had a dual diaphragm brake

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.020 
2nd gen I had a dual diaphragm brake
booster<00:02:23.819> as<00:02:24.060> well<00:02:24.240> from<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:25.520> 2nd<00:02:26.520> gen<00:02:26.640> 4runner

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
booster as well from the 2nd gen 4runner

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.930 
booster as well from the 2nd gen 4runner
v6<00:02:27.450> but<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.380> didn't<00:02:28.860> work<00:02:29.010> at<00:02:29.160> all<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.310> put<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.819> on

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
v6 but it didn't work at all I put it on

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.540 
v6 but it didn't work at all I put it on
there<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.300> then<00:02:30.450> had<00:02:31.200> no<00:02:31.260> brakes<00:02:31.620> at<00:02:31.800> all<00:02:31.950> well

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
there and then had no brakes at all well

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.630 
there and then had no brakes at all well
no<00:02:33.030> power<00:02:33.300> brakes<00:02:33.480> anyway<00:02:34.130> so<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.160> got<00:02:35.489> the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
no power brakes anyway so I got the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.090 
no power brakes anyway so I got the
stock<00:02:35.700> single<00:02:36.180> diaphragm<00:02:36.630> there<00:02:36.950> I'm<00:02:37.950> still

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
stock single diaphragm there I'm still

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.640 
stock single diaphragm there I'm still
going<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.250> pick<00:02:38.400> one<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.610> those<00:02:38.700> up<00:02:39.470> let's<00:02:40.470> see

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
going to pick one of those up let's see

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.670 
going to pick one of those up let's see
for<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.280> brake<00:02:41.459> lines<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:42.000> was<00:02:42.840> able<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.170> bend

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
for the brake lines I was able to bend

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.930 
for the brake lines I was able to bend
them<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.950> fit<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.489> still<00:02:44.670> looks<00:02:44.880> pretty

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
them to fit so it still looks pretty

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.530 
them to fit so it still looks pretty
much<00:02:45.209> stock<00:02:45.510> there<00:02:45.780> and<00:02:46.459> for<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.519> wiring<00:02:47.730> you

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
much stock there and for the wiring you

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.830 
much stock there and for the wiring you
can<00:02:48.630> see<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:48.810> have<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.410> factory<00:02:49.860> plug<00:02:50.040> there<00:02:50.310> and

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
can see I have a factory plug there and

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.660 
can see I have a factory plug there and
that<00:02:51.840> wire<00:02:52.019> runs<00:02:52.350> down<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.890> another<00:02:53.190> factory

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
that wire runs down to another factory

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.309 
that wire runs down to another factory
plug<00:02:53.900> so<00:02:54.900> in<00:02:55.319> inside<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.870> selectable

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
plug so in inside this the selectable

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.870 
plug so in inside this the selectable
tape<00:02:58.530> here's<00:02:58.709> where<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:58.980> soldered<00:02:59.340> two<00:02:59.519> pieces

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
tape here's where I soldered two pieces

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.430 
tape here's where I soldered two pieces
together<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:01.530> it<00:03:01.620> uses<00:03:01.769> factory<00:03:02.220> plugs<00:03:02.519> I

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
together so it uses factory plugs I

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.930 
together so it uses factory plugs I
didn't<00:03:04.440> have<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.680> flare<00:03:04.950> any<00:03:05.190> lines<00:03:05.489> I<00:03:05.790> just

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
didn't have to flare any lines I just

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.180 
didn't have to flare any lines I just
had<00:03:06.660> to<00:03:06.750> bend<00:03:06.930> this<00:03:07.110> because<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.680> stock<00:03:07.950> one

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
had to bend this because the stock one

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.940 
had to bend this because the stock one
this<00:03:08.910> comes<00:03:09.450> in<00:03:09.630> to<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.780> top<00:03:09.989> but<00:03:10.470> obviously

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
this comes in to the top but obviously

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.350 
this comes in to the top but obviously
it<00:03:11.069> needs<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.280> go<00:03:11.370> into<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.580> side<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.060> just

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
it needs to go into the side so I just

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.900 
it needs to go into the side so I just
bent<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.660> over<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.920> loosened<00:03:14.549> this<00:03:14.720> this<00:03:16.910> line

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
bent it over I loosened this this line

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.810 
bent it over I loosened this this line
bolt<00:03:18.209> right<00:03:18.390> here<00:03:19.100> rotated<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.190> over<00:03:20.430> got<00:03:20.579> to

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
bolt right here rotated it over got to

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.640 
bolt right here rotated it over got to
line<00:03:21.209> up<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.480> then<00:03:21.540> tighten<00:03:21.750> back<00:03:21.989> down<00:03:22.200> and

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
line up and then tighten back down and

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.350 
line up and then tighten back down and
of<00:03:23.220> course<00:03:23.400> I<00:03:23.549> am<00:03:23.670> telling<00:03:23.910> you<00:03:24.000> about<00:03:24.120> how<00:03:24.329> I

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
of course I am telling you about how I

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.150 
of course I am telling you about how I
did<00:03:24.600> my<00:03:24.720> proportioning<00:03:25.410> valve<00:03:25.470> pleat<00:03:25.860> so<00:03:26.070> you

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
did my proportioning valve pleat so you

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.500 
did my proportioning valve pleat so you
have<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.340> put<00:03:26.489> in<00:03:26.579> a<00:03:26.670> manual<00:03:26.970> proportioning

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
have to put in a manual proportioning

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.300 
have to put in a manual proportioning
valve<00:03:27.540> so<00:03:28.320> here's<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.560> one<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.709> got<00:03:28.920> I<00:03:28.950> got<00:03:29.130> from

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
valve so here's the one I got I got from

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.310 
valve so here's the one I got I got from
LC<00:03:29.579> engineering<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.959> have<00:03:31.079> to<00:03:31.170> buy<00:03:31.260> these

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
LC engineering you have to buy these

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.080 
LC engineering you have to buy these
sway<00:03:31.980> Glocks<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.579> think<00:03:32.790> they're<00:03:32.910> called

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
sway Glocks I think they're called

Swagelok sway Glock I'm not sure but you

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.699 
Swagelok sway Glock I'm not sure but you
don't<00:03:36.780> have<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:36.989> flare<00:03:37.230> anything<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.680> just

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
don't have to flare anything you just

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.410 
don't have to flare anything you just
cut<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.100> line<00:03:38.130> you<00:03:38.820> stick<00:03:39.030> them<00:03:39.090> in<00:03:39.239> there<00:03:39.299> and

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
cut the line you stick them in there and

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.569

the bracket that bolts into that hole

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.949 
the bracket that bolts into that hole
and<00:03:59.030> got<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.090> couple<00:04:00.239> of<00:04:00.390> bolts<00:04:00.540> there<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.870> hold

you need to else because what happens is
there's<00:04:22.420> one<00:04:22.570> that<00:04:22.720> goes<00:04:22.780> to<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:23.050> front<00:04:23.290> from

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
there's one that goes to the front from

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.960 
there's one that goes to the front from
the<00:04:23.500> map<00:04:23.710> from<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.280> master<00:04:24.700> cylinder<00:04:24.940> and

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
the map from the master cylinder and

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.460 
the map from the master cylinder and
those<00:04:25.150> bonus<00:04:25.540> goods<00:04:25.750> to<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.050> route<00:04:26.230> that<00:04:26.440> goes

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
those bonus goods to the route that goes

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.080 
those bonus goods to the route that goes
to<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.800> rear<00:04:26.980> and<00:04:27.190> then<00:04:27.730> from<00:04:27.970> the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
to the rear and then from the

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.430 
to the rear and then from the
proportioning<00:04:28.630> valve<00:04:28.660> there's<00:04:29.110> one<00:04:29.320> that

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
proportioning valve there's one that

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.170 
proportioning valve there's one that
comes<00:04:29.560> back<00:04:29.920> and<00:04:30.190> feeds<00:04:30.580> into<00:04:30.820> the<00:04:30.970> front

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
comes back and feeds into the front

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.430 
comes back and feeds into the front
brakes<00:04:31.420> because<00:04:31.600> what<00:04:31.810> it<00:04:31.870> does<00:04:31.990> is<00:04:32.110> it<00:04:32.260> feeds

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
brakes because what it does is it feeds

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.660 
brakes because what it does is it feeds
extra<00:04:32.860> pressure<00:04:33.040> from<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.340> rear<00:04:33.490> to<00:04:33.520> the

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
extra pressure from the rear to the

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.740 
extra pressure from the rear to the
front<00:04:33.760> that's<00:04:34.030> how<00:04:34.150> the<00:04:34.210> proportioning<00:04:34.720> valve

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
front that's how the proportioning valve

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.350 
front that's how the proportioning valve
works<00:04:35.550> but<00:04:36.550> obviously<00:04:36.910> you're<00:04:37.030> not<00:04:37.180> going<00:04:37.300> to

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
works but obviously you're not going to

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.400 
works but obviously you're not going to
have<00:04:37.450> that<00:04:37.570> there<00:04:37.750> so<00:04:37.930> you're<00:04:38.110> not<00:04:38.230> going<00:04:38.350> to

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
have that there so you're not going to

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.320 
have that there so you're not going to
need<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.710> T<00:04:38.950> fitting<00:04:39.250> there<00:04:39.370> so<00:04:39.730> you<00:04:39.790> can

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
need the T fitting there so you can

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.330 
need the T fitting there so you can
either<00:04:40.420> block<00:04:40.690> it<00:04:40.840> off<00:04:40.990> we<00:04:41.680> can<00:04:41.860> get<00:04:42.010> another<00:04:42.160> L

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
either block it off we can get another L

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.700 
either block it off we can get another L
fitting<00:04:42.810> kind<00:04:43.810> of<00:04:43.900> cut<00:04:44.200> off<00:04:44.230> the<00:04:44.440> tee<00:04:44.590> fitting

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
fitting kind of cut off the tee fitting

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.020 
fitting kind of cut off the tee fitting
and<00:04:44.950> wall<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.190> L<00:04:45.310> fitting<00:04:45.580> there<00:04:45.700> which<00:04:45.940> is

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
and wall the L fitting there which is

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.660 
and wall the L fitting there which is
what<00:04:46.150> I<00:04:46.210> did<00:04:46.860> and<00:04:47.860> then<00:04:48.040> you<00:04:48.160> end<00:04:48.310> up<00:04:48.490> with<00:04:48.640> a

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
what I did and then you end up with a

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.100 
what I did and then you end up with a
real<00:04:48.880> factory<00:04:49.270> looking<00:04:49.510> connection<00:04:49.930> here

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
real factory looking connection here

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.720 
real factory looking connection here
it's<00:04:50.500> two<00:04:50.620> L<00:04:50.770> fittings<00:04:51.100> no<00:04:52.090> mess<00:04:52.360> no<00:04:52.900> extra

brake lines hanging around well there

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.530 
brake lines hanging around well there
was<00:04:55.990> but<00:04:56.500> I<00:04:56.560> took<00:04:56.620> it<00:04:56.830> out<00:04:56.980> you<00:04:57.250> know<00:04:57.370> just<00:04:57.700> cut

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
was but I took it out you know just cut

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.250 
was but I took it out you know just cut
it<00:04:58.630> and<00:04:58.840> then<00:04:59.530> get<00:05:00.130> out<00:05:00.250> of<00:05:00.310> the<00:05:00.400> way<00:05:01.230> so<00:05:02.230> that

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
it and then get out of the way so that

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.160 
it and then get out of the way so that
looks<00:05:02.530> all<00:05:02.650> factory<00:05:03.040> there<00:05:03.840> then<00:05:04.840> if<00:05:04.960> you<00:05:05.050> head

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
looks all factory there then if you head

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.480 
looks all factory there then if you head
to<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:05.380> rear<00:05:05.590> you<00:05:05.860> can<00:05:05.980> see<00:05:06.160> there's<00:05:06.400> a

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
to the rear you can see there's a

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.270 
to the rear you can see there's a
there's<00:05:07.200> a<00:05:08.200> line<00:05:08.470> then<00:05:08.650> I<00:05:08.680> cut<00:05:08.890> that<00:05:09.070> to<00:05:09.190> the

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
there's a line then I cut that to the

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.150 
there's a line then I cut that to the
return<00:05:09.580> line<00:05:09.760> it<00:05:09.940> comes<00:05:10.030> from<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:11.560> stock<00:05:11.830> LS

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
and turned into an L and then I got

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.270 
and turned into an L and then I got
another<00:05:18.490> one<00:05:18.700> of<00:05:18.760> those<00:05:18.790> options<00:05:19.270> and<00:05:20.160> put<00:05:21.160> it

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
another one of those options and put it

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.410 
another one of those options and put it
where<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:22.230> this<00:05:23.230> line<00:05:23.500> comes<00:05:23.740> from<00:05:24.420> the

where the this line comes from the
master<00:05:25.750> cylinder<00:05:25.780> and<00:05:26.290> then<00:05:27.070> it<00:05:27.190> would<00:05:27.310> go

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
master cylinder and then it would go

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.150 
master cylinder and then it would go
into<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.790> LS<00:05:28.480> PV<00:05:28.780> but<00:05:29.470> now<00:05:29.620> it<00:05:29.740> goes<00:05:29.830> into<00:05:29.890> this

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
into the LS PV but now it goes into this

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.910 
into the LS PV but now it goes into this
L<00:05:30.370> and<00:05:30.640> this<00:05:31.270> comes<00:05:31.600> normally<00:05:32.230> from<00:05:32.380> the<00:05:32.530> LS<00:05:32.740> PB

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.940 
L and this comes normally from the LS PB
but<00:05:33.580> now<00:05:33.670> it<00:05:33.790> just<00:05:33.820> comes<00:05:34.120> from<00:05:34.270> this<00:05:34.390> L

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950

fitting<00:05:37.450> and<00:05:37.660> then<00:05:38.350> it<00:05:38.440> goes<00:05:38.560> to<00:05:39.600> the<00:05:40.600> rubrics

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
fitting and then it goes to the rubrics

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.360 
fitting and then it goes to the rubrics
and<00:05:41.260> you<00:05:41.470> can<00:05:41.590> see<00:05:41.710> I<00:05:41.740> have<00:05:41.860> another<00:05:42.070> stainless

steel braided line here and that just

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.470 
steel braided line here and that just
goes<00:05:45.040> to<00:05:45.100> the<00:05:45.280> ribery<00:05:45.550> now<00:05:46.000> I<00:05:46.030> didn't<00:05:46.270> replace

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
goes to the ribery now I didn't replace

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.360 
goes to the ribery now I didn't replace
the<00:05:46.690> drums<00:05:46.930> but<00:05:47.440> I<00:05:47.470> did<00:05:47.680> replace<00:05:47.980> the<00:05:48.160> wheel

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
the drums but I did replace the wheel

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.000 
the drums but I did replace the wheel
cylinders<00:05:48.910> and<00:05:49.060> I<00:05:49.750> got<00:05:49.930> Wilson<00:05:50.140> cylinders

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010

Toyota<00:05:53.650> Landcruiser<00:05:54.190> and<00:05:54.460> those<00:05:55.360> bolt<00:05:55.600> right

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
Toyota Landcruiser and those bolt right

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.170 
Toyota Landcruiser and those bolt right
in<00:05:55.870> but<00:05:56.050> they're<00:05:56.200> a<00:05:56.230> larger<00:05:56.620> diameter<00:05:57.120> so<00:05:58.120> you

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
in but they're a larger diameter so you

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.570 
in but they're a larger diameter so you
get<00:05:58.300> better<00:05:58.450> brakes<00:05:58.690> in<00:05:58.840> the<00:05:58.870> rear<00:05:59.400> the<00:06:00.400> only

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
get better brakes in the rear the only

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.800 
get better brakes in the rear the only
thing<00:06:00.730> I<00:06:00.820> haven't<00:06:01.000> done<00:06:01.150> to<00:06:01.330> secure<00:06:01.690> this

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
thing I haven't done to secure this

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.320 
thing I haven't done to secure this
because<00:06:02.050> it<00:06:02.170> is<00:06:02.650> kind<00:06:02.860> of<00:06:02.920> wobbly<00:06:03.310> I<00:06:03.490> don't

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
because it is kind of wobbly I don't

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.910 
because it is kind of wobbly I don't
know<00:06:04.390> over<00:06:04.630> times<00:06:04.810> how<00:06:05.020> fatigued<00:06:05.440> the<00:06:05.650> lines

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:05.920 
know over times how fatigued the lines

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.650 
know over times how fatigued the lines
so<00:06:06.370> I'm<00:06:06.460> just<00:06:06.580> going<00:06:06.760> to<00:06:06.790> make<00:06:07.420> a<00:06:07.450> little

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
so I'm just going to make a little

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.760 
so I'm just going to make a little
bracket<00:06:07.900> and<00:06:08.200> have<00:06:08.320> that<00:06:08.530> secured<00:06:09.220> total<00:06:10.770> so

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
bracket and have that secured total so

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.650 
bracket and have that secured total so
for<00:06:11.950> the<00:06:12.010> LSP<00:06:12.250> V<00:06:12.550> delete<00:06:12.880> what<00:06:13.390> do<00:06:13.480> you<00:06:13.540> need

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
for the LSP V delete what do you need

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.500 
for the LSP V delete what do you need
exactly<00:06:14.790> what<00:06:15.790> you<00:06:15.850> need<00:06:16.000> to<00:06:16.090> get<00:06:16.240> two<00:06:16.480> of

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:16.510 
exactly what you need to get two of

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:19.320 
exactly what you need to get two of
these<00:06:16.980> brackets<00:06:17.980> so<00:06:18.670> that<00:06:18.700> you<00:06:18.850> can<00:06:18.970> cut<00:06:19.150> the

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
these brackets so that you can cut the

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.550 
these brackets so that you can cut the
elf<00:06:19.840> innings<00:06:20.140> off<00:06:20.290> and<00:06:20.730> then

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.380 

and<00:06:24.770> then<00:06:25.190> you'll<00:06:25.340> have<00:06:25.430> an<00:06:25.610> extra<00:06:25.700> then<00:06:26.300> you

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
and then you'll have an extra then you

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.030 
and then you'll have an extra then you
have<00:06:26.510> your<00:06:26.630> original<00:06:26.720> one<00:06:27.140> because<00:06:27.800> you<00:06:27.890> take

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.040 
have your original one because you take

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.650 
have your original one because you take
the<00:06:28.160> two<00:06:28.310> you<00:06:28.490> make<00:06:28.670> them<00:06:28.790> into<00:06:28.940> outfitting

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:29.660 
the two you make them into outfitting

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.390 
the two you make them into outfitting
ones<00:06:29.840> and<00:06:30.410> then<00:06:30.560> you<00:06:30.590> have<00:06:30.770> your<00:06:30.890> original<00:06:30.980> one

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
ones and then you have your original one

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.150 
ones and then you have your original one
still<00:06:31.700> and<00:06:31.820> you'll<00:06:32.180> use<00:06:32.330> that<00:06:32.360> outfitting<00:06:33.160> for

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
still and you'll use that outfitting for

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.980 
still and you'll use that outfitting for
the<00:06:34.250> back<00:06:34.400> to<00:06:34.760> go<00:06:35.570> where<00:06:35.750> the<00:06:35.840> LSPD<00:06:36.350> was<00:06:37.990> then

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
the back to go where the LSPD was then

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.290 
the back to go where the LSPD was then
you'll<00:06:39.170> have<00:06:39.350> a<00:06:39.650> line<00:06:39.950> that<00:06:40.670> is<00:06:40.850> the<00:06:41.060> pressure

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
you'll have a line that is the pressure

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.000 
you'll have a line that is the pressure
per<00:06:41.510> turn<00:06:41.690> line<00:06:41.840> from<00:06:42.020> the<00:06:42.170> LSP<00:06:42.440> v<00:06:42.650> to<00:06:42.890> the

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
per turn line from the LSP v to the

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:44.830 
per turn line from the LSP v to the
front<00:06:43.190> brakes<00:06:43.400> that<00:06:44.150> will<00:06:44.300> be<00:06:44.390> open<00:06:44.630> at<00:06:44.720> either

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
front brakes that will be open at either

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.720 
front brakes that will be open at either
end<00:06:45.140> so<00:06:45.350> you<00:06:45.650> can<00:06:45.920> leave<00:06:46.100> it<00:06:46.130> there<00:06:46.310> hanging<00:06:46.490> I

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:46.730 
end so you can leave it there hanging I

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:47.890 
end so you can leave it there hanging I
did<00:06:46.940> that<00:06:47.060> for<00:06:47.150> about<00:06:47.240> a<00:06:47.390> week<00:06:47.510> and<00:06:47.720> then<00:06:47.810> I

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900 
did that for about a week and then I

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.240 
did that for about a week and then I
finally<00:06:48.200> got<00:06:48.290> around<00:06:48.440> to<00:06:48.620> taking<00:06:48.740> it<00:06:48.920> out<00:06:49.070> and

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
finally got around to taking it out and

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.150 
finally got around to taking it out and
then<00:06:49.970> you'll<00:06:50.150> have<00:06:50.240> no<00:06:50.450> lines<00:06:50.660> I<00:06:51.620> only<00:06:51.950> have<00:06:52.130> a

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 
then you'll have no lines I only have a

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.620 
then you'll have no lines I only have a
bit<00:06:52.340> above<00:06:52.550> the<00:06:52.610> tank<00:06:52.910> because<00:06:53.240> I<00:06:53.270> couldn't

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:53.630 
bit above the tank because I couldn't

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.350 
bit above the tank because I couldn't
really<00:06:53.750> get<00:06:54.410> to<00:06:54.590> it<00:06:54.820> put<00:06:55.820> the<00:06:55.910> tank<00:06:56.090> out<00:06:56.240> I'll

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 
really get to it put the tank out I'll

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.640 
really get to it put the tank out I'll

don't have messed up lines going all
over<00:07:08.990> the<00:07:09.230> place<00:07:09.440> you<00:07:09.620> don't<00:07:09.650> have<00:07:09.890> things

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.190 
over the place you don't have things

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:11.920 
over the place you don't have things
that<00:07:10.280> look<00:07:10.340> on<00:07:10.580> factory<00:07:11.030> you<00:07:11.540> know<00:07:11.630> I<00:07:11.660> wanted

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
that look on factory you know I wanted

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.300 
that look on factory you know I wanted
this<00:07:12.050> to<00:07:12.200> look<00:07:12.290> real<00:07:12.500> clean<00:07:12.740> so<00:07:12.950> that's<00:07:13.130> why<00:07:13.280> I

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.310 
this to look real clean so that's why I

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.560 
this to look real clean so that's why I
did<00:07:13.550> it<00:07:13.580> this<00:07:13.700> way<00:07:13.820> I<00:07:14.000> made<00:07:14.270> the<00:07:14.390> special

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:14.570 
did it this way I made the special

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.170 
did it this way I made the special
bracket<00:07:15.080> with<00:07:15.200> two<00:07:15.380> L<00:07:15.530> fittings<00:07:15.919> in<00:07:16.850> the<00:07:17.000> back

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.180 
bracket with two L fittings in the back

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.580 
bracket with two L fittings in the back
that's<00:07:17.480> the<00:07:17.660> only<00:07:17.870> thing<00:07:18.050> that<00:07:18.169> looks<00:07:18.320> kind<00:07:18.560> of

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:18.590 
that's the only thing that looks kind of

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.400 
that's the only thing that looks kind of
hokey<00:07:18.890> but<00:07:19.100> you<00:07:19.190> know<00:07:19.900> it<00:07:20.900> should<00:07:21.080> clean<00:07:21.290> up

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:21.410 
hokey but you know it should clean up

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.870 
hokey but you know it should clean up
okay<00:07:21.560> once<00:07:21.890> I<00:07:21.980> make<00:07:22.130> the<00:07:22.250> bracket<00:07:22.610> and<00:07:22.730> get

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 
okay once I make the bracket and get

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.790 
okay once I make the bracket and get
that<00:07:23.030> extra<00:07:23.360> piece<00:07:23.480> of<00:07:23.510> line<00:07:23.750> out<00:07:23.930> and<00:07:24.530> under

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 
that extra piece of line out and under

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.050 
that extra piece of line out and under
the<00:07:24.890> hood<00:07:25.040> it's<00:07:25.190> pretty<00:07:25.400> much<00:07:25.490> all<00:07:25.669> too<00:07:25.850> in<00:07:25.970> a

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:26.060 
the hood it's pretty much all too in a

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.060 
the hood it's pretty much all too in a
hardware<00:07:26.300> I<00:07:26.660> didn't<00:07:27.290> have<00:07:27.410> to<00:07:27.500> cut<00:07:27.680> or<00:07:27.830> flare

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.070 
hardware I didn't have to cut or flare

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:29.890 
hardware I didn't have to cut or flare
any<00:07:28.280> lines<00:07:28.550> or<00:07:28.700> any<00:07:28.850> why<00:07:29.000> that<00:07:29.240> cut<00:07:29.479> that<00:07:29.630> for

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:29.900 
any lines or any why that cut that for

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.060 
any lines or any why that cut that for
the<00:07:30.020> proportion<00:07:30.320> valve<00:07:30.650> but<00:07:30.800> I<00:07:30.830> didn't<00:07:30.979> have

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:31.070 
the proportion valve but I didn't have

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.320 
the proportion valve but I didn't have
to<00:07:31.190> cut<00:07:31.340> a<00:07:31.370> reef<00:07:31.580> Larry<00:07:31.790> any<00:07:31.850> lines<00:07:32.060> up<00:07:32.210> here

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:32.330 
to cut a reef Larry any lines up here

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.050 
to cut a reef Larry any lines up here
for<00:07:32.479> the<00:07:32.570> master<00:07:33.470> cylinder<00:07:33.790> everything<00:07:34.790> still

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:35.060 
for the master cylinder everything still

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.719 
for the master cylinder everything still
routes<00:07:35.270> the<00:07:35.450> same<00:07:35.690> way<00:07:35.930> and<00:07:36.919> then<00:07:37.310> I<00:07:37.340> got<00:07:37.520> that

00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:37.729 
routes the same way and then I got that

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:39.630 
routes the same way and then I got that
custom<00:07:38.240> proportioning<00:07:38.690> valve<00:07:38.720> in<00:07:39.020> there<00:07:39.229> and

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:39.640 
custom proportioning valve in there and

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.550 
custom proportioning valve in there and
made<00:07:40.640> that<00:07:40.820> bracket<00:07:41.060> for<00:07:41.450> it<00:07:41.570> so<00:07:41.750> it<00:07:42.140> bolts<00:07:42.440> in

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 
made that bracket for it so it bolts in

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:44.830 
made that bracket for it so it bolts in
there<00:07:42.680> real<00:07:42.830> nice<00:07:42.979> and<00:07:43.220> looks<00:07:43.370> you<00:07:44.060> know<00:07:44.150> looks

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:44.840 
there real nice and looks you know looks

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.810 
there real nice and looks you know looks
clean<00:07:45.110> doesn't<00:07:45.410> look<00:07:45.590> factory<00:07:46.010> but<00:07:46.550> it<00:07:46.640> looks

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:46.820 
clean doesn't look factory but it looks
