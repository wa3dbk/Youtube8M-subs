00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
let's see here it's got basic pictures

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.160 
let's see here it's got basic pictures
and<00:01:49.060> diagrams<00:01:49.179> it's<00:01:49.780> got<00:01:49.899> a<00:01:49.929> little<00:01:50.020> more

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
and diagrams it's got a little more

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.930 
and diagrams it's got a little more
information<00:01:50.349> the<00:01:50.890> other<00:01:50.979> manual<00:01:51.399> type<00:01:51.789> of

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
information the other manual type of

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.150 
information the other manual type of
tools<00:01:52.119> you<00:01:52.270> need<00:01:53.489> torque<00:01:54.489> specs<00:01:54.819> four<00:01:55.090> bolts

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
tools you need torque specs four bolts

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.820 
tools you need torque specs four bolts
so<00:01:57.160> I<00:01:57.190> think<00:01:57.789> this<00:01:58.030> covers<00:01:58.209> a<00:01:59.039> 2000<00:02:00.039> to<00:02:00.160> 2009

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
so I think this covers a 2000 to 2009

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.630 
so I think this covers a 2000 to 2009
well<00:02:02.830> you<00:02:02.920> know<00:02:03.009> it's<00:02:03.130> got<00:02:03.220> everything<00:02:03.550> you

and then I'll go directly hooked up to

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.399 
and then I'll go directly hooked up to
the<00:02:25.859> computer<00:02:25.950> there<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.780> we'll<00:02:28.049> go<00:02:28.230> over<00:02:28.260> to

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
the computer there and we'll go over to
