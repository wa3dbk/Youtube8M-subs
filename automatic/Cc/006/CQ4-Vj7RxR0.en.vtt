straight I kind of like this back any of

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.200 
straight I kind of like this back any of
those<00:01:05.720> kind<00:01:05.900> of<00:01:05.960> old<00:01:06.140> school<00:01:07.060> whenever<00:01:08.060> you

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
those kind of old school whenever you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.120

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
take a crossover step it it gives you it

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.740 
take a crossover step it it gives you it
makes<00:01:10.280> you<00:01:10.400> take<00:01:10.640> one<00:01:10.880> more<00:01:10.909> step<00:01:11.060> to<00:01:11.390> recover

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
makes you take one more step to recover
