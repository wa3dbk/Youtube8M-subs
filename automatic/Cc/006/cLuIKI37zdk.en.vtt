00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
circuit it doesn't matter so I mean

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.910 
circuit it doesn't matter so I mean
let's<00:01:06.840> not<00:01:06.930> just<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> hundred<00:01:07.439> percent<00:01:07.500> jump

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
let's not just a hundred percent jump

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.399 
let's not just a hundred percent jump
shit<00:01:08.220> go<00:01:08.490> over<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.700> Cod<00:01:08.909> okay<00:01:09.720> I've<00:01:10.080> played<00:01:10.320> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
shit go over to Cod okay I've played the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.510 
shit go over to Cod okay I've played the
game<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.650> watch<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.040> game<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.460> not

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
game of watch the game it's not

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.280 
game of watch the game it's not
entertaining<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.600> me<00:01:12.689> I<00:01:12.720> understand<00:01:13.170> it's

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
entertaining to me I understand it's

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.719 
entertaining to me I understand it's
incredible<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> other<00:01:14.010> spectators<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.610> can

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
incredible the other spectators you can

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.100 
incredible the other spectators you can
switch<00:01:14.970> between<00:01:15.119> viewers<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.720> can<00:01:15.869> literally

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
switch between viewers you can literally

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.200 
switch between viewers you can literally
do<00:01:16.290> an<00:01:16.530> amazing<00:01:16.979> job<00:01:17.189> as<00:01:17.460> commentators<00:01:17.909> that's

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
do an amazing job as commentators that's

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.330 
do an amazing job as commentators that's
awesome<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:19.170> halo<00:01:19.350> 4<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.770> gonna<00:01:19.979> be<00:01:20.100> getting

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
awesome but halo 4 is gonna be getting

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.010 
awesome but halo 4 is gonna be getting
that<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.610> already<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.600> know<00:01:21.689> three<00:01:21.900> for

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
that it's already you know three for

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.420 
that it's already you know three for
three<00:01:22.110> showing<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.650> much<00:01:22.740> interest<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.220> trying

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
three showing so much interest in trying

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.649 
three showing so much interest in trying
to<00:01:23.520> make<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.759> game<00:01:23.880> as<00:01:24.030> good<00:01:24.180> as<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> possibly

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
to make the game as good as a possibly

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.749 
to make the game as good as a possibly
can<00:01:24.840> be<00:01:25.100> they're<00:01:26.100> adding<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> ranking<00:01:26.729> system

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
can be they're adding the ranking system
