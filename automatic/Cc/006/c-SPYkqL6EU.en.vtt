00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.630
 I personally like the overall quality very well 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.250
 especially when you see that this development took place in such a short time 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.310
 has in about 25 years 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.250
 that is considerable 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.230
 OK 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.990
 20 percent had to cope with high percentages 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.559
 The Association of German Art Associations you can find here 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:58.390
 These latest numbers have to be rebooked at 8:20 pm St 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.710
 Published maps for the work 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.820
 Surprise her at the end of the 5 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.800
 I did not really find it was there was no phase had a client 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.420
 by own information inadvertently 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.790
 that the church was the church for us because there was no proof it was 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.790
 exhausting 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.720
 the Swiss 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.580
 the hearts 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.130
 for me it was above all the personal 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.040
 the preparations are 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.560
 so were to present 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 while the summery to be satisfied was not 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.840
 the brake 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.840
 better than the men 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.250
 This includes a chance to have us play the first two 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.330
 during a crew from the Hanseatic city the man was among others 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.700
 also 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.700
 it just did not fit and still served well 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.229
 yes what has happened since then when we started what is this 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:18.909
 my first saxophone in 1937 was a 10 o'clock and I always have the boys 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.229
 played 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:24.149
 I think it is important for the artist that he can do what he wants 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.909
 Lust has 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:29.939
 and that has an instrument with which he does an instrument that Chur 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.280
 does not stop doing what he wants
