00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 
hi I'm tinny from many balls as I and

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.820 
hi I'm tinny from many balls as I and
today<00:00:11.500> i'm<00:00:12.500> working<00:00:12.710> on<00:00:13.010> a<00:00:13.070> new<00:00:13.340> soap<00:00:13.760> design

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
today i'm working on a new soap design

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.930 
today i'm working on a new soap design
i'm<00:00:16.840> taking<00:00:17.840> an<00:00:17.960> m2<00:00:18.410> which<00:00:18.650> is<00:00:18.860> my<00:00:19.039> favorite

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
i'm taking an m2 which is my favorite

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.870 
i'm taking an m2 which is my favorite
stove<00:00:21.520> and<00:00:23.800> basically<00:00:24.800> turned<00:00:25.220> it<00:00:25.340> wrong<00:00:25.550> side

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
stove and basically turned it wrong side

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.190 
stove and basically turned it wrong side
out<00:00:27.670> all<00:00:28.670> the<00:00:28.820> silicone<00:00:29.330> was<00:00:29.510> on<00:00:29.690> the<00:00:29.810> outside

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
out all the silicone was on the outside

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.700 
out all the silicone was on the outside
now<00:00:31.160> it's<00:00:31.370> all<00:00:31.550> on<00:00:31.760> the<00:00:31.880> inside<00:00:32.469> and<00:00:33.469> the

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
now it's all on the inside and the

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.680 
now it's all on the inside and the
aluminum<00:00:34.129> was<00:00:34.280> on<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:34.520> inside<00:00:34.640> is<00:00:35.300> on<00:00:35.570> the

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
aluminum was on the inside is on the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.080 
aluminum was on the inside is on the
outside<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:36.530> i<00:00:36.770> basically<00:00:37.340> turn<00:00:37.760> it<00:00:37.910> wrong

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
outside so i basically turn it wrong

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.880 
outside so i basically turn it wrong
side<00:00:38.390> out<00:00:38.890> which<00:00:39.890> gives<00:00:40.190> a<00:00:41.800> couple<00:00:42.800> of

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
side out which gives a couple of

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.189 
side out which gives a couple of
advantages<00:00:43.489> one<00:00:43.730> is<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.539> silicone<00:00:44.899> is

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
advantages one is the silicone is

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.799 
advantages one is the silicone is
completely<00:00:45.739> away<00:00:46.309> from<00:00:46.339> the<00:00:46.609> flame<00:00:46.879> even<00:00:47.719> if

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
completely away from the flame even if

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.860 
completely away from the flame even if
you<00:00:47.929> grossly<00:00:48.440> over<00:00:48.980> fuel<00:00:49.249> it<00:00:49.489> you<00:00:50.480> won't<00:00:50.659> burn

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
you grossly over fuel it you won't burn

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.360 
you grossly over fuel it you won't burn
the<00:00:51.019> silicone<00:00:51.499> anymore<00:00:52.569> and<00:00:53.569> also<00:00:54.199> by<00:00:55.010> doing

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
the silicone anymore and also by doing

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.549 
the silicone anymore and also by doing
this<00:00:55.579> turn<00:00:56.179> the<00:00:56.300> wrong<00:00:56.479> side<00:00:56.780> out<00:00:56.809> making<00:00:57.440> it

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
this turn the wrong side out making it

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.639 
this turn the wrong side out making it
bigger<00:00:57.739> around<00:00:58.780> there's<00:00:59.780> more<00:00:59.960> volume<00:01:00.440> for

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
bigger around there's more volume for

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.520 
bigger around there's more volume for
alcohol<00:01:01.069> so<00:01:01.789> it<00:01:02.149> burns<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:02.809> little<00:01:02.960> better<00:01:03.229> I'm

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
alcohol so it burns a little better I'm

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.530 
alcohol so it burns a little better I'm
get<00:01:03.889> down<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:04.489> other<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:04.850> I<00:01:04.879> get<00:01:05.180> two<00:01:05.390> and<00:01:05.510> a

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
get down the other so I get two and a

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.800 
get down the other so I get two and a
half<00:01:05.720> minutes<00:01:06.590> on<00:01:07.130> full<00:01:07.850> before<00:01:08.210> I<00:01:08.299> free<00:01:08.540> fuel

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
half minutes on full before I free fuel

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.780 
half minutes on full before I free fuel
and<00:01:09.020> this<00:01:09.170> i<00:01:09.320> can<00:01:09.500> get<00:01:09.620> about<00:01:09.710> three<00:01:10.159> another

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
and this i can get about three another

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.540 
and this i can get about three another
30<00:01:11.150> seconds<00:01:11.660> three<00:01:12.320> three<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:12.590> a<00:01:12.710> half<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.160> a

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
30 seconds three three and a half and a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.400 
30 seconds three three and a half and a
total<00:01:13.940> bird<00:01:14.060> of<00:01:14.210> time<00:01:14.420> is<00:01:14.720> about<00:01:14.930> 10<00:01:15.200> minutes

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
total bird of time is about 10 minutes

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.470 
total bird of time is about 10 minutes
about<00:01:15.620> eight<00:01:15.890> minutes<00:01:16.160> are<00:01:16.370> usable<00:01:16.790> burning

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
about eight minutes are usable burning

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.040 
about eight minutes are usable burning
time<00:01:17.660> for<00:01:17.930> you<00:01:17.990> have<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:18.320> refuel<00:01:18.910> so<00:01:19.930> it's<00:01:20.930> a

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
time for you have to refuel so it's a

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.870 
time for you have to refuel so it's a
little<00:01:21.080> more<00:01:21.380> compact<00:01:21.950> a<00:01:22.340> little<00:01:22.730> more

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
little more compact a little more

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.210 
little more compact a little more
durable<00:01:23.530> and<00:01:24.530> i<00:01:25.460> think<00:01:25.700> i<00:01:25.880> may<00:01:26.920> make<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:27.950> few

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
durable and i think i may make a few

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.730 
durable and i think i may make a few
updates<00:01:28.400> to<00:01:28.790> it<00:01:28.880> do<00:01:29.030> some<00:01:29.240> testing<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:29.900> i<00:01:30.530> may

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
updates to it do some testing and i may

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.360 
updates to it do some testing and i may
sell<00:01:31.070> it<00:01:31.750> i'm<00:01:32.750> not<00:01:32.810> sure<00:01:33.200> what<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.560> call<00:01:33.590> it<00:01:33.830> i'm

not sure whether to take the m2 out and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.480 
not sure whether to take the m2 out and
replace<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:37.730> with<00:01:37.910> this<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:38.420> call<00:01:38.600> a<00:01:38.630> CM<00:01:39.490> 2.2

i have tested a few times and appears to
work<00:01:55.670> a<00:01:55.730> little<00:01:56.330> better<00:01:56.510> than<00:01:56.810> the<00:01:56.900> original

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960
