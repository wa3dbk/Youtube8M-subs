00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
at least thirty years and it's a great

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.930 
at least thirty years and it's a great
system<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.620> shows<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:44.040> how<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.219> cut<00:00:44.489> squares

want to be able to cut shapes you know

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.069 
want to be able to cut shapes you know
quickly<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:54.000> accurately<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.870> great

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
quickly and accurately it's a great

quickly and accurately it's a great
system<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.489> I'm<00:00:56.879> gonna<00:00:57.120> show<00:00:57.420> you

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
system for that so I'm gonna show you

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.139 
system for that so I'm gonna show you
how<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.960> create<00:00:58.260> pieces<00:00:58.800> like<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.940> is

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
how to create pieces like this this is

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.209 
how to create pieces like this this is
before<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.780> fused<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.530> these<00:01:01.649> are<00:01:01.890> all<00:01:02.039> out

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
before it's fused so these are all out

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.969 
before it's fused so these are all out
of<00:01:02.370> two<00:01:02.520> inch<00:01:02.730> squares<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:04.049> each<00:01:04.229> cup<00:01:04.470> square

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
of two inch squares so each cup square

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.460 
of two inch squares so each cup square
was<00:01:05.220> cut<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.670> then<00:01:05.850> it's<00:01:06.210> split<00:01:06.869> with<00:01:07.439> that

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
was cut and then it's split with that

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.460 
was cut and then it's split with that
with<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.070> jig<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.479> stacked<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.229> top<00:01:10.260> of

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
with that jig and and stacked on top of

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.080 
with that jig and and stacked on top of
one<00:01:10.619> another<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.400> piece<00:01:11.670> when<00:01:11.939> it's

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
one another and this piece when it's

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.460 
one another and this piece when it's
fired<00:01:12.360> becomes<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:14.240> piece<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:16.320> this

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
fired becomes a piece like this so this

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.060 
fired becomes a piece like this so this
was<00:01:16.680> fused<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.369> slumped<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.860> it'll<00:01:19.860> be<00:01:19.979> able

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
was fused and slumped so it'll be able

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.100 
was fused and slumped so it'll be able
to<00:01:20.220> show<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.520> how<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.000> cut<00:01:21.240> those<00:01:21.420> pieces<00:01:21.689> like

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
to show you how to cut those pieces like

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.010 
to show you how to cut those pieces like
that<00:01:22.490> and<00:01:23.490> also<00:01:23.640> if<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.360> want<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.570> be<00:01:24.810> able<00:01:24.900> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
that and also if you want to be able to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.219 
that and also if you want to be able to
cut<00:01:25.290> repetitive<00:01:25.979> strips<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.330> actually

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
cut repetitive strips this is actually

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.980 
cut repetitive strips this is actually
from<00:01:28.790> half<00:01:29.790> inch<00:01:30.030> strips<00:01:30.390> or<00:01:30.570> quarter<00:01:30.840> inch

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
from half inch strips or quarter inch

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.660 
from half inch strips or quarter inch
strips<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.650> are<00:01:31.770> stacked<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.250> top<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.520> one

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
strips that are stacked on top of one

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.600 
strips that are stacked on top of one
another<00:01:32.990> both<00:01:33.990> ways<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:35.130> that's<00:01:35.280> another

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
another both ways so that's another

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.490 
another both ways so that's another
thing<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.970> can<00:01:36.119> do<00:01:36.299> with<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.570> system<00:01:36.960> I'm

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
thing you can do with the system I'm

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.289 
thing you can do with the system I'm
also<00:01:37.710> going<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.159> show<00:01:38.430> you<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.700> different<00:01:39.090> way

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
also going to show you a different way

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.990 
also going to show you a different way
to<00:01:39.390> break<00:01:39.750> glass<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.500> before<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.549> they

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
to break glass so before this they

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.149 
to break glass so before this they
started<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.750> actually<00:01:42.869> scored<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.649> surface<00:01:44.009> of

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
started I actually scored the surface of

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.280 
started I actually scored the surface of
this<00:01:44.310> glass<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:45.299> called<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.810> safety

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
this glass and this is called a safety

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.319 
this glass and this is called a safety
break<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> nice<00:01:47.790> way<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.030> break
