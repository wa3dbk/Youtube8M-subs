00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.710
 sculptures bicycles photographs 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.630
 giants and kinder are some of the 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.639
 elements that are throughout all 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.590
 the boulevard of the united nations in the 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.840
 north of I remove one of the spaces 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.240
 public that have been remodeled since 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.609
 three years ago and now they have become 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.099
 in a place to enjoy art and 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.869
 socialization the public space is a 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.240
 important concept in the life of the 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.919
 citizenship because they are the places where 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.770
 the meeting between the 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.500
 citizens in addition to being created as 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.510
 pedestrian walks or meeting places 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.570
 they also harbor the creativity of 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.900
 photographers artists and sculptors who 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.220
 have exhibited their works since 2011 year in 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.200
 the one that was made a sample 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.360
 significant of photographs and 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.910
 Ecuadorians and that's how the 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:55.120
 project photography to open sky is 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.770
 a project that is already three years old and 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.020
 growing every time there is more demand 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.360
 there are a lot of proposals for the 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.409
 present that has proposals for 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.939
 open sky photography exhibits 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.649
 it's good now we're doing the 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.030
 call precisely the new 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:13.799
 call precisely for that and 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.990
 always the idea is to occupy new 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.030
 spaces also that is to go out a 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.500
 little more financed 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.720
 the least urban part of the district to 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.880
 just like the photographs the sculptures 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.220
 they have also occupied these spaces for 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.110
 the enjoyment of citizenship of this 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.350
 way another of the cultural projects 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.899
 is the exhibition removed kindle garden 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.270
 that remains on a stretch of boulevard of 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.740
 the united nations and that was inaugurated 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.509
 in conjunction with other activities 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.580
 musical artistic that was boosted the 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:51.840
 sculptural exhibition of quito ccq 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:55.380

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.520
 sample also from a Christmas story 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.259
 with what really took a 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.929
 permanent activation that is still 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.489
 current in the square we really have 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.200
 many people who are visiting this 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.580
 space that is new but at the same 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.880
 time they run into these 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.730
 exhibitions that bring them closer to what 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.800
 what is the use of public space 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.200
 and feel becoming a site of 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.540
 family meeting in this way the 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.120
 citizens can enjoy art in 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.340
