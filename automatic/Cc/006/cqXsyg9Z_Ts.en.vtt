00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.230
 and 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.120
 good welcome back to jenson box 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.309
 and you know we're on the mobile 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.500
 world congress 2015 and this time 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.570
 We are in the htc stand to try 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.379
 the new flagship of the brand 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.359
 htc one 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.789
 m9 as we can observe aesthetically 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.390
 we are facing a very very similar telephone 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.880
 at htc one m 8 and m7 htc at this time has 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.580
 had quite successful with the design of 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.260
 its wireless htc and flagship and has 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.910
 decided not to change too much the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.890
 inconvenience that I encounter is the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.449
 we always have the htc brand here 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.219
 in the lower part that occupies us 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.870
 space in the terminal and it does more 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.489
 big of what it could be like you see 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.859
 so since uaga 8 also maintains its 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.329
 same screen size 5 inches and in 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:47.879
 this time we have resolution 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.920
 full hd to 7 that has decided the contrary 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.079
 that other brands do not put quad screen 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.760
 hd that we already know that can affect 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.739
 negative effect on battery consumption 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.809
 this time I think that for a 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.670
 5-inch screen is enough 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.499
 Full HD resolution and the quality that 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.389
 we can see on the screen is more than 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:05.880
 acceptable in terms of its interior 

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:08.670
 we found an 810 snapdragon processor 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.250
 and 3 gb ram this processor you know 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.080
 which is 64 bits 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.760
 better and is optimized for both 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.620
 better performance than their 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.660
 previous versions in addition to optimize 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.040
 the battery consumption so that 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.320
 we should arrive without any kind of 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.530
 problem until the end of the day its 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.840
 2,840 milliamperes battery added to 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.700
 its full hd resolution makes us think 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.650
 which is going to last a long time and we are not going to 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.300
 have problems to do even a 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.040
 day and a half and can reach even two 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.119
 days of use of course this is a 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.100
 proof that we will have to do more 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.380
 go ahead when we can try this 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.940
 phone and more thoroughly about the camera 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.190
 a section that has been quite 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.530
 criticized in the previous htc one already 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.780
 know that previously used the 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.430
 ultra pixel technology and the truth is 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.440
 that is not the best technology has been 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.380
 could see that they did not hold the best 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.300
 results your rear camera is 20 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.490
 megapixels we leave technology behind 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.830
 our pixel and we have an interface 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.570
 pretty simple where we found the 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.520
 two panoramas the self mode and for 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.110
 switch to the front camera and some 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.970
 basic adjustments like the balance 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.590
 whites the iso value the truth that is 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.540
 makes a camera very simple to use 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.950
 because the interface has nothing 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.380
 complicated here to do the photography 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.970
 and here we would have the option to record 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.770
 Of video 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.390
 if we switch to the front camera in 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.640
 this time we do keep the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.680
 ultra pixel technology in concrete 4 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.180
 ultra pixels so we have more or 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.220
 minus the same camera that we had in 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.800
 the m 8 in the back but in this 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.900
 occasion in front and one of the most 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.210
 strengths of the htc one we already know that its 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.880
 sound we continue counting on doubles 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.190
 stereo speakers with dolby technology and 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.130
 in addition the technology umts although already 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.390
 you know that you get an audio quality 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.970
 spectacular we could say that htc to 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.130
 today is the brand that best sound 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.080
 is able to transmit through their 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.340
 internal speakers if we talk about their 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.840
 Android version we can see that 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.660
 already has the latest version of 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.690
 Android 5.0 points 2 and the htc version 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.400
 ss 7.0 that does not change too much with 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.290
 compared to its previous version we see that 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.730
 the system does move very fluid and 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.170
 one thing that happened sometimes is that 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.090
 when going to the blind fit 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.110
 and return to normal desktop was 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.330
 true lag 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.250
 however 6 that now that works with 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.260
 total fluidity and it is clear that 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.840
 optimized with respect to the version of 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.850
 htc one 8 of course we can say that 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.300
 htc always does a good job in 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.950
 how much 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.600
 optimization we can see that the 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.710
 software is practically identical that 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.940
 his previous pressures 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:27.580
 we keep keeping a drawer of 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.690
 vertical applications not horizontal 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.640
 following the opposite to the rest of 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.750
 manufacturers and yes we have the 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.180
 double notification bar 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.150
 features of android 5.0 but with 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.660
 interface and appearance of htc sense in 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.580
 htc 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.530
 unlike for example on samsung 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.320
 despite having an internal capacity 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.940
 of 32gb we also have the slot for 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.190
 microsd card which is going to 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.640
 allow to expand the memory very much 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.200
 more of course the new htc one m 9 is 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.090
 a very good terminal but you have to 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.310
 recognize that we have not taken 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.350
 no surprise since almost everything was 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.520
 had previously filtered we counted 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.890
 with the latest snapdragon processor 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.120
 we have bring 20 ram a camera 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.560
 let's hope it exceeds 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.930
 expectations in previous versions 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.060
 and the most spectacular sound we can 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.220
 find on a smartphone as soon as 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.810
 we can buy the official version and 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.710
 we can bring you an in-depth analysis of 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.710
 this device
