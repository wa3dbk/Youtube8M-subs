00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:35.000
A boy from Indiana
he could watch the raindrops glisten

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.989
on hills as emeralds in the grass.

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.350
A boy from Indiana
he could take the time to listen

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.649
to the wind
blowing by.

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:05.670
Now, the 
boy from Indiana's

00:01:05.670 --> 00:02:23.299
traveled 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:03:07.540
miles of country mile

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:17.010
to see the things he wanted so to see.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:30.820
But the 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:50.549
boy from Indiana
stops along the way and smiles

00:03:50.549 --> 00:04:04.430
with his own memories.
