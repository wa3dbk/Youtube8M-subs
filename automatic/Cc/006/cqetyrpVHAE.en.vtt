domination but in search like the hit
detection<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.840> important<00:01:49.380> like

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
detection is so important like

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.319 
detection is so important like
especially<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.610> should<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:50.850> got<00:01:50.970> first<00:01:51.180> he

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329

detection<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:53.189> just<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.579> frustrating

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
detection it's just so frustrating

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.550 
detection it's just so frustrating
search<00:01:54.329> because<00:01:54.689> obviously<00:01:54.960> you<00:01:55.350> can't

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
search because obviously you can't

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.889 
search because obviously you can't

every game although I have to say I did

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.050 
every game although I have to say I did
dashboard<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.530> couple<00:03:52.740> times<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.280> I've<00:03:53.820> said

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
dashboard a couple times and I've said

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.870 
dashboard a couple times and I've said
I'm<00:03:54.120> sure<00:03:54.330> you<00:03:54.420> can<00:03:54.510> understand<00:03:54.870> why<00:03:55.880> it's

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
I'm sure you can understand why it's

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.490 
I'm sure you can understand why it's
been<00:03:57.030> two<00:03:57.180> times<00:03:57.330> so<00:03:57.660> far<00:03:57.690> one<00:03:58.140> time<00:03:58.350> it<00:03:58.470> was

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
been two times so far one time it was

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.900 
been two times so far one time it was
the<00:03:58.650> Search<00:03:58.860> and<00:03:58.950> Destroy<00:03:58.980> game<00:03:59.430> was<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.760> last

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
the Search and Destroy game was the last

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.730 
the Search and Destroy game was the last
round<00:04:00.270> and<00:04:00.510> known<00:04:00.660> and<00:04:00.990> once<00:04:01.200> person<00:04:01.590> on<00:04:01.650> my

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
round and known and once person on my

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.440 
round and known and once person on my
team<00:04:01.770> was<00:04:02.040> alive<00:04:02.280> that<00:04:02.490> I<00:04:02.520> join<00:04:02.760> in<00:04:02.910> too<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.330> I

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
team was alive that I join in too and I

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.410 
team was alive that I join in too and I
have<00:04:03.690> a<00:04:03.780> 219<00:04:04.710> win<00:04:04.860> streak<00:04:05.100> right<00:04:05.190> now<00:04:05.400> so<00:04:06.390> I

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
have a 219 win streak right now so I

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.310 
have a 219 win streak right now so I
didn't<00:04:06.630> want<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:06.810> take<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.020> loss<00:04:07.200> a

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
didn't want to take that loss a

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.480 
didn't want to take that loss a
dashboard<00:04:07.680> it<00:04:08.070> I<00:04:08.130> probably<00:04:08.250> could<00:04:08.460> have

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
dashboard it I probably could have

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
dashboard it I probably could have
backed<00:04:08.700> out<00:04:08.850> I<00:04:08.910> didn't<00:04:09.180> know<00:04:09.270> that<00:04:09.390> at<00:04:09.480> the

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
backed out I didn't know that at the

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.030 
backed out I didn't know that at the
time<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:09.870> another<00:04:10.050> time<00:04:10.260> is<00:04:10.410> demolition<00:04:10.950> the

time and another time is demolition the

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:13.580 
time and another time is demolition the
same<00:04:11.280> deal<00:04:11.490> you<00:04:11.640> know<00:04:11.790> it's<00:04:11.940> very<00:04:12.320> very<00:04:13.320> end<00:04:13.500> of

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
same deal you know it's very very end of

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.640 
same deal you know it's very very end of
the<00:04:13.650> game<00:04:13.830> I'm<00:04:14.510> here<00:04:15.510> I<00:04:15.540> give<00:04:15.930> up<00:04:16.049> killfeed

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
the game I'm here I give up killfeed

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.340 
the game I'm here I give up killfeed
with<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.120> napalm<00:04:18.120> in<00:04:18.390> one<00:04:18.600> little<00:04:18.780> sniper

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
with the napalm in one little sniper

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.680 
with the napalm in one little sniper
crossmap<00:04:19.890> actually<00:04:20.880> like<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.120> ACOG<00:04:21.420> allowed

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
crossmap actually like the ACOG allowed

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.090 
crossmap actually like the ACOG allowed
in<00:04:21.780> this<00:04:21.840> game<00:04:22.049> especially<00:04:22.229> in<00:04:22.500> search<00:04:22.770> I<00:04:22.979> mean

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
in this game especially in search I mean

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.740 
in this game especially in search I mean
it's<00:04:23.250> obvious<00:04:23.520> it's<00:04:23.669> not<00:04:23.820> efficient<00:04:24.479> in<00:04:24.630> any

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
it's obvious it's not efficient in any

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.240 
it's obvious it's not efficient in any
way<00:04:24.960> but<00:04:25.020> none<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.350> the<00:04:25.440> snipers<00:04:25.830> are<00:04:25.950> anyway

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
way but none of the snipers are anyway

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.679 
way but none of the snipers are anyway
so

00:04:26.679 --> 00:04:26.689 
so

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:29.209 
so
doesn't<00:04:27.689> really<00:04:27.810> matter<00:04:28.020> but<00:04:28.409> the<00:04:28.830> acog<00:04:29.099> is

00:04:29.209 --> 00:04:29.219 
doesn't really matter but the acog is

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:31.189 
doesn't really matter but the acog is
fun<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.490> use<00:04:29.610> it<00:04:29.849> is<00:04:29.879> and<00:04:30.300> this<00:04:30.840> is<00:04:30.900> kind<00:04:31.139> of

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
fun to use it is and this is kind of

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.390 
fun to use it is and this is kind of
random<00:04:31.379> but<00:04:31.620> I<00:04:31.680> keep<00:04:31.830> forgetting<00:04:32.129> to<00:04:32.189> tell<00:04:32.310> you
