 what a package wrapped 32 days not even us 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.730
 without any pimple just unpacked 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.130

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.489
 so littered with timid is it with us 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:55.379
 nightcore d4 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:01:00.210
 see an orgy and what was with a friend 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:07.980
 open and well understood measurement we

 the bottom of what we have here is on the cord 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:16.229
 networked 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:19.950
 ordinary and his conclusion is huge is that u 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.290
 we are here Anton that gesture graze 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.189
 guarantees coupons so I understand yes date

 acquiring number so on here such 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.380
 Here we have a small charge 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.090
 It is clear that the digital 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.360
 and multifunctional meaning it can 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.860
 charge a lot of all sorts of different 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.149
 battery in particular batteries 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.490
 which can hold us is 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.200
 the list here is we have it well 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.149
 I will not list everything myself 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:53.070
 You see, apart from the standard ones, we have 2 3 and so 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:55.170
 then we have 18 honeycombs 5022 650 26 650 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.840
 here that is, here are such a battery 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.609
 who used to quit all 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.549
 devices 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:04.229
 Here is the thing in principle inexpensive 20 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.359
 I paid dollars 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.450
 here used to have such for such 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:12.800
 a charger but unfortunately it 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.570
 the device does not charge the 18650 battery 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.460
 my lantern here are the batteries here 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.960
 worth one emulator shame 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.550
 here and recently my something 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.610
 the flashlight began to exactly nest where 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.610
 Charging starts, then he started a bit 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.320
 don't get it apart it very much there 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.530
 difficult in general everything is problematic and 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.120
 accordingly be residential here and so 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.490
 decided to purchase such a thing because 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.010
 I think in the economy, he just come in handy yes 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.890
 and you can charge batteries 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.600
 different not only booths and others 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.510
 battery, please, everything is possible 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:52.920
 it's charging it how does it work 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:57.250
 device device so there is contact 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:01.090
 there is a contact being put on 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.710
 the battery is put here another 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.750
 battery and, respectively, under 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.230
 the size of your battery you yourself 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:12.880
 expose the appropriate let's say so 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:15.430
 the length is buttons slot mode as 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.530
 do not yet know well now 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.000
 I will try to turn it on and see what it is. 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.320
 I don't know my mom's cards now 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.740
 I need to understand right away or all the same 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:32.260
 will have to read Chinese instructions 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:34.450
 English one which a look like this 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.310
 here we turn on the device by the way 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.620
 there are also connectors 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.110
 I would understand the same code and power supply 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.950
 or an adapter for automotive 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:51.550
 Well that's charging now have a look 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:55.780
 try to insert what will be what he 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:58.770
 shows milliampere charging time because 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:06.370
 and he defined a voltage of 378 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:08.830
 750 milliampere hour same status that is but 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.100
 I understand it just with such a current 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:19.140
 then he charges so not visible here so here 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:23.480
 you can see 750 mega imper hours charging time 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:28.110
 voltage so here 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:31.010
 that's what they say we have 38 volts 750 a 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.130
 that is, the button could we switch 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.730
 value 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:41.700
 what to see and so I understand the button 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:49.500
 slot we switch between slots 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:51.420
 probably so yes that is if we 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.070
 more than one battery we put 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.470
 on the charger, then we can switch from 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.550
 addresses see what we have now by 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.830
 charging it right away 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.170
 he determined it was nickel 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:06.300
 metal hydride whether nickel cadmium 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:09.510
 battery and this at a rally he well such 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.580
 from an interesting charge here is a reference to 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.260
 the seller who bought the charger, then I 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.580
 I'll put it of course under the video if anyone 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.940
 interested you can go 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.800
 It is very convenient to acquire that of course 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.870
 you can charge different batteries 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.810
 let's say so in different slots that is in 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.270
 this one in my opinion is so impossible here 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.890
 you need to install at least two slots 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.860
 have the same battery knowing 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.510
 help can't be here actually like how 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.410
 do you want to deliver accordingly 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.900
 and you charge it 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:44.490
 it's fun and probably yes chopped 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:46.170
 I'm sure I'm not really big 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.720
 specialist again know jackpot on 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.610
 different videos in any topic there 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.440
 Electronics means exactly what is there 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.760
 by 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.430
 voltage to you first and so on that is 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.980
 in it I would not be a great expert but 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.010
 nevertheless , that is to say here and see 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:03.780
 this situation if you have considerations 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.850
 on this device or ass that is 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.860
 such a device or you something 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.870
 can add on this machine 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.180
 write in the comments your wishes 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.430
 your comments about what you are 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.050
 now saw here if the device you 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.880
 liked it and you want to buy it 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.260
 then you can click on the link which 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.180
 is under our video and 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:24.200
 accordingly get us right 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.200
 which I bought 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.990
 if anything if you order something 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.700
 ask that the seller is more more better 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.370
 packed because with stronger 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.140
 blow of course one could have her and 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.350
 a little damage it would not be very 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.910
 nice video 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.830
 end because well I don't know what 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.200
 still tell you about it here on the charger 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.510
