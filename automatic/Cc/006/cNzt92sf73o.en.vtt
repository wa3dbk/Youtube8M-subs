00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
and so you don't expect it to run quite

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.270 
and so you don't expect it to run quite
as<00:02:05.600> fast<00:02:05.780> although<00:02:06.110> i<00:02:06.229> was<00:02:06.530> pleased<00:02:07.009> that<00:02:07.250> it

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
as fast although i was pleased that it

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.199 
as fast although i was pleased that it
is<00:02:07.550> fairly<00:02:07.970> responsive<00:02:08.649> and<00:02:09.820> of<00:02:10.820> course<00:02:11.000> this

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
is fairly responsive and of course this

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.410 
is fairly responsive and of course this
is<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.660> process<00:02:12.440> of<00:02:12.650> signing<00:02:12.860> in<00:02:13.190> which<00:02:13.910> i'm

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
is the process of signing in which i'm

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
done we are now booting to the first

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.050 
done we are now booting to the first
screen<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:35.040> want<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.280> brighten<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.760> up<00:02:35.850> so

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
screen and I want to brighten it up so

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:47.930 
screen and I want to brighten it up so
you<00:02:36.150> can<00:02:36.300> see<00:02:36.569> a<00:02:36.600> little<00:02:36.810> bit<00:02:36.990> better<00:02:37.200> here

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.250
