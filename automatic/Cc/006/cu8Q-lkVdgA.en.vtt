00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.139
 Sometimes it happens that you have the teams 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.480
 just not and not in his 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.089
 right length then i would get 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.619
 recommend buying through the jeans bit 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.930
 too long and you can just 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.550
 itself that's not so hard you 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.080
 just need to be clear what 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.600
 shoes you just carry the women down 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.269
 Maybe you cities too 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.130
 want to wear and own preferences 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.660
 have to know how long the jeans should be 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.160
 cities put on shoes or mens 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.780
 put on proper shoes 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.690
 do that now barefoot to neutral to 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.520
 stay constantly in front of the mirror and 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.540
 take a pin with you 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.260
 stretched legs if that still 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.969
 can and pin you the pin 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.890
 on the length you want to have 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.890
 then align yourself again please and 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.910
 checked in the mirror if that the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.590
 pin is stuck in about the height 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.059
 to have that on if you want 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.100
 your luck for the pants a bit 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.739
 longer, until shorter because you the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.600
 pants and looks after and then 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.880
 Just put this one 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.040
 pin on the back of the heel where 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.640
 you should then you have the pants 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.530
 move out 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.840
 So here is the pin 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.810
 europeans desired length corresponds 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.640
 You've controlled that well enough 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.200
 that also has the right length and 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.680
 now you need this is your finished 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.159
 length needle and results with one 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.900
 geodreieck or a ruler 25 cm in addition 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.610
 length and draws you with a 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.990
 tailor chalk on if you do not 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.970
 tailor chalk you can have one 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.549
 black pen or something to use as 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.590
 wurscht 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.979
 then you've marked this and you 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.979
 put the pants so the two knew 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.720
 the hem length is the same as you and before 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.930
 backside simply both layers 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:57.509
 put one on top of each other and then just that 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:02:00.540
 cut off and now evil animal then the 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.530
 fabric knew the fabric edges twice 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.399
 an initial x 1 cm 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.399
 most of you have 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.599
 Let's go a hill from the user 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.239
 where the seams are so thick 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:26.750
 you have to print a bit more on the 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:30.950
 winged tire once hammered 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.950
 and hit it a second time 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.019
 and if you have one each two times 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.569
 centimeter impact then the need 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.720
 jeans thick this legal 5 mm 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.170
 therefore, are 25 cm and is the normal 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.170
 Jeans 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.069
 because the material is so thick that he is so 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:03:04.660
 many roles continue to need over the 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:03:11.020
 strength 25 cm for once the classy 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:13.120
 Who wants to do that now ? 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.460
 stuck even or directly 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.990
 go into the machine 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.530
 and now we will sew it all 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.790
 but before that a trifle this 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.190
 replica here where that twice 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.600
 The power will be taken 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.190
 most sewing machines 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.240
 That's why I recommend you the following 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.650
 take you any hard one 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.280
 object a hammer he the 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:41.380
 hopefully you have at home and knocks 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:45.150
 you believe this is the closest thing you can do 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.150
 not that what brings boots though 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:54.580
 also takes the sport and the hammer 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.690
 then it's easier to take on 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.490
 the machine the pants is here now the 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.230
 saum knew twice taken 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.590
 one centimeter each we have the 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.590
 trousers of the finished length 25 cm longer 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.000
 so once cut twice and 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.780
 whose the five millimeters and it 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.760
 catch up 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.980
 we have a machine threaded with 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.109
 a thirty- year-old eger and one 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.530
 thick needle and a thin under 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.700
 drive and have to be at the household now 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.220
 marching unfortunately this is no different 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.050
 possible from the top we will go 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.880
 only have the upper thread as beautiful 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.669
 thick thread that makes us the winner 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.770
 from the optics and go here after we 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:36.460
 know we hit a cm 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:39.430
 also have a centimeter of known 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.440
 sinking the fusion and sinking 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.450
 close daimler and therefore and now me 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.669
 a lot here with the fingernail you feel 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.140
 the edge under the fabric that is 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:52.810
 so you do not just then not always there 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:54.400
 so along for most so household 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.530
 closer ones forget that namely the 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:06.520
 egan thick and then look at the genes to 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:09.120
 cut home from when you die 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.100
 thick will ask the hammered 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.590
 then the handwheel on the side of 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.390
 the machine probably also in addition 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.479
 the hand that can turn along 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:22.200
 so that you really through art 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.200
 heard how she acts 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.090
 has done the machine and on 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.090
 it's 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.290
 now have the freshly cut pants 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.050
 Look really cut off 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.800
 but already have the beautiful 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.050
 authentic jeans can 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.030
 and these downforce phenomena there 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.860
 you need to make room for the jeans 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.720
 actually only a game about beer knows 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.670
 Also take a nail file next to or 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.420
 normal arrows then you just stop 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.210
 a bit longer 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:08.360
 then you click the edges so me 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.690
 thought that with the blasphemy the papers 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.460
 on 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.900
 Watch out that you do not care about it 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.400
 the nearness goes over the negernes over it 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.710
 otherwise draw there is now more conscious 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.720
 made his bend that did not want 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.390
 and you see here how you already got that 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.570
 getting hair away that's what you do 

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:27.740
 few centimeters you forge that 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:29.420
 even if the right one 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:34.010
 Want to have recently really wants the edge 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:36.290
 Tense here and there go and long 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.080
 then you hail yourself along and 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.670
 do n't be surprised 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.770
 as long as you did that for the first time 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.710
 one sees not so much only 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:47.300
 after washing the fibers become the 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.610
 roughened here are torn away 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.050
 final and then it gets really know 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.020
 and then you have a relative 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.470
 authentic a relatively authentic 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.470
 Jeans 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.200
 a little addition to the jeans 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.910
 shorten 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.310
 I have to admit that the technique with 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.050
 emery paper not 100 percent 

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:08.750
 authentic teaching bridle 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.580
 budersand tongue-breaker there is one 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.620
 possibility often used by shops 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.690
 becomes like a jeans with a real one 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.400
 because tables are shortened 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:18.950
 I'll take any one of those 

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:23.440
 if he has a particularly successful hem 

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:27.110
 the want to cut then you go easy 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:29.450
 the desired length i own the way 

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:33.850
 make her now only with pins her 

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:33.850
 not a meadow, so to speak 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.750
 not there or the pin 

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:41.510
 symbolize the seams along and 

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.610
 then it works out and then 

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.590
 you only see the seam here and there 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.880
 the pants cut and has the 

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.880
 authentic hem on plan 

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:55.729
 the computer
