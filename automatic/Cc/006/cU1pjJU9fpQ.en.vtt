more<00:02:03.390> effective<00:02:04.200> rather<00:02:04.860> than<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:06.150> paper<00:02:06.710> the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
more effective rather than the paper the

more effective rather than the paper the
Qashqai<00:02:08.160> balls<00:02:08.460> hard<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.000> will<00:02:09.149> go<00:02:09.300> inside

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
Qashqai balls hard and it will go inside
