and our job code resource we're looking

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.520 
and our job code resource we're looking
to<00:03:47.550> produce<00:03:47.750> 22,000<00:03:48.750> tons<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:49.050> year<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:49.320> you<00:03:49.410> can

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
to produce 22,000 tons a year so you can

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.460 
to produce 22,000 tons a year so you can
see<00:03:49.650> we've<00:03:49.770> got<00:03:49.860> a<00:03:49.890> long<00:03:50.100> mine<00:03:50.850> life<00:03:51.090> there<00:03:51.470> and

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
see we've got a long mine life there and

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.520 
see we've got a long mine life there and
if<00:03:53.340> we<00:03:53.490> get<00:03:53.640> when<00:03:53.970> we<00:03:54.000> get<00:03:54.240> to<00:03:54.330> 22,000<00:03:55.080> tons<00:03:55.200> and

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
if we get when we get to 22,000 tons and

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.500 
if we get when we get to 22,000 tons and
there<00:03:55.980> is<00:03:56.100> further<00:03:56.340> customer<00:03:56.820> demand<00:03:57.150> women

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
there is further customer demand women

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.030 
there is further customer demand women
looking<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.870> grow<00:03:58.020> beyond<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.470> would<00:03:58.800> I<00:03:58.860> be

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
looking to grow beyond that would I be

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.800 
looking to grow beyond that would I be
right<00:03:59.310> in<00:03:59.340> thinking<00:03:59.460> that<00:03:59.970> that<00:04:00.450> would<00:04:00.600> be<00:04:00.690> one

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
right in thinking that that would be one

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.390 
right in thinking that that would be one
of<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:00.990> larger<00:04:01.410> deposits<00:04:01.920> of<00:04:02.010> rare<00:04:02.190> earths

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
of the larger deposits of rare earths

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.640 
of the larger deposits of rare earths
around<00:04:02.850> certainly<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.990> richest<00:04:04.410> in

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
around certainly and the richest in

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.520 
around certainly and the richest in
terms<00:04:05.100> of<00:04:05.220> grade<00:04:05.490> were<00:04:06.050> about<00:04:07.050> fourteen

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
terms of grade were about fourteen

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.680 
terms of grade were about fourteen
percent<00:04:07.650> in<00:04:08.040> our<00:04:08.190> mind<00:04:08.460> pit<00:04:08.700> that<00:04:09.300> compares<00:04:09.630> to

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
percent in our mind pit that compares to

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.190 
percent in our mind pit that compares to
about<00:04:09.870> 5%<00:04:10.290> in<00:04:10.620> China<00:04:10.950> for<00:04:11.100> example<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:12.200> in

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
about 5% in China for example and in

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.050 
about 5% in China for example and in
terms<00:04:13.770> of<00:04:13.890> grade<00:04:14.130> and<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.550> different<00:04:14.880> areas

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
terms of grade and the different areas

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.180 
terms of grade and the different areas
that<00:04:15.420> we<00:04:15.510> have<00:04:15.780> makes<00:04:16.380> us<00:04:16.530> a<00:04:16.650> very<00:04:16.739> valuable

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
that we have makes us a very valuable

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.510 
that we have makes us a very valuable
asset<00:04:17.670> and<00:04:17.930> so<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.109> demand<00:04:19.770> is<00:04:20.100> really

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
asset and so the demand is really

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.520 
asset and so the demand is really
outstripping<00:04:21.150> supply<00:04:21.270> at<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.900> moment<00:04:22.410> isn't

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
outstripping supply at the moment isn't

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.620 
outstripping supply at the moment isn't
it<00:04:22.650> a<00:04:23.100> day<00:04:23.430> let<00:04:23.760> alone<00:04:23.790> over<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.300> next<00:04:24.510> few

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
it a day let alone over the next few

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.000 
it a day let alone over the next few
years<00:04:24.720> that's<00:04:24.990> why<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.169> Chinese<00:04:25.500> supply

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
years that's why the Chinese supply

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.600 
years that's why the Chinese supply
system<00:04:26.400> is

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.240 
investors I think the key points were
how<00:07:10.759> outlining<00:07:11.479> that<00:07:11.780> demand<00:07:12.530> is<00:07:12.800> growing

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.250 
how outlining that demand is growing

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.890 
how outlining that demand is growing
supplies<00:07:14.180> is<00:07:14.660> very<00:07:15.169> fragile<00:07:15.440> today<00:07:16.900> the

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:17.900 
supplies is very fragile today the

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.450 
supplies is very fragile today the
Chinese<00:07:18.259> government<00:07:18.710> understands<00:07:19.250> the

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:19.460 
Chinese government understands the

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.010 
Chinese government understands the
strategic<00:07:19.940> nature<00:07:20.090> of<00:07:20.330> rare<00:07:20.509> earths<00:07:20.750> hence

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:21.020 
strategic nature of rare earths hence

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.610 
strategic nature of rare earths hence
the<00:07:21.289> the<00:07:21.710> restrictions<00:07:22.520> and<00:07:23.449> the<00:07:24.139> lioness

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:24.620 
the the restrictions and the lioness

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.200 
the the restrictions and the lioness
will<00:07:24.830> be<00:07:24.979> the<00:07:25.130> first<00:07:25.340> company<00:07:25.729> outside<00:07:25.910> of
