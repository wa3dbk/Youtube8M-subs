get<00:00:38.219> started<00:00:39.800> we're<00:00:40.800> gonna<00:00:40.890> start<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:41.430> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
get started we're gonna start with a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.459 
get started we're gonna start with a
blank<00:00:41.820> canvas<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:44.100> actually<00:00:44.360> see<00:00:45.469> how

blank canvas so you can actually see how

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.650 
blank canvas so you can actually see how
to<00:00:46.530> get<00:00:47.309> all<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.059> functions<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.539> you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
to get all of the functions that you

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.799 
to get all of the functions that you
need<00:00:49.219> okay<00:00:50.219> as<00:00:50.460> before<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.480> we're<00:00:51.660> going<00:00:51.780> to

we're<00:01:06.780> going<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.990> go<00:01:07.170> down<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.500> image<00:01:08.159> tools

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
we're going to go down to image tools

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.490 
we're going to go down to image tools
and<00:01:08.909> we're<00:01:09.360> going<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.540> choose<00:01:10.070> slideshow<00:01:11.070> and

okay<00:02:29.880> now<00:02:30.570> what<00:02:30.990> we're<00:02:31.110> going<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.320> do<00:02:32.540> I'm

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
okay now what we're going to do I'm

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.000 
okay now what we're going to do I'm
going<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.750> look<00:02:33.870> at<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.080> first<00:02:34.440> element<00:02:34.980> of

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
going to look at the first element of

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.970 
going to look at the first element of
the<00:02:35.070> editor<00:02:35.580> which<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.150> allows<00:02:36.510> us<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:37.140> either

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
the editor which is allows us to either

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.600 
the editor which is allows us to either
make<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.820> wider<00:02:39.060> or<00:02:39.270> higher<00:02:40.200> I've<00:02:40.980> explained

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
make it wider or higher I've explained

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.980 
make it wider or higher I've explained
in<00:02:41.940> uploading<00:02:43.460> photos<00:02:44.460> what<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.510> means<00:02:45.810> so

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
in uploading photos what this means so

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.260 
in uploading photos what this means so
let's<00:02:46.590> just<00:02:46.890> stick<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.100> little<00:02:47.400> more<00:02:47.610> we've

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
let's just stick a little more we've

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.920 
let's just stick a little more we've
done<00:02:49.160> add<00:02:50.160> images<00:02:50.760> now<00:02:50.940> let's<00:02:51.150> organize<00:02:51.690> them

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
done add images now let's organize them

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.630 
done add images now let's organize them
there's<00:02:52.350> this<00:02:52.440> really<00:02:52.800> nifty<00:02:53.010> little<00:02:53.310> tool

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
there's this really nifty little tool

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.740 
there's this really nifty little tool
and<00:02:53.910> if<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:55.350> already<00:02:55.860> have<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.670> slideshow<00:02:57.270> want

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
and if you already have a slideshow want

and if you already have a slideshow want
to<00:02:57.930> get<00:02:58.320> rid<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.500> some<00:02:58.740> of<00:02:58.770> them<00:02:58.950> again<00:02:59.700> you<00:02:59.910> go

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
to get rid of some of them again you go

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.990 
to get rid of some of them again you go
to<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.300> little<00:03:00.540> icon<00:03:00.990> garbage<00:03:01.620> bin<00:03:02.370> which<00:03:02.820> is

to the little icon garbage bin which is

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.840 
to the little icon garbage bin which is
the<00:03:03.150> delete<00:03:03.510> now<00:03:04.320> let's<00:03:04.740> say<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.010> want<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.460> put

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
the beach one above Ayers Rock I move it

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.370 
the beach one above Ayers Rock I move it
up<00:03:09.930> one<00:03:10.430> let's<00:03:11.430> say<00:03:11.730> I<00:03:11.760> want<00:03:12.000> city<00:03:12.840> lights<00:03:13.140> at

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
up one let's say I want city lights at

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.490 
up one let's say I want city lights at
the<00:03:13.410> top<00:03:13.710> if<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.400> see<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.540> it's<00:03:15.840> moving<00:03:16.080> to

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
the top if you see that it's moving to

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.840 
the top if you see that it's moving to
position<00:03:16.980> four<00:03:17.310> three<00:03:17.730> two<00:03:18.180> one<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:19.370> it's<00:03:20.370> up

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
position four three two one and it's up

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.830 
position four three two one and it's up
at<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.030> top<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:22.820> what<00:03:23.820> we<00:03:23.940> can<00:03:24.150> do<00:03:24.360> then<00:03:24.630> is

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
at the top and what we can do then is

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.080 
at the top and what we can do then is
I'm<00:03:25.140> just<00:03:25.170> going<00:03:25.410> to<00:03:25.530> apply<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:25.950> if<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:26.880> look

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
I'm just going to apply that if you look

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.460 
I'm just going to apply that if you look
down<00:03:27.330> here<00:03:27.390> you'll<00:03:27.959> see<00:03:28.200> some<00:03:28.440> changes

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
down here you'll see some changes

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.460 
down here you'll see some changes
occurring<00:03:30.140> and<00:03:32.209> now<00:03:33.209> what<00:03:33.450> we're<00:03:33.600> going<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.870> do

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
occurring and now what we're going to do

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.300 
occurring and now what we're going to do
is<00:03:35.120> get<00:03:36.120> out<00:03:36.240> of<00:03:36.360> this<00:03:36.480> little<00:03:36.840> one<00:03:37.020> and<00:03:37.310> we're

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
is get out of this little one and we're

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.360 
is get out of this little one and we're
going<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.490> go<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.700> advanced<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:40.130> this<00:03:41.130> looks

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
going to go to advanced and this looks

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.070 
going to go to advanced and this looks
at<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:42.000> actual<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:45.360> main<00:03:45.570> image<00:03:45.840> that

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
at the actual the main image that

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.199 
at the actual the main image that
appears<00:03:46.620> in<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:46.920> type<00:03:47.130> of<00:03:47.280> aspect<00:03:47.730> ratio<00:03:48.120> I'm

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
appears in the type of aspect ratio I'm

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.820 
appears in the type of aspect ratio I'm
not<00:03:48.360> going<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.540> go<00:03:48.630> into<00:03:48.810> that<00:03:48.930> captions<00:03:49.709> I

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
not going to go into that captions I

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.400 
not going to go into that captions I
like<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.610> captions<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.330> be<00:03:51.480> there<00:03:51.780> the

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
like the captions to be there the

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.710 
like the captions to be there the
padding<00:03:52.950> is<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.190> space<00:03:53.610> around<00:03:53.850> here<00:03:54.390> you<00:03:54.570> can

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
padding is a space around here you can

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.960 
padding is a space around here you can
adapt<00:03:55.020> that<00:03:55.320> we're<00:03:56.250> going<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.459> go<00:03:56.580> to<00:03:56.640> more

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
adapt that we're going to go to more

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.699 
adapt that we're going to go to more
this<00:03:57.690> is<00:03:57.900> pretty<00:03:58.200> neat

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
this is pretty neat

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.449 
this is pretty neat
this<00:03:59.300> regulates<00:04:00.300> the<00:04:00.570> actual<00:04:00.930> speed<00:04:01.500> in<00:04:01.740> which

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
this regulates the actual speed in which

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.300 
this regulates the actual speed in which
the<00:04:03.150> slides<00:04:03.930> are<00:04:04.170> shown<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.920> intervals

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
the slides are shown the intervals

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.840 
the slides are shown the intervals
behind<00:04:05.700> them<00:04:05.910> I<00:04:06.290> tend<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.440> keep<00:04:07.739> that<00:04:08.010> pretty

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
behind them I tend to keep that pretty

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.330 
behind them I tend to keep that pretty
short<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.750> I'm<00:04:10.440> going<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.739> have<00:04:10.860> it<00:04:10.980> at<00:04:11.070> three

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
short and I'm going to have it at three

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.120 
short and I'm going to have it at three
seconds<00:04:11.930> let's<00:04:12.930> say<00:04:13.110> this<00:04:13.260> was<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.800> business

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
seconds let's say this was a business

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.390 
seconds let's say this was a business
tutorial<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.739> you<00:04:16.739> were<00:04:16.919> explaining

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
tutorial and you were explaining

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.310 
tutorial and you were explaining
different<00:04:18.000> concepts<00:04:18.540> to<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.720> client<00:04:19.200> maybe

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
different concepts to a client maybe

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.320 
different concepts to a client maybe
about<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:19.680> product<00:04:20.040> and<00:04:20.370> you<00:04:20.910> had<00:04:21.060> audio

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
about a product and you had audio

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.900 
about a product and you had audio
running<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:22.320> might<00:04:22.350> want<00:04:22.770> it<00:04:22.890> slower<00:04:23.310> so<00:04:23.880> you

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
running you might want it slower so you

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:24.200 
running you might want it slower so you
can

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
can

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.219 
can
drop<00:04:24.389> that<00:04:24.530> slide<00:04:25.530> that<00:04:25.610> and<00:04:26.870> now<00:04:27.870> we're<00:04:28.050> going

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
drop that slide that and now we're going

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.420 
drop that slide that and now we're going
to<00:04:28.380> go<00:04:28.620> to<00:04:28.680> setup<00:04:29.930> you<00:04:30.930> can<00:04:31.139> add<00:04:31.380> music<00:04:31.680> if<00:04:32.220> you

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
to go to setup you can add music if you

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.040 
to go to setup you can add music if you
want<00:04:32.669> to<00:04:32.940> you<00:04:33.180> just<00:04:33.240> have<00:04:33.569> to<00:04:33.690> browse<00:04:34.410> inside

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
want to you just have to browse inside

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.499 
want to you just have to browse inside
your<00:04:37.050> your<00:04:37.860> files<00:04:38.220> that<00:04:38.430> you<00:04:38.550> have<00:04:38.580> maybe

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
colors I've used gray-on-gray to go with

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.180 
colors I've used gray-on-gray to go with
this<00:05:02.310> site<00:05:02.639> I'm<00:05:03.240> gonna<00:05:03.419> try<00:05:03.750> this<00:05:04.320> lime<00:05:04.740> color

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
up here so you'll be able to see that

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.999 
up here so you'll be able to see that
well<00:05:08.520> that's<00:05:09.360> a<00:05:09.449> bit<00:05:09.599> crazy<00:05:09.780> isn't<00:05:10.259> it<00:05:10.410> maybe

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:11.009

for<00:05:11.250> some<00:05:11.460> of<00:05:11.490> your<00:05:11.699> sites<00:05:11.970> that<00:05:12.690> might<00:05:13.050> be

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
for some of your sites that might be

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.290 
for some of your sites that might be
usable<00:05:13.710> but<00:05:14.490> you<00:05:14.580> get<00:05:14.759> the<00:05:14.880> general<00:05:15.060> idea

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
usable but you get the general idea

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.480
