this is fake this is just jumped in see
how<00:03:07.810> this<00:03:07.870> looks<00:03:08.080> like<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.320> piece<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.850> maybe<00:03:09.850> of

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
how this looks like a piece of maybe of

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.470 
how this looks like a piece of maybe of
a<00:03:10.450> tanker<00:03:11.440> Matilda<00:03:12.130> military<00:03:12.820> vehicle<00:03:13.360> or

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
a tanker Matilda military vehicle or

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.580 
a tanker Matilda military vehicle or
something<00:03:14.340> so<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.430> live

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.640 

I<00:03:18.680> mean<00:03:19.069> it's<00:03:19.220> easy<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:19.760> bear<00:03:20.030> it<00:03:20.379> right<00:03:21.379> here

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
I mean it's easy to bear it right here

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.190 
I mean it's easy to bear it right here
like<00:03:22.040> this<00:03:22.250> way<00:03:22.489> because<00:03:23.420> this<00:03:23.660> could<00:03:23.840> all<00:03:24.019> be

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
like this way because this could all be

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.009 
like this way because this could all be
open<00:03:24.560> see<00:03:24.980> this<00:03:25.099> here<00:03:25.390> this<00:03:26.390> could<00:03:26.629> all<00:03:26.840> be

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
open see this here this could all be

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.619 
open see this here this could all be
opened<00:03:27.440> or<00:03:27.790> just<00:03:28.790> could<00:03:28.910> be<00:03:28.940> going<00:03:29.300> into<00:03:29.420> an

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
opened or just could be going into an

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.369 
opened or just could be going into an
underground<00:03:29.870> garage<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:31.190> you<00:03:31.459> just<00:03:31.640> silly

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
underground garage and you just silly

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.440 
underground garage and you just silly
just<00:03:33.379> take<00:03:33.590> this<00:03:34.129> texture<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:34.910> color<00:03:35.120> and

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
just take this texture and color and

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.660 
just take this texture and color and
then<00:03:35.660> just<00:03:35.930> fill<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.290> pencil<00:03:36.680> not<00:03:37.220> a<00:03:37.250> big<00:03:37.459> deal

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
then just fill the pencil not a big deal

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.089 
then just fill the pencil not a big deal
and<00:03:38.510> you<00:03:38.629> can<00:03:38.750> see<00:03:38.930> how<00:03:39.140> it's<00:03:39.470> almost<00:03:39.769> perfect

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
and you can see how it's almost perfect

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.759 
and you can see how it's almost perfect

I<00:04:50.100> mean<00:04:50.520> if<00:04:50.729> this<00:04:50.940> is<00:04:51.210> NASA's<00:04:51.930> way<00:04:52.169> of<00:04:52.380> doing<00:04:52.680> a

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
I mean if this is NASA's way of doing a

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.659 
I mean if this is NASA's way of doing a
slow<00:04:53.010> rollout<00:04:54.800> there's<00:04:55.800> not<00:04:56.070> much<00:04:56.280> look

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
slow rollout there's not much look

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.020 
slow rollout there's not much look
there's<00:04:57.000> not<00:04:57.150> much<00:04:57.330> slow<00:04:57.630> about<00:04:57.930> it<00:04:58.250> this<00:04:59.250> here

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
there's not much slow about it this here

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.390 
there's not much slow about it this here
looks<00:05:00.210> at<00:05:00.360> another<00:05:00.570> rooftop<00:05:01.100> where<00:05:02.100> you<00:05:02.220> have

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
looks at another rooftop where you have

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.710 
looks at another rooftop where you have
like<00:05:02.639> an<00:05:02.790> exhaust<00:05:03.120> pipe<00:05:03.419> coming<00:05:03.780> out<00:05:03.960> or<00:05:04.949> tent

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:12.230 
that I think was a mistake but this I

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:18.760 
that I think was a mistake but this I
think<00:07:12.290> is<00:07:12.650> delivering<00:07:14.050> this<00:07:15.050> is<00:07:15.350> cool<00:07:17.530> this<00:07:18.530> I

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:24.700 

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.490 

why<00:07:25.700> would<00:07:25.940> NASA<00:07:26.270> blurt<00:07:26.750> out<00:07:26.930> that's<00:07:27.380> a

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:27.500 
why would NASA blurt out that's a

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:33.010 
why would NASA blurt out that's a
perfect<00:07:28.040> ball<00:07:29.440> with<00:07:30.820> part<00:07:31.820> of<00:07:31.910> it<00:07:32.060> exposed<00:07:32.570> and

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:33.020 
perfect ball with part of it exposed and

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.710 
perfect ball with part of it exposed and
it<00:07:33.140> looks<00:07:33.470> to<00:07:33.620> be<00:07:33.650> like<00:07:33.800> a<00:07:34.160> relief<00:07:35.000> carving<00:07:35.600> in

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:35.720 
it looks to be like a relief carving in

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.950 
it looks to be like a relief carving in
there

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.559 

hey<00:07:41.259> guys

00:07:43.559 --> 00:07:43.569 

00:07:43.569 --> 00:07:49.740 

so<00:07:44.289> if<00:07:44.529> i<00:07:44.649> can<00:07:44.800> get<00:07:44.919> it<00:07:44.979> just<00:07:45.249> a<00:07:45.369> little<00:07:45.399> bigger

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:49.750 

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.010 

I<00:07:49.810> think<00:07:50.140> that's<00:07:50.320> about<00:07:50.500> it

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.020 
I think that's about it

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.279 
I think that's about it
they're<00:07:52.620> also<00:07:52.770> lips<00:07:53.160> to<00:07:53.280> be<00:07:53.539> like<00:07:54.539> a<00:07:54.569> little

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:55.289 
they're also lips to be like a little

00:07:55.289 --> 00:08:00.450 
they're also lips to be like a little
little<00:07:55.650> thing<00:07:56.039> coming<00:07:56.400> out<00:07:56.490> the<00:07:56.669> top<00:07:56.699> gear

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:00.460 

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:08.030 

and<00:08:01.060> that<00:08:01.900> is<00:08:02.310> absolutely<00:08:03.310> cool<00:08:05.729> only<00:08:06.729> case

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:08.040 
and that is absolutely cool only case

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.860 
and that is absolutely cool only case
not<00:08:08.670> much<00:08:08.850> to<00:08:09.060> say<00:08:09.300> few<00:08:10.260> seekers<00:08:10.650> out
