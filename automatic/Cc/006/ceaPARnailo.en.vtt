 we assemble the iso we install 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.080
 I think both governments to file 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.730

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.739
 This game consists of three parts two of 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.809
 700 mb and one of 595 megabytes those are 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.390
 the servers to download well here 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.829
 we have another spices persia that would be 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.300
 completely interchangeable means that 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.829
 we can give the part of here another part 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.970
 here and another cow or all in one 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.620
 server as you see it most 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.190
 comfortable and the password for 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.269
 unzip the raps is richie well 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.250
 we unload the three parts we put the 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.930
 three in one folder and now split 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.930
 we are not going to right click and extract 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.390
 here these winrar of the game currently 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.030
 they do not have a password 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.220
 password have the most in mind in the 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.350
 case that stir sure of 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.509
 receive the game and have a password 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.330
 is to base the game's password well 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.970
 in this case it does not have a password 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.290
 I just have to wait 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.300
 [Music] 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.360
 well once it ends it will leave us 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.010
 these files to number one to did one 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.030
 we are going to give right click a stroke and 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.400
 montero nya df but they are not the seconds 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.870
 we're going to go to the cd unit and we're going 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.870
 to execute the sixth exe point 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.380
 we wait a few seconds 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.780
 we select the language we give you the 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.780
 following 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.979
 we see in the next one we accept 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.370
 next we owe the complete the minimum 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.370
 I do not know 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.440
 the movies are 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.700
 with difference between two things here they go to 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.400
 have less graphic quality when

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.020
 accept and wait until game is 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.510

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.350

 to accept 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.630
 and we wait until it's over 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.370
 install 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.230
 in this part of installation we will 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.270
 ask us to accept disk 3 we are going to 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.610
 do the same thing we go back and go 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.730

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.020
 right used in assembling the unit efe 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.660
 we go back to the installer we see some 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.530
 seconds we will go to accept and I will 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.110
 continue the installation 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.209
 well once this action is finished 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.890
 this will come out and we will give it 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.280
 I do not want to register the product because 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.420
 register the gordon game and go on ok 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.330
 we deactivate this we do not mark it 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.780
 we do not give in finalizing 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.600
 alright now let's go to the cd unit 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.900
 where disk 3 is mounted we open the 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.710
 cd drive we go to the crack folder and 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.710
 we copy this file 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.550
 let's go to the local disk team c 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.790
 program files 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:37.160
 ubisoft Persian laughs the soul of the warrior 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:41.480
 and here we are going to paste it 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:43.310
 we will replace the file and ready in 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.190
 theory that is perfectly for 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.420
 to play 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.950
 let's try the game 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.300
 has a screen resolution 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.510
 pretty weird and now I'm not going to 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.000
 modify we can be seems it does not 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.120
 just auto configure when you believe in 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.120
 my 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.110
 osorio 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.770
 well and here the game starts 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.399
 here we are 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.399
 [Applause] 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.010
 the right to block 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.920
 left click 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.500
 simple weapons 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:37.900
 so to order like 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.900
 or broke everything together 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.860
 between possible enemy notes 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:50.160
 perfect as we say a fatality 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.160
 [Applause] 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:53.339
 much faster 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.060
 today I know 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.229
 and I would be there I do not know what it will be 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:21.320
 and more or less 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:30.770
 for now that is the part of parkour 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.770
 with writers for parkour I think 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.400
 if you can try 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:44.389
 and good see you in the next visit 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.389
