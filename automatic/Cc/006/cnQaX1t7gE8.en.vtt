00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
and this time I'm a little smarter I

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.710 
and this time I'm a little smarter I
just<00:03:58.590> go<00:03:58.739> straight<00:03:59.069> with<00:03:59.220> aqua<00:03:59.579> jet<00:03:59.790> um<00:04:02.720> but

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
just go straight with aqua jet um but

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.580 
just go straight with aqua jet um but
that<00:04:04.169> was<00:04:04.259> pretty<00:04:04.439> stupid<00:04:04.709> because<00:04:06.530> she'd<00:04:07.530> be

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
that was pretty stupid because she'd be

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.949 
that was pretty stupid because she'd be
gone<00:04:07.680> for<00:04:07.829> the<00:04:07.889> Stone<00:04:08.189> Age<00:04:08.220> it<00:04:08.790> does<00:04:09.030> seem<00:04:09.900> like

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
gone for the Stone Age it does seem like

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.920 
gone for the Stone Age it does seem like
two<00:04:10.799> times<00:04:11.009> effective<00:04:11.579> and<00:04:11.909> it<00:04:12.180> has<00:04:12.750> like

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
two times effective and it has like

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.379 
two times effective and it has like
three<00:04:13.409> times<00:04:13.590> so<00:04:13.769> much<00:04:13.889> power<00:04:14.150> so<00:04:15.150> then<00:04:15.299> I<00:04:15.359> go

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
three times so much power so then I go

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.990 
three times so much power so then I go
for<00:04:15.629> the<00:04:15.720> stoners<00:04:16.019> next<00:04:16.409> term<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:16.919> of<00:04:17.639> course

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
for the stoners next term and of course

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.640 
for the stoners next term and of course
he's<00:04:18.180> missed<00:04:18.539> own<00:04:18.690> agent<00:04:19.049> gets<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.289> crit

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
he's missed own agent gets the crit

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.290 
he's missed own agent gets the crit
almost<00:04:20.400> kills<00:04:20.729> me<00:04:20.880> but<00:04:21.090> i<00:04:21.599> have<00:04:21.900> 7<00:04:22.320> HP<00:04:22.880> and<00:04:23.880> so

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
almost kills me but i have 7 HP and so

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.800 
almost kills me but i have 7 HP and so
then<00:04:24.510> i<00:04:24.599> use<00:04:24.779> my<00:04:24.930> own<00:04:25.050> storage<00:04:25.320> on
