images<00:00:15.719> can<00:00:16.260> be<00:00:16.410> one<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.770> more

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
images can be one of the more

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.710 
images can be one of the more
intimidating<00:00:17.250> techniques<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.359> use<00:00:18.510> and

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
intimidating techniques to use and

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.570 
intimidating techniques to use and
understand<00:00:19.289> done<00:00:19.770> incorrectly<00:00:20.100> they<00:00:20.430> can

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
understand done incorrectly they can

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.960 
understand done incorrectly they can
come<00:00:20.730> out<00:00:20.760> underexposed<00:00:21.600> or<00:00:21.930> hazy<00:00:22.710> or

come out underexposed or hazy or

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.140 
come out underexposed or hazy or
overexposed<00:00:24.590> backlight<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.740> probably<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
overexposed backlight is probably the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.570 
overexposed backlight is probably the
least<00:00:27.420> understood<00:00:28.199> component<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.189> lighting

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
least understood component of lighting

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.030 
least understood component of lighting
and<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.150> really<00:00:30.390> does<00:00:30.570> take<00:00:30.779> time<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.349> skill

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
and it really does take time and skill

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.030 
and it really does take time and skill
to<00:00:32.430> really<00:00:32.820> master<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.809> technique<00:00:34.040> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
to really master this technique the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.220 
to really master this technique the
purpose<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.700> backlight<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.840> highlight

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
purpose of backlight is to highlight

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.100 
purpose of backlight is to highlight
your<00:00:37.950> subject<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:39.390> creates<00:00:39.899> a

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
your subject and it creates a

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.229 
your subject and it creates a
three-dimensional<00:00:40.559> more<00:00:41.340> compelling<00:00:42.000> look

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
three-dimensional more compelling look

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.040 
three-dimensional more compelling look
to<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.840> photograph<00:00:43.700> in<00:00:44.700> order<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.600> create

to a photograph in order to create

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.190 
to a photograph in order to create
backlight<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.550> want<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.149> create<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.780> narrow

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
backlight you want to create a narrow

beam onto the back of your subject how

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.200 
beam onto the back of your subject how
you<00:00:51.870> do<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.739> by<00:00:53.100> setting<00:00:53.579> your<00:00:53.820> lights

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
you do that is by setting your lights

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.439 
you do that is by setting your lights
behind<00:00:54.899> your<00:00:55.260> subject<00:00:55.469> at<00:00:56.070> an<00:00:56.730> angle<00:00:57.180> out<00:00:57.390> of

your frame if you are using a larger
light<00:01:00.320> source<00:01:01.320> make<00:01:01.649> sure<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.250> have

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
light source make sure that you have

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.789 
light source make sure that you have
something<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:03.000> control<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.719> build<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
something to control this build on the

something to control this build on the
back<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.100> your<00:01:05.220> subject<00:01:05.729> because<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.390> don't

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
back of your subject because you don't

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.660 
back of your subject because you don't
want<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.020> look<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.229> they're<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.220> a

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
want it to look like they're just on a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.660 
want it to look like they're just on a
bright<00:01:09.330> backdrop<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.860> basically<00:01:11.220> want<00:01:11.520> to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
bright backdrop you basically want to

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.560 
bright backdrop you basically want to
outline<00:01:12.180> them<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.049> soft<00:01:13.350> hue<00:01:14.159> or<00:01:14.430> light<00:01:14.970> if

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
outline them in a soft hue or light if

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.560 
outline them in a soft hue or light if
you<00:01:15.810> use<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> large<00:01:16.409> light<00:01:17.210> it<00:01:18.210> will<00:01:18.330> create

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
you use a large light it will create

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.140 
you use a large light it will create
spill<00:01:19.049> onto<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.040> sides<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.340> your<00:01:20.400> subject<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
spill onto the sides of your subject and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.899 
spill onto the sides of your subject and
instead<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.810> creating<00:01:22.110> nice<00:01:22.650> dramatic<00:01:23.220> subtle

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
instead of creating nice dramatic subtle

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.300 
instead of creating nice dramatic subtle
light<00:01:24.119> you'll<00:01:24.869> actually<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.439> big<00:01:26.040> light

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
light you'll actually have a big light

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.280 
light you'll actually have a big light
source<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.240> want<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.630> avoid<00:01:27.840> doing<00:01:28.140> that

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
source so you want to avoid doing that

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.350 
source so you want to avoid doing that
at<00:01:28.409> all<00:01:28.530> costs<00:01:29.100> now<00:01:29.490> as<00:01:29.700> mentioned<00:01:29.939> if<00:01:30.180> you're

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
at all costs now as mentioned if you're

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.870 
at all costs now as mentioned if you're
using<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.780> large<00:01:31.049> light<00:01:31.409> source<00:01:31.729> make<00:01:32.729> sure

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
using a large light source make sure

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.210 
using a large light source make sure
that<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.150> have<00:01:33.270> something<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.750> control<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
that you have something to control the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.020 
that you have something to control the
spill<00:01:36.119> such<00:01:36.570> as<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> snoot<00:01:37.409> or<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.979> flag<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:38.880> way

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
spill such as a snoot or a flag this way

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.550 
spill such as a snoot or a flag this way
you<00:01:39.090> can<00:01:39.420> direct<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> light<00:01:39.990> onto<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.380> back

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
you can direct the light onto the back

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.390 
you can direct the light onto the back
of<00:01:40.590> your<00:01:40.799> subject

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
of your subject

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.310 
of your subject
now<00:01:41.490> if<00:01:41.579> too<00:01:41.820> much<00:01:41.939> light<00:01:42.180> does<00:01:42.450> enter<00:01:43.020> your

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
now if too much light does enter your

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.880 
now if too much light does enter your
lens<00:01:43.740> during<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:45.000> photography<00:01:45.479> session<00:01:45.890> what

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
lens during the photography session what

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.190 
lens during the photography session what
it<00:01:47.189> can<00:01:47.399> cause<00:01:47.670> your<00:01:48.000> detail<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.750> your<00:01:48.869> subject

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
it can cause your detail of your subject

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.690 
it can cause your detail of your subject
to<00:01:49.290> become<00:01:50.149> less<00:01:51.170> noticeable<00:01:52.369> or<00:01:53.369> less

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
to become less noticeable or less

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.819 
to become less noticeable or less
defined<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.780> really<00:01:55.049> want<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.290> avoid<00:01:55.590> that

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
defined so you really want to avoid that

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.620 
defined so you really want to avoid that
at<00:01:56.009> all<00:01:56.100> cost<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> best<00:01:57.060> way<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.210> do<00:01:57.479> that

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
at all cost and the best way to do that

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.080 
at all cost and the best way to do that
is<00:01:57.869> by<00:01:58.049> setting<00:01:58.110> your<00:01:58.530> aperture<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.759> higher

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
is by setting your aperture to a higher

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.359 
is by setting your aperture to a higher
value<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.810> highest<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.229> can<00:02:01.259> go<00:02:01.590> as<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> matter

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
value the highest you can go as a matter

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.609
