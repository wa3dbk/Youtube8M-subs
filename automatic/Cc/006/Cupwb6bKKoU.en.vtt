one

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.109 

it<00:01:20.790> has<00:01:21.409> four<00:01:22.409> color<00:01:22.619> bars<00:01:23.869> you<00:01:24.869> put<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.290> on

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
it has four color bars you put this on

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:33.800 
it has four color bars you put this on
you<00:01:27.119> know<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:31.579> you<00:01:32.579> get<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.000> four<00:01:33.360> different

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
you know and you get the four different

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.640 
you know and you get the four different
colors<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:35.070> becomes<00:01:35.400> easier<00:01:36.320> yet<00:01:37.320> again

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
colors and it becomes easier yet again

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.469 
colors and it becomes easier yet again
to<00:01:38.579> match<00:01:39.590> to<00:01:40.590> match<00:01:40.799> your<00:01:41.130> pH<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.270> looks

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
to match to match your pH and it looks

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.870 
to match to match your pH and it looks
like<00:01:43.790> looks<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:44.939> my<00:01:45.090> p.m.<00:01:45.509> saliva<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.320> six<00:01:46.880> -

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880
