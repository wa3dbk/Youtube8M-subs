get<00:01:39.659> it<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.780> stay<00:01:39.990> out<00:01:40.170> really<00:01:40.500> solidly<00:01:41.009> or

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
get it to stay out really solidly or

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.620 
get it to stay out really solidly or
nothing<00:01:41.579> other<00:01:41.820> than<00:01:42.030> hitting<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.420> against

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
nothing other than hitting it against

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.840 
nothing other than hitting it against
the<00:01:42.780> ground<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.470> got<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.710> swing<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.040> downwards

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
the ground you got to swing it downwards

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.850 
the ground you got to swing it downwards
really<00:01:45.210> hard<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.780> keeps<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.439> open<00:01:46.560> real

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
really hard and that keeps it open real

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.260 
really hard and that keeps it open real
good<00:01:47.960> so<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.079> one<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.409> 21<00:01:50.009> inches<00:01:50.460> they<00:01:51.030> sell

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
good so this one is 21 inches they sell

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.200 
good so this one is 21 inches they sell
them<00:01:51.420> between<00:01:51.689> 12<00:01:52.079> inches<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.860> 26<00:01:53.460> inches<00:01:53.880> I

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
them between 12 inches and 26 inches I

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.660 
them between 12 inches and 26 inches I
got<00:01:54.899> 21<00:01:55.350> because<00:01:55.710> it's<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.390> good<00:01:58.490> what's<00:01:59.490> worth

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
got 21 because it's a good what's worth

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.660 
got 21 because it's a good what's worth
enough<00:01:59.880> fur<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.560> really<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.649> no<00:02:01.770> idea<00:02:02.040> but<00:02:02.460> um

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
enough fur I really have no idea but um

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.109 
enough fur I really have no idea but um
it's<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.450> good<00:02:03.600> difference<00:02:04.049> between<00:02:05.119> medium

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
it's a good difference between medium

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.990 
it's a good difference between medium
it's<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.420> good<00:02:06.630> medium<00:02:07.079> between<00:02:07.789> expanded<00:02:08.789> ends

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
it's a good medium between expanded ends

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.580 
it's a good medium between expanded ends
and<00:02:09.360> collapsed<00:02:09.989> lengths

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
and collapsed lengths

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.020 
and collapsed lengths
cuz<00:02:10.739> ya<00:02:12.019> 26-inch<00:02:13.019> ones<00:02:13.910> or<00:02:14.910> about<00:02:15.300> this<00:02:15.510> long

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
cuz ya 26-inch ones or about this long

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.130 
cuz ya 26-inch ones or about this long
collapsed<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.269> mean<00:02:18.420> this<00:02:18.540> can't<00:02:18.810> go<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.050> a

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
at home but it's kind of falling apart I

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.670 
at home but it's kind of falling apart I
got<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.880> do<00:02:47.970> some<00:02:48.180> repairs<00:02:48.480> on<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.720> that<00:02:49.440> one

it's<00:02:50.340> this<00:02:50.760> length<00:02:51.000> collapsed<00:02:51.690> but<00:02:51.870> it

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
it's this length collapsed but it

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.710 
it's this length collapsed but it
expands<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.500> 26<00:02:53.130> inches<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:54.269> so<00:02:54.390> that<00:02:54.569> one's

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
expands to 26 inches and so that one's

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.050 
expands to 26 inches and so that one's
really<00:02:54.900> good<00:02:55.170> but<00:02:55.440> it's<00:02:55.590> even<00:02:56.400> lower<00:02:56.519> quality

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
really good but it's even lower quality

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.880 
really good but it's even lower quality
than<00:02:57.269> this<00:02:57.390> one<00:02:57.599> I<00:02:57.660> gotta<00:02:57.840> say<00:02:58.019> convention

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890

out<00:03:45.389> the<00:03:45.540> whole<00:03:45.660> thing<00:03:45.900> I<00:03:46.200> mean<00:03:46.680> it<00:03:46.769> didn't

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
out the whole thing I mean it didn't

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.620 
out the whole thing I mean it didn't
break<00:03:47.280> it'll<00:03:47.639> go<00:03:47.700> flying<00:03:47.940> off<00:03:48.150> its<00:03:48.389> own<00:03:48.540> an

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599

as<00:03:51.989> he<00:03:52.109> treated<00:03:52.440> steel<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:52.829> I<00:03:52.859> highly

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
as he treated steel so I highly

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.349 
as he treated steel so I highly
recommend<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.579> figuring<00:03:53.880> by<00:03:53.970> one<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.299> these

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
recommend to figuring by one of these

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.440 
recommend to figuring by one of these

&amp;<00:03:57.660> Wesson<00:03:57.870> I<00:03:57.930> ask<00:03:58.139> another<00:03:59.130> thing<00:03:59.489> about<00:03:59.579> this

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
&amp; Wesson I ask another thing about this

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.690 
&amp; Wesson I ask another thing about this
about<00:04:00.419> the<00:04:00.569> whole<00:04:00.750> general<00:04:01.470> design<00:04:01.799> of<00:04:01.829> it<00:04:02.160> and

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
about the whole general design of it and

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.460 
about the whole general design of it and
go<00:04:02.970> back<00:04:03.180> through<00:04:03.209> order<00:04:03.930> of<00:04:04.019> human<00:04:04.349> history

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
go back through order of human history

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.009 
go back through order of human history
and<00:04:04.799> even<00:04:05.040> before<00:04:05.250> that<00:04:05.430> monkey<00:04:05.940> history<00:04:06.120> the

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
and even before that monkey history the

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.650 
and even before that monkey history the
first<00:04:07.290> ever<00:04:07.620> made<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.160> weapon<00:04:08.519> used<00:04:08.760> is<00:04:09.120> a<00:04:09.180> stick

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
first ever made a weapon used is a stick

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.490 
first ever made a weapon used is a stick
and<00:04:10.519> it's<00:04:11.519> so<00:04:11.849> simple<00:04:12.299> you<00:04:12.569> pick<00:04:12.780> up<00:04:12.959> a<00:04:13.169> thing

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
and it's so simple you pick up a thing

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.589 
and it's so simple you pick up a thing
which<00:04:13.709> is<00:04:13.739> blunt<00:04:14.160> and<00:04:14.459> you<00:04:14.609> smack<00:04:15.000> an<00:04:15.269> enemy

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
which is blunt and you smack an enemy

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.569 
which is blunt and you smack an enemy
with<00:04:15.750> it<00:04:15.930> that's<00:04:16.109> how<00:04:16.229> it<00:04:16.349> works<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.829> the

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
with it that's how it works and the

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.539 
with it that's how it works and the
simplicity<00:04:17.820> of<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.359> design<00:04:18.750> is<00:04:19.310> being<00:04:20.310> used

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
simplicity of that design is being used

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.190 
simplicity of that design is being used
today<00:04:20.760> by<00:04:21.060> police<00:04:21.329> forces<00:04:21.750> all<00:04:21.900> over<00:04:21.930> the

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
love that that the simplest weapon ever

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.050 
love that that the simplest weapon ever
is<00:04:34.229> what's<00:04:34.410> being<00:04:34.590> used<00:04:34.889> by<00:04:35.280> law<00:04:35.550> enforcers

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060

today<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.870> it's<00:04:37.350> really<00:04:38.010> I<00:04:38.310> mean<00:04:38.910> it<00:04:38.970> makes

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
today and it's really I mean it makes

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.310 
today and it's really I mean it makes
sense<00:04:39.240> when<00:04:39.540> you<00:04:39.600> think<00:04:39.630> about<00:04:39.870> it<00:04:40.169> but<00:04:40.290> I

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
sense when you think about it but I

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.420 
sense when you think about it but I
still<00:04:40.380> think<00:04:40.860> that's<00:04:40.949> awesome

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
still think that's awesome

so<00:04:42.210> collateral<00:04:43.169> returns<00:04:43.500> it's<00:04:43.740> a<00:04:43.800> good<00:04:43.949> thing

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
so collateral returns it's a good thing

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.400 
so collateral returns it's a good thing
to<00:04:44.220> have<00:04:44.430> I<00:04:44.760> mean<00:04:45.180> in<00:04:45.570> New<00:04:45.690> Jersey<00:04:45.750> they're<00:04:46.290> not

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
give a but it's legal in most

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.790 
give a but it's legal in most
states<00:04:53.340> only<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.380> northeasters<00:04:55.380> were<00:04:55.470> people

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
states only the northeasters were people

states only the northeasters were people
a<00:04:55.860> little<00:04:56.039> bit<00:04:56.220> pissy<00:04:57.150> about<00:04:57.360> them<00:04:57.539> but<00:04:58.440> look

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
a little bit pissy about them but look

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.370 
a little bit pissy about them but look
look<00:04:59.490> what<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.669> laws<00:04:59.880> off<00:05:00.150> get<00:05:00.840> one<00:05:01.080> if<00:05:01.260> you

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
so I guess that's the end of this video

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.020 
so I guess that's the end of this video
and<00:05:07.620> you're<00:05:08.070> gonna<00:05:08.130> be<00:05:08.340> seeing<00:05:08.550> it<00:05:08.639> off<00:05:08.760> meow

and you're gonna be seeing it off meow

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.330 
and you're gonna be seeing it off meow
in<00:05:09.330> cool<00:05:09.570> locations<00:05:10.139> like<00:05:10.260> this<00:05:10.470> I'm<00:05:10.949> gonna<00:05:11.160> be
