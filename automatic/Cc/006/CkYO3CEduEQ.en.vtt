00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.980
 tha 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.760
 hello i'm the doctor sydney ohana 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.830
 plastic surgeon I practice since 30 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.849
 years old and I 'm going to talk to you about the 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.860
 rhinoplasty 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.689
 everyone knows this word 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.580
 Rhinoplasty ie at the angers 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.739
 nose the most frequent requests 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.450
 it lÃ© default concerns 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.939
 deformities of the nose when there is a 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.790
 hump or when the tip is too 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.380
 thick too wide 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:37.130
 so it's aesthetic rhinoplasty 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.429
 which will consist of removing beauce and 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.179
 reduce cartilage at the level of 

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:42.530
 tip of the nose 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:44.179
 so first of all it's a 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.750
 intervention that was already taking place in 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:47.239
 antiquity 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.649
 but for more than fifty 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.960
 years we know how to do this 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.879
 intervention simply going through 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.960
 inside the nostrils without having 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.300
 need to make scars outside 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.429
 with the instruments that we have 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.430
 we can recall the beauty we can 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.930
 define precisely the shape of the 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.790
 cartilage that we will leave in place 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:13.940
 to get thinner year with a back 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.700
 men either straight or concave and a 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.090
 better drawn tip is thinner the 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.180
 simulation with software allows us 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.290
 to show the before / after to the patients 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.360
 before the intervention 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.420
 which allows them to apprehend their 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.580
 subsequent image and it makes it easier for them 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.340
 decision making here is nose 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.560
 with a bump and that allows us to 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.800
 remove the hump and show to the 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:44.810
 pressures exactly the result that 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.980
 can discount the intervention is happening 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.740
 under general anesthesia 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.970
 after all the precautions of used 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.100
 that is to say wants us to consultation 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.360
 consultation with the anesthesiologist the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.560
 simulation on the computer and 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.170
 the operation is done from within the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.630
 nostrils helps to work loos the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.450
 cartilage to close the mucosa and 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.430
 then we put in place a plaster of 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.760
 contention that will stay in place a 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.649
 week 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.420
 when there is a deflection of partitions 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.459
 associated with disorders of the 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.670
 breathing corrects the septum in 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.980
 same time 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.140
 at that moment there are wicks the 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.840
 nostril that is removed the next day or 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.170
 that the 48th hours the operative suites 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.330
 are not painful most often 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.300
 born are marked by cockades and 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.900
 blue for eight to ten days so at 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.940
 eighth day ablation of the plaster no 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.890
 pain we resume its activity after 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.180
 ten days 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.190
 during these ten days there is care 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.650
 postoperative is to clean up well 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.930
 inside the small nostrils 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.900
 crusts that could settle is done 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.700
 with a cotton swab is a product and 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.370
 so we come back to see the surgeon for 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.260
 the removal of the plaster and then 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.630
 resumes its activities at the beginning 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.540
 the nose is still swollen during 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.370
 first month he deflates and becomes 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.140
 less hard after a few months and 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.540
 it is considered that it is solid that 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.970
 really around the sixth eighth month 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.170
 it can happen in plastic rhinos 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.380
 we need a small editing 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.640
 secondary happens in 5% of cases 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.799
 are small things you do not need 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.320
 not be afraid that's going on this is and 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.180
 local that allows to correct this 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.739
 imperfection that has settled 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.670
 progressively during healing 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:29.010
 of the nose so the surgeon style says it l 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.170
 already explains during the first 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.150
 consultation and the last consultation 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.670
 is done after one year to check 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.380
 that everything is consolidated and that all these 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.380
 last in place thank you
