 in question is he 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.879
 after having climbed to it 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.589
 we asked 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.589
 Do you expect the queen? 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.150
 and now 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.810
 like every half hour to protect us 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.120
 the talent 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.890
 sarney remembers the year he is talking here is my door and spicy essays 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.360
 just a wide victim we'll teach instead we'll save it as soon as we do not mind 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.360
 in moments 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.850
 There you are the newlyweds 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.380
 in injunction 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.520
 you went 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.380
 the last 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.300
 where is installed 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.390
 the way between the environment 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.780
 but I know this is my computer 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.580
 if there is more 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.570
 relevant program 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.490
 drought 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.220
 the udinese 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.220
 on five screens 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.119
 the semed and craig bass 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:13.929
 no senate 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:16.929
 offering access and special 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.629
 the singer 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.929
 if I am installed among the goods 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:28.249
 redknapp technical for all this 

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:40.230
 the letter highlights 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.409
 and stresses that there is a treaty falling as soon as dressing 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:45.510
 that's weird
