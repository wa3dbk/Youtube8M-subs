mode<00:00:41.070> but<00:00:41.879> don't<00:00:42.150> worry<00:00:42.620> because<00:00:43.620> basically

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
mode but don't worry because basically

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.650 
mode but don't worry because basically
all<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.550> really<00:00:44.699> have<00:00:44.790> to<00:00:44.910> do<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.210> attack<00:00:45.510> it

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
all you really have to do is attack it

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.079 
all you really have to do is attack it
from<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.960> opposite<00:00:46.409> side<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:47.100> hopefully

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
from the opposite side and hopefully

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.509 
from the opposite side and hopefully
they<00:00:48.629> haven't<00:00:48.930> reloaded<00:00:49.500> or<00:00:49.680> loaded<00:00:50.220> all<00:00:50.370> of

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
they haven't reloaded or loaded all of

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.630 
they haven't reloaded or loaded all of
their<00:00:50.670> traps<00:00:51.620> tesla's<00:00:52.620> things<00:00:52.860> like<00:00:53.040> that<00:00:53.220> so

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
their traps tesla's things like that so

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.890 
their traps tesla's things like that so
it's<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> little<00:00:53.909> bit<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.150> a<00:00:54.210> risk<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.600> can

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
it's a little bit of a risk you can

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.750 
it's a little bit of a risk you can
choose<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.290> attack<00:00:55.860> from<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.159> opposite<00:00:56.550> side

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
choose to attack from the opposite side

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.079 
choose to attack from the opposite side
I<00:00:57.030> normally<00:00:57.839> do<00:00:58.050> just<00:00:58.890> try<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.159> deploy<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.549> few

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
I normally do just try to deploy a few

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.000 
I normally do just try to deploy a few
Scout<00:01:00.479> troops<00:01:00.750> before<00:01:01.019> that<00:01:01.440> because<00:01:01.830> then

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
Scout troops before that because then

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.219 
Scout troops before that because then
you<00:01:02.100> can<00:01:02.220> sort<00:01:02.400> of<00:01:02.489> trigger<00:01:02.760> all<00:01:03.629> their<00:01:03.930> traps

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
you can sort of trigger all their traps

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.380 
you can sort of trigger all their traps
and<00:01:04.500> things<00:01:04.680> like<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:05.309> overall<00:01:06.030> no

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
and things like that but overall no

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.800 
and things like that but overall no

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
entire base and then there's that one

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.390 
entire base and then there's that one
last<00:01:12.570> pesky<00:01:13.229> little<00:01:13.440> percentage<00:01:13.860> point<00:01:14.280> in

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
last pesky little percentage point in

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.520 
last pesky little percentage point in
the<00:01:14.520> corner<00:01:14.880> normally<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.960> doesn't<00:01:16.170> usually

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
the corner normally it doesn't usually

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
come down to that last second or so so I

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.810 
come down to that last second or so so I
usually<00:01:19.890> don't<00:01:20.040> do<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.370> Builder<00:01:20.670> Hut

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
strategy sometimes it does pay off but i

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.280 
strategy sometimes it does pay off but i
would<00:01:23.370> say<00:01:23.520> nine<00:01:24.150> point<00:01:24.690> nine<00:01:24.750> times<00:01:25.080> out<00:01:25.260> of

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
would say nine point nine times out of

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.690 
would say nine point nine times out of
ten<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.620> doesn't<00:01:25.920> alright<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.430> was<00:01:26.550> a

so<00:01:37.980> actually<00:01:38.370> I<00:01:38.400> think<00:01:38.490> he<00:01:38.700> had<00:01:38.820> one<00:01:39.030> lava

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.000 
so actually I think he had one lava
hound<00:01:39.510> in<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.870> clan<00:01:40.080> castle<00:01:40.110> so<00:01:40.710> here<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:40.980> have

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
hound in the clan castle so here we have

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.700
