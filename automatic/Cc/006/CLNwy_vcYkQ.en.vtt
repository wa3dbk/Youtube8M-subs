00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Hello, I'm from Jamaica in Automation. 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.879
 residential and commercial 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.160
 I heard this video lesson for those who have 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.639
 interest in learning about 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.040
 Winner cameras in this new will have three 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.760
 topics starting with this first one 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.170
 is the presentation of used products 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.240
 for this video lesson 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.100
 Let's start the presentation of our 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.810
 router 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.550
 This is a router of the brand te period 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.390
 he's 3g because I do not like I do not have 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.630
 access to the wired network as speedy 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.040
 how nef I use it very 3g 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.570
 only to take the test in the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.460
 The installations that I make today I go 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.290
 depending on the installation of the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.270
 customer, then take a test with the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.390
 my own internet 3g 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.250
 so if we can ever learn but 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.219
 model can be a simple and 3g also 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.890
 can be normal only concentrating on having the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:03.949
 3d function nÃ© 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:03.949
 this is the model t rmr 3420 rmr 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.400
 3421 very important magic search 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.830
 use only you will do is the system 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.280
 like one with camera guards right? 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.549
 try to use the 300 mega theater more 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.610
 because that's because megabytes per second 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.310
 and this greatly influences the time of 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.850
 install coin cameras because you are champion 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.220
 years it requires a lot of sending and receiving 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.299
 information and how much more 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.310
 information was sent and received but 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.500
 you will get quality in the signal too 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.930
 of your camera will have released will not 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.240
 keep stopping they were 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.460
 happens a lot because of routers 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.570
 then this is a tip 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.689
 use a 300 router if you put too much 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.780
 there you can use it I do not recommend that 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:13.590
 Camera installation is or AIDS is the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:16.620
 ideal to do the configuration is this is 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:21.349
 a sian brand campaign we have one 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.349
 small we have several models in franca 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.860
 it is also in the pieces that they do not come 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.599
 even though at home it only comes with the 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.340
 function and pp 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.780
 when I go to buy to pay attention 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.390
 also on tv 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:41.540
 the fit of the previous team then did not 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.920
 has the information function for her 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.670
 work without end 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.680
 This is a camera here at the first 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.000
 Marina's entrance will be the 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.390
 same setting 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.140
 it has an audio output you can 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.430
 call none to see if something you 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.720
 Can you talk online? 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:14.430
 the way over or pay cable entry 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:16.530
 rj 45 medium network cable is very 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.150
 important that people do not know 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:24.090
 also set up here in the 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:27.870
 part of the king is the part of rs 1 and 2 still 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.670
 So this one leaves here for you to call. 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.590
 energy nothing she already leaves with 5 volts 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.610
 five goals there yes you can pick five 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.239
 goals 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.519
 buy a relay and install after it 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.860
 understood why when you start 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.069
 automatically it would narrate and close itself 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.170
 receive it already left with 5 volts block 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.989
 side has these 3 and 4 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.049
 the sock also an entrance 3 which is the 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.030
 exit at 34 the entrance in the entrance you 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.629
 can be without your presence 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.630
 when he made contact then she only ala 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.210
 in the case 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.380
 and if you consult you can also 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.720
 trigger the alarm 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.540
 she is also doing the part of 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.930
 monitoring was also to leave in 3 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.870
 and 4 inputs 3 and 4 are 12 output 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:19.180
 five goals 34 entrance for sensor 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.350
 I 'm not alarmed and they can burn 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:27.100
 the camera and here in the end we have to 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:30.280
 power input in case it is also 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.290
 one is some 5 volt source 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.110
 This is very important for you to catch. 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:38.200
 always used to look good is world 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:42.670
 input and output so as not to confuse and 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:48.820
 to install the local TV coming 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:50.470
 together with her to call you directly at 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.760
 computer in the field the computer you 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:57.880
 need to make a configuration of a 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:01.120
 computer to find a camera on the 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.880
 head to find the address of the 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.410
 camera but it is a different way of 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.420
 to work 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.420
 and this is the installation cd 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:20.410
 We'll talk, we'll call everything. 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:25.870
 the equipment let's turn on the router 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:28.840
 Let's turn the camera on the router and let's 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:37.350
 Put water on her so I'm 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:42.600
 with education here in the connected router 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:42.600
 Now let's get some food. 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:55.440
 this ip camera power supply 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:58.980
 you can call too, there's no program 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:04.790
 have this business of calling first time 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.790
 can not connect antenna 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:18.580
 When are you going to have a good time? 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:22.300

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:24.490
 part of a break from it then there everyone 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:28.110

 You learn to call and Japan too. 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:48.340
 ride this way 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.840
 I'm not going to connect a computer, I'm going 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:07:01.419
 work with her 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:07:07.660
 already in wireless areas and the other to a few knots 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:10.419
 fits in router does not have port 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:14.790

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:23.530
 to understand right? 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:31.210
 I installed it and asked for it quickly. 

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:37.080
 network cable router connected energy 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:40.360
 antenna and now software 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:44.340
