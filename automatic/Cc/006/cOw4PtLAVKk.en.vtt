we would like to enable the 3d

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.730 
we would like to enable the 3d
interaction<00:00:15.879> with<00:00:16.150> annual<00:00:16.480> surface<00:00:16.779> okay<00:00:17.500> now

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
interaction with annual surface okay now

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.710 
interaction with annual surface okay now
let<00:00:17.980> me<00:00:18.009> show<00:00:18.160> the<00:00:18.460> demos<00:00:18.790> for<00:00:19.330> this<00:00:19.510> time<00:00:19.689> I

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
let me show the demos for this time I

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.480 
let me show the demos for this time I
saw<00:00:19.900> how<00:00:20.020> we<00:00:20.080> used<00:00:20.350> to<00:00:20.650> sing<00:00:20.949> for<00:00:21.100> the<00:00:21.220> two

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
saw how we used to sing for the two

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.490 
saw how we used to sing for the two
times<00:00:21.789> and<00:00:22.060> we<00:00:22.510> assume<00:00:22.779> this<00:00:22.990> jump<00:00:23.260> is<00:00:23.350> that

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
times and we assume this jump is that

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.460 
times and we assume this jump is that
even<00:00:23.650> the<00:00:23.740> head<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:25.060> the<00:00:25.359> last<00:00:25.570> last<00:00:26.050> gem<00:00:26.320> a

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
even the head of the last last gem a

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.310 
even the head of the last last gem a
tacit<00:00:26.800> habit<00:00:27.099> and<00:00:27.580> a<00:00:27.640> photo<00:00:28.119> for<00:00:28.480> the<00:00:28.630> rest<00:00:28.990> of

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
tacit habit and a photo for the rest of

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:37.229 
tacit habit and a photo for the rest of
it<00:00:29.470> and<00:00:29.890> tap<00:00:30.160> in<00:00:30.310> the<00:00:30.400> air<00:00:35.580> so<00:00:36.580> also<00:00:36.760> can<00:00:37.000> put<00:00:37.180> a

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
it and tap in the air so also can put a

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.930 
it and tap in the air so also can put a
DVD<00:00:37.449> and<00:00:37.900> put<00:00:38.440> hard<00:00:38.680> so<00:00:39.159> can<00:00:39.339> say<00:00:39.549> that<00:00:39.729> sound

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
DVD and put hard so can say that sound

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.869 
DVD and put hard so can say that sound
difference<00:00:40.330> okay<00:00:40.780> also<00:00:41.229> in<00:00:42.010> this<00:00:42.159> 3d<00:00:42.640> a

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
difference okay also in this 3d a

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.299 
difference okay also in this 3d a
specific<00:00:43.750> a<00:00:43.870> quicker<00:00:44.409> if<00:00:44.559> we<00:00:44.710> can<00:00:44.920> know<00:00:45.040> the

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
specific a quicker if we can know the

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.750 
specific a quicker if we can know the
route<00:00:45.850> and<00:00:46.089> it<00:00:46.390> has<00:00:46.540> a<00:00:46.570> 3d<00:00:46.989> objects<00:00:47.470> and<00:00:48.010> so<00:00:48.519> I

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
route and it has a 3d objects and so I

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:57.090 
route and it has a 3d objects and so I
thinking<00:00:49.150> you<00:00:49.390> change<00:00:49.720> to<00:00:49.989> another<00:00:50.260> one<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:57.070> i

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
thinking you change to another one so i

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.390 
thinking you change to another one so i
can<00:00:57.339> use<00:00:57.489> my<00:00:57.540> fingers<00:00:58.540> who<00:00:58.960> each<00:00:59.799> other<00:01:00.040> the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
can use my fingers who each other the

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.880 
can use my fingers who each other the
background<00:01:00.820> music<00:01:01.150> that's<00:01:01.449> in<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:01.689> air<00:01:04.890> also

but<00:02:29.400> again<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.090> can<00:02:30.209> easily<00:02:30.360> imagine<00:02:30.709> you

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
but again you can easily imagine you

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.860 
but again you can easily imagine you
know<00:02:31.830> phone<00:02:32.549> devices<00:02:32.910> or<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.360> device<00:02:33.600> in<00:02:33.750> the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
know phone devices or the device in the

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.840 
know phone devices or the device in the
future<00:02:34.230> having<00:02:35.040> those<00:02:35.250> kinds<00:02:35.790> of

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
future having those kinds of

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.160 
future having those kinds of
capabilities<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:36.900> what<00:02:37.049> we're

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
capabilities and so what we're

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.479 
capabilities and so what we're
experimenting<00:02:37.440> we're<00:02:37.860> here<00:02:38.070> is<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.250> kinds<00:02:38.459> of

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
experimenting we're here is the kinds of

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.890 
experimenting we're here is the kinds of
applications<00:02:38.640> you<00:02:39.209> would<00:02:39.299> build<00:02:39.450> with<00:02:39.690> those

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
applications you would build with those

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.490 
applications you would build with those
capabilities<00:02:41.600> all<00:02:42.600> right<00:02:42.720> we<00:02:42.870> can<00:02:42.989> move<00:02:43.110> on<00:02:43.260> to

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
capabilities all right we can move on to

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.940 
capabilities all right we can move on to
the<00:02:45.049> so<00:02:46.049> what<00:02:46.440> are<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.620> three<00:02:46.799> components

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
the so what are the three components

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.039 
the so what are the three components
here<00:02:47.489> in<00:02:47.670> there<00:02:47.850> the<00:02:47.970> good<00:02:48.360> of<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.750> bicycle

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
here in there the good of the bicycle

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.830 
here in there the good of the bicycle
our<00:02:49.530> own<00:02:49.769> that<00:02:50.310> pod<00:02:50.519> access<00:02:50.910> is<00:02:51.090> camera<00:02:51.600> and

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
our own that pod access is camera and

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.259 
our own that pod access is camera and
the<00:02:51.900> camera<00:02:51.930> sensing<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.799> okay<00:02:53.280> thanks<00:02:54.120> very

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
the camera sensing that okay thanks very

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.329 
the camera sensing that okay thanks very
much
