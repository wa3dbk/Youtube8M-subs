00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.280 
with a standard light tower just because
the<00:02:29.110> bulbs<00:02:29.440> get<00:02:29.620> so<00:02:29.950> hot<00:02:30.600> that<00:02:31.600> if<00:02:32.019> anyone

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
the bulbs get so hot that if anyone

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.050 
the bulbs get so hot that if anyone
comes<00:02:32.620> into<00:02:32.950> contact<00:02:33.190> with<00:02:33.550> them<00:02:33.820> you're

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
comes into contact with them you're

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.320 
comes into contact with them you're
actually<00:02:34.209> risking<00:02:35.580> severe<00:02:36.580> burns

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
actually risking severe burns

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.310 
actually risking severe burns
since<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.410> LEDs<00:02:38.860> burn<00:02:39.790> so<00:02:40.150> cool<00:02:40.480> we<00:02:41.290> don't

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
since the LEDs burn so cool we don't

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.560 
since the LEDs burn so cool we don't
have<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.769> worry<00:02:42.010> about<00:02:42.190> someone<00:02:42.940> getting<00:02:43.180> hurt

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
have to worry about someone getting hurt

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.520 
have to worry about someone getting hurt
but<00:02:44.440> also<00:02:45.269> this<00:02:46.269> means<00:02:46.600> we<00:02:46.840> can<00:02:47.019> run<00:02:47.200> four

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
but also this means we can run four

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.970 
but also this means we can run four
corner<00:02:47.980> lighting<00:02:48.730> so<00:02:49.480> with<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.660> quick

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
corner lighting so with a quick

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.620 
corner lighting so with a quick
disconnect<00:02:50.980> system<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:52.810> allows<00:02:53.140> us<00:02:53.170> to

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
disconnect system that allows us to

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.620 
disconnect system that allows us to
disconnect<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:55.840> move<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.320> light<00:02:57.299> we<00:02:58.299> can<00:02:58.480> now

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
disconnect and move the light we can now

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:07.690 
disconnect and move the light we can now
have<00:02:58.870> ground<00:02:59.230> lighting<00:02:59.700> on<00:03:00.700> all<00:03:01.090> four<00:03:01.360> corners

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.990 

so<00:03:08.700> we<00:03:08.880> simply<00:03:10.640> place<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.910> light<00:03:13.760> using<00:03:14.760> the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
so we simply place the light using the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.060 
so we simply place the light using the
quick<00:03:15.210> connect<00:03:15.960> system<00:03:20.120> attach<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.300> light

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
quick connect system attach the light

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.300 
quick connect system attach the light
put<00:03:23.070> it<00:03:23.190> at<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.490> angle<00:03:23.790> we<00:03:23.910> want<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:25.310> simply

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
put it at the angle we want and simply

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.850 
put it at the angle we want and simply

feature<00:05:40.169> we've<00:05:40.440> already<00:05:40.680> discussed<00:05:41.430> but

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
feature we've already discussed but

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.090 
feature we've already discussed but
can't<00:05:42.060> overstate<00:05:42.300> is<00:05:43.050> the<00:05:43.320> ability<00:05:43.560> to<00:05:43.860> turn

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
can't overstate is the ability to turn

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.420 
can't overstate is the ability to turn
the<00:05:44.130> lights<00:05:44.400> on<00:05:44.760> and<00:05:44.820> off<00:05:45.090> immediately<00:05:46.430> what

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
the lights on and off immediately what

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.000 
the lights on and off immediately what
this<00:05:47.610> means<00:05:47.850> on<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.150> jobsite<00:05:48.660> is<00:05:48.960> instead<00:05:49.950> of

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
this means on the jobsite is instead of

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.770 
this means on the jobsite is instead of
waiting<00:05:50.460> five<00:05:50.729> to<00:05:50.970> ten<00:05:51.150> minutes<00:05:51.510> for<00:05:51.570> the

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
waiting five to ten minutes for the

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.290 
waiting five to ten minutes for the
lights<00:05:51.960> to<00:05:52.169> fully<00:05:52.380> come<00:05:52.650> on<00:05:52.860> able<00:05:53.820> to<00:05:53.940> see<00:05:54.150> the

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
lights to fully come on able to see the

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.219 
lights to fully come on able to see the
lights<00:05:54.510> fully<00:05:54.870> on<00:05:55.140> and<00:05:56.750> without<00:05:57.750> having<00:05:58.139> to

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
lights fully on and without having to

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:01.010 
lights fully on and without having to
wait<00:05:58.410> we<00:05:58.740> can<00:05:58.889> turn<00:05:59.100> them<00:05:59.250> off<00:05:59.660> this<00:06:00.660> means

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
wait we can turn them off this means

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.040 
wait we can turn them off this means
it's<00:06:01.320> now<00:06:01.470> practical<00:06:02.310> to<00:06:03.180> test<00:06:03.450> our<00:06:03.660> lighting

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
it's now practical to test our lighting

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.250 
it's now practical to test our lighting
whereas<00:06:04.800> a<00:06:04.860> standard<00:06:05.370> light<00:06:05.550> tower<00:06:06.260> you're

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
whereas a standard light tower you're

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.900 
whereas a standard light tower you're
not<00:06:07.440> going<00:06:07.740> to<00:06:07.860> turn<00:06:08.039> the<00:06:08.190> lights<00:06:08.400> on<00:06:08.580> and<00:06:08.639> off

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
not going to turn the lights on and off

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.180 
not going to turn the lights on and off
just<00:06:09.360> because<00:06:09.570> of<00:06:10.020> the<00:06:10.110> time<00:06:10.320> to<00:06:10.530> strike<00:06:10.830> and

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
just because of the time to strike and

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.760 
just because of the time to strike and
then<00:06:11.850> technically<00:06:12.360> restrike<00:06:13.020> which<00:06:13.590> is

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
then technically restrike which is

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.760 
then technically restrike which is
supposed<00:06:14.130> to<00:06:14.250> be<00:06:14.400> 30<00:06:14.669> minutes<00:06:15.139> now<00:06:16.139> instant

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
supposed to be 30 minutes now instant

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.900 
supposed to be 30 minutes now instant
own<00:06:16.860> instant<00:06:17.370> all<00:06:17.490> we<00:06:18.389> find<00:06:18.720> that<00:06:18.990> many<00:06:19.229> times

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
own instant all we find that many times

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.750 
own instant all we find that many times
one<00:06:20.910> or<00:06:21.360> two<00:06:21.720> lights<00:06:21.960> is<00:06:22.260> enough<00:06:22.760> means

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
one or two lights is enough means

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.909 
one or two lights is enough means
instead<00:06:24.270> of<00:06:24.389> having<00:06:24.600> sixteen<00:06:25.320> hours<00:06:25.650> of

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 
instead of having sixteen hours of

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.380 
instead of having sixteen hours of
battery<00:06:26.280> life<00:06:26.330> now<00:06:27.330> we're<00:06:27.570> up<00:06:27.690> to<00:06:27.720> 32
