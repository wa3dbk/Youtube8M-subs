Americano when the machines operating
these<00:00:55.260> two<00:00:55.670> you<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:56.820> 12<00:00:57.720> to<00:00:57.870> 13<00:00:58.430> bar<00:00:59.430> pump

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
these two you have 12 to 13 bar pump

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.880 
these two you have 12 to 13 bar pump
pressure<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:01.560> on<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.770> bottom

pressure and the one on the bottom

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.920 
pressure and the one on the bottom
that's<00:01:02.160> very<00:01:02.370> low<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:02.970> only<00:01:03.120> about<00:01:03.270> 2<00:01:03.540> to<00:01:03.690> 3

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
that's very low it's only about 2 to 3

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.329 
that's very low it's only about 2 to 3
so<00:01:04.619> for<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:04.979> one

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
so for that one

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.520 
so for that one
the<00:01:05.729> capsules<00:01:06.210> you'll<00:01:06.840> have<00:01:07.049> very<00:01:07.290> coarse

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the capsules you'll have very coarse

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.600 
the capsules you'll have very coarse
grind<00:01:07.950> coffee<00:01:08.390> or<00:01:09.390> leaf<00:01:09.720> tea<00:01:10.310> but<00:01:11.310> with<00:01:11.460> our

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
grind coffee or leaf tea but with our

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.610 
grind coffee or leaf tea but with our
capsules<00:01:12.060> you'll<00:01:12.450> be<00:01:12.570> using<00:01:12.780> predominantly

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
capsules you'll be using predominantly

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.210 
capsules you'll be using predominantly
the<00:01:14.010> top<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> B<00:01:15.270> button<00:01:16.220> so

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the top to the a and the B button so

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.860 
the top to the a and the B button so
first<00:01:17.880> thing<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.240> do<00:01:18.620> is<00:01:19.620> open<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.040> lever

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
first thing to do is open the lever

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.120 
first thing to do is open the lever
there's<00:01:21.870> only<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.260> way<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.620> the<00:01:22.770> capsule

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
there's only one way that the capsule

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.480 
there's only one way that the capsule
can<00:01:23.340> go<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.930> which<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.110> facing<00:01:25.590> towards

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
can go in which is facing towards

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.690 
can go in which is facing towards
yourself<00:01:27.120> so<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.530> simply<00:01:29.010> drops<00:01:29.370> in

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
yourself so I just it simply drops in

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.210 
yourself so I just it simply drops in
close<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:32.310> lever<00:01:33.440> now<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:34.500> factory<00:01:35.040> has

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
close the lever now the factory has

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.820 
close the lever now the factory has
already<00:01:35.610> preset<00:01:35.880> these<00:01:36.330> buttons<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.590> the

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
already preset these buttons so the

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.469 
already preset these buttons so the
first<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.840> is<00:01:39.840> an<00:01:40.020> espresso

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.030 

so<00:01:45.479> there's<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.810> pre-infusion<00:01:46.409> at<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> very

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
so there's a pre-infusion at the very

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.149 
so there's a pre-infusion at the very
beginning<00:01:47.460> that's<00:01:47.700> why<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.330> starts<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.900> stops

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
beginning that's why it starts and stops

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.980 
beginning that's why it starts and stops
and<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.960> is<00:01:53.109> only<00:01:53.229> about<00:01:53.409> 30<00:01:53.770> mils<00:01:54.039> of<00:01:54.490> coffee

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.429 

then<00:02:01.950> we<00:02:02.950> pull<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.280> handle<00:02:03.609> back<00:02:04.229> we're<00:02:05.229> going

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
then we pull the handle back we're going

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.080 
then we pull the handle back we're going
to<00:02:05.530> demonstrate<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:06.399> long<00:02:07.240> espresso<00:02:08.039> simply

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
to demonstrate a long espresso simply

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.410 
to demonstrate a long espresso simply
pop<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.119> capsule<00:02:10.569> in<00:02:10.769> now<00:02:11.769> if<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.040> capsule

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
pop the capsule in now if the capsule

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.660 
pop the capsule in now if the capsule
the<00:02:13.420> previous<00:02:13.810> capsule<00:02:14.200> is<00:02:14.379> stuck<00:02:14.650> there<00:02:14.890> when

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
the previous capsule is stuck there when

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.910 
the previous capsule is stuck there when
you<00:02:15.790> drop<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.780> capsule<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.440> second<00:02:17.799> one

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
you drop the capsule in the second one

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.250 
you drop the capsule in the second one
it<00:02:18.459> should<00:02:18.790> push<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.269> capsule<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.810> previous

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
it should push the capsule the previous

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.680 
it should push the capsule the previous
capsule<00:02:20.799> through<00:02:20.980> into<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:22.180> drawer<00:02:22.420> down<00:02:22.569> the

capsule through into the drawer down the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.360 
capsule through into the drawer down the
bottom<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:24.220> we<00:02:24.340> close<00:02:24.579> that<00:02:24.610> up<00:02:26.069> this<00:02:27.069> is<00:02:27.129> our

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
bottom so we close that up this is our

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.470 
bottom so we close that up this is our
long<00:02:27.579> espresso

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
long espresso

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:59.500 
long espresso
you<00:02:30.050> like<00:02:30.200> it<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.409> bit<00:02:30.440> stronger

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.949 

and<00:02:59.599> then<00:03:00.819> the<00:03:01.819> beauty<00:03:02.150> of<00:03:02.209> this<00:03:02.330> machine<00:03:02.750> is

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
and then the beauty of this machine is

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.380 
and then the beauty of this machine is
that<00:03:03.860> we<00:03:04.340> can<00:03:04.549> program<00:03:05.030> it<00:03:05.209> very<00:03:05.540> nicely<00:03:07.390> so

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
that we can program it very nicely so

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.710 
that we can program it very nicely so
we'll<00:03:08.540> put<00:03:08.689> in<00:03:08.810> our<00:03:09.019> third<00:03:09.349> capsule<00:03:10.480> close<00:03:11.480> the

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
we'll put in our third capsule close the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.130 
we'll put in our third capsule close the
lid<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.170> I<00:03:12.769> just<00:03:13.010> should<00:03:13.549> point<00:03:13.760> out<00:03:14.140> that

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
lid and I just should point out that

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.690 
lid and I just should point out that
when<00:03:15.379> you<00:03:15.409> press<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:15.890> button<00:03:16.190> for<00:03:16.220> any<00:03:16.549> of

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
when you press the button for any of

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.750 
when you press the button for any of
these<00:03:16.900> applications<00:03:17.900> under<00:03:18.200> no<00:03:18.980> circumstance

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
these applications under no circumstance

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.449 
these applications under no circumstance
pull<00:03:20.569> the<00:03:20.720> handle<00:03:21.079> back<00:03:21.230> because<00:03:22.159> you've<00:03:22.310> got

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
pull the handle back because you've got

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.850 
pull the handle back because you've got
hot<00:03:22.640> water<00:03:22.670> running<00:03:23.269> through<00:03:23.629> the<00:03:24.409> capsule

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
hot water running through the capsule

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.559 
hot water running through the capsule
and<00:03:25.010> hot<00:03:25.519> water<00:03:25.790> will<00:03:25.970> come<00:03:26.150> up<00:03:26.180> through<00:03:26.480> the

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
and hot water will come up through the

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.929 
and hot water will come up through the
top<00:03:26.750> so<00:03:27.470> it's<00:03:27.620> very<00:03:27.739> important<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.730> you

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:28.939 
top so it's very important that you

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:31.149 
top so it's very important that you
always<00:03:29.239> keep<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.870> handle<00:03:30.230> down<00:03:30.439> when<00:03:31.040> you're

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 
always keep the handle down when you're

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.180 
always keep the handle down when you're
operating<00:03:31.549> these<00:03:31.819> buttons<00:03:32.239> in<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:33.049> front<00:03:33.290> now

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
operating these buttons in the front now

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.949 
operating these buttons in the front now
the<00:03:34.250> programming<00:03:34.970> probably<00:03:35.629> one<00:03:35.780> of<00:03:35.810> the

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
the programming probably one of the

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.119 
the programming probably one of the
easiest<00:03:36.470> espresso<00:03:37.370> machines<00:03:38.109> to<00:03:39.109> program<00:03:39.530> and

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
easiest espresso machines to program and

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.250 
easiest espresso machines to program and
it's<00:03:40.250> simply<00:03:40.549> just<00:03:40.639> holding<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.209> button<00:03:41.359> so

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
it's simply just holding the button so

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.660 
it's simply just holding the button so
if<00:03:42.409> we're<00:03:42.560> going<00:03:42.650> to<00:03:42.709> do<00:03:42.859> a<00:03:42.889> long<00:03:43.069> black

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.650 

we<00:03:46.630> just<00:03:46.840> hold<00:03:47.020> our<00:03:47.230> finger<00:03:47.530> on<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.740> button<00:03:48.660> to

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
we just hold our finger on the button to

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:57.890 
we just hold our finger on the button to
the<00:03:49.780> desired<00:03:50.400> level<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:52.930> you're<00:03:53.110> after

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.259 

so<00:03:58.470> with<00:03:58.650> this<00:03:58.799> method<00:03:59.010> it<00:03:59.489> can<00:03:59.549> actually<00:04:00.000> fill

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
so with this method it can actually fill

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.460 
so with this method it can actually fill
up<00:04:00.299> to<00:04:00.540> about<00:04:00.720> 250<00:04:01.409> mils<00:04:02.299> into<00:04:03.299> even<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.870> mug<00:04:04.049> if

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
up to about 250 mils into even a mug if

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:15.160 
up to about 250 mils into even a mug if
you<00:04:04.620> wanted<00:04:04.799> a<00:04:04.920> mug

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.259 

there<00:04:16.170> we<00:04:16.290> go

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:28.450 

you

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.520 

you
