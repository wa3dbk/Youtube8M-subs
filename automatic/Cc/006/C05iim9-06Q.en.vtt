 all the expectations and forecasts that 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.119
 we did then great because we 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.529
 it was excellent that we increase the lower 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.839
 number of radars then I lost 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.970

 a dream come true 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.559
 after a goal that I plan that at 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.110
 start of the trip and super happy I'm leaving 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.660
 motivated and eager to train more in 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.909
 Sofía strap ladies was constituted in the 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.610
 most prominent climber since 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.280

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.960
 silver and another bronze was also located 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.600
 in the second place of the classification 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.760
 general has risen quite a lot in 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.470
 the last three months 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.660
 Well this is evidenced so 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.340
 Spent of hot and motivated esteban 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.980
 égüez stood out in males with three 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.980
 all silver medals in the same way 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.290
 he was second in the general location 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.970
 he manages to be at the level or he can put 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.320
 mentally the first three positions and 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.910
 that was important and not only that but 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.550
 obviously enjoy climbing 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.290
 It is very important and if that was not enough , 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.960
 Ecuador also managed to break a record 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.660
 bolivariano nicole mejía beat the mark 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:53.630
 of speed with 9 seconds and 86 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:56.060
 hundredths 80 and I'm very happy the key 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.550
 of all this success first have a 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.930
 team on united having done have a 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.700
 good level of competition to start 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.740
 the basis of all this is that the level of 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.780
 our competition is very high and this 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.160
 makes the best sports of our 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.229
 country go out to compete in this kind of 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.630
 events at a good level so our 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.850
 athletes climbed to glory and 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.270

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.270
 Ecuador
