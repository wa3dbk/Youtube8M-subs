00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.050 
it bro oh man but that's pretty much the
end<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.799> chapter<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.490> thought<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:53.970> was

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
end of the chapter I thought it was

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.060 
end of the chapter I thought it was
awesome<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.049> can't<00:01:55.259> really<00:01:55.500> discuss

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
awesome like you can't really discuss

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.920 
awesome like you can't really discuss
that<00:01:56.430> many<00:01:56.670> things<00:01:56.939> when<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.450> comes<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.780> this

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
that many things when it comes to this

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.359 
that many things when it comes to this
chapter<00:01:58.229> because<00:01:58.380> like<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.860> said<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.189> pretty

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
chapter because like I said it's pretty

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.249 
chapter because like I said it's pretty
much<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.610> fight<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.360> kind<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.540> shows<00:02:00.869> the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
much the fight and it kind of shows the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.230 
much the fight and it kind of shows the
whole<00:02:01.469> relationship<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.610> how<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.880> started

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
whole relationship and how it started

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.459 
whole relationship and how it started
between<00:02:03.360> my<00:02:03.600> darn<00:02:03.780> high<00:02:03.930> should<00:02:04.110> I'm<00:02:04.200> about
