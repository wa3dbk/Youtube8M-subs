of reach I'll crouch down a bit right

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.679 
of reach I'll crouch down a bit right
let<00:01:07.380> it<00:01:07.530> flip<00:01:07.770> down<00:01:08.150> slap<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.299> on<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.450> glass

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
let it flip down slap it on the glass

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.500 
let it flip down slap it on the glass
you<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.799> see<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.340> there<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.880> reach<00:01:12.060> very

you can see that there and reach very

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.899 
you can see that there and reach very
easily<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.950> whole<00:01:14.130> thing<00:01:14.400> swivels

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
easily and the whole thing swivels

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.679 
easily and the whole thing swivels
between<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:16.470> fingertips<00:01:17.040> if<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.369> like<00:01:17.689> don't

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
between the fingertips if you like don't

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.560 
between the fingertips if you like don't
have<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.020> much<00:01:19.200> pressure<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:21.000> pad<00:01:21.210> slip

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
have to have much pressure the pad slip

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:38.290 
have to have much pressure the pad slip
down<00:01:21.750> like<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.259> again<00:01:24.409> cut<00:01:25.409> in

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.210 

when<00:01:39.300> I<00:01:39.330> think<00:01:39.690> you<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.930> reach<00:01:40.110> transfer<00:01:41.070> your

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
when I think you can reach transfer your

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.690 
when I think you can reach transfer your
hand<00:01:41.460> further<00:01:41.850> up<00:01:42.200> towards<00:01:43.200> thee<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.590> or<00:01:44.490> even

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
hand further up towards thee and or even

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.400 
hand further up towards thee and or even
just<00:01:44.940> take<00:01:45.150> the<00:01:45.360> actual<00:01:46.350> tip<00:01:46.860> off<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:47.520> that

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
just take the actual tip off like that

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.820 
just take the actual tip off like that
and<00:01:49.410> then<00:01:49.530> continue<00:01:51.140> just<00:01:52.140> with<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.440> wagtail

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
and then continue just with the wagtail

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.570 
and then continue just with the wagtail
in<00:01:52.980> your<00:01:53.100> hand<00:01:54.350> that's<00:01:55.350> brilliant

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
in your hand that's brilliant

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.330 
in your hand that's brilliant
no<00:01:56.790> no<00:01:56.970> it's<00:01:57.330> got<00:01:57.479> two<00:01:57.660> angles<00:01:58.080> I<00:01:58.320> used<00:01:59.160> that

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
no no it's got two angles I used that

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.820 
no no it's got two angles I used that
one<00:01:59.630> that<00:02:00.630> way<00:02:00.750> around<00:02:01.050> your<00:02:02.040> high<00:02:02.220> job<00:02:02.580> now

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
one that way around your high job now

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.730 
one that way around your high job now
when<00:02:04.830> you're<00:02:05.100> reaching<00:02:05.220> across<00:02:05.820> something

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
when you're reaching across something

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.529 
when you're reaching across something
takes<00:02:07.740> like<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:07.979> flowerbed<00:02:08.459> put<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.300> that

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
takes like a flowerbed put it on that

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.870 
takes like a flowerbed put it on that
way<00:02:09.860> something<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.610> can't

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
way something like that and you can't

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.400 
way something like that and you can't
actually<00:02:12.060> reach<00:02:12.450> maybe<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:12.930> should<00:02:13.140> put<00:02:13.320> the

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
actually reach maybe I should put the

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.170 
actually reach maybe I should put the
camera<00:02:13.740> down<00:02:13.770> a<00:02:13.920> bit<00:02:14.130> further<00:02:16.910> say<00:02:17.910> there<00:02:18.090> was

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
camera down a bit further say there was

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.510 
camera down a bit further say there was
something<00:02:18.570> in<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.780> way<00:02:18.930> just<00:02:18.959> here<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.890> had<00:02:20.370> to

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
something in the way just here I had to

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.750 
something in the way just here I had to
lean<00:02:20.730> across<00:02:21.410> now<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.470> angle<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:22.950> perfect<00:02:23.489> for

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
lean across now the angle is perfect for

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.260 
lean across now the angle is perfect for
that

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
that

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:32.030 
that
you<00:02:25.080> can<00:02:25.230> see<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:30.350> now<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.380> get<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.800> perfect

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
you can see that now you get the perfect

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.830 
you can see that now you get the perfect
angle<00:02:32.580> for<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:36.590> absolute<00:02:37.590> treat<00:02:38.660> takes<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.720> bit

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
angle for the absolute treat takes a bit

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
angle for the absolute treat takes a bit
