00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
we're definitely upped our game and the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.179

following<00:01:20.850> year<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.509> think<00:01:22.259> throughout<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
following year I think throughout the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.640 
following year I think throughout the
top<00:01:23.400> four<00:01:23.700> were<00:01:23.909> DSC<00:01:24.450> pilots<00:01:25.020> eight<00:01:25.200> out<00:01:25.439> of

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
top four were DSC pilots eight out of

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.399 
top four were DSC pilots eight out of
the<00:01:25.740> top<00:01:25.950> ten<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.430> EXCI<00:01:26.820> league<00:01:27.090> were<00:01:27.750> DRC

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
the top ten in the EXCI league were DRC

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.859 
the top ten in the EXCI league were DRC
pilots<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.490> had<00:01:29.670> recaptured<00:01:30.150> all<00:01:30.630> that

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
pilots and it had recaptured all that

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:38.740 
pilots and it had recaptured all that
sort<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.470> imagination<00:01:32.159> enthusiasm

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:47.560 

look<00:01:38.840> about<00:01:39.110> Studios<00:01:45.850> how<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:46.910> get<00:01:47.210> off<00:01:47.390> the

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
look about Studios how to get off the

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.380 
look about Studios how to get off the
hill<00:01:47.720> okay<00:01:48.290> so<00:01:49.040> that<00:01:49.340> will<00:01:49.490> put<00:01:49.700> that<00:01:49.729> there

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
hill okay so that will put that there

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.300 
hill okay so that will put that there
because<00:01:50.660> that's<00:01:50.870> a<00:01:51.080> particular<00:01:51.410> element<00:01:51.860> of

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
because that's a particular element of

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.060 
because that's a particular element of
cross<00:01:52.520> country<00:01:52.729> fly<00:01:53.530> overcome<00:01:54.530> my<00:01:54.680> fear

cross country fly overcome my fear

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.640 
cross country fly overcome my fear
that's<00:01:55.430> a<00:01:55.610> good<00:01:55.850> one<00:01:56.030> sense<00:01:56.390> very<00:01:57.170> much<00:01:57.350> on<00:01:57.500> the

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
that's a good one sense very much on the

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.550 
that's a good one sense very much on the
mental<00:01:58.310> side<00:01:58.580> over<00:01:59.000> there<00:01:59.240> is<00:01:59.780> interesting

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
mental side over there is interesting

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.210 
mental side over there is interesting
one<00:02:00.710> fear<00:02:01.010> isn't<00:02:01.250> it<00:02:01.520> because<00:02:02.330> you<00:02:02.570> can<00:02:03.220> one

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
one fear isn't it because you can one

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.700 
one fear isn't it because you can one
way<00:02:04.369> of<00:02:04.430> dealing<00:02:05.000> with<00:02:05.180> fear<00:02:05.540> is<00:02:06.020> actually<00:02:06.530> to

way of dealing with fear is actually to

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.900 
way of dealing with fear is actually to

water you if you've got reservoir near

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
the site you can obviously see it

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.980 
the site you can obviously see it
tracking<00:02:29.100> across<00:02:29.460> there

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.980 

and<00:02:32.290> I<00:02:32.440> have<00:02:32.890> smelt<00:02:33.190> thermals<00:02:33.790> at<00:02:34.300> five<00:02:34.630> grand

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
and I have smelt thermals at five grand

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.500 
and I have smelt thermals at five grand
you<00:02:35.710> know<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.220> it's<00:02:36.610> certainly<00:02:36.880> certainly

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
you know so it's certainly certainly

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.660 
you know so it's certainly certainly
useful<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.020> sometimes<00:02:38.710> you<00:02:38.860> smell<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.370> smell

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
useful and sometimes you smell the smell

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.810 
useful and sometimes you smell the smell
even<00:02:39.910> when<00:02:40.210> you're<00:02:40.330> not<00:02:40.360> in<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.600> Corps<00:02:41.820> but

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
even when you're not in the Corps but

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.940 
even when you're not in the Corps but
often<00:02:43.420> if<00:02:43.600> you<00:02:43.720> smell<00:02:43.990> the<00:02:44.140> smell<00:02:44.350> but<00:02:44.800> you're

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
often if you smell the smell but you're

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.380 
often if you smell the smell but you're
not<00:02:45.040> going<00:02:45.400> up<00:02:45.490> it's<00:02:45.670> really<00:02:45.970> worth<00:02:46.150> just

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
not going up it's really worth just

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.660 
not going up it's really worth just
having<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.690> bit<00:02:46.870> of<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:47.050> surge<00:02:47.290> because<00:02:48.130> it's

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
having a bit of a surge because it's

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.630 
having a bit of a surge because it's
that<00:02:49.090> smell<00:02:49.420> has<00:02:49.510> got<00:02:49.720> up<00:02:49.840> there<00:02:50.050> somehow

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
that smell has got up there somehow

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.830 
that smell has got up there somehow
smells<00:02:51.640> aren't<00:02:51.850> very<00:02:51.970> good<00:02:52.060> at<00:02:52.180> therming<00:02:52.690> so<00:02:52.810> I

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
smells aren't very good at therming so I

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.120 
smells aren't very good at therming so I
think<00:02:52.930> what<00:02:53.200> they<00:02:53.290> do<00:02:53.380> is<00:02:53.500> they<00:02:53.590> climb<00:02:53.860> in<00:02:54.070> the

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
think what they do is they climb in the

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.890 
think what they do is they climb in the
film<00:02:54.340> then<00:02:54.460> they<00:02:54.580> fall<00:02:54.820> out<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.060> bit<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.570> that's

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
film then they fall out a bit and that's

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.059 
film then they fall out a bit and that's
when<00:02:56.080> you<00:02:56.200> smell<00:02:56.500> them<00:02:56.620> yet

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
when you smell them yet

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.869 
when you smell them yet
so<00:02:58.810> run<00:02:59.830> fighting<00:03:00.830> it<00:03:01.010> oh<00:03:01.250> come<00:03:02.150> on<00:03:02.329> turn<00:03:02.720> turn

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
so run fighting it oh come on turn turn

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.319 
so run fighting it oh come on turn turn
or<00:03:04.879> let<00:03:05.060> it<00:03:05.090> go<00:03:05.360> a<00:03:05.390> bit<00:03:05.829> Bank<00:03:06.829> it<00:03:07.069> round<00:03:07.370> and

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
or let it go a bit Bank it round and

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.869 
or let it go a bit Bank it round and
that<00:03:08.720> is<00:03:08.989> a<00:03:09.409> nice<00:03:09.980> way<00:03:10.310> when<00:03:10.519> you're<00:03:10.640> fighting

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
that is a nice way when you're fighting

00:03:10.879 --> 00:04:16.420 
that is a nice way when you're fighting
a<00:03:11.180> thermal<00:03:11.659> today

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.489
