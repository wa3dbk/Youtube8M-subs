00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello to all we find ourselves for a 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.160
 tutorials videos on a lip contour 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.230
 special 3d effects it's gone first 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.910
 step in a simple pencil that will be a 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.610
 darker hue your skin tone 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.460
 lips we will draw the contours but in 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.680
 overflowing slightly and my tip if 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.050
 your upper lip stops before 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.420
 your corner is to connect the end of the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.580
 upper lip at the corner so creating 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.050
 a continuous lip that does not exist 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.550
 obvious little customer and the same 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.550
 hue that your lips work too 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.660
 for my part i gza i also like the 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.840
 heart shape in the heart of the lip 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.840
 higher 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:00.130
 there I really did that the outlines 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.130
 and now I'm reading the corners 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:11.930
 but devilishly a difference in the 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:12.380
 corner is connected and where he spared neither 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.910
 heads 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.680
 once the effect contour in 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.790
 slightly protruding and accentuating 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.950
 slightly shapes 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.110
 we go with is thus created always the 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.110
 even fill in the corners of the lips 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.360
 so already here we see a sacred 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.250
 difference but I do not stop there I 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.010
 take the lipstick that I want m 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:44.380
 who I took a nude pink and I'm applying 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.910
 everywhere and I get off well until the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.680
 end of the upper lip that 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.700
 usually we forget the same for the 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.620
 low 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.870
 I fill the inside of the lip 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:59.130
 lower I resume my pencil thought 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.130
 and I think of the corners 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.830
 now we need a color 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.360
 clear whose according to what you have you 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.300
 can take care a lip pencil 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.400
 clear either a nude lipstick or 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.500
 a good actor me I take the red to 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:24.580
 nude lips and game placed in the center of the 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:26.770
 upper and lower lip last 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.020
 step for me accentuate the 3d effect 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.640
 it is to apply a gloss again a 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.940
 times only on the sound between 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.940
 Delhaize 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.240
 and here we have our lips 3d effects but 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.190
 one thing is sure what step the 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.470
 more important is the first so 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.420
 with the new background pencil it's because 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.210
 that there we redesign completely 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.800
 mouth and your upper lip 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.600
 stop before the corners do not hesitate to 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.040
 connecting it is what changes everything and 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.370
 which gives the impression of a new 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.080
 stuffy 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.390
 same for death wool elsewhere 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.400
 dollar too at the corner of a way 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.950
 more pronounced because I do not have this 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.540
 well- bound mouth to the corner 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.100
 naturally it's a technique that I 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.390
 really want by period of which there are 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.740
 moments when I really want to 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.540
 work the mouth thoroughly and take 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.160
 a long time so I 'm doing all the steps 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.530
 and periods I do not at all 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.720
 because why I was able to relive 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.700
 I prefer my time and so I put a 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.560
 simple lip but when I do a 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.390
 garden is a technique that must be 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.430
 dare to do because when we launch 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.650
 for the first time around the edges of 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.930
 lips we grant exaggerated frankly 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.970
 do not have them and paleta small step by 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.310
 little step and if you do it tagged 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.470
 month on your photos with the 3d hashtag 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.420
 the movie very happy to see your photos 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.040
 attention they must be in public 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.959
 for me to see them otherwise we go up to 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.700
 thank you for nothing I really hope that this 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.190
 quick little tutorial you will have to help and 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.190
