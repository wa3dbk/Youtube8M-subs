already<00:01:02.039> stuff<00:01:02.219> but<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.969> problem<00:01:03.329> with<00:01:03.420> this

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
already stuff but the problem with this

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.710 
already stuff but the problem with this
is<00:01:03.809> as<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:04.860> see<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.220> lip<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:06.150> lip<00:01:06.450> of

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
is as you can see the lip the lip of

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.289 
is as you can see the lip the lip of
this<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.770> lid<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> little<00:01:09.000> bit<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.210> a

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
this the lid that is a little bit of a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.050 
this the lid that is a little bit of a
gap<00:01:09.540> that's<00:01:10.020> raised<00:01:10.380> up<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.890> what<00:01:11.490> happens<00:01:11.909> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
gap that's raised up and what happens a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.969 
gap that's raised up and what happens a
lot<00:01:12.180> with<00:01:12.330> these<00:01:12.510> hooks<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.020> with<00:01:13.530> even<00:01:13.860> when

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
lot with these hooks is with even when

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.670 
lot with these hooks is with even when
this<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.220> shut<00:01:14.490> on<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:15.810> how<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:15.960> solve<00:01:16.229> this<00:01:16.439> is

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
this is shut on like how I solve this is

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.039 
this is shut on like how I solve this is
I<00:01:16.799> usually<00:01:16.979> draw<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.630> once<00:01:18.869> it

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
I usually draw it like this so once it

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.200 
I usually draw it like this so once it
gets<00:01:19.140> up<00:01:19.920> flipped<00:01:20.340> upside<00:01:20.670> down<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:21.030> its<00:01:21.090> side

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
gets up flipped upside down on its side

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.070 
gets up flipped upside down on its side
shaken<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.650> lot<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.790> hooks<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.180> stuff<00:01:24.299> will

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
shaken a lot of the hooks and stuff will

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.260 
shaken a lot of the hooks and stuff will
come<00:01:25.770> over<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> edge<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.610> then<00:01:26.670> once<00:01:27.180> you

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
come over the edge and then once you

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.850 
come over the edge and then once you
open<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.540> up<00:01:27.630> they'll<00:01:27.840> be<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.170> hanging<00:01:28.650> off

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
open it up they'll be like hanging off

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.590 
open it up they'll be like hanging off
like<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.310> or<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:30.090> know<00:01:30.180> they're<00:01:30.329> all<00:01:30.450> mixed

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
like that or you know they're all mixed

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.030 
like that or you know they're all mixed
up<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.960> don't<00:01:31.020> even<00:01:31.140> have<00:01:31.259> some<00:01:31.530> like<00:01:31.770> jump

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
up and I don't even have some like jump

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.090 
up and I don't even have some like jump

memorized<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.579> when<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:41.939> hooks<00:01:42.210> get

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
memorized and so when like hooks get

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.510 
memorized and so when like hooks get
jumbled<00:01:43.079> then<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:44.040> know<00:01:44.189> you're<00:01:44.340> going<00:01:44.430> to

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
jumbled then you know you're going to

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.980 
jumbled then you know you're going to
just<00:01:44.670> sit<00:01:44.759> there<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:44.909> compare<00:01:45.420> them<00:01:45.600> up<00:01:45.720> side

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
just sit there and compare them up side

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.240 
just sit there and compare them up side
to<00:01:46.140> side<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.470> stuff<00:01:46.649> like<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.070> have<00:01:47.189> a

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
to side and stuff like that so I have a

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.800 
to side and stuff like that so I have a
simple<00:01:47.430> trick<00:01:47.759> I'll<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.299> show<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.450> kind<00:01:48.780> of

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
simple trick I'll just show you kind of

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.260 
simple trick I'll just show you kind of
what<00:01:48.869> happens<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.530> little<00:01:50.009> bit<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.729> side

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
what happens a little bit so I can side

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.840 
what happens a little bit so I can side

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
weights and stuff but some of the hooks

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.800 
weights and stuff but some of the hooks
just<00:02:19.040> get<00:02:19.430> jumbled<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:19.850> quick<00:02:20.150> quick<00:02:20.570> little

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
tip is this is like little like memory

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.700 
tip is this is like little like memory
foam<00:02:23.210> mesh<00:02:23.750> stuff<00:02:24.050> it's<00:02:24.230> kind<00:02:24.260> of<00:02:24.410> it's<00:02:24.590> like

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
foam mesh stuff it's kind of it's like

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
so don't slide around you can get this

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.460 
so don't slide around you can get this
at<00:02:37.730> Walmart<00:02:37.880> real<00:02:38.300> cheap<00:02:38.540> for<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:38.840> big<00:02:38.990> old<00:02:39.200> roll

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
at Walmart real cheap for a big old roll

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.690 
at Walmart real cheap for a big old roll
um<00:02:40.180> what<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.209> did<00:02:41.420> here<00:02:41.600> was<00:02:41.630> measured<00:02:42.380> this<00:02:42.500> out

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
um what I did here was measured this out

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.670 
um what I did here was measured this out
to<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.730> perfect<00:02:44.090> length<00:02:44.240> cut<00:02:44.600> two<00:02:44.810> of<00:02:44.930> them<00:02:45.110> just

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
to a perfect length cut two of them just

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.530 
to a perfect length cut two of them just
so<00:02:45.830> it's<00:02:46.010> double<00:02:46.430> thickness<00:02:46.700> so<00:02:47.090> there's<00:02:47.360> no

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
so it's double thickness so there's no

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.060 
so it's double thickness so there's no
chance<00:02:47.780> of<00:02:47.959> anything<00:02:48.170> you<00:02:48.440> know<00:02:48.530> falling<00:02:48.950> out

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
chance of anything you know falling out

you'll be able to shut it and what will

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.500 
you'll be able to shut it and what will
happen<00:03:12.320> is<00:03:12.580> I'll<00:03:13.580> just<00:03:13.730> kind<00:03:14.000> of<00:03:14.030> lay<00:03:14.150> this<00:03:14.330> out

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
happen is I'll just kind of lay this out

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.740 
happen is I'll just kind of lay this out
like<00:03:14.690> this<00:03:15.820> see<00:03:16.820> how<00:03:16.910> it's<00:03:17.060> kind<00:03:17.420> of<00:03:17.450> covering

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
like this see how it's kind of covering

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.670 
like this see how it's kind of covering
on<00:03:17.810> it<00:03:17.900> doesn't<00:03:18.019> have<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.230> go<00:03:18.320> all<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.560> way<00:03:18.590> to

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
on it doesn't have to go all the way to

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.650 
on it doesn't have to go all the way to
the<00:03:18.799> edge<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.220> then<00:03:19.760> when<00:03:19.970> you<00:03:20.060> go<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.180> shut<00:03:20.480> it

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
the edge and then when you go to shut it

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.520 
the edge and then when you go to shut it
it'll<00:03:21.470> be<00:03:21.530> a<00:03:21.560> little<00:03:21.739> bit<00:03:21.830> tighter<00:03:22.160> but<00:03:23.350> not<00:03:24.350> to

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
it'll be a little bit tighter but not to

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.400 
it'll be a little bit tighter but not to
diet<00:03:24.799> there<00:03:25.070> you<00:03:25.190> go<00:03:25.310> oh<00:03:25.750> what<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.930> me<00:03:27.080> like<00:03:27.260> said

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
diet there you go oh what a me like said

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.870 
diet there you go oh what a me like said
you<00:03:27.500> can<00:03:27.620> use<00:03:27.739> one<00:03:28.010> but<00:03:28.280> I<00:03:28.310> found<00:03:28.549> like<00:03:28.700> a

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
you can use one but I found like a

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.100 
you can use one but I found like a
couple<00:03:29.239> hooks<00:03:29.420> here<00:03:29.570> and<00:03:29.630> there<00:03:29.780> might<00:03:29.930> get

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
couple hooks here and there might get

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.590 
couple hooks here and there might get
thrown<00:03:30.380> out<00:03:30.620> with<00:03:31.340> just<00:03:31.610> one<00:03:31.670> padding<00:03:32.390> layer

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
thrown out with just one padding layer

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.259 
thrown out with just one padding layer
but<00:03:32.840> it<00:03:33.560> does<00:03:33.769> work<00:03:33.980> so<00:03:34.549> I<00:03:34.610> have<00:03:34.700> two<00:03:34.880> in<00:03:35.060> here

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
but it does work so I have two in here

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:42.360 
but it does work so I have two in here
that<00:03:35.450> kind<00:03:35.540> of<00:03:35.660> keeps<00:03:35.810> everything<00:03:35.930> compressed

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.820 

move<00:03:43.370> around<00:03:43.519> like<00:03:43.790> that<00:03:43.940> flip<00:03:44.720> it<00:03:44.870> open<00:03:44.989> for

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
move around like that flip it open for

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.680 
move around like that flip it open for
the<00:03:45.920> most<00:03:46.160> part<00:03:46.489> I<00:03:46.700> mean<00:03:46.849> this<00:03:46.970> is<00:03:47.120> 100<00:03:47.510> percent

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
the most part I mean this is 100 percent

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.809 
the most part I mean this is 100 percent
guarantee<00:03:48.340> but<00:03:49.340> for<00:03:49.519> the<00:03:49.580> most<00:03:49.730> part

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
guarantee but for the most part

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.100 
guarantee but for the most part
everything<00:03:50.269> should<00:03:50.569> kind<00:03:50.720> of<00:03:50.810> be<00:03:50.900> in<00:03:50.989> its

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
everything should kind of be in its

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.920 
everything should kind of be in its
place<00:03:51.170> as<00:03:51.620> you<00:03:52.310> can<00:03:52.430> see<00:03:52.610> there's<00:03:52.790> no<00:03:52.940> hooks<00:03:53.750> in

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
place as you can see there's no hooks in

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.960 
place as you can see there's no hooks in
any<00:03:54.110> other<00:03:54.319> spots<00:03:54.800> I<00:03:55.069> mean<00:03:55.220> my<00:03:55.640> swim<00:03:55.819> bait

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
any other spots I mean my swim bait

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.759 
any other spots I mean my swim bait
hooks<00:03:56.209> everything's<00:03:57.050> kind<00:03:57.260> of<00:03:57.319> in<00:03:57.440> its<00:03:57.560> place

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
hooks everything's kind of in its place

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:58.990 
hooks everything's kind of in its place
this<00:03:57.980> will<00:03:58.130> get<00:03:58.280> jumbled<00:03:58.580> around<00:03:58.760> because

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
this will get jumbled around because

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.130 
this will get jumbled around because
there's<00:03:59.180> kind<00:03:59.360> of<00:03:59.390> a<00:03:59.480> bigger<00:03:59.630> gap<00:03:59.870> there

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
there's kind of a bigger gap there

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.690 
there's kind of a bigger gap there
that's<00:04:00.380> why<00:04:00.470> I<00:04:00.530> keep<00:04:00.680> little<00:04:01.190> stuff<00:04:01.459> like<00:04:01.610> this

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
that's why I keep little stuff like this

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.910 
that's why I keep little stuff like this
there<00:04:01.910> um<00:04:02.269> well<00:04:03.080> I<00:04:03.110> said<00:04:03.319> for<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.530> most<00:04:03.590> part

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
there um well I said for the most part

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.920 
there um well I said for the most part
it<00:04:04.010> kept<00:04:04.220> everything<00:04:04.549> in<00:04:04.819> its<00:04:04.970> place<00:04:05.150> and

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
it kept everything in its place and

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.140 
it kept everything in its place and
you'll<00:04:06.530> have<00:04:06.709> this<00:04:06.860> glued<00:04:07.250> so<00:04:07.580> it'll<00:04:07.790> be<00:04:07.910> just

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
you'll have this glued so it'll be just

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.059 
you'll have this glued so it'll be just
kind<00:04:08.209> of<00:04:08.330> like<00:04:08.420> a<00:04:08.450> like<00:04:08.900> this<00:04:09.140> when<00:04:09.830> you<00:04:09.890> go<00:04:10.010> to

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
kind of like a like this when you go to

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.150 
kind of like a like this when you go to
get<00:04:10.190> your<00:04:10.250> tackle<00:04:10.610> box<00:04:10.640> or<00:04:11.569> whatever<00:04:11.720> um<00:04:12.170> so

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
get your tackle box or whatever um so

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.559 
get your tackle box or whatever um so
it'll<00:04:13.340> be<00:04:13.400> real<00:04:13.610> easy<00:04:13.819> you<00:04:13.910> won't<00:04:14.090> even<00:04:14.239> really

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
it'll be real easy you won't even really

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.300 
it'll be real easy you won't even really
notice<00:04:14.870> except<00:04:15.230> for<00:04:15.380> the<00:04:15.440> closing<00:04:15.920> part<00:04:16.160> like

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
notice except for the closing part like

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.960 
notice except for the closing part like
I<00:04:16.340> said<00:04:16.519> you<00:04:16.609> can<00:04:16.760> you<00:04:17.299> can<00:04:17.450> use<00:04:17.720> one<00:04:17.989> layer

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
I said you can you can use one layer

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.690 
I said you can you can use one layer
I'll<00:04:19.970> just<00:04:20.120> lay<00:04:20.299> one<00:04:20.540> layer<00:04:20.720> down<00:04:21.520> you<00:04:22.520> see

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
I'll just lay one layer down you see

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.980 
I'll just lay one layer down you see
it's<00:04:22.820> a<00:04:22.850> lot<00:04:23.000> easier<00:04:23.150> to<00:04:23.300> close<00:04:23.510> that<00:04:23.720> way<00:04:23.810> but

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
it's a lot easier to close that way but

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.719 
it's a lot easier to close that way but
like<00:04:24.050> I<00:04:24.139> said<00:04:24.200> there<00:04:24.470> is<00:04:24.500> a<00:04:24.680> couple<00:04:25.220> times<00:04:25.460> here

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
like I said there is a couple times here

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.190 
like I said there is a couple times here
and<00:04:25.850> there<00:04:25.970> where<00:04:26.180> a<00:04:26.210> hook<00:04:26.570> will<00:04:26.750> get<00:04:26.870> tossed

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
and there where a hook will get tossed

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.310 
and there where a hook will get tossed
up<00:04:27.530> so<00:04:27.919> it's<00:04:28.040> up<00:04:28.160> to<00:04:28.280> you<00:04:28.400> um<00:04:28.940> but<00:04:29.300> I<00:04:30.020> mean<00:04:30.200> this

up so it's up to you um but I mean this
might<00:04:30.440> not<00:04:30.470> seem<00:04:30.710> like<00:04:30.740> a<00:04:30.889> big<00:04:31.070> deal<00:04:31.250> to<00:04:31.310> you

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550

might not seem like a big deal to you
guys<00:04:31.760> if<00:04:32.000> a<00:04:32.090> hook<00:04:32.270> gets<00:04:32.510> jumbled<00:04:32.990> but<00:04:33.350> when
