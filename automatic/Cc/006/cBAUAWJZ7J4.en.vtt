think<00:00:11.809> 1979-80<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:13.440> thought<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.250> like<00:00:14.490> yeah<00:00:14.759> I

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.109 
think 1979-80 I thought I like yeah I
started<00:00:15.269> doing<00:00:15.420> strong<00:00:15.719> sides<00:00:16.199> then<00:00:17.119> then

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
started doing strong sides then then

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.590 
started doing strong sides then then
that<00:00:18.990> evolved<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.310> famous<00:00:20.789> Z<00:00:21.000> crap<00:00:21.270> you

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
that evolved to the famous Z crap you

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.750 
that evolved to the famous Z crap you
know<00:00:21.660> was<00:00:21.869> completely<00:00:22.830> over<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.310> top<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.550> our

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.840 
bar over the bed year then the profile
from<00:00:45.809> there<00:00:46.050> which<00:00:46.289> isn't<00:00:46.500> even<00:00:46.860> bigger<00:00:47.219> as

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
from there which isn't even bigger as

from there which isn't even bigger as
you<00:00:48.059> say<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.570> then<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.809> Titan<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.440> one<00:00:49.590> that

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739

you say and then the Titan the one that
changed<00:00:50.070> everything

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
changed everything

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
that is like the first bivy with the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.880 
that is like the first bivy with the
arms<00:00:53.070> on<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.280> outside<00:00:53.640> isn't<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.649> first<00:00:55.649> BB

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
mainly the first BB that had a rigid

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.110 
mainly the first BB that had a rigid
frame<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.309> where<00:01:02.460> you've<00:01:02.579> got<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.940> now

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
frame so this is where you've got to now

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.549 
frame so this is where you've got to now
then<00:01:03.359> as<00:01:03.570> far<00:01:03.840> as<00:01:03.899> technology<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.500> concerned

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
then as far as technology is concerned

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.640 
then as far as technology is concerned
yeah<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> s7<00:01:06.720> as<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.229> say

yeah this is the s7 as you say

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.590 
yeah this is the s7 as you say
fast<00:01:07.979> technologies<00:01:08.670> concerned<00:01:09.240> there<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
fast technologies concerned there is a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.800 
fast technologies concerned there is a
bit<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.140> actually<00:01:11.390> firstly<00:01:12.390> let<00:01:12.540> me<00:01:12.630> talk

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
bit in this actually firstly let me talk

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.600 
bit in this actually firstly let me talk
about<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.200> frame<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> pram<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.340> type

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
about the frame is the pram with type

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.420 
about the frame is the pram with type
but<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.390> think<00:01:16.380> where<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.799> different<00:01:17.250> is

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
but I think where it is different is

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.390 
but I think where it is different is
it's<00:01:17.610> pleasing<00:01:17.970> curved<00:01:18.600> shape<00:01:19.189> I've<00:01:20.189> always

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
it's pleasing curved shape I've always

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.090 
it's pleasing curved shape I've always
felt<00:01:20.759> all<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> dimes<00:01:21.590> on<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.680> pram<00:01:22.920> would

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
felt all the dimes on the pram would

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.039 
felt all the dimes on the pram would
design<00:01:23.430> look<00:01:23.700> ugly<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.450> they<00:01:24.600> curved

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
design look ugly you know they curved

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.390 
design look ugly you know they curved
out<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.439> then<00:01:25.530> they've<00:01:25.650> got<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> strike<00:01:26.100> peak

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
out and then they've got a strike peak

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.819 
out and then they've got a strike peak
on<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.790> yeah<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.659> made<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:28.020> have<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.229> nice<00:01:28.439> curved

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
on it yeah it made it have a nice curved

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.160 
on it yeah it made it have a nice curved
shape<00:01:29.159> by<00:01:29.340> lifting<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.909> middle<00:01:30.270> up<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.049> it's

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
shape by lifting the middle up so it's

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.840 
shape by lifting the middle up so it's
high<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> middle<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.340> summer<00:01:32.579> aims

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
high in the middle and that summer aims

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.060 
high in the middle and that summer aims
appreciate<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> bit<00:01:33.780> more<00:01:33.990> Headroom<00:01:34.350> inside<00:01:34.710> if

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
appreciate a bit more Headroom inside if

is<00:01:50.909> called<00:01:51.390> aqua<00:01:51.720> sense<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:53.549> blowing<00:01:53.790> me

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
is called aqua sense and it's blowing me

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.780 
is called aqua sense and it's blowing me
away<00:01:54.000> quite<00:01:54.509> frankly<00:01:55.040> if<00:01:56.040> someone<00:01:56.460> had<00:01:56.549> said

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
away quite frankly if someone had said

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.670 
away quite frankly if someone had said
to<00:01:56.820> me<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.270> fabric<00:01:57.689> does<00:01:57.869> what<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.200> does<00:01:58.229> I

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
to me this fabric does what it does I

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.080 
to me this fabric does what it does I
would<00:01:58.860> have<00:01:59.040> said<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.280> be<00:01:59.369> talking<00:01:59.759> rubbish

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
would have said to be talking rubbish

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.520 
would have said to be talking rubbish
and<00:02:00.390> let<00:02:00.479> us<00:02:00.630> say<00:02:00.810> into<00:02:01.020> myself

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
and let us say into myself

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.580 
and let us say into myself
you<00:02:01.920> know<00:02:02.070> when<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.250> baby's<00:02:02.640> cold<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.659> wet<00:02:03.930> it's

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
you know when a baby's cold and wet it's

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.039 
you know when a baby's cold and wet it's
go<00:02:04.799> saggy<00:02:05.219> yeah<00:02:05.850> yeah<00:02:06.210> that's<00:02:06.540> because<00:02:06.689> all

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
go saggy yeah yeah that's because all

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.160 
go saggy yeah yeah that's because all
fabrics<00:02:07.740> stretch<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.729> relax

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
fabrics stretch and relax

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.580 
fabrics stretch and relax
when<00:02:09.619> they're<00:02:09.740> cold<00:02:09.950> and<00:02:10.160> wet<00:02:10.670> yeah<00:02:10.940> and

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
when they're cold and wet yeah and

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.630 
when they're cold and wet yeah and
particularly<00:02:12.590> relevant<00:02:12.860> if<00:02:13.340> he's<00:02:13.490> not

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
particularly relevant if he's not

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.890 
particularly relevant if he's not
they've<00:02:13.819> done<00:02:13.940> they<00:02:14.060> look<00:02:14.090> though<00:02:14.569> I<00:02:14.600> said

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
they've done they look though I said

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.059 
they've done they look though I said
where<00:02:15.050> you<00:02:15.170> get<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.440> ridges<00:02:15.860> the

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 
where you get the ridges the

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.190 
where you get the ridges the
condensation<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.910> inside<00:02:17.390> sliding<00:02:17.990> down

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
condensation the inside sliding down

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.900 
condensation the inside sliding down
collects<00:02:18.650> on<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:18.830> ridges<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.550> that's<00:02:19.790> how

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
collects on the ridges and that's how

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.840 
collects on the ridges and that's how
you<00:02:19.970> get<00:02:20.090> condensation<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:20.959> yeah<00:02:21.500> or<00:02:22.130> the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
you get condensation to it yeah or the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.490 
you get condensation to it yeah or the
other<00:02:23.000> thing<00:02:23.270> is<00:02:23.390> when<00:02:23.540> they're<00:02:23.690> hot<00:02:23.959> they

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
other thing is when they're hot they

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.560 
other thing is when they're hot they
stretch<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:25.700> puts<00:02:26.030> pressure<00:02:26.240> on<00:02:26.510> the

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
stretch that puts pressure on the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.290 
stretch that puts pressure on the
waterproof<00:02:27.140> sames<00:02:27.470> okay<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.700> that's<00:02:29.000> one<00:02:29.209> of

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
waterproof sames okay and that's one of

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.449 
waterproof sames okay and that's one of
the<00:02:29.360> reasons<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:29.810> get<00:02:29.930> tight<00:02:30.200> lift<00:02:30.530> yeah<00:02:30.920> this

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
the reasons you get tight lift yeah this

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.110 
the reasons you get tight lift yeah this
stuff<00:02:31.790> it<00:02:32.570> adjusts<00:02:33.320> itself<00:02:33.770> to<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.610> climate

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
stuff it adjusts itself to the climate

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.660 
stuff it adjusts itself to the climate
we<00:02:35.570> had<00:02:35.660> one<00:02:35.840> up<00:02:36.020> outside<00:02:36.709> we<00:02:37.010> snow<00:02:37.310> well<00:02:37.550> I've

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
we had one up outside we snow well I've

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.729 
we had one up outside we snow well I've
written<00:02:37.820> right<00:02:38.090> in<00:02:38.300> I<00:02:38.510> stopped<00:02:39.410> dead<00:02:39.590> in<00:02:39.650> my

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
written right in I stopped dead in my

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.160 
written right in I stopped dead in my
tracks<00:02:39.880> they<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.270> know<00:02:41.360> expect<00:02:41.420> me<00:02:41.810> to<00:02:41.840> be<00:02:42.020> all

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
tracks they you know expect me to be all

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.350 
tracks they you know expect me to be all
saggy<00:02:42.470> but<00:02:42.739> that<00:02:43.130> literally<00:02:43.640> tightened<00:02:44.120> of<00:02:44.239> it

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
saggy but that literally tightened of it

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.780 
saggy but that literally tightened of it
and<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.540> can<00:02:44.660> tell<00:02:44.930> by<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.380> yeah<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.430> amount

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
and you can tell by the yeah the amount

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.880 
and you can tell by the yeah the amount
of<00:02:46.880> distance<00:02:47.209> on<00:02:47.420> here<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:48.260> it<00:02:48.530> does<00:02:48.709> the

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
of distance on here so it does the

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.130 
of distance on here so it does the
opposite<00:02:49.220> of<00:02:49.370> any<00:02:49.459> other<00:02:49.640> material<00:02:49.790> but<00:02:50.209> then

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
opposite of any other material but then

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.410 
opposite of any other material but then
and<00:02:51.470> then<00:02:51.590> in<00:02:51.709> hot<00:02:51.950> weather<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.640> relaxes

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
and then in hot weather it relaxes

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.600 
and then in hot weather it relaxes
slightly<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.170> more<00:02:54.470> or<00:02:54.590> less<00:02:54.769> stays<00:02:55.340> this

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
slightly it more or less stays this

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.750 
slightly it more or less stays this
tension<00:02:56.080> summer<00:02:57.080> winter<00:02:57.530> rain<00:02:58.070> or<00:02:58.280> snow<00:02:58.519> I

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
tension summer winter rain or snow I

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.940 
tension summer winter rain or snow I
know<00:02:59.480> he's<00:02:59.840> mad<00:03:00.140> he's<00:03:00.500> mad

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
know he's mad he's mad

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.770 
know he's mad he's mad
if<00:03:01.310> you<00:03:01.430> want<00:03:01.580> to<00:03:01.640> half<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:02.000> white<00:03:02.180> you<00:03:02.570> have

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
if you want to half the white you have

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.600 
if you want to half the white you have
the<00:03:02.930> way<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.200> material<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:04.040> have<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.430> white

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
the way the material you have the white

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.060 
the way the material you have the white
material<00:03:05.360> it<00:03:05.720> won't<00:03:06.019> have<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.320> strength<00:03:06.530> that

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
material it won't have the strength that

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.670 
material it won't have the strength that
durability<00:03:07.519> or<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.269> insulation<00:03:08.959> fully<00:03:09.590> a

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
durability or the insulation fully a

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.280 
durability or the insulation fully a
fade<00:03:10.340> this<00:03:10.550> is<00:03:10.700> 20<00:03:11.000> or<00:03:11.030> kilo<00:03:11.510> but<00:03:11.690> that's<00:03:12.080> all

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
fade this is 20 or kilo but that's all

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.740 
fade this is 20 or kilo but that's all
the<00:03:12.500> spec<00:03:12.739> yeah<00:03:13.239> compared<00:03:14.239> with<00:03:14.360> our<00:03:14.540> busy

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
the spec yeah compared with our busy

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.080 
the spec yeah compared with our busy
clean-out<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:15.920> either<00:03:16.100> but<00:03:16.370> I<00:03:16.549> think<00:03:16.970> it's

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
clean-out to either but I think it's

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.610 
clean-out to either but I think it's
worth<00:03:17.329> it<00:03:17.600> because<00:03:17.750> you've<00:03:18.019> got<00:03:18.170> the<00:03:18.320> edge<00:03:18.440> the

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
worth it because you've got the edge the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.470 
worth it because you've got the edge the
durability<00:03:19.010> but<00:03:19.250> more<00:03:19.430> importantly<00:03:20.030> you've

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
durability but more importantly you've

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.090 
durability but more importantly you've
got<00:03:20.570> the<00:03:20.690> insulation<00:03:20.930> you'll<00:03:21.530> never<00:03:21.769> need<00:03:21.950> to

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
got the insulation you'll never need to

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.370 
got the insulation you'll never need to
fire<00:03:22.370> skin<00:03:22.700> over<00:03:22.970> this<00:03:23.090> yeah<00:03:23.450> this<00:03:24.079> is<00:03:24.230> the

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
fire skin over this yeah this is the

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.449 
fire skin over this yeah this is the
foam<00:03:24.680> kit<00:03:25.100> version<00:03:25.540> which<00:03:26.890> certainly<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:27.950> and

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
foam kit version which certainly I and

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.819 
foam kit version which certainly I and
you<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:29.120> most<00:03:29.360> anglers<00:03:29.720> would<00:03:30.019> probably<00:03:30.590> only

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
you and most anglers would probably only

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.370 
you and most anglers would probably only
using<00:03:31.519> really<00:03:31.790> bad<00:03:32.030> winter<00:03:32.600> weather<00:03:32.810> you've

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
using really bad winter weather you've
