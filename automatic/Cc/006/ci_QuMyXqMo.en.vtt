00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
but yeah this is your you know strategy

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:39.399 
but yeah this is your you know strategy
simple<00:03:33.470> strategy<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:35.859> I<00:03:36.859> have<00:03:37.989> much<00:03:38.989> problem

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
simple strategy and I have much problem

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.270 
simple strategy and I have much problem
sitting<00:03:40.010> that<00:03:40.340> guy<00:03:40.639> right<00:03:40.909> now

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
sitting that guy right now

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.780 
sitting that guy right now
so<00:03:43.280> let's<00:03:43.609> use<00:03:43.819> the<00:03:43.969> chain<00:03:44.239> gun<00:03:44.540> for<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:44.870> while

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
so let's use the chain gun for a while

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.509 
so let's use the chain gun for a while
at<00:03:46.790> least<00:03:47.329> I<00:03:47.780> save<00:03:48.019> ammo<00:03:48.260> from<00:03:48.650> my<00:03:48.950> better

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
at least I save ammo from my better

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.099 
at least I save ammo from my better
weapons<00:03:50.409> and<00:03:51.409> as<00:03:51.769> you<00:03:51.890> can<00:03:52.069> see<00:03:52.099> the<00:03:52.459> arrows

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
weapons and as you can see the arrows

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.929 
weapons and as you can see the arrows
stopped<00:03:54.109> coming<00:03:54.620> you<00:03:54.890> just<00:03:55.129> have<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.340> wait<00:03:55.700> or

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:55.939 
stopped coming you just have to wait or

00:03:55.939 --> 00:04:01.149 
stopped coming you just have to wait or
kill<00:03:56.269> everything<00:03:56.629> and<00:03:57.430> then<00:03:58.430> rush<00:03:58.790> back<00:04:00.159> yeah

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:01.159 
kill everything and then rush back yeah

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:03.160 
kill everything and then rush back yeah
they<00:04:01.609> will<00:04:01.760> start<00:04:02.030> again<00:04:02.389> but<00:04:02.599> this<00:04:02.750> time<00:04:02.810> it's

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
they will start again but this time it's

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.129 
they will start again but this time it's
a<00:04:03.290> little<00:04:03.530> bit<00:04:03.650> easier<00:04:03.799> cuz<00:04:04.540> it<00:04:05.540> takes<00:04:05.599> a<00:04:05.959> while

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
a little bit easier cuz it takes a while

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.250 
a little bit easier cuz it takes a while
because<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.430> trick<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:08.540> trigger<00:04:08.900> that

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
because the trick the trigger that

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.339 
because the trick the trigger that
launches<00:04:09.769> those<00:04:10.010> things<00:04:10.780> is<00:04:11.780> on<00:04:12.200> this<00:04:12.799> side

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
launches those things is on this side
