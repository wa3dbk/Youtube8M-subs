needs to know exactly know the Anatomy
know<00:04:35.660> at<00:04:35.840> what<00:04:36.080> depth<00:04:36.380> you're<00:04:36.650> putting<00:04:37.040> this

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
know at what depth you're putting this

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.490 
know at what depth you're putting this
fluid<00:04:37.730> in<00:04:38.000> and<00:04:38.210> that<00:04:38.360> amount<00:04:38.690> of<00:04:38.840> fluid<00:04:39.169> scares

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
fluid in and that amount of fluid scares

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.260 
fluid in and that amount of fluid scares
me<00:04:39.680> because<00:04:39.830> you<00:04:40.070> could<00:04:40.340> put<00:04:41.000> so<00:04:41.150> much

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
me because you could put so much

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.510 
me because you could put so much
pressure<00:04:41.330> on<00:04:41.810> that<00:04:42.169> skin<00:04:42.530> that<00:04:42.740> you<00:04:43.070> actually

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
pressure on that skin that you actually

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.610 
pressure on that skin that you actually
lose<00:04:43.700> those<00:04:44.330> people<00:04:44.600> that<00:04:44.870> get<00:04:45.110> their<00:04:45.320> lips

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
lose those people that get their lips

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.190 
lose those people that get their lips
all<00:04:45.860> yeah<00:04:46.100> and<00:04:46.310> Africa<00:04:46.820> well<00:04:47.510> it's<00:04:47.750> a<00:04:47.870> similar

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
all yeah and Africa well it's a similar

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.600 
all yeah and Africa well it's a similar
kind<00:04:48.410> of<00:04:48.530> thing<00:04:48.740> you're<00:04:48.919> stretching<00:04:49.220> it<00:04:49.460> out

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
kind of thing you're stretching it out

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.550 
kind of thing you're stretching it out
but<00:04:49.790> those<00:04:49.910> are<00:04:50.090> more<00:04:50.240> permanent<00:04:50.540> this<00:04:51.260> does

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
but those are more permanent this does

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.290 
but those are more permanent this does
go<00:04:51.800> away<00:04:51.890> it's<00:04:52.220> saline<00:04:52.640> the<00:04:52.790> body<00:04:52.970> just

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
go away it's saline the body just

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.410 
go away it's saline the body just
absorbs<00:04:54.200> it
