spindles<00:00:06.330> painted<00:00:06.960> on<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.350> staircase<00:00:07.890> and

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
spindles painted on the staircase and

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.879 
spindles painted on the staircase and
the<00:00:08.670> last<00:00:08.880> thing<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.210> have<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.570> do<00:00:09.719> is<00:00:09.990> paint

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
the last thing I have to do is paint

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.549 
the last thing I have to do is paint
this<00:00:11.309> portion<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.690> carpet<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.380> stairs

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
this portion to the carpet on the stairs

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.840 
this portion to the carpet on the stairs
I<00:00:14.160> kind<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.269> saved<00:00:15.509> it<00:00:15.780> for<00:00:16.080> last<00:00:16.139> because<00:00:17.039> one

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
I kind of saved it for last because one

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.450 
I kind of saved it for last because one
I<00:00:17.880> wasn't<00:00:18.300> sure<00:00:18.810> how<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.529> was<00:00:19.680> going<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.189> do<00:00:20.310> it

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
I wasn't sure how I was going to do it

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.960 
I wasn't sure how I was going to do it
and<00:00:20.990> two<00:00:22.070> however<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.130> was<00:00:23.340> going<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.640> do<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.880> I

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
and two however I was going to do it I

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.670 
and two however I was going to do it I
knew<00:00:24.150> it'd<00:00:24.269> be<00:00:24.300> time-consuming<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.439> want<00:00:25.650> to

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
knew it'd be time-consuming so I want to

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.550 
knew it'd be time-consuming so I want to
get<00:00:25.800> everything<00:00:26.070> else<00:00:26.279> out<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.640> way<00:00:26.760> um

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
get everything else out of the way um

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.150 
get everything else out of the way um
the<00:00:28.560> solution<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.130> came<00:00:29.340> up<00:00:29.519> with<00:00:29.550> it's<00:00:30.390> just<00:00:30.810> a

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
the solution I came up with it's just a

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.310 
the solution I came up with it's just a
piece<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.189> acetate<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.780> was<00:00:34.020> at<00:00:34.140> one

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
piece of acetate and this was at one

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.889 
piece of acetate and this was at one
time<00:00:34.350> clear<00:00:34.980> I've<00:00:35.160> been<00:00:35.370> using<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.149> do<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
time clear I've been using it to do the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.729 
time clear I've been using it to do the
edges<00:00:37.290> as<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.800> see<00:00:38.329> you<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.510> also<00:00:39.719> use<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
edges as you can see you can also use a

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.190 
edges as you can see you can also use a
piece<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.550> cardstock<00:00:41.940> or<00:00:42.570> something<00:00:43.050> like

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
piece of cardstock or something like

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.729 
piece of cardstock or something like
that

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
that

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.830 
that
so<00:00:44.250> all<00:00:44.579> you're<00:00:44.789> going<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.059> do<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:46.879> put<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.420> next

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
so all you're going to do is put it next

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.100 
so all you're going to do is put it next
to<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.789> place<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.969> down<00:00:51.210> into<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.870> carpet

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
to the place it down into the carpet

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.560 
to the place it down into the carpet
next<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.920> spin<00:00:53.160> like<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.879> pull<00:00:54.360> back

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
next to the spin like that and pull back

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.500 
next to the spin like that and pull back
and<00:00:55.440> you'll<00:00:56.010> see<00:00:56.280> how<00:00:56.579> much<00:00:56.610> more<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.300> this

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
and you'll see how much more of this

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.979 
and you'll see how much more of this
stair<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.350> see<00:00:58.649> now<00:00:59.550> eventually<00:01:00.030> let<00:01:00.870> me

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
stair you can see now eventually let me

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.429 
stair you can see now eventually let me
load<00:01:01.590> up<00:01:01.710> my<00:01:01.739> brush<00:01:01.859> here<00:01:02.539> eventually<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:04.110> plan

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
load up my brush here eventually we plan

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.050 
load up my brush here eventually we plan
to<00:01:05.000> get<00:01:06.000> hardwoods<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:07.320> our<00:01:08.810> staircase<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.140> so

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
to get hardwoods on our staircase and so

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.359 
to get hardwoods on our staircase and so
once<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.270> carpet<00:01:12.840> comes<00:01:13.170> out<00:01:13.439> I'll<00:01:14.100> probably

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
once this carpet comes out I'll probably

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.730 
once this carpet comes out I'll probably
have<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:14.880> some<00:01:15.090> touching<00:01:15.390> up<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:16.080> but

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
have to do some touching up here but

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.640 
have to do some touching up here but
this<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.280> best<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.850> do<00:01:18.650> without

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
this is the best I can do without

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.320 
this is the best I can do without
ripping<00:01:20.490> up<00:01:20.610> my<00:01:20.640> carpet

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
ripping up my carpet

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
ripping up my carpet
so<00:01:21.720> once<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:23.220> let<00:01:23.670> go<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.600> acetate<00:01:25.140> you

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
so once you let go of the acetate you

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.719 
so once you let go of the acetate you
can<00:01:25.530> see<00:01:25.909> how<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.869> can't<00:01:28.140> even<00:01:28.350> tell<00:01:28.729> there

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
can see how you can't even tell there

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.899 
can see how you can't even tell there
may<00:01:30.030> be<00:01:30.060> some<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.079> wood<00:01:31.290> not<00:01:31.560> covered<00:01:32.040> at

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
may be some of the wood not covered at

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.330 
may be some of the wood not covered at
the<00:01:33.150> very<00:01:33.540> very<00:01:33.659> base<00:01:34.880> I<00:01:36.650> really<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.829> tried

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
the very very base I really I tried

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.830 
the very very base I really I tried
taping<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.210> off<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:40.170> wasn't<00:01:41.040> getting

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
taping it off and it just wasn't getting

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.560 
taping it off and it just wasn't getting
whoa<00:01:42.020> enough<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:43.640> I<00:01:43.670> have<00:01:44.000> found<00:01:44.329> that

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
whoa enough and so I have found that

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.749 
whoa enough and so I have found that
this<00:01:44.810> is<00:01:45.020> just<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:45.619> best<00:01:45.860> way<00:01:46.100> to<00:01:46.130> do<00:01:46.430> it<00:01:46.579> and

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
this is just the best way to do it and

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.020 
this is just the best way to do it and
it's<00:01:46.909> really<00:01:47.360> quick<00:01:48.430> especially<00:01:49.430> since<00:01:49.909> I

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
it's really quick especially since I

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.749 
it's really quick especially since I
have<00:01:50.180> everything<00:01:50.539> else<00:01:50.780> painted<00:01:51.289> so<00:01:52.250> there's

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
have everything else painted so there's

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.300 
have everything else painted so there's
a<00:01:52.939> little<00:01:53.450> tip<00:01:53.600> for<00:01:53.899> you

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
a little tip for you

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.300 
a little tip for you
like<00:01:55.820> I<00:01:55.939> said<00:01:56.000> acetate<00:01:56.840> a<00:01:57.229> piece<00:01:57.830> of<00:01:58.009> card

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
like I said acetate a piece of card

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.149 
like I said acetate a piece of card
stock<00:01:58.630> index<00:01:59.630> card<00:01:59.929> anything<00:02:00.289> you<00:02:00.590> can<00:02:00.799> to<00:02:01.009> get
