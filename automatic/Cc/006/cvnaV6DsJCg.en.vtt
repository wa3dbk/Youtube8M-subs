00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.400
 Hello, my little guardians, how are you? 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.860
 you are welcome to a new video of 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.080
 destiny and today I want to talk about a 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.449
 novelty that we will find in the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.820
 good pot that novelty is the mode 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.040
 that way eliminating as if already 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.900
 you know it's not so much news because 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.850
 a few weeks ago we are 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.730
 enjoying in osiris tests 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.590
 but the fact incorporate it into 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.789
 the crucible play modes well yes it is 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.760
 a novelty because it will allow us 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.739
 play that good way without having to 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.870
 go through osiris tests and without 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.250
 go through the brother good fans too 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.400
 You have to say also you have to say that 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.870
 this mode is going to be temporary is not a 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.280
 way that will be always active you know 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.140
 that there are ways in the crucible that come and 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.940
 they go then this one is going to be part of that 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.800
 in those ways so nothing when I 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.809
 let's have available then there will be 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.030
 take advantage and enjoy it well too 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.130
 I want to talk about the news of the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.960
 variations that will suffer this way 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.360
 elimination inside the crucible and 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.769
 we started with the first one maybe for a 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.020
 of the most important 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.030
 it's going to be that the level advantages do not 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.580
 they will be activated that is not 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.840
 guardians that have been level 34 then not 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.970
 they will have advantages over those that 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.470
 have level 20 for example the whole world 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.299
 will have the same possibilities you know 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.340
 that there is equal everything that they are 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.040
 armor and weapons damage so good 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.409
 that is going to be one of the novelties that goes 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.450
 to suffer from the modifications that will 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.460
 suffer this elimination mode in the 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.850
 good pot we go with the second 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.130
 modification and this is going to be the include 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.619
 skill matches for all 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.560
 that is to say that the system will try 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.450
 that we have to fight we touch 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.369
 face players who have a 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.140
 level more or less similar to that 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.909
 we have in the crucible with 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.789
 which good then that's pretty good 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.740
 also you more things pairings of 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.350
 peers or what is also translated 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.509
 as matchmaking we will finally be able to 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.950
 play this mode with the option to 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.770
 matchmaking that is to say we are not going to have 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.500
 to take our friends and in that 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.899
 moment they are not online or not 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.390
 They want to play the crucible, because we are going to 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.489
 can play against good with better said 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.650
 first and then against others 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.120
 players so nothing that option is 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.020
 very well the fact of having matchmaking 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.640
 for allies we are going 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.850
 Well, as I tell you to facilitate a 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.500
 little options and not letting us play in 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.930
 any time that we may want 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.040
 good going on with these with these 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.930
 modifications with these changes 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.240
 we will also find the rotation of 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.580
 activated maps this is great because 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.190
 you know that maybe one of the things that 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.000
 well you may like less of the way 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.100
 elimination 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.860
 through osiris is the fact that 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.930
 we only play on a map because everything 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.490
 that event in this way then we are going to 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.480
 have the possibility to play them in 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.480
 all maps 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.820
 that yes remember that it will be necessary that 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.500
 have the new dlc of the house of 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.970
 the wolves because here they are going to be included 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.620
 also all the new maps that are 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.380
 three in particular to do this 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.780
 rotation as much as possible and then 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.610
 as last point we will also have the 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.930
 random rewards that we 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.550
 we will benefit put one of the system 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.430
 which makes it a bit and changed 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.950
 you know in the last update and that 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.210
 theoretically I say theoretically because it 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.730
 they still see players who are made 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.990
 games and they do not give them absolutely 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.940
 nothing and the player then that has been done 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.100
 a mediocre game because they give it a 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.530
 little bit of everything and something else so good 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.450
 I'm still without seeing 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.650
 this update these changes that have 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.200
 done because I already tell you that in moments 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.100
 in that it is not seen anywhere and it shines 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.300
 by its absence 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.130
 I suppose you too will have 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.510
 found in this case I say yes 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.190
 sure you know what I'm 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.620
 speaking you know what I mean and 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.200
 Well, this is all I wanted 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.670
 comment you wanted that then and share it 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.590
 with you who knew that now 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.230
 you can enter here in the crucible that 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.150
 you will find that elimination variant 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.610
 and what good is it going to do to us as you 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.280
 it said a little more pleasant the crucible 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.350
 as having a range including for 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.480
 so far this little video 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.950
 informative I hope you have served 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.330
 utility 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.670
 I am ghost and as always I say goodbye 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.570
 until the next video take care 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.570
 bye Bye 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.550
 ah
