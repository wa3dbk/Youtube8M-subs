00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.830
 everyone knows how to touch a car, it generates pain 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.230
 of head 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.419
 of with us in 3 m we know is that 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.189
 this headache is not just for the 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.529
 owner of the car but also 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.699
 for all the people involved in 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.699
 the repair process 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.890
 the system is collapsed the country is 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:41.649
 full of cars that can not be 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.089
 repaired on time the companies 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.399
 insurers have nowhere to send 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.589
 your clients the workshops are 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.659
 burdened trying to meet the high 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.790
 demand for existing labor and 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:54.320
 customers are increasingly 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.019
 dissatisfied with the service that 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.909
 receive in 13m we have a time 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:00.969
 thinking about this problem that affects us 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:04.690
 everyone and we have found the solution 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.690
 increase productivity 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.080
 we already know that lower costs 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.080
 brings good results 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.040
 what we are proposing is that 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.020
 Let's increase profits through 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.990
 increase our productivity ie 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.860
 more pieces worked per month means 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.860
 more utilities 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.770
 how we do it is a job in 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.530
 set between each workshop 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.780
 and 13m is not just about using 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.340
 our products is a new way of 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.950
 see the work we do 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.979
 13m provides comprehensive advice 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.500
 that will allow each workshop to increase its 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.810
 productivity significantly the idea 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.899
 is that everyone ends up winning the 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.240
 customers, workshops, technicians and 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.610
 insurers a workshop with greater 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.500
 productivity means less time 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.329
 wait for the owner of the vehicle 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.030
 possibility for the workshop to make a 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:11.679
 better job generating more profits and 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.679
 more efficiency for insurance 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.270
 how this advice works, we believe that 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.000
 The basis of the problem lies in the lack of 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.310
 therefore standardized processes 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.560
 Our solution proposes to establish 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.960
 these processes for each of the 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.210
 repair stages we must leave behind 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.670
 the days when each technician chose 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.660
 according to their own criteria the inputs and 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.660
 tools to use 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.670
 13m when incorporating its new technology on 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.650
 process establishes a system in which 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.990
 each step of the repair has 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.850
 tools and products defined with 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.750
 which the technician must work for 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.750
 an optimal result 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.129
 the combination of both elements 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.530
 technology and standardized processes we 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:05.239
 allows you to do more in less time 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.239
 leads to an increase in profits 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.690
 another problem that is solved with the 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.340
 3m counseling are the setbacks the 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.950
 fact that a high percentage of 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.300
 repaired vehicles go back to the workshop 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.730
 it means a great waste of time and 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.160
 therefore also of money the 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.930
 system that we propose solves this already 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.090
 that by employing 13m technology 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.130
 correct form ensures the results 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.569
 perfect by reducing the minimum the 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.569
 percentage of processes 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.050
 13 accompanies me clients throughout 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.760
 this transition with a coach that helps 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.400
 both the technicians and the 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.020
 workshop administrators do the 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.110
 training and training 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.110
 personal 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.720
 then we choose the best technician in 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.670
 workshop and we designated him as a coach 13m 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.560
 authorized him to continue 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.270
 overseeing the implementation of 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.280
 new process 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.410
 In addition to the initial training 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.510
 we also track each 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.370
 workshop to verify that the new 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.890
 tools and processes are 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.120
 implemented correctly 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.830
 making sure that our customers 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.830
 get the best results 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.980
 this plan that is of action in 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.130
 several workshops throughout the country and 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.980
 the results have been impressive 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.750
 contact test with your seller 3m for 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.990
 implement these changes in your workshop 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.580
 you will see the results in a few days 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.560
 let's work together in making your workshop 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.560
 a more productive and efficient service 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.180
 ah
