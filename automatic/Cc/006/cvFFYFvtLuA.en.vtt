00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.770 
it's still good what three weeks before
Christmas<00:00:35.489> I'm<00:00:36.030> thinking<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.660> maybe

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
Christmas I'm thinking that maybe

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.450 
Christmas I'm thinking that maybe
they'll<00:00:37.050> do<00:00:37.170> like<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> christmas-themed<00:00:38.100> skin

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
they'll do like a christmas-themed skin

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.130 
they'll do like a christmas-themed skin
pack<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.790> don't<00:00:38.940> know<00:00:39.000> it's<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.270> secret<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.079> I'm

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
pack I don't know it's a secret so I'm

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.930 
pack I don't know it's a secret so I'm
thinking<00:00:40.200> either<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:41.219> they<00:00:41.340> are<00:00:41.610> like

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
thinking either that they are like

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.979 
thinking either that they are like
because<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.329> said<00:00:42.540> they<00:00:42.629> weren't<00:00:42.750> really

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
because I said they weren't really

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.600 
because I said they weren't really
thinking<00:00:43.230> about<00:00:43.440> doing<00:00:43.829> them<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.309> maybe<00:00:44.489> they

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
thinking about doing them so maybe they

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.709 
thinking about doing them so maybe they
changed<00:00:44.640> their<00:00:45.030> mind<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.300> they're<00:00:45.420> gonna<00:00:45.510> do

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
changed their mind and they're gonna do

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.150 
changed their mind and they're gonna do
it<00:00:45.809> because<00:00:45.960> I'm<00:00:46.230> assuming<00:00:46.710> they<00:00:46.770> got<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> whole

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
it because I'm assuming they got a whole

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.819 
it because I'm assuming they got a whole
bunch<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.460> messages<00:00:47.989> of<00:00:48.989> people<00:00:49.469> saying<00:00:49.649> they
