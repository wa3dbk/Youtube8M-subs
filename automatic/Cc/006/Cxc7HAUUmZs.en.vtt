Hi, I’m Francis, 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.914
the host of this show "Cooking with Dog."  

00:00:19.153 --> 00:00:23.618
First, let’s prepare the ingen, string bean pods.

00:00:24.172 --> 00:00:26.176
Remove the stem end.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.896
Cut the bean pods into 2 to 3 pieces.

00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:38.028
Now, add a little salt to a pot of boiling water.

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:44.563
Drop in the bean pods 

00:00:44.563 --> 00:00:48.128
and simmer for 1 and a half to 2 minutes.

00:00:48.663 --> 00:00:51.875
The easiest way to check if they are ready is 

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:54.996
to take a little bite of one of the pods.

00:00:55.748 --> 00:00:59.269
OK, Chef thinks the ingen is ready now.

00:01:02.723 --> 00:01:07.831
Remove and place the bean pods onto a mesh strainer.

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.548
And now, let’s make the Goma-ae.

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:17.732
First, lightly re-toast the toasted sesame seeds.

00:01:22.867 --> 00:01:27.729
Stir the sesame seeds over heat until they are nice and hot, 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.916
but be careful not to burn them.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.856
Place the sesame into a suribachi mortar.

00:01:37.776 --> 00:01:42.894
Then, grind the seeds until they reach the desired consistency.

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:54.092
Add the sugar 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:58.205
and soy sauce.

00:02:00.981 --> 00:02:03.070
Mix to combine.

00:02:07.234 --> 00:02:11.688
Then, add the dashi stock, diluting the sesame paste.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.373
Now, add the boiled ingen to it.

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:30.150
Toss to coat.

00:02:36.325 --> 00:02:38.812
Place the goma-ae into a bowl.

00:02:44.582 --> 00:02:47.241
Maintaining the green color of the bean pods 

00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:49.914
is not so important for this recipe 

00:02:49.914 --> 00:02:53.262
so Chef didn’t soak them in ice water.

00:02:53.262 --> 00:02:57.925
This way helps to retain their nutrients and crisp texture.

00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:05.950
Goma-ae is a quick and easy recipe 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.270
so it will help you make one more side dish.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.281
If string bean pods have firm stringy fibers, 

00:03:13.281 --> 00:03:15.288
remove them beforehand.

00:03:15.288 --> 00:03:17.093
Good luck in the kitchen.
