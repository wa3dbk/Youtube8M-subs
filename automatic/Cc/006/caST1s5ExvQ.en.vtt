we're in the entire camera sensor and

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.999 
we're in the entire camera sensor and
lens<00:00:16.730> assembly<00:00:16.880> gets<00:00:17.839> vibrated<00:00:18.470> essentially

all of these shots despite being

all of these shots despite being
handheld<00:00:26.869> should<00:00:27.199> hopefully<00:00:27.470> be<00:00:27.739> pretty

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:28.069 
handheld should hopefully be pretty

smooth<00:00:28.460> to<00:00:29.089> the<00:00:29.119> I<00:00:29.239> notice<00:00:30.199> that<00:00:30.349> there<00:00:30.470> are

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
smooth to the I notice that there are

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.950 
smooth to the I notice that there are
some<00:00:30.829> continuous<00:00:31.399> autofocus<00:00:31.960> artifacts

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
some continuous autofocus artifacts

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.650 
some continuous autofocus artifacts
where<00:00:33.200> it<00:00:33.260> kind<00:00:33.800> of<00:00:33.890> focuses<00:00:34.400> in<00:00:34.610> and<00:00:35.000> out<00:00:35.150> and

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
where it kind of focuses in and out and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.810 
where it kind of focuses in and out and
also<00:00:36.020> the<00:00:36.140> bright<00:00:36.440> lights<00:00:36.710> here<00:00:36.980> have<00:00:37.520> a<00:00:37.550> bit

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
also the bright lights here have a bit

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.010 
also the bright lights here have a bit
of<00:00:37.910> a<00:00:37.970> detrimental<00:00:38.630> effect<00:00:40.990> unlike<00:00:41.990> the

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
of a detrimental effect unlike the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.000 
of a detrimental effect unlike the
Symbian<00:00:42.920> based<00:00:43.160> nokia<00:00:43.640> n8<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:44.590> 808<00:00:45.590> there's

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010

no intelligent digital video zoom here

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.050 
no intelligent digital video zoom here
so<00:00:48.080> if<00:00:48.170> i<00:00:48.230> zoom<00:00:48.260> in<00:00:48.740> and<00:00:49.160> take<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.460> same<00:00:49.700> scene

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
so if i zoom in and take the same scene

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.819 
so if i zoom in and take the same scene
everything's<00:00:50.720> very<00:00:50.870> blocky<00:00:51.200> as<00:00:51.530> it<00:00:51.680> is<00:00:51.800> on

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
everything's very blocky as it is on

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.460 
everything's very blocky as it is on
most<00:00:52.190> other<00:00:52.450> camcorder<00:00:53.450> phones<00:00:53.690> to<00:00:54.140> be<00:00:54.230> fair

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
most other camcorder phones to be fair

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.110 
most other camcorder phones to be fair
but<00:00:54.740> disappointing<00:00:55.579> not<00:00:55.670> to<00:00:55.730> have<00:00:55.940> that

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
but disappointing not to have that

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.350 
but disappointing not to have that

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
testing shooting into light quite a few

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.729 
testing shooting into light quite a few
flare<00:01:02.630> effects<00:01:02.989> in<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.200> lens<00:01:03.380> but<00:01:03.590> that's

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
flare effects in the lens but that's

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.590 
flare effects in the lens but that's
quite<00:01:04.009> normal<00:01:04.189> for<00:01:04.429> any<00:01:04.699> camera<00:01:04.999> phone<00:01:05.359> and

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
quite normal for any camera phone and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.359 
quite normal for any camera phone and
indeed<00:01:06.020> i<00:01:06.170> think<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.499> effect<00:01:06.799> here<00:01:07.009> is<00:01:07.159> quite

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
indeed i think the effect here is quite

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.760 
indeed i think the effect here is quite
atmospheric<00:01:08.179> i<00:01:08.420> still<00:01:08.990> a<00:01:09.020> few<00:01:09.350> variations

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
atmospheric i still a few variations

i<00:01:12.560> think<00:01:12.799> though<00:01:13.009> and<00:01:13.700> now<00:01:13.880> for<00:01:14.060> some<00:01:14.210> close-up

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
i think though and now for some close-up

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:17.770 
i think though and now for some close-up
work<00:01:14.990> let's<00:01:15.560> look<00:01:15.649> at<00:01:15.799> Rafe's<00:01:16.069> cat<00:01:16.630> again<00:01:17.630> the
