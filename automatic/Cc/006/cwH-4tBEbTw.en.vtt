 today's revenue in some places is 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.840
 called a gelinho related to the college and 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.869
 suck jinping here in our region is

 call sacolé we will use networks 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:36.360
 here he has these measures now 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:39.899
 the width or length is the most used 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.950
 the first option we will do with the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.600
 dim that little guy who sells packages 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.829
 so you can make a taste of 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.090

 and here's a pint of half-liter milk 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.739
 we will use to make the pudding and 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.140
 another half liter 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.939
 we'll use the rest of the revenue 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.400
 then this first option 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.750
 the second option we are going to show is 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.150
 more economical 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.590
 We're going to make juice powder then. 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.850
 You can make strawberry pineapple 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.560

 We're going to make the grape taste. 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.560
 let's use a glass of crystal sugar 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.470
 It's best to do this kind of thing. 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.200

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.420
 sugar and half a liter of milk 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.290
 We'll make the first choice. 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:08.190
 we put the putin pod in a bowl 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:12.070
 and we put half a liter of milk 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.650
 We mix the other half of the milk we 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.060
 Let's put it later when you hit the 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.180
 blender 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.940
 Now let's put it on the low fire and let's 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.230
 stirring here until cooking for 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.530
 against 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:30.790
 we are making the caramel flavor already 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:34.180
 raised boil continues on low heat 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.090
 we move the pattern of fire 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.260
 ours could already be in temperature 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.580
 environment 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.950
 We'll put it in the blender. 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.730
 we will put the condensed milk the 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:52.709
 remaining milk 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.709
 now we're going to hit for 2 minutes 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.480
 We're finishing up hitting our 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.840
 cream to make your college and 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.400
 bags are sold in packs with 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:12.430
 50 units or 100 units 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:16.360
 he has so you make rabbit there so 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:20.190
 already for this opening is you put a 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.570
 funnel can be a large small funnel 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:28.270
 here we take the bigger one that 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:31.390
 makes you dump you can not 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:32.890
 Injecting into the account we are going to tie a knot in the 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.030
 we leave you 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.630
 we have three rooms of the bag and 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:04:06.370
 leave the room to take the knot 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:04:09.530
 [Music] 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.560
 we finished packing the bag 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.970
 to make our colé with that piece 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.729
 so big but it looks better for 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.739
 mahatta if you want you can book more 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.880
 at the end but it gets more difficult in the 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.150
 time to dial 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.479
 now we'll put in the freezer 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.490
 Now we're going to make the second choice. 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:34.009
 We will put in the blender the 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:36.560
 water the milk the sugar 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.510
 We'll put the grape flavor of your 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.010
 lap 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.070
 Now we're going to hit for a minute. 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.550
 just to give a light burst 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.550
 in these ingredients 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.360
 we do so to find who looks 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:57.490
 to open so point to it 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:59.160
 we put the funnel that we pour the cream 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:04.150
 of grape 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:06.440
 [Music] 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:10.490
 so we finished making one more 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.919
 consignment of sacrols in this same option we 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.460
 we can do without milk 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:18.039
 then we put water in the sugar and the 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:24.069
 powdered juice 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:24.069
 Let's do a jucu school. 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.820
 a normal juice we do not put sugar 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:32.070
 It's not to make you reap us. 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.320
 we put sugar that has more stringent 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.870
 but 25 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.330
 then it is this one is grape juice without 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.680
 milk 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.680
 so we do the same procedure 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:51.229
 Let's put our freezer in our 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.900
 perception that we make 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:54.830
 we can make avocado demand 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.289
 banana 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:02.509
 We're going to make manga, we have three 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:04.280
 chopped half a liter of milk and a 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:06.620
 sugar cup 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.620
 if it is vitamin as we put less 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.889
 sugar until we choose to make the 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.479
 Tea colé we put a glass to 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:17.210
 stay and sweetheart 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:19.720
 let's hit the blender the two 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.720
 minutes 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:25.509
 we do the same procedure area 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.290
 So we just finished doing our 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.380
 sacrols in good demand 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:37.350
