00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
better so the problem that my students

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.610 
better so the problem that my students
have<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.719> when<00:00:36.930> they<00:00:37.079> want<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.440> say

have is that when they want to say

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.920 
have is that when they want to say
medium<00:00:38.010> they<00:00:38.460> just<00:00:38.760> take<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.210> Russian<00:00:39.540> idiom

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
medium they just take the Russian idiom

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.260 
medium they just take the Russian idiom
and<00:00:40.079> then<00:00:40.260> they<00:00:40.379> translate<00:00:40.950> every<00:00:41.399> word<00:00:41.610> into

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
and then they translate every word into

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.020 
and then they translate every word into
English<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:43.140> makes<00:00:43.559> no<00:00:44.040> sense<00:00:44.070> at<00:00:44.640> all<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
English that makes no sense at all and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.229 
English that makes no sense at all and
if<00:00:45.360> we<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.690> lots<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.140> idioms<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:47.370> the
