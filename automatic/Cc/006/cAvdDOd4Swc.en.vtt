 Lesson 7 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.480
 What are you doing Tarik? 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.400
 I put the picture in its place in the album 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.380
 Look, this is a sphinx 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.680
 What? Who's father? 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.040
 No Rome. He is not a father, her name is Sphynx 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.800
 I want paper, do you have paper? 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.360
 Yes take the paper 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.960
 I also want a pen 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.060
 Why do you need a pen? 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.000
 To draw 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.780
 Do you want to draw a pyramid? 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.340
 Not. I prefer to draw camels 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.600
 Take the pens and bye. 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.460
 I want to fix the album * 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.460
 Tariq! 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.340
 What do you want now 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.620
 What is the name of this? 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.860
 You two, what are you doing? 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.500
 I tidy up the album 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.620
 And I draw a camel 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.940
 Let's go to the living room 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.580
 What for? 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.500
 I feel comfortable here 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.740
 Me too 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.820
 Look in the living room 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.100
 Grandfather... 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.080
 Grandfather 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.160
 Rome. Tarik 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.920
 How are you doing? Sit on the sides 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.420
 Do you want anything? 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.420
 I would like juice mom 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.920
 What is this book Tariq? 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.700
 This is not a book, this is an album. 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.660
 I'm sorry 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.640
 Look grandfather 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.400
 Look, this is a sphinx 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.380
 This is not a father, this is a sphinx 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.980
 Yes you are right 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.160
 This is the mosque of Azhar 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.960
 This is the Nile River 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.680
 The pyramids 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.220
 Cairo 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.540
 We are at Cairo airport 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.440

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.780
 Not 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.720
 To see a friend 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.900
 No, this is Amin's friend 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.520

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.980
