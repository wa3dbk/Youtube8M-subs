00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.400
 ah 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:16.010
 anniversary food of the restaurant and 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:18.440
 why they were destroyed carries a safety 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.750
 specialized traditional cuisine 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.770
 that country to see that gonzález del 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.770
 grotto restaurant 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.369
 what is your story with the kitchen 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.450
 traditional Mexican because this is his 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.579
 specialty so I started working 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.489
 with creating doubts that then the one that 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.500
 taught traditional cooking the taste for 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.010
 the local product working with 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.050
 small producers at a fair price 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.850
 know ingredients of not only the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.089
 where he lives but of all the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.210
 republic then that's where he took the 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.809
 taste of Mexican cuisine and I fell in love 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.809
 totally 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.090
 in many places people are a little 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.909
 jealous of your recipes then that is 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.880
 from getting into the field to know the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.530
 ingredient meet the person 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.290
 ask and little by little you get soaked 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.060
 of your recipes for your ingredients from 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.979
 your products I think that is the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.420
 most beautiful part because you not only know 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.130
 the food also how are the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.130
 people and what do people eat 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.790
 that you chose to bring samples a little bit 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.220
 good we bring holy leaf a grass that 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.680
 it is given 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.340
 veracruz to dramatize the dishes 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.890
 they have very lively notes various types 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.870
 of cheeses this is from querétaro and this is 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.660
 of Michoacán are two different states 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.660
 and therefore are two very different cheeses 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.760
 what are these goat's milk and this 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.190
 it's cow 's a very ingredient 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.520
 malleable for all things 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.740
 the bluest for us is very typical 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.830
 and it's me I think the most food 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.410
 important because without corn there is no country and 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.330
 without Mexican mass would not have its 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.580
 tortillas that we like so much wears a 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.710
 process of mix amenización that is a 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.710
 cooking technique so that the grain of 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:15.830
 corn becomes edible then it 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.840
 puts in a bake with lime and leaves 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.700
 rest the other day it grinds and is that 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.800
 we have this texture that is the basis for 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.770
 make tortillas tamales food 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:29.000
 basic in our kitchen and the taste is 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.760
 as curious as the appearance or not 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.770
 it's a very neutral taste the tortilla the 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.020
 We can accompany with all kinds of 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.310
 Food sauces up with a little bit of 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.310
 salt is very rich 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.040
 another curious I think it would be the walt 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.780
 fumes that is the flower of the maguey the 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.640
 maguey is another type of cactus that is 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.940
 where we get mezcal and tequila 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.379
 a flower is coming out and these 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:00.200
 kits that are boiled and used to 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:03.230
 this salads to make pancakes 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.530
 these are the famous trucks is the 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.650
 ant roe the ant arriera in 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.690
 mexico is one of the most 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.400
 typical and oldest we have 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.250
 they usually prepare with butter 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.580
 cilantro chile de paso tea is a product 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.650
 very delicate very rich and I think very 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.470
 fine Mexican caviar 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.170
 I know that it is a type of tuna like 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.540
 comes out of the nopal come in this case is 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.700
 an acid tuna can be used so much 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.430
 for sweet preparations like 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.680
 super acidic salads and preparations 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.349
 in fact many people instead of taking 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.270
 lemon with tequila eat I know 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.270
 for the acidity 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.910
 this is the maguey leaf more than a 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.520
 ingredient is a coverage equal to 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.590
 very similar to the tamal leaf 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.240
 llama missotten mexico then it 's like 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.240
 a sachet and they cook 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:02.329
 There are many things wrapped in something 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:06.590
 so that what is the 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:11.000
 ingredient does not aromas the juices and 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.640
 everything if it helps to keep the product with 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.790
 Higher juicier flavor stays 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.540
 hot longer 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:23.180
 how was it to bring all this brazil as well 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.870
 interesting we are going more ingredients 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.580
 what clothes in the suitcase then is a 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.040
 experience since packing it 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.250
 keep it so that everything arrives in good 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.120
 been and really try a little bit of 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.120
 mexico of sao paulo
