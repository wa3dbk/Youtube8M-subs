she can't put in him off at that point

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.740

but<00:01:16.860> she<00:01:17.100> waited<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.850> all<00:01:18.000> honesty<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.600> she

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
but she waited in all honesty so she

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.030 
but she waited in all honesty so she
wasn't<00:01:18.960> really<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.259> small<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.799> could<00:01:19.950> it

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
wasn't really that small of it could it

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.990 
wasn't really that small of it could it
could<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.220> been<00:01:20.280> even<00:01:20.400> more<00:01:20.549> entertaining

but<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.840> think<00:01:22.200> she's<00:01:22.380> got<00:01:22.500> mental<00:01:22.650> problems<00:01:22.860> so

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
but I think she's got mental problems so

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.440 
but I think she's got mental problems so
personally<00:01:23.759> we<00:01:23.909> should<00:01:24.060> probably<00:01:24.210> stop
