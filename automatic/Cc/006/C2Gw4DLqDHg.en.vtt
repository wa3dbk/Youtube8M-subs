00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This will be complete Walkthrough.
Movies, cutscenes and dialogues won't be skipped.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.060
Ah, so this is Hong Kong.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.999
People talk of it as an interesting place.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.335
"Filled with mystery, laughs and excitement"
they say.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:38.572
Not really my scene.

00:00:38.575 --> 00:00:40.575
OK, so here's how I'm gonna do my Walkthroughs:

00:00:40.576 --> 00:00:50.576
I'll let you read all things in briefing.
Then I'll try to explain my strategy on the map.
And finally I'll show you how I do it.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Sometimes these subtitles will be too fast.
Use Interactive Transcript or just pause the movie.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I love this mission. The essence of Hitman.
I'm gonna try to eliminate the target with sniper rifle.

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:32.001
To perform clean shot, I need to find good, high spot.
The best spots in the city are of course buildings' roofs.

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:38.000
OK, blue circle is Rendezvous Point.
After eliminating the target, we must get back to this point.

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:44.500
I've picked roof on the east from Chiu Dai Park.
Here's the route to the roof.

00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:47.074
I'll use elevator to go up,
assemble my weapon there and wait for the target.

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:51.500
Target should be in the center of this park.
After eliminating the target I'll use elevator to go down...

00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:54.648
...and go back the same route to Rendezvous Point.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.421
I'll buy Blaser Jagdwaffen R93 Sniper.
Won't buy any extra ammo.
It has only one bullet - that's enough for this job.

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:06.421
As a real pro I must be very quick and precise.
Try to make this mission on full speed.

00:02:06.422 --> 00:02:11.422
As you can see, some alleyways are closed.
That's why I had to go this way.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:51.533
Carefully pick up place to assemble your weapon.
Try to do it near the center of the wall.

00:02:51.534 --> 00:02:56.534
It's very important to have the suitcase as close as possible,
because after the shot you'll have to pick it up ASAP.

00:02:56.535 --> 00:03:01.535
Of course you can leave the weapon with suitcase,
but we've just bought it, right?

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:41.585
That's Blue Lotus negotiator.
DO NOT KILL HIM!!!

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:12.983
And here's Red Dragon negotiator.
That's your target.

00:04:12.984 --> 00:04:15.984
Wait until he stops to get 100% shot.

00:04:15.985 --> 00:04:19.985
ATTENTION!
Don't shoot, when Blue Lotus is in front of
or just behind the Red Dragon.

00:04:19.986 --> 00:04:24.986
If he'll stand on fire line - you'll score double kill
and fail the mission.

00:04:24.987 --> 00:04:27.987
That's why your placement was very important.

00:04:27.988 --> 00:04:32.988
Focus, score headshot, get the suitcase ASAP
and go to Rendezvous Point.

00:04:52.626 --> 00:04:57.626
If you were very quick - the helicopter won't
be able to recognise the assassin.

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:38.305
Mission completed in beautiful style!

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:41.274
Subtitles can be changed, so if y'all see
some errors, mistakes - write to me.
