00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
badass constructor spawns he does not

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.620 
badass constructor spawns he does not
spawn<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.549> first<00:01:35.820> go<00:01:36.000> through<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.570> you

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
spawn on the first go through so you

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.020 
spawn on the first go through so you
don't<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.930> worry<00:01:37.110> about<00:01:37.200> him<00:01:37.909> there<00:01:38.909> are

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
don't have to worry about him there are

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.210 
don't have to worry about him there are
occasionally<00:01:39.659> yeah<00:01:40.439> you'll<00:01:40.710> see<00:01:40.950> some

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
occasionally yeah you'll see some

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.460 
occasionally yeah you'll see some
loaders<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.909> pop<00:01:42.090> up<00:01:42.270> here<00:01:42.540> you<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.380> either

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
loaders that pop up here you can either

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.069 
loaders that pop up here you can either
dispatch<00:01:44.280> them<00:01:44.600> but<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.630> would<00:01:45.840> recommend

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
dispatch them but I would recommend

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.440 
dispatch them but I would recommend
dispatching<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.130> barrel<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.520> because<00:01:48.299> if

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
dispatching this barrel here because if

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.719 
dispatching this barrel here because if
they<00:01:48.570> shoot<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.930> you're<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> goner<00:01:49.610> so<00:01:50.610> you've

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
they shoot it you're a goner so you've

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.850 
they shoot it you're a goner so you've
got<00:01:50.880> another<00:01:51.119> one<00:01:51.360> here<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.200> got<00:01:52.380> lucky<00:01:52.680> and

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
got a nice mod unfortunately fire rate

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.950 
got a nice mod unfortunately fire rate
is<00:01:55.740> pretty<00:01:56.159> worthless<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.969> siren<00:01:57.630> mod

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
is pretty worthless on a siren mod

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.210 
is pretty worthless on a siren mod
because<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.530> skills<00:01:58.799> gives

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220
