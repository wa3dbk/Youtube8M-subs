00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:04.150
 Formation of Living Beings 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:10.460
 When did the Earth begin to settle? "At first everything was chaos; the elements 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:18.859
 were in confusion. Little by little every thing took its place. Then appeared beings 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.439
 alive to the state of the globe. " 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.289
 Where did living beings come to Earth? "The Earth contained the germens, which 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.140
 favorable moment to develop. Organic principles congregated, 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.280
 since the action of the force that kept them ceased, and formed the germs 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:52.420
 of all living beings. These germs remained in a latent state of inertia, as the chrysalis 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:00.059
 and the seeds of the plants, until the moment favorable to the outbreak of each species. The beings 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.220
 of each of these gathered together, and multiplied. " 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.790
 Where were the organic elements, before the formation of the Earth? 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.340
 "They were, as it were, in fluid state in Space, in the midst of the Spirits, 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.460
 or on other planets, waiting for the creation of the Earth to begin new existence 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.890
 on a new globe. " 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.080
 Are there still beings who are born spontaneously? "Yes, but the primitive germ already existed 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:38.570
 latent state. You are witnesses of this phenomenon every day. The tissues of the human body 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.780
 and of animals do not enclose the germs of a multitude of worms that only wait, 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:52.050
 to blossom, the putrid fermentation that is necessary to their existence? 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.780
 It's a tiny world that slumbers and creates itself. " 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.580
 Was the human species among the organic elements contained in the terrestrial globe? 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:09.009
 "Yes, and it came in time. This is what gave rise to being said that the man was formed 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.050
 of the earth's slime. " 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.400
 Can we know the epoch of the appearance of man and other living beings on Earth? 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.400
 "Not; all your calculations are chimerical. " 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.610
 If the germ of the human species was among the organic elements of the globe, 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.210
 who do not spontaneously form men, as in the origin of time? 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:39.190
 "The beginning of things is in the secrets of God. However, it can be said that the 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:46.080
 men, once scattered over the Earth, absorbed in themselves the elements necessary to 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.000
 their own formation, to transmit them according to the laws of reproduction. 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.530
 The same has happened with different species of living beings. "
