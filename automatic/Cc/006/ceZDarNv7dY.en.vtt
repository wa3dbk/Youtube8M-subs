back<00:00:30.949> protector<00:00:31.750> unlike<00:00:32.750> most<00:00:32.960> back

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
back protector unlike most back

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.940

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
protectors this is actually pliable and

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.099 
protectors this is actually pliable and
its<00:00:36.950> molecular<00:00:37.640> armor<00:00:37.940> so<00:00:38.359> what<00:00:38.539> happens<00:00:38.899> is

00:00:39.099 --> 00:00:39.109 
its molecular armor so what happens is

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:40.510 
its molecular armor so what happens is
even<00:00:39.410> though<00:00:39.469> it's<00:00:39.620> soft<00:00:39.949> and<00:00:40.219> it's<00:00:40.309> almost

like memory foam and when you stick your
finger<00:00:42.379> into<00:00:42.590> it<00:00:42.910> you<00:00:43.910> can<00:00:44.120> make<00:00:44.359> it<00:00:44.420> dimple

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
finger into it you can make it dimple

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.900 
finger into it you can make it dimple
into<00:00:45.379> the<00:00:45.500> thing<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:45.829> then<00:00:45.949> it<00:00:46.100> slowly<00:00:46.550> comes

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
into the thing and then it slowly comes

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.660 
into the thing and then it slowly comes
back<00:00:47.149> out<00:00:47.390> but<00:00:48.350> what<00:00:48.980> happens<00:00:49.309> is<00:00:49.430> when<00:00:49.579> the

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
back out but what happens is when the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.090 
back out but what happens is when the
shock<00:00:49.940> hits<00:00:50.300> this<00:00:50.629> mold<00:00:51.469> on<00:00:51.739> a<00:00:51.769> molecular

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.940 
knife because if you use a serrated
knife<00:02:02.030> you'll<00:02:02.359> actually<00:02:02.719> tear<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.469> material

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
knife you'll actually tear the material

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.709 
knife you'll actually tear the material
apart<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.759> has<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:05.000> be<00:02:05.090> a<00:02:05.119> straight<00:02:05.570> edge

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
apart so it has to be a straight edge

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:06.950 
apart so it has to be a straight edge
knife<00:02:06.020> versus

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
knife versus

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.630 
knife versus
want<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.229> use<00:02:07.440> but<00:02:08.039> what<00:02:08.160> I'm<00:02:08.250> going<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.399> do<00:02:08.520> is
