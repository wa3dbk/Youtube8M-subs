pretty<00:06:47.430> cool<00:06:47.700> I'm<00:06:48.150> like<00:06:48.300> I<00:06:48.420> was<00:06:48.540> saying

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
pretty cool I'm like I was saying

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.060

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.070 
there's a hole there in the front where

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.140 
there's a hole there in the front where
the<00:06:50.160> light<00:06:50.280> comes<00:06:50.460> out<00:06:50.670> and<00:06:50.760> then<00:06:50.880> you've<00:06:51.000> got
