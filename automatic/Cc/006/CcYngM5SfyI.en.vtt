afraid because like I said this was my
first<00:03:12.410> time<00:03:12.739> so<00:03:13.040> I<00:03:13.220> didn't<00:03:13.790> bleach<00:03:14.030> it<00:03:14.209> twice

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
I shampooed it so the second time I

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.920

applied<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.519> bleach<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.940> hair<00:03:20.180> was<00:03:20.389> actually

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
applied the bleach the hair was actually

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.770 
applied the bleach the hair was actually
wet<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.400> didn't<00:03:22.850> leave<00:03:23.030> it<00:03:23.060> on<00:03:23.389> there<00:03:23.630> as

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
wet and I didn't leave it on there as

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.039 
wet and I didn't leave it on there as
long<00:03:24.109> so<00:03:24.650> it<00:03:25.010> didn't<00:03:25.430> process<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:26.269> same<00:03:26.540> way<00:03:26.870> a

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
long so it didn't process the same way a

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.440 
long so it didn't process the same way a
process<00:03:27.560> when<00:03:27.799> the<00:03:27.950> hair<00:03:28.220> was<00:03:28.489> dry<00:03:28.760> with<00:03:29.180> just

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
process when the hair was dry with just

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.930 
process when the hair was dry with just
oil<00:03:29.690> on<00:03:30.019> it<00:03:30.200> I<00:03:30.350> could<00:03:30.590> tell<00:03:31.040> through<00:03:31.370> filling

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
oil on it I could tell through filling

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.110 
oil on it I could tell through filling
the<00:03:32.150> aluminum<00:03:32.750> foil<00:03:32.989> it<00:03:33.260> wasn't<00:03:33.709> as<00:03:33.829> hot<00:03:34.160> as<00:03:34.430> it

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
the aluminum foil it wasn't as hot as it

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.479 
the aluminum foil it wasn't as hot as it
was<00:03:35.359> when<00:03:35.959> you<00:03:35.989> when<00:03:36.799> I<00:03:36.829> bleached<00:03:37.220> it<00:03:37.370> the

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
was when you when I bleached it the

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.059 
was when you when I bleached it the
first<00:03:37.730> time<00:03:37.970> so<00:03:38.030> you<00:03:38.840> guys<00:03:39.049> can<00:03:39.319> try<00:03:39.560> that<00:03:39.829> I

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
first time so you guys can try that I

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.069 
first time so you guys can try that I
don't<00:03:40.250> know<00:03:40.400> if<00:03:40.609> anyone<00:03:41.030> wants<00:03:41.720> to<00:03:41.750> try<00:03:42.019> it

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
don't know if anyone wants to try it

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.900 
don't know if anyone wants to try it
that<00:03:42.170> way<00:03:42.319> but<00:03:42.530> I<00:03:42.950> bleached<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.489> hair<00:03:43.700> while

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
that way but I bleached the hair while

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.240 
that way but I bleached the hair while
it<00:03:44.090> was<00:03:44.209> still<00:03:44.420> wet<00:03:44.480> and<00:03:45.049> I<00:03:45.290> think<00:03:45.709> that's<00:03:45.950> why

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
it was still wet and I think that's why

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.809 
it was still wet and I think that's why
it<00:03:46.639> is<00:03:47.030> acting<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.810> way<00:03:47.840> it<00:03:48.079> X<00:03:48.440> and<00:03:48.859> it's<00:03:49.579> not

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
it is acting the way it X and it's not

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.050 
it is acting the way it X and it's not
dry<00:03:50.120> so<00:03:50.540> it's<00:03:51.079> not<00:03:51.319> matting<00:03:51.859> up<00:03:52.040> or<00:03:52.310> tangling

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
dry so it's not matting up or tangling

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.479 
dry so it's not matting up or tangling
I<00:03:53.090> mean<00:03:53.720> yet<00:03:54.019> I<00:03:54.260> will<00:03:54.530> keep<00:03:54.739> you<00:03:54.920> guys<00:03:54.950> updated

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
I mean yet I will keep you guys updated

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:56.890 
I mean yet I will keep you guys updated
on<00:03:55.970> that

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
on that

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.930 
on that
as<00:03:57.140> far<00:03:57.530> as<00:03:57.560> shedding<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.190> hair<00:03:58.400> detach<00:03:58.700> it<00:03:58.910> a

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
as far as shedding the hair detach it a

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.500 
as far as shedding the hair detach it a
little<00:03:59.269> bit<00:03:59.540> when<00:04:00.500> I<00:04:00.530> was<00:04:01.390> constructing<00:04:02.390> it

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
little bit when I was constructing it

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.780 
little bit when I was constructing it
and<00:04:02.780> rinsing<00:04:03.410> it<00:04:03.530> out<00:04:03.680> because<00:04:04.129> I<00:04:04.190> had<00:04:04.519> bleach

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
and rinsing it out because I had bleach

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.759 
and rinsing it out because I had bleach
so<00:04:05.030> I<00:04:05.060> think<00:04:05.209> that<00:04:05.599> was<00:04:05.780> maybe<00:04:06.019> from<00:04:06.379> the<00:04:06.560> hair

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
so I think that was maybe from the hair

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.160 
so I think that was maybe from the hair
breaking<00:04:07.340> not<00:04:07.819> so<00:04:07.849> much<00:04:08.269> shedding<00:04:08.780> from<00:04:09.019> the

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
breaking not so much shedding from the

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.530 
breaking not so much shedding from the
whiffed<00:04:09.440> or<00:04:09.709> anything<00:04:09.920> like<00:04:10.280> that<00:04:10.340> but<00:04:10.940> as<00:04:11.510> far

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
whiffed or anything like that but as far

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.089 
whiffed or anything like that but as far
as<00:04:11.780> tangling<00:04:12.319> and<00:04:12.440> medica<00:04:12.800> I'm<00:04:12.920> not

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
as tangling and medica I'm not

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.309 
as tangling and medica I'm not
experiencing<00:04:13.849> it<00:04:14.060> just<00:04:14.660> a<00:04:14.780> little<00:04:14.959> bit<00:04:15.110> of

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
experiencing it just a little bit of

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.110 
experiencing it just a little bit of
