00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
can jump over the object really you

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.249 
can jump over the object really you
don't<00:01:31.090> exactly<00:01:31.359> want<00:01:31.630> to<00:01:31.719> land<00:01:31.899> on<00:01:32.020> your<00:01:32.109> butt

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
don't exactly want to land on your butt

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.649 
don't exactly want to land on your butt
so<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:32.920> stick<00:01:33.729> your<00:01:33.849> hands<00:01:34.029> down<00:01:34.299> underneath

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
so you stick your hands down underneath

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.359 
so you stick your hands down underneath
it<00:01:34.929> and<00:01:35.079> you<00:01:35.170> kind<00:01:35.409> of<00:01:35.469> push<00:01:35.679> off<00:01:35.889> you<00:01:36.039> can

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
it and you kind of push off you can

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.449 
it and you kind of push off you can
actually<00:01:36.490> make<00:01:36.819> your<00:01:36.999> way<00:01:37.090> over<00:01:37.119> it

00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:38.459 
actually make your way over it

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:40.649 
actually make your way over it
speedboat<00:01:39.639> it<00:01:39.849> is<00:01:39.939> like<00:01:40.149> a<00:01:40.179> hurdle<00:01:40.539> in<00:01:40.599> the

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
speedboat it is like a hurdle in the

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:42.179 
speedboat it is like a hurdle in the
sense<00:01:40.959> that<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:41.259> don't<00:01:41.380> exactly<00:01:41.649> jump<00:01:42.039> up

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
sense that you don't exactly jump up

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.800 
sense that you don't exactly jump up
because<00:01:42.399> usually<00:01:42.549> the<00:01:42.849> higher<00:01:43.029> you<00:01:43.270> jump<00:01:43.539> you

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
because usually the higher you jump you

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.179 
because usually the higher you jump you
lose<00:01:44.049> speed<00:01:44.380> there's<00:01:44.740> a<00:01:44.799> difference<00:01:45.130> between

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
lose speed there's a difference between

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.069 
lose speed there's a difference between
that<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:45.729> hurdles<00:01:46.060> that<00:01:46.149> gets<00:01:46.630> touch<00:01:46.869> it

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
that and the hurdles that gets touch it

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.879 
that and the hurdles that gets touch it
allowing<00:01:47.560> yourself<00:01:47.950> to<00:01:48.009> get<00:01:48.249> even<00:01:48.549> lower

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:49.889 
allowing yourself to get even lower

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:54.239 
allowing yourself to get even lower
lazy's<00:01:50.889> are<00:01:51.279> useful<00:01:52.409> because<00:01:53.409> they're<00:01:54.069> just

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:54.249 
lazy's are useful because they're just

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:56.190 
lazy's are useful because they're just
so<00:01:54.520> easy<00:01:54.819> to<00:01:54.969> do<00:01:55.209> you're<00:01:55.599> basically<00:01:56.109> just

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
so easy to do you're basically just

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.310 
so easy to do you're basically just
leaning<00:01:56.739> on<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.159> object

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
leaning on the object

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.320 
leaning on the object
and<00:01:58.410> letting<00:01:58.920> your<00:01:59.100> legs<00:01:59.340> over<00:01:59.520> there's<00:02:00.120> not

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
and letting your legs over there's not

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.080 
and letting your legs over there's not
much<00:02:00.510> force<00:02:00.900> involved<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.620> therefore<00:02:02.090> it's

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
much force involved in it therefore it's

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.250 
much force involved in it therefore it's
like<00:02:03.210> easy<00:02:03.480> to<00:02:03.780> jump<00:02:04.140> over<00:02:04.850> railings<00:02:06.260> walls

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
like easy to jump over railings walls

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.359 
like easy to jump over railings walls

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.330 
the position jammers land empire your
front<00:02:17.400> fits<00:02:17.670> but<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.150> kept<00:02:18.480> um<00:02:18.770> maybe<00:02:19.770> maybe<00:02:20.100> no

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
front fits but I kept um maybe maybe no

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.580 
front fits but I kept um maybe maybe no
maybe<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.850> just<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.600> do<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> landing<00:02:22.170> you

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
maybe you just you can do a landing you

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.130 
maybe you just you can do a landing you
jump<00:02:22.800> over<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.040> gap<00:02:23.250> your<00:02:23.760> whole<00:02:24.090> fit<00:02:24.360> or<00:02:24.600> your

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
jump over the gap your whole fit or your

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.910 
jump over the gap your whole fit or your
whole<00:02:25.380> body<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.860> already<00:02:26.610> going<00:02:27.920> that's

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
whole body is already going that's

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.640 
whole body is already going that's
basically<00:02:29.280> where<00:02:29.490> I<00:02:29.550> used<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.090> get<00:02:30.600> lower<00:02:31.170> in<00:02:31.530> a

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
basically where I used to get lower in a

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.949 
basically where I used to get lower in a
sense<00:02:31.860> before<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.400> even<00:02:32.850> really<00:02:33.000> get<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.480> what

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
sense before you even really get to what

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.080 
sense before you even really get to what
needs<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.320> jump<00:02:34.590> off<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.890> object<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:35.430> it

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
needs to jump off the object and it

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.300 
needs to jump off the object and it
really<00:02:36.330> takes<00:02:36.570> a<00:02:36.840> good<00:02:37.020> like<00:02:37.320> one<00:02:37.920> or<00:02:38.070> one<00:02:38.190> and

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
really takes a good like one or one and

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.790 
really takes a good like one or one and
a<00:02:38.370> half<00:02:38.550> meters<00:02:38.970> off<00:02:39.300> your<00:02:39.720> drop<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.410> creates

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
a half meters off your drop it creates

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.970 
a half meters off your drop it creates
like<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.190> huge<00:02:41.400> difference<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:42.240> impact<00:02:42.630> so<00:02:43.410> so

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
like a huge difference to impact so so

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.280 
like a huge difference to impact so so
it's<00:02:44.160> really<00:02:44.340> useful<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.940> cap<00:02:45.120> off<00:02:45.390> objects

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
it's really useful to cap off objects

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.830 
it's really useful to cap off objects
before<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.740> really<00:02:46.980> do<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.340> landing<00:02:47.750> this<00:02:48.750> is

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
before you really do the landing this is

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.000 
before you really do the landing this is
a<00:02:48.930> thing<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:49.140> I<00:02:49.290> found<00:02:49.470> about<00:02:49.770> popcorn

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
a thing that I found about popcorn

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.490 
a thing that I found about popcorn
