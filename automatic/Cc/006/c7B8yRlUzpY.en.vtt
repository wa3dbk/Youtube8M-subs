00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.630
 choose us is under the seat 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.150
 important here that the horse is from 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.270
 girlfriend has from behind and from the front 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.880
 actually after gives a kind of release 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.650
 each other does not try this 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.630
 and then that would actually not be enough 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.050
 see space are or have strength 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.290
 so that the foreleg is raised forwards 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.780
 bring 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.310
 two see Spanish paulus that are sailing more often 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.410
 believe the distance 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.220
 not enough meters of food making them 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:21.250
 and then three times yes we actually fit 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:23.710
 they only pass who lost oh basis of 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.180
 the siphon very important I think hard 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.340
 partying the hinges 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.430
 but such things as soon as things don't 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.040
 button in it seems 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.070
 exercise just not performed correctly 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.229
 well of course that horse on the edge here 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.509
 French only has learned is it 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.540
 easier to say it under the saddle 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.460
 but also to learn 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.560
 be a trainer and when will you be there? 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.500
 then under the saddle 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.479
 we do not go with the pill he sees whole 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.990
 often given that spanish french ehlhart 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.490
 is becoming 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.860
 yes what happens and that's why you bring it 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.470
 blowing out of the country and taking it with you 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.960
 expect him to be better so hopefully 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.790
 just vibrate with you understandably 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.390
 figuring out 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:11.170
 so we actually boost so much actually 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.810
 with wind, we were among the audience also drive 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.920
 in the Spanish stage members sit citan 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.800
 and we try it in one 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.630
 sweetheart to indicate in circles and one 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.630
 to close a new field but the hgw 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.170
 second also often on span 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.110
 we want again 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:48.049
 then you actually have to 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.250
 stay here 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.300
 a driftwood no longer just a little 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.300
 did wait 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.770
 here 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.510
 get in the pulse 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.510
 oh my god no 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.600
 of doing 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.980
 look lock again 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.479
 your horse gives 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:51.530
 to spend too much more in projects 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.990
 with playing aids 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.629
 is just i had tweezers i close it 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:03.259
 optimum horse professions and then varik 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:06.500
 right left right not many little ones 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:08.000
 it helps you so that they are in professions 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.979
 completely through 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.229
 and you actually keep an idea on the 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:14.810
 normal way horse closing and impulse 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.400
 indicate as you stated in the base 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.199
 dressage also does 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.460
 and then at some point you know 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:21.969
 takes it all very well from each other 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.969
 to distinguish 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:42.900
 and I live legs to decide within 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.940
 gliding smart le look 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.440
 let them put themselves in fine posture 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.759
 we need 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.280
 I don't always want to say as one 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:56.610
 tail nothing pulls up and you say 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:07:00.620
 is not said come come come from that 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.620
 street needs amounts 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:19.470
 video now 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:21.210
 just do not stay off idea 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:28.970
 the when living under pressure that 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:33.199
 connected, you remain behind 

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:36.080
 if that poor one is n't going to transport you too 

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:38.090
 never come right 

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.319
 of course those four pass we want to take out 

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:43.630
 development 

00:07:39.319 --> 00:07:43.630
 are you actually wanting that 

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:51.910
 from the Spanish pass under the saddle 

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:51.910
 back to basics
