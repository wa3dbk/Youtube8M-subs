particles in there settled out out of

particles in there settled out out of
out<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.040> the<00:00:50.250> air<00:00:50.370> really<00:00:50.579> slowly<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.360> even

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
out of the air really slowly and even

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.170 
out of the air really slowly and even
some<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.440> them<00:00:52.560> it<00:00:52.800> takes<00:00:52.950> 36<00:00:53.460> hours<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.030> get<00:00:54.120> to

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
some of them it takes 36 hours to get to

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.670 
some of them it takes 36 hours to get to
the<00:00:54.390> floor<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.840> by<00:00:54.960> then<00:00:55.140> you've<00:00:55.290> already

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
the floor and by then you've already

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.190 
the floor and by then you've already
changed<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.400> stall<00:00:56.640> again<00:00:56.970> so<00:00:57.239> there's<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.050> lot

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
changed the stall again so there's a lot

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.720 
changed the stall again so there's a lot
of<00:00:58.320> things<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.739> horses<00:00:59.130> breathing<00:00:59.700> zone

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
of things in the horses breathing zone

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.050 
of things in the horses breathing zone
that<00:01:00.660> can<00:01:00.720> irritate<00:01:01.290> his<00:01:01.920> airway<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.670> not

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
that can irritate his airway and not

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.910 
that can irritate his airway and not
every<00:01:03.480> court<00:01:03.750> courses<00:01:04.140> are<00:01:04.259> not<00:01:04.410> all<00:01:04.649> created

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
every court courses are not all created

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.400 
every court courses are not all created
equal<00:01:05.520> so<00:01:06.090> some<00:01:06.330> horses<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.780> no<00:01:06.930> problems

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
equal so some horses have no problems

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.830 
equal so some horses have no problems
but<00:01:07.920> other<00:01:08.160> horses<00:01:08.520> when<00:01:08.940> they<00:01:09.090> inhale<00:01:09.509> enough

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
but other horses when they inhale enough

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.420 
but other horses when they inhale enough
of<00:01:10.020> these<00:01:10.170> type<00:01:10.410> of<00:01:10.590> particles<00:01:11.420> may<00:01:12.420> develop

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
of these type of particles may develop

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.590 
of these type of particles may develop
irritation<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.550> the<00:01:14.640> lower<00:01:14.790> airway<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.479> we

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
irritation of the lower airway and we

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.389 
irritation of the lower airway and we
think<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:15.930> extra<00:01:16.410> mucus<00:01:16.619> may<00:01:17.040> come<00:01:17.250> about

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
think that extra mucus may come about

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.140 
think that extra mucus may come about
that<00:01:18.149> may<00:01:18.330> be<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.810> reasons

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.770 

we<00:01:23.150> can

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
we can

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.620 
we can
treatment<00:01:24.520> either<00:01:25.520> by<00:01:25.909> giving<00:01:26.330> drugs

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
treatment either by giving drugs

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.590 
treatment either by giving drugs
systemically<00:01:27.440> so<00:01:27.979> that<00:01:28.130> means<00:01:28.369> I<00:01:28.700> give<00:01:29.420> that

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
systemically so that means I give that

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.930 
systemically so that means I give that
him<00:01:29.780> to<00:01:30.020> him<00:01:30.200> orally<00:01:30.650> and<00:01:30.860> most<00:01:31.070> horses<00:01:31.369> aren't

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
him to him orally and most horses aren't

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.880 
him to him orally and most horses aren't
all<00:01:32.060> that<00:01:32.270> excited<00:01:32.750> about<00:01:32.810> eating<00:01:33.619> something

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
all that excited about eating something

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.620 
all that excited about eating something
that<00:01:34.040> doesn't<00:01:34.400> taste<00:01:34.580> very<00:01:34.700> good<00:01:35.119> so<00:01:35.330> you<00:01:35.360> have

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
that doesn't taste very good so you have

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.230 
that doesn't taste very good so you have
to<00:01:35.750> talk<00:01:36.350> to<00:01:36.380> him<00:01:36.590> about<00:01:36.710> giving<00:01:37.100> orally<00:01:37.640> you

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
to talk to him about giving orally you

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.790 
to talk to him about giving orally you
can<00:01:38.420> give<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:38.720> by<00:01:39.020> an<00:01:39.350> intramuscular

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
can give it by an intramuscular

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.940 
can give it by an intramuscular
injection<00:01:40.759> or<00:01:40.909> a<00:01:41.060> subcutaneous<00:01:41.540> injection<00:01:42.080> or

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
injection or a subcutaneous injection or

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.040 
injection or a subcutaneous injection or
an<00:01:43.070> intravenous<00:01:43.580> injection<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:44.360> that's<00:01:44.840> all

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
an intravenous injection and that's all

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.380 
an intravenous injection and that's all
well<00:01:45.259> and<00:01:45.409> good<00:01:45.500> but<00:01:45.680> it<00:01:45.979> requires<00:01:46.460> you<00:01:47.270> know

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
well and good but it requires you know

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.109 
well and good but it requires you know
it's<00:01:47.509> an<00:01:47.570> invasive<00:01:47.899> procedure<00:01:48.350> and<00:01:49.119> most

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
it's an invasive procedure and most

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.850 
it's an invasive procedure and most
horses<00:01:50.509> will<00:01:50.780> eventually<00:01:51.259> object<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.740> these

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
horses will eventually object to these

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.999 
horses will eventually object to these
things<00:01:52.100> over<00:01:52.970> time<00:01:53.210> so<00:01:53.899> as<00:01:54.440> we're<00:01:54.830> usually

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
things over time so as we're usually

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.859 
things over time so as we're usually
trying<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.549> treat<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:55.910> lungs<00:01:56.179> and<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.570> and

trying to treat the lungs and the and

the<00:01:57.020> trachea<00:01:57.619> or<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.890> all<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.429> structures

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
the trachea or the all the structures

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.490 
the trachea or the all the structures
that<00:01:59.030> carry<00:01:59.300> air<00:02:00.289> from<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.160> nostril<00:02:02.259> all<00:02:03.259> the

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
that carry air from the nostril all the

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.499 
that carry air from the nostril all the
way<00:02:03.619> back<00:02:03.890> into<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.429> horses<00:02:04.729> lung<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.270> it's<00:02:05.390> a

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
way back into the horses lung and it's a

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.690 
way back into the horses lung and it's a
long<00:02:05.840> you<00:02:06.440> know<00:02:06.470> this<00:02:06.710> is<00:02:06.860> this<00:02:07.009> is<00:02:07.159> a<00:02:07.190> the

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
long you know this is this is a the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.729 
long you know this is this is a the
horse's<00:02:08.030> head<00:02:08.179> is<00:02:08.360> big<00:02:08.600> so<00:02:08.869> air<00:02:09.259> is<00:02:09.319> being

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
horse's head is big so air is being

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.550 
horse's head is big so air is being
humidified<00:02:10.429> as<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:11.150> moves<00:02:11.420> back<00:02:12.200> through<00:02:12.440> his

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
humidified as it moves back through his

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.820 
humidified as it moves back through his
nasal<00:02:12.980> passages<00:02:13.580> down<00:02:14.510> his<00:02:14.810> trachea<00:02:15.110> all<00:02:15.560> the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
nasal passages down his trachea all the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.559 
nasal passages down his trachea all the
way<00:02:15.920> down<00:02:16.100> the<00:02:16.250> trachea<00:02:16.700> all<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.209> way<00:02:17.330> back

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
way down the trachea all the way back

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.140 
way down the trachea all the way back
here<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.769> lungs<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.430> lungs<00:02:19.610> are<00:02:19.910> sort

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
here to the lungs and the lungs are sort

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.940 
here to the lungs and the lungs are sort
of<00:02:20.239> in<00:02:20.420> this<00:02:21.640> configuration<00:02:23.319> so<00:02:24.319> horses<00:02:24.800> have

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
of in this configuration so horses have

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.880 
of in this configuration so horses have
a<00:02:25.130> lot<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.400> lung<00:02:25.790> capacity<00:02:26.569> but<00:02:27.230> it's<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.620> long

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
a lot of lung capacity but it's a long

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.819 
a lot of lung capacity but it's a long
way<00:02:28.220> between<00:02:28.760> here<00:02:29.450> and<00:02:29.480> here<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.290> so

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
way between here and here and so

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.370 
way between here and here and so
surprisingly<00:02:31.820> little<00:02:32.329> dust<00:02:32.630> particles<00:02:33.230> and

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
surprisingly little dust particles and

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.680 
surprisingly little dust particles and
very<00:02:33.709> small<00:02:34.070> particles<00:02:34.670> that<00:02:34.760> are<00:02:34.850> as<00:02:35.180> we<00:02:35.329> call

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
very small particles that are as we call

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.120 
very small particles that are as we call
them<00:02:35.840> respire<00:02:36.290> about<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.650> means<00:02:36.799> they<00:02:36.950> can

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
them respire about that means they can

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.680 
them respire about that means they can
stay<00:02:37.760> in<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.000> air<00:02:38.030> while<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.450> horses

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
stay in the air while the horses

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.870 
stay in the air while the horses
breathing<00:02:39.230> they<00:02:39.680> can<00:02:39.860> actually<00:02:40.220> get<00:02:40.459> all<00:02:40.700> the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
breathing they can actually get all the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.690 
breathing they can actually get all the
way<00:02:41.180> down<00:02:41.480> here<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.470> can<00:02:42.709> drugs<00:02:43.010> that<00:02:43.579> we

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
way down here and so can drugs that we

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.130 
way down here and so can drugs that we
some<00:02:44.030> drugs<00:02:44.329> that<00:02:44.420> we<00:02:44.600> can<00:02:44.750> give<00:02:44.930> by

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
some drugs that we can give by

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.410 
some drugs that we can give by
inhalation<00:02:45.459> so<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.549> idea<00:02:46.850> is<00:02:47.090> if<00:02:47.299> you're

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
inhalation so the idea is if you're

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.600 
inhalation so the idea is if you're
treating<00:02:47.750> by<00:02:47.870> inhalation<00:02:48.170> for<00:02:49.070> a<00:02:49.100> problem<00:02:49.400> in

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
treating by inhalation for a problem in

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.740 
treating by inhalation for a problem in
the<00:02:49.700> lungs<00:02:49.880> you're<00:02:50.150> treating<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:50.570> lungs

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
the lungs you're treating the lungs

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.920 
the lungs you're treating the lungs
directly<00:02:51.440> rather<00:02:52.100> than<00:02:52.340> giving<00:02:53.239> putting<00:02:53.660> the

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
directly rather than giving putting the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.990 
directly rather than giving putting the
the<00:02:54.260> drug<00:02:54.739> in<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:54.980> muscle<00:02:55.370> waiting<00:02:55.760> for<00:02:55.940> the

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
the drug in the muscle waiting for the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.550 
the drug in the muscle waiting for the
blood<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.329> pick<00:02:56.510> it<00:02:56.630> up<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:56.900> then<00:02:57.079> take<00:02:57.350> it<00:02:57.380> to

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
blood to pick it up and then take it to

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.800 
blood to pick it up and then take it to
the<00:02:57.769> lungs

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.040 

this<00:03:02.800> product<00:03:03.459> is<00:03:03.610> called<00:03:03.880> an<00:03:04.150> arrow<00:03:04.390> mask<00:03:04.720> and

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
this product is called an arrow mask and

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.370 
this product is called an arrow mask and
it<00:03:05.620> is<00:03:06.209> designed<00:03:07.209> specifically<00:03:07.840> for<00:03:07.930> use<00:03:08.230> in

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
it is designed specifically for use in

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.500 
it is designed specifically for use in
horses<00:03:08.770> it<00:03:08.920> comes<00:03:09.130> in<00:03:09.340> three<00:03:09.580> different<00:03:09.700> sizes

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
horses it comes in three different sizes

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.210 
horses it comes in three different sizes
and<00:03:10.720> it<00:03:11.290> has<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.530> number<00:03:12.010> of<00:03:12.040> different

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
and it has a number of different

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.550 
and it has a number of different
components<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.180> can<00:03:13.870> see<00:03:14.020> it's<00:03:14.170> got<00:03:14.349> this

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
components you can see it's got this

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.250 
components you can see it's got this
rubber<00:03:15.160> area<00:03:15.819> that<00:03:16.239> fits<00:03:16.540> over<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.840> horse's

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
rubber area that fits over the horse's

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.080 
rubber area that fits over the horse's
nose<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:17.770> the<00:03:17.830> idea<00:03:18.099> is<00:03:18.340> that<00:03:18.370> that<00:03:18.610> makes<00:03:18.940> a

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
nose and the idea is that that makes a

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.030 
nose and the idea is that that makes a
little<00:03:19.239> bit<00:03:19.450> of<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.599> seal<00:03:19.900> when<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.800> horse

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
little bit of a seal when the horse

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.339 
little bit of a seal when the horse
breathes<00:03:21.400> in<00:03:21.880> air<00:03:22.269> comes<00:03:22.900> through<00:03:23.200> these

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
breathes in air comes through these

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.440 
breathes in air comes through these
valves<00:03:23.920> so<00:03:24.280> he's<00:03:24.430> not<00:03:24.550> going<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:24.730> suffocate<00:03:25.120> in

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
valves so he's not going to suffocate in

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.530 
valves so he's not going to suffocate in
there<00:03:25.660> and<00:03:25.840> this<00:03:26.260> thing<00:03:26.319> is<00:03:26.890> it<00:03:27.099> is<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:28.120> the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
there and this thing is it is the the

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.589 
there and this thing is it is the the
spacer<00:03:29.349> where<00:03:29.890> we<00:03:29.980> can<00:03:30.130> actually<00:03:30.310> put

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
spacer where we can actually put

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.259 
spacer where we can actually put
medication<00:03:31.599> so<00:03:32.290> this<00:03:33.220> is<00:03:33.370> a<00:03:33.400> very<00:03:33.670> versatile

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
medication so this is a very versatile

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:35.940 
medication so this is a very versatile
piece<00:03:34.480> of<00:03:34.540> equipment<00:03:34.780> it<00:03:35.319> can<00:03:35.470> be<00:03:35.590> used<00:03:35.830> for

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
piece of equipment it can be used for

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.400 
piece of equipment it can be used for
inhalation<00:03:36.610> therapy<00:03:37.180> it<00:03:37.630> can<00:03:37.810> also<00:03:37.989> be<00:03:38.260> used

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
inhalation therapy it can also be used

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.680 
inhalation therapy it can also be used
for<00:03:38.560> nebulizing<00:03:39.130> therapy<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:39.970> there's<00:03:40.450> some

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
for nebulizing therapy and there's some

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.940 
for nebulizing therapy and there's some
potential<00:03:41.170> that<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.380> could<00:03:41.410> be<00:03:41.590> used<00:03:41.799> if

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
potential that it could be used if

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.300 
potential that it could be used if
you're<00:03:42.130> if<00:03:42.489> you<00:03:42.640> were<00:03:42.730> trying<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.120> use<00:03:43.420> a<00:03:44.310> dry

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
you're if you were trying to use a dry

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.309 
you're if you were trying to use a dry
powder<00:03:45.670> to<00:03:46.510> treat<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:46.780> horse

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
powder to treat a horse

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.320 
powder to treat a horse
the<00:03:47.620> idea<00:03:47.950> is<00:03:48.160> that<00:03:48.190> this<00:03:48.519> thing<00:03:48.790> fits<00:03:49.060> fairly

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
the idea is that this thing fits fairly

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.729 
the idea is that this thing fits fairly
securely<00:03:49.989> and<00:03:50.230> we<00:03:50.319> would<00:03:50.470> probably<00:03:52.290> fit<00:03:53.290> more

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
securely and we would probably fit more

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.339 
securely and we would probably fit more
securely<00:03:54.190> on<00:03:54.459> his<00:03:54.670> nose<00:03:54.940> so<00:03:55.690> that<00:03:55.840> we<00:03:55.959> have<00:03:56.170> us

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
securely on his nose so that we have us

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.009 
securely on his nose so that we have us
sort<00:03:56.620> of<00:03:56.709> almost<00:03:56.860> a<00:03:57.190> seal<00:03:57.489> here<00:03:58.030> now<00:03:58.750> it's<00:03:58.900> not

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
sort of almost a seal here now it's not

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.479 
sort of almost a seal here now it's not
bothering<00:03:59.590> him<00:03:59.739> because<00:04:00.010> when<00:04:00.130> he<00:04:00.190> breathes

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
bothering him because when he breathes

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.670 
bothering him because when he breathes
in<00:04:00.730> air<00:04:01.030> goes<00:04:01.269> in<00:04:01.450> here<00:04:01.720> and<00:04:01.870> comes<00:04:02.380> out<00:04:02.620> here

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
in air goes in here and comes out here

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.150 
in air goes in here and comes out here
now<00:04:03.610> if<00:04:04.090> you<00:04:04.299> have<00:04:04.569> ever<00:04:04.690> had<00:04:05.410> to<00:04:05.590> use<00:04:05.829> a

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
now if you have ever had to use a

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.979 
now if you have ever had to use a
preparation<00:04:06.790> yourself<00:04:07.450> that<00:04:07.660> had<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:07.900> be

preparation yourself that had to be
inhaled<00:04:08.380> you<00:04:08.739> probably<00:04:09.070> remember<00:04:09.459> that<00:04:09.489> the

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
inhaled you probably remember that the

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.560 
inhaled you probably remember that the

yourself<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:13.989> medication<00:04:14.320> when<00:04:14.560> you're

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
yourself a medication when you're

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.469 
yourself a medication when you're
breathing<00:04:15.040> in<00:04:15.220> even<00:04:16.000> when<00:04:16.120> you're<00:04:16.239> trying<00:04:16.390> to

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
treat yourself that way that's hard

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.099 
treat yourself that way that's hard
never<00:04:18.789> mind<00:04:19.060> trying<00:04:19.359> to<00:04:19.419> guess<00:04:19.720> when<00:04:20.019> the

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
never mind trying to guess when the

never mind trying to guess when the

horse is going to inhale

so<00:04:22.840> this<00:04:23.169> spacer<00:04:23.740> is<00:04:23.919> designed<00:04:24.340> so<00:04:24.669> that<00:04:24.700> the

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
so this spacer is designed so that the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.529 
so this spacer is designed so that the
end<00:04:25.150> will<00:04:26.020> call<00:04:26.380> out<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:27.039> any<00:04:27.640> atomizer<00:04:28.300> that

end will call out to any atomizer that

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.460 
end will call out to any atomizer that
you<00:04:28.810> could<00:04:28.960> buy<00:04:29.140> at<00:04:29.320> a<00:04:29.380> pharmacy<00:04:29.919> and<00:04:31.470> that

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
you could buy at a pharmacy and that

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.050 
you could buy at a pharmacy and that
makes<00:04:32.740> it<00:04:32.860> really<00:04:33.010> easy<00:04:33.130> because<00:04:33.610> we<00:04:33.850> can<00:04:34.030> just

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
makes it really easy because we can just

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.409 
makes it really easy because we can just
script<00:04:34.570> out<00:04:34.750> the<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.350> drug<00:04:35.620> and<00:04:36.090> attach<00:04:37.090> the

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
script out the the drug and attach the

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.980 
script out the the drug and attach the
little<00:04:37.660> atomizer<00:04:38.229> right<00:04:38.830> to<00:04:39.280> this<00:04:39.460> thing

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
little atomizer right to this thing

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.020 
little atomizer right to this thing
actuate<00:04:40.990> it<00:04:41.139> whenever<00:04:41.680> we<00:04:41.860> want<00:04:42.010> say<00:04:42.550> 2<00:04:42.610> or<00:04:42.760> 3

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
actuate it whenever we want say 2 or 3

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.210 
actuate it whenever we want say 2 or 3
puffs<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.570> medication<00:04:44.229> stays<00:04:44.530> here<00:04:45.010> until

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
puffs the medication stays here until

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.850 
puffs the medication stays here until
the<00:04:45.850> horse<00:04:46.030> breeds<00:04:46.419> in<00:04:46.660> there's<00:04:47.289> a<00:04:47.380> one-way

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
the horse breeds in there's a one-way

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.469 
the horse breeds in there's a one-way
valve<00:04:47.889> in<00:04:48.370> here<00:04:48.580> it<00:04:48.669> doesn't<00:04:48.940> go<00:04:49.000> anywhere<00:04:49.300> if

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
valve in here it doesn't go anywhere if

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.330 
valve in here it doesn't go anywhere if
the<00:04:49.570> horse<00:04:49.780> exhales<00:04:50.260> but<00:04:50.410> when<00:04:50.560> he<00:04:50.620> inhales<00:04:51.130> he

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
the horse exhales but when he inhales he

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.210 
the horse exhales but when he inhales he
inhales<00:04:51.789> all<00:04:52.090> of<00:04:52.630> that<00:04:52.810> air<00:04:53.110> and<00:04:53.380> then<00:04:53.770> then

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
inhales all of that air and then then

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.980 
inhales all of that air and then then
the<00:04:54.340> medication<00:04:54.729> travels<00:04:55.360> down<00:04:55.539> this<00:04:55.690> long

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
the medication travels down this long

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.810 
the medication travels down this long
route<00:04:56.260> and<00:04:56.440> for<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:56.620> one<00:04:56.800> with<00:04:57.310> a<00:04:57.340> horse<00:04:57.639> you

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
route and for the one with a horse you

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.820 
route and for the one with a horse you
might<00:04:58.000> have<00:04:58.150> to<00:04:58.270> give<00:04:58.389> say<00:04:58.660> 10<00:04:58.990> puffs<00:04:59.350> on<00:04:59.710> the

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
might have to give say 10 puffs on the

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.590 
might have to give say 10 puffs on the
human<00:05:00.130> atomizer<00:05:00.550> so<00:05:00.850> you<00:05:00.910> would<00:05:01.090> wait<00:05:01.300> for<00:05:01.479> him

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
human atomizer so you would wait for him

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.629 
human atomizer so you would wait for him
to<00:05:01.690> breathe<00:05:01.930> in<00:05:02.110> and<00:05:02.350> then<00:05:02.470> put<00:05:03.010> more<00:05:03.220> in<00:05:03.430> and

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
to breathe in and then put more in and

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.610 
to breathe in and then put more in and
because<00:05:04.030> a<00:05:04.240> little<00:05:04.630> bit<00:05:04.780> dilution<00:05:05.289> in<00:05:05.380> the<00:05:05.470> air

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
because a little bit dilution in the air

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.140 
because a little bit dilution in the air
is<00:05:05.830> good<00:05:06.039> rather<00:05:06.250> than<00:05:06.490> so<00:05:06.729> much<00:05:06.880> that

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
is good rather than so much that

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.700 
is good rather than so much that
sediment

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
sediment

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.620 
sediment
right<00:05:08.160> here<00:05:08.460> but<00:05:08.880> that's<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.180> beauty<00:05:09.480> of<00:05:09.510> the

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
right here but that's the beauty of the

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.330 
right here but that's the beauty of the
spacer<00:05:10.110> with<00:05:10.620> this<00:05:10.830> one

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
spacer with this one

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.000 
spacer with this one
you<00:05:11.820> basically<00:05:12.170> co-opted<00:05:13.170> this<00:05:13.410> right<00:05:13.680> on<00:05:13.860> the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
you basically co-opted this right on the

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.570 
you basically co-opted this right on the
nostril<00:05:14.550> like<00:05:14.730> that<00:05:14.970> and<00:05:15.240> then<00:05:16.340> actuate<00:05:17.340> and

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
nostril like that and then actuate and

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.880 
nostril like that and then actuate and
let<00:05:17.760> the<00:05:17.850> horse<00:05:18.060> breathe<00:05:18.360> in<00:05:18.570> now<00:05:19.470> this<00:05:19.650> works

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
let the horse breathe in now this works

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.950 
let the horse breathe in now this works
pretty<00:05:20.130> well<00:05:20.280> but<00:05:20.670> you<00:05:21.270> have<00:05:21.420> to<00:05:21.570> be<00:05:21.690> really

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
pretty well but you have to be really

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.300 
pretty well but you have to be really
careful<00:05:22.170> that<00:05:22.500> you<00:05:22.590> stay<00:05:22.770> right<00:05:22.950> over<00:05:23.010> the

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
careful that you stay right over the

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.430 
careful that you stay right over the
nostril<00:05:23.790> and<00:05:23.910> you<00:05:24.180> don't<00:05:24.360> do<00:05:24.510> that<00:05:24.540> or<00:05:25.140> that

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
nostril and you don't do that or that

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.320 
nostril and you don't do that or that
because<00:05:25.740> if<00:05:25.920> you<00:05:25.950> do<00:05:26.160> you'll<00:05:26.520> lose<00:05:26.730> you'll

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
because if you do you'll lose you'll

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.540 
because if you do you'll lose you'll
lose<00:05:27.540> the<00:05:27.690> medication<00:05:28.290> and<00:05:28.620> you<00:05:28.860> can<00:05:29.010> also<00:05:29.160> see

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
lose the medication and you can also see

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.330 
lose the medication and you can also see
that<00:05:29.580> that<00:05:30.080> there's<00:05:31.080> not<00:05:31.260> a<00:05:31.290> very<00:05:31.560> big<00:05:31.740> chamber

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
that that there's not a very big chamber

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.340 
that that there's not a very big chamber
here<00:05:32.670> so<00:05:33.210> you<00:05:33.930> basically<00:05:34.290> have<00:05:35.810> to<00:05:36.810> be<00:05:36.840> careful

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
here so you basically have to be careful

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.050 
here so you basically have to be careful
how<00:05:37.470> you<00:05:37.500> align<00:05:37.950> this<00:05:38.190> with<00:05:38.400> a<00:05:38.430> horse's<00:05:38.700> airway

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
how you align this with a horse's airway

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.420 
how you align this with a horse's airway
but<00:05:39.240> this<00:05:39.450> is<00:05:39.600> a<00:05:39.630> much<00:05:39.900> less<00:05:40.140> expensive<00:05:40.430> item

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
but this is a much less expensive item

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.240 
but this is a much less expensive item
there's<00:05:41.880> a<00:05:41.970> third<00:05:42.270> product<00:05:42.690> it<00:05:42.840> has<00:05:43.020> a<00:05:43.530> small

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
there's a third product it has a small

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.910 
there's a third product it has a small
chamber<00:05:44.970> that<00:05:45.600> collapse<00:05:46.110> over<00:05:46.470> one<00:05:46.650> nostril

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
chamber that collapse over one nostril

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.290 
chamber that collapse over one nostril
but<00:05:47.340> there's<00:05:47.490> a<00:05:47.580> little<00:05:47.700> bit<00:05:47.880> of<00:05:47.910> a<00:05:48.000> chamber

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
but there's a little bit of a chamber

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.260 
but there's a little bit of a chamber
and<00:05:48.720> then<00:05:49.110> a<00:05:49.410> spacer<00:05:50.130> out<00:05:50.160> here<00:05:50.670> and<00:05:50.880> that<00:05:51.060> one

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
and then a spacer out here and that one

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.650 
and then a spacer out here and that one
is<00:05:51.960> also<00:05:52.410> less<00:05:52.890> expensive<00:05:52.920> than<00:05:53.670> the<00:05:53.820> mask<00:05:54.060> but

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
is also less expensive than the mask but

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.159 
is also less expensive than the mask but
I<00:05:55.110> think<00:05:55.620> quite<00:05:55.830> useful

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
I think quite useful

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.350 
I think quite useful
so<00:05:58.889> you<00:05:58.949> might<00:05:59.159> say<00:05:59.340> what<00:05:59.550> kind<00:05:59.759> of<00:05:59.819> drugs<00:06:00.120> can

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
so you might say what kind of drugs can

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.899 
so you might say what kind of drugs can
I<00:06:00.449> put<00:06:00.659> in<00:06:00.810> there<00:06:01.020> well<00:06:01.460> when<00:06:02.460> you're<00:06:02.580> treating

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:02.909 
I put in there well when you're treating

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:05.809 
I put in there well when you're treating
inflammatory<00:06:03.449> airway<00:06:04.169> disease<00:06:04.379> and<00:06:04.819> extra

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:05.819 
inflammatory airway disease and extra

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:07.879 
inflammatory airway disease and extra
mucus<00:06:05.969> in<00:06:06.330> the<00:06:06.419> airways<00:06:06.870> there<00:06:07.650> are<00:06:07.710> two

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
mucus in the airways there are two

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:09.679 
mucus in the airways there are two
things<00:06:08.099> that<00:06:08.249> you're<00:06:08.430> trying<00:06:08.580> to<00:06:08.849> do<00:06:08.999> you're

00:06:09.679 --> 00:06:09.689 
things that you're trying to do you're

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:11.929 
things that you're trying to do you're
trying<00:06:09.719> to<00:06:10.169> reduce<00:06:10.650> inflammation<00:06:11.039> and<00:06:11.699> you're

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:11.939 
trying to reduce inflammation and you're

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.719 
trying to reduce inflammation and you're
trying<00:06:12.270> to<00:06:12.389> open<00:06:12.840> the<00:06:13.229> Airways<00:06:13.650> so<00:06:14.400> the<00:06:14.580> two

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
trying to open the Airways so the two

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:16.550 
trying to open the Airways so the two
types<00:06:14.999> of<00:06:15.210> drugs<00:06:15.479> that<00:06:15.569> we<00:06:15.749> use<00:06:15.779> our<00:06:16.199> drugs

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
types of drugs that we use our drugs

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.429 
types of drugs that we use our drugs
that<00:06:16.740> will<00:06:16.830> bronchodilator<00:06:17.840> uggs<00:06:18.840> that<00:06:19.259> will

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:19.439 
that will bronchodilator uggs that will

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:21.080 
that will bronchodilator uggs that will
cause<00:06:19.860> suppression<00:06:20.580> of<00:06:20.639> the<00:06:20.789> inflammation

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
cause suppression of the inflammation

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.390 
cause suppression of the inflammation
now<00:06:22.020> we'd<00:06:22.229> want<00:06:22.439> to<00:06:22.529> be<00:06:22.620> very<00:06:22.800> sure<00:06:22.919> the<00:06:23.189> horse

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
now we'd want to be very sure the horse

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.129 
now we'd want to be very sure the horse
didn't<00:06:23.639> have<00:06:23.759> an<00:06:23.849> infection<00:06:24.419> because<00:06:25.020> we

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 
didn't have an infection because we

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.260 
didn't have an infection because we
don't<00:06:25.289> want<00:06:25.499> to<00:06:25.590> treat<00:06:25.800> we<00:06:26.400> need<00:06:26.759> to<00:06:26.849> treat<00:06:26.999> an

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
don't want to treat we need to treat an

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.059 
don't want to treat we need to treat an
infection<00:06:27.719> if<00:06:27.810> it<00:06:27.900> exists<00:06:28.319> but<00:06:28.439> most<00:06:28.770> horses

00:06:29.059 --> 00:06:29.069 
infection if it exists but most horses

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:30.920 
infection if it exists but most horses
with<00:06:29.249> inflammatory<00:06:29.550> airway<00:06:30.120> disease<00:06:30.419> do<00:06:30.750> not

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
with inflammatory airway disease do not

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.100 
with inflammatory airway disease do not
have<00:06:31.199> primarily<00:06:31.710> infectious<00:06:32.400> disease<00:06:32.759> so<00:06:33.689> the

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.110 
have primarily infectious disease so the

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.290 
have primarily infectious disease so the
drugs<00:06:35.069> that<00:06:35.219> open<00:06:35.639> the<00:06:35.759> Airways<00:06:36.090> the

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
drugs that open the Airways the

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.179 
drugs that open the Airways the
bronchodilators<00:06:36.710> there<00:06:37.710> are<00:06:37.830> a<00:06:37.860> number<00:06:38.039> of

00:06:38.179 --> 00:06:38.189 
bronchodilators there are a number of

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:40.279 
bronchodilators there are a number of
them<00:06:38.460> and<00:06:38.610> they<00:06:38.699> can<00:06:38.759> be<00:06:38.969> I<00:06:39.449> usually<00:06:40.110> recommend

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
them and they can be I usually recommend

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:41.809 
them and they can be I usually recommend
that<00:06:40.770> that<00:06:40.919> you<00:06:40.979> give<00:06:41.159> that<00:06:41.370> one<00:06:41.520> first

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:41.819 
that that you give that one first

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:44.300 
that that you give that one first
because<00:06:42.449> then<00:06:42.779> it<00:06:42.900> opens<00:06:43.319> the<00:06:43.469> air<00:06:43.860> passage

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
because then it opens the air passage

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.820 
because then it opens the air passage
tubes<00:06:44.759> and<00:06:45.120> then<00:06:45.900> after<00:06:46.379> you've<00:06:46.500> given<00:06:46.620> the

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
tubes and then after you've given the

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.679 
tubes and then after you've given the
bronchodilator<00:06:47.550> you<00:06:47.699> wait<00:06:47.969> about<00:06:48.120> a<00:06:48.270> half<00:06:48.539> an

00:06:48.679 --> 00:06:48.689 
bronchodilator you wait about a half an

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:51.829 
bronchodilator you wait about a half an
hour<00:06:48.840> for<00:06:49.469> that<00:06:50.270> treatment<00:06:51.270> to<00:06:51.330> take<00:06:51.509> effect

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:51.839 
hour for that treatment to take effect

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:55.550 
hour for that treatment to take effect
and<00:06:52.110> then<00:06:52.620> you<00:06:53.509> take<00:06:54.509> your<00:06:54.560> corticosteroid

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 
and then you take your corticosteroid

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.469 
and then you take your corticosteroid
and<00:06:55.830> treat<00:06:56.430> the<00:06:56.550> horse<00:06:56.699> and<00:06:57.240> the

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 
and treat the horse and the

00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:59.329 
and treat the horse and the
corticosteroid<00:06:57.900> we<00:06:58.560> think<00:06:58.860> gets<00:06:59.099> better

00:06:59.329 --> 00:06:59.339 
corticosteroid we think gets better

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:01.010 
corticosteroid we think gets better
penetration<00:07:00.029> in<00:07:00.120> the<00:07:00.150> lungs<00:07:00.389> if<00:07:00.599> he<00:07:00.719> gives<00:07:00.930> the

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
penetration in the lungs if he gives the

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.629 
penetration in the lungs if he gives the
bronchodilator<00:07:01.740> first<00:07:02.039> to<00:07:02.219> open<00:07:02.520> the

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 
bronchodilator first to open the

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:05.510 
bronchodilator first to open the
bronchioles<00:07:03.599> or<00:07:03.750> the<00:07:03.839> air<00:07:03.960> passing<00:07:04.439> tubes<00:07:04.710> so

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
bronchioles or the air passing tubes so

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.249 
bronchioles or the air passing tubes so
that's<00:07:05.699> the<00:07:05.939> that's<00:07:06.270> the<00:07:06.449> goal<00:07:06.719> so<00:07:06.990> we<00:07:07.110> give

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:07.259 
that's the that's the goal so we give

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:10.189 
that's the that's the goal so we give
the<00:07:07.469> the<00:07:08.219> bronchodilator<00:07:08.879> first<00:07:09.330> wait<00:07:09.900> a<00:07:09.930> half

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 
the the bronchodilator first wait a half

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:15.770 
the the bronchodilator first wait a half
an<00:07:10.319> hour<00:07:10.439> and<00:07:10.710> then<00:07:10.860> give<00:07:11.069> the<00:07:11.219> steroid

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.980

actually that amount of drug will will

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.700 
actually that amount of drug will will
reduce<00:07:23.790> the<00:07:24.120> function<00:07:24.750> of<00:07:25.050> the<00:07:25.139> horse's<00:07:25.500> own

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:25.710 
reduce the function of the horse's own

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:28.129 
reduce the function of the horse's own
adrenal<00:07:26.370> glands<00:07:26.790> and<00:07:26.910> the<00:07:27.570> horse<00:07:27.750> will<00:07:27.930> quit

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:28.139 
adrenal glands and the horse will quit
