00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.359 
is their best approach for getting out
of<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.529> situation

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
of that situation

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.060 
of that situation
well<00:00:20.910> debt<00:00:21.240> debt<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.779> dangerous<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.890> don't

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
well debt debt is dangerous and I don't

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.890 
well debt debt is dangerous and I don't
believe<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.400> all<00:00:23.820> debt<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.150> wrong<00:00:24.539> but<00:00:24.779> I

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
believe that all debt is wrong but I

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.580 
believe that all debt is wrong but I
believe<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.170> all<00:00:25.560> debt<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.099> cautionary

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
believe that all debt is cautionary

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.419 
believe that all debt is cautionary
especially<00:00:28.590> when<00:00:28.769> you're<00:00:28.890> borrowing<00:00:29.130> money

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
especially when you're borrowing money

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.429 
especially when you're borrowing money
on<00:00:29.730> credit<00:00:30.000> cards<00:00:30.420> with<00:00:30.599> incredibly<00:00:31.320> high

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
on credit cards with incredibly high

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.190 
on credit cards with incredibly high
interest<00:00:31.949> rates<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.430> things<00:00:32.610> like<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.200> you

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
interest rates and things like that you

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.200 
interest rates and things like that you
just<00:00:34.260> need<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.680> be<00:00:35.309> cautionary<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.030> what<00:00:36.180> I

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
just need to be cautionary and so what I

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.200 
just need to be cautionary and so what I
would<00:00:36.450> say<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.780> if<00:00:36.989> you're<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.559> debt<00:00:38.210> downsides

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
would say is if you're in debt downsides

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.000 
would say is if you're in debt downsides
as<00:00:39.540> much<00:00:39.719> as<00:00:39.899> possible<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.500> other<00:00:40.620> words<00:00:40.860> if

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
as much as possible in other words if

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.400
