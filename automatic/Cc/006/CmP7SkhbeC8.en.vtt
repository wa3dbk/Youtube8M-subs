00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.540
 favorite methods of writers 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.010
 create super heroes and I really 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.059
 I wonder how more people do not 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.980
 they imagined that they had 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.750
 superpowers instead of cancer 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.149

 bitten by a zombie about twenty times 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.469
 You discover that the man's mother is nothing. 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.350
 nothing less than a cloth doll and 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.420
 that the car is completely crazy and 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.330

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.270

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.240
 Good in the pond when a dog talks to 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.050
 that a person is trapped in a 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.090
 tree 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.860
 You go there to rescue the person and comment 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.180
 that her dog is a legal grinder 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.100

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.440

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.290
 consult a psychiatrist urgently 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.580
