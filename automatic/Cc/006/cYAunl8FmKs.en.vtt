00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hello, this is Jorge de Cerro Bar 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.470
 point is I want to show this cup of 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.639
 hesse maker and a cup for 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.160
 everyone that I like other 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.500
 outdoor activities or traveler is 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.210
 a cup to use it with 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.050
 our worst since both cold and 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.929
 hot 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.150
 it's a cup that is very light since 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:23.710
 it starts only 100 grams and the lid is 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.000
 totally tight 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.460
 I wanted to make a clarification that this is 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.559
 a cup is not a cup I have since 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.210
 within the website we have another 

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:32.590
 cup that if they are thermos I put one 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.390
 has a double wall is an action 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.699
 stable this is a normal cup and 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.060
 current for our activities to the 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.740
 fresh air 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.210
 It is main characteristics as 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.190
 you can see it does not have any kind of gauze 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.620
 fixed or anything because a small tape 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.360
 that comes in handy so that the 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.890
 time for example save it in our 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.900
 backpack does not go to the little space because 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.360
 we can put in like this there will be people who will 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.210
 like nothing sticks your hand here 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.370
 or directly catch it like this this is the 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.650
 cover that has a rough appearance that 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.940
 it's pretty good to grab it in the 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.590
 base as you can see here a small 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.900
 true so that it does not move us that we 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.540
 it comes very well and well this is the model 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.670
 infinity with a capacity of 400 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.800
 milliliters the sheath is totally 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.040
 removable and here we will find what 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.020
 that is the infinity container the infiniti is 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.720
 very resistant material manufacturer 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.620
 gs and it will not leave us tastes so much the 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.890
 water or any kind of smell inside the 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.690
 cup and apart admits very well both the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.850
 cold drinks as hot 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.710
 and the other team that you see the cover has 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.480
 you see here that I have here a 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.730
 together to make it better 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.730
 tightness is free of bp 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.010
 this would be and here we would give access to 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.010
 stopper for drinking time 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.479
 by someone 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.210
 and we come here directly to the extent 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.370
 It has a diameter of 19 centimeters and 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.979
 a height of about 10 centimeters and the 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.110
 weight is about 100 grams or a cup 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.430
 that suits us very well for our 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.660
 outdoor activities or even 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.119
 for work since it occupies little 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.130
 when it comes to wearing it and we can 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.330
 bring another totally liquid tight 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.730
 so that we do not spill 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.020
 I hope this information is helpful 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.580
