00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.219
 hi all welcome to a in movie 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.090
 but i'm going to show you your own 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.389
 necessary 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.640
 5 allows and also at the last 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.109
 how you can make something fun with being 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.359
 very short tutorial 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.050
 she also made me very fast and easy 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.640
 what you need for this is a can i 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.070
 just use it on a can can 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.130
 can be normal 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.270
 elastic band to make your laundry and a 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.090
 slide pin 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.280
 naturally start with her loose you can 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.950
 top up a bit like what 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:46.670
 sometimes in this way against the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.670
 direction in combing 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.199
 little on top a little red port 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.610
 yes there is slightly more volume in the structure 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:34.979
 in what we do now just kill her 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:36.540
 grabbing him does not lower him a bit 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.070
 completely at its lowest with the 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.410
 in between 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.170
 you grab it that it's not quite 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.170
 looks tight here on the side 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.240
 make sure your first does not 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:05.580
 so that you are a bit really tight 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.970
 against your head to this nice good 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.970
 attract 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.250
 what we are going to do now is actually normal 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.860
 always a bit attracting and the 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.260
 release with a game in between 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.280
 these two 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.280
 you pull this because suddenly 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.970
 good on too 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.230
 thereafter 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:38.730
 pull the piece yourself something again 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:41.700
 closer to my head the end 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.470
 what is important is that your rubber band 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.190
 your tail is close to your head 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:58.590
 but that this hair is a bit round here 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:03:01.739
 is a bit loose is the biggest 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.329
 part is the basically what i am 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.680
 always likes is that you stay 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.160
 of the rubber band 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.049
 blame your hair tuft her him 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.120
 leads so that it looks like you have one 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.680
 her song saw how this part 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.680
 need the disk 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.500
 grab a small stool 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:32.150
 then it revolved around your tail us 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.150
 very much you go 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.880
 as often as possible , it depends on how 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.330
 longer you have a small piece left 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.880
 have 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.880
 at the bottom bake the slider 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:55.680
 fasten it and then you have rubber band 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.680
 of the hair 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.260
 to make it a little messy 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.549
 I always like it even more 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:25.729
 to check 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:27.979
 and especially what tufts are on 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.800
 own cross but I had another tip 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:33.289
 one last tip to make it something so 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.150
 to make it more cheerful and it's gone 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:37.150
 means you have to be very simple 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.130
 Who knows yet nothing is so may be 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:48.110
 you tail what the high is so much 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.270
 creates a very weird let you look 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.180
 then I would really be seven layers 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.509
 have to make or a little to no 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.509
 say 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.350
 I hope you liked this movie a lot 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.910
 to experience success 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.910
 and see you next time
