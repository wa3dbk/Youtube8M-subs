 There may be people who get in the way a bit like this, but a little middle year 2 years letter is 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.370
 More likely 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.270
 It is a little favorite I myself this now just 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.490
 To introduction 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.840
 I tried to 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.840
 It 's about a while now 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.680

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:09.090

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.509

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.040
 hit 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.200
 Ice is a minor magazine 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.200

 I do not have that auto aiming , but there 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.170
 Originally this game itself 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:11.950
 There is a kind of auto aiming though 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.450
 In the vicinity of the enemy it's fit stiff to have made of this 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.580
 that 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.300
 I will become 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:23.410
 I can not end that precision shooting 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:26.330
 Say so Toka aimed at Ano weakness guess I can at all 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.640
 The central part of the enemy 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.640
 I just aim and I just lock it 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.740
 I removed it 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.810

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.480
 Standard source 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.250
 It will be its own cheat 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.250
 Some people may think that 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.940
 That it does not may have 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.110

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.770
