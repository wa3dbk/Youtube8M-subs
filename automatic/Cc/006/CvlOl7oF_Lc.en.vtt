00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.889
 no no no 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.330
 hello how welcome to the channel is 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.820
 news today is that 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.560
 christian bale has it clear he will not return 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.450
 to put on the batman suit for 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.970
 League of Justice movie that will arrive 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.250
 to theaters in 2015 the Oscar winner 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.840
 actor for the fighter had already warned 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.580
 prior to publication 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.140
 weekly entertainment that the only 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.970
 possibility of interpreting again to 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.440
 batman went through that christopher nolan 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.930
 I would go back to the controls of the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.370
 production cristian vale is aware 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.809
 that your loyalty to nolan can 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.580
 even with the most attractive projects 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.379
 that they can offer you having the 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.059
 Bat superhero as the protagonist 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.059
 that's why he has things clear 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.640
 this is how he expressed himself in this respect 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.140
 we were very lucky in 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.809
 get to make three batman movies 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.089
 and it's enough we're not greedy 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.400
 nolan always said he wanted to make a 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.080
 movie and we ended up making three what 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.820
 true is that we never knew that he was going to 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.700
 be like that but it was like it had to be that 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.350
 must already finish added cristian vale no 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.090
 will return to give life to batman and be in the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.710
 league of justice will be very different to 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.899
 what nolan has outlined in the gentleman 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.520
 dark so David confirmed it is in 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.090
 google the screenwriter of the movie the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.090
 famed director 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.229
 cristian vale does not want to hear about 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.390
 the league of justice this is your 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.219
 opinion about it I have not had any 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.140
 information or knowledge about anything 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.450
 I have not had any conversation either 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.369
 with nobody the only thing I know is that they are 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.960
 preparing a movie at his trial 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.299
 berman is a torch that must be 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.950
 passed on to another actor I will enjoy seeing what 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.259
 what he does with the character he concluded 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.609
 cristian vale we'll have to wait for 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.350
 so much to know the name of the 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:54.000
 interpreter who puts on one's costume 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.000
 of the most famous superheroes in the world 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.660
 a savior 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:05.040
