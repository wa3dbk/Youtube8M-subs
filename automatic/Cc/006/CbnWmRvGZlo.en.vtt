00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.400 
Rock it's a pretty impressive rock
formation<00:02:52.490> the<00:02:53.060> water<00:02:53.360> over<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.900> years<00:02:54.140> has

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
formation the water over the years has

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.740 
formation the water over the years has
just<00:02:54.650> carved<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.820> center<00:02:56.240> of<00:02:56.330> that<00:02:56.450> rock

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
just carved the center of that rock

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.700 
just carved the center of that rock
right<00:02:57.170> out<00:02:57.380> and<00:02:58.280> apparently<00:02:58.990> when<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.500> low

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
right out and apparently when the low

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.890 
right out and apparently when the low
tide<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.520> tide<00:03:01.550> goes<00:03:02.000> all<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.210> way<00:03:02.330> out<00:03:02.570> you

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
tide the tide goes all the way out you

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.850 
tide the tide goes all the way out you
can<00:03:03.320> walk<00:03:03.740> right<00:03:04.640> up<00:03:04.850> to<00:03:04.880> arch<00:03:05.240> Rock<00:03:05.570> so<00:03:05.960> we're

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
can walk right up to arch Rock so we're

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.960 
can walk right up to arch Rock so we're
kind<00:03:07.040> of<00:03:07.070> waiting<00:03:07.370> here<00:03:07.520> for<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.760> next<00:03:07.910> couple

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
kind of waiting here for the next couple

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.710 
kind of waiting here for the next couple
hours<00:03:08.630> until<00:03:08.840> low<00:03:09.800> low<00:03:10.070> tide<00:03:10.430> let's<00:03:11.360> see<00:03:11.510> if<00:03:11.600> we

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
can get out there and check out arch

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.010 
can get out there and check out arch
