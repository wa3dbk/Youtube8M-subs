strategy than using this card and that's
kind<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.280> unfortunate<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> little<00:01:30.030> bit

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
kind of unfortunate it's a little bit

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.670 
kind of unfortunate it's a little bit
situational<00:01:30.780> doesn't<00:01:31.290> really<00:01:31.409> have<00:01:31.560> good

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
situational doesn't really have good

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.020 
situational doesn't really have good
stats<00:01:31.979> weekend<00:01:32.250> with<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.460> all<00:01:32.549> too<00:01:32.700> i<00:01:32.729> mean<00:01:32.939> i

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
stats weekend with that all too i mean i

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.429 
stats weekend with that all too i mean i
could<00:01:33.090> at<00:01:33.299> least<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.869> have<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> little<00:01:34.259> bit<00:01:34.350> more

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
could at least it have a little bit more

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.990 
could at least it have a little bit more
redeemable<00:01:34.860> quality<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:35.369> I'd<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.880> know

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
redeemable quality if I'd like you know

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.960 
redeemable quality if I'd like you know
better<00:01:36.689> defense<00:01:37.079> or<00:01:37.259> something<00:01:37.820> but<00:01:38.820> yeah

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
better defense or something but yeah

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.789 
better defense or something but yeah
maybe<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.960> one<00:01:40.200> too<00:01:40.409> i<00:01:40.439> don't

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
maybe it's just this one too i don't

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.230 
maybe it's just this one too i don't
know<00:01:40.860> i<00:01:40.890> assume<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.340> we'll<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:41.939> more<00:01:42.150> of

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
know i assume that we'll get more of

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.219 
know i assume that we'll get more of
these<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.509> future<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:42.869> know<00:01:42.960> one<00:01:43.110> for

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
these in the future you know one for

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.840 
these in the future you know one for
each<00:01:43.320> monarch<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.920> don't<00:01:44.340> know<00:01:44.430> yeah<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.640> mean

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
each monarch I don't know yeah I mean

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.609 
each monarch I don't know yeah I mean
none<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.090> that's<00:01:45.240> been<00:01:45.360> confirmed<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.439> yeah

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
none of that's been confirmed but yeah

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.749 
none of that's been confirmed but yeah
what<00:01:46.799> do<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.890> guys<00:01:46.979> think<00:01:47.040> about<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.490> card

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
what do you guys think about this card

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.819 
what do you guys think about this card
for<00:01:48.299> me<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.450> feel<00:01:49.079> like<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.350> was<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.500> missed

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
for me I feel like it was a missed

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.160 
for me I feel like it was a missed
opportunity<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.640> all<00:01:50.880> honesty<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.390> think<00:01:52.020> they

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
opportunity and all honesty I think they

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.179 
opportunity and all honesty I think they
could<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.380> done<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.560> lot<00:01:52.710> better<00:01:52.770> with<00:01:53.070> this

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
could have done a lot better with this

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.520 
could have done a lot better with this
card<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.750> I'm<00:01:54.750> hoping<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.200> maybe<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
card and I'm hoping that maybe the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.319 
card and I'm hoping that maybe the
others<00:01:55.740> will<00:01:55.770> be<00:01:56.189> better<00:01:56.399> i<00:01:56.490> don't<00:01:56.790> know<00:01:56.880> but

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
others will be better i don't know but

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.149 
others will be better i don't know but
this<00:01:57.479> one<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:58.020> mean<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.560> feel<00:01:58.799> like<00:01:58.950> there's

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
this one I mean I just feel like there's

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.770 
this one I mean I just feel like there's
already<00:01:59.280> better<00:01:59.670> options<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.600> isn't

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
already better options and this isn't

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.600 
already better options and this isn't
really<00:02:00.899> something<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:02.189> type<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.369> card

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
really something this type of card

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.190 
really something this type of card
anyway<00:02:02.790> certainly<00:02:03.329> some<00:02:03.479> monarchs<00:02:03.689> needed

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
anyway certainly some monarchs needed

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.649 
anyway certainly some monarchs needed
then<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.890> know<00:02:05.040> it's<00:02:05.640> like<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.299> said<00:02:06.450> just<00:02:06.479> a

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
then you know it's like I said just a

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.359 
then you know it's like I said just a
missed<00:02:06.869> opportunity<00:02:06.979> yeah<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.039> wonder<00:02:08.250> what

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
missed opportunity yeah I wonder what

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.589 
missed opportunity yeah I wonder what
