00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
little bit more texture to it not nearly

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.300 
little bit more texture to it not nearly
as<00:01:47.070> easy<00:01:47.850> as<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:50.100> store-bought<00:01:50.790> chicken<00:01:51.150> and

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
as easy as the store-bought chicken and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.679 
as easy as the store-bought chicken and
that<00:01:53.310> gives<00:01:53.579> us<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.820> sense<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.180> what<00:01:54.390> they<00:01:54.509> look

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
that gives us a sense of what they look

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.999 
that gives us a sense of what they look
like<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.140> we're<00:01:55.380> gonna<00:01:55.470> make<00:01:55.650> some<00:01:55.799> stock
