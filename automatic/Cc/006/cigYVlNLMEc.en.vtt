00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.660 
career oh these reels are the first
reels<00:02:32.580> that<00:02:32.700> they<00:02:32.910> build<00:02:33.500> CT<00:02:34.500> style<00:02:34.800> prior<00:02:35.370> to

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
reels that they build CT style prior to

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.210 
reels that they build CT style prior to
the<00:02:36.530> before<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.940> flat<00:02:38.940> bar<00:02:39.319> so<00:02:40.319> I'm<00:02:40.830> going<00:02:40.920> to

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
the before the flat bar so I'm going to

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.210 
the before the flat bar so I'm going to
use<00:02:41.280> this<00:02:41.610> so<00:02:42.090> I'm<00:02:42.330> pretty<00:02:42.540> much<00:02:43.160> going<00:02:44.160> to

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
use this so I'm pretty much going to

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.030 
use this so I'm pretty much going to
chop<00:02:44.459> this<00:02:44.580> real<00:02:44.819> up<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.269> everything<00:02:45.810> on<00:02:46.650> the

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
chop this real up and everything on the

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.880 
chop this real up and everything on the
left<00:02:47.400> side<00:02:48.049> actually<00:02:49.049> that<00:02:49.230> would<00:02:49.530> be<00:02:49.709> my

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
left side actually that would be my

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.720 
left side actually that would be my
right<00:02:50.130> side<00:02:50.430> my<00:02:51.269> right<00:02:51.540> side<00:02:52.160> will<00:02:53.160> be<00:02:53.340> used

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
right side my right side will be used

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.640 
right side my right side will be used
for<00:02:54.420> my<00:02:54.720> new<00:02:54.900> real<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:56.400> left<00:02:56.670> side<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:58.260> spool

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
for my new real the left side the spool

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.190 
for my new real the left side the spool
the<00:02:59.250> cage<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.940> level<00:03:00.239> one<00:03:00.390> all<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:00.989> stuff

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
the cage the level one all of that stuff

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.250 
the cage the level one all of that stuff
will<00:03:01.470> be<00:03:02.150> extras<00:03:03.150> that<00:03:03.180> won't<00:03:03.599> be<00:03:03.750> used<00:03:04.019> on

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
will be extras that won't be used on

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.960 
will be extras that won't be used on
this<00:03:04.440> project<00:03:04.769> but<00:03:05.099> i'm<00:03:05.310> pretty<00:03:05.489> sure<00:03:05.760> i'll

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
this project but i'm pretty sure i'll

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:13.130 
this project but i'm pretty sure i'll
use<00:03:06.299> it<00:03:08.510> for<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.890> fishing<00:03:10.890> reel<00:03:11.540> all<00:03:12.540> right<00:03:12.750> so

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
use it for a fishing reel all right so

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.310 
use it for a fishing reel all right so
this<00:03:13.920> is<00:03:14.250> this<00:03:14.940> here<00:03:15.209> is<00:03:15.269> my<00:03:15.420> intro<00:03:15.900> my<00:03:16.079> next

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
this is this here is my intro my next

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.620 
this is this here is my intro my next
video<00:03:16.560> will<00:03:16.829> be<00:03:16.950> me<00:03:17.130> actually<00:03:17.310> putting<00:03:17.760> the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
video will be me actually putting the

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.620 
video will be me actually putting the
pieces<00:03:18.930> together<00:03:19.940> i'm<00:03:20.940> going<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.269> leave<00:03:21.420> out

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
pieces together i'm going to leave out

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.620 
pieces together i'm going to leave out
some<00:03:21.959> of<00:03:22.140> my<00:03:22.459> learned<00:03:24.230> tuning<00:03:25.230> techniques

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
some of my learned tuning techniques

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.080 
some of my learned tuning techniques
just<00:03:27.630> cuz<00:03:27.810> they're<00:03:28.109> secret<00:03:28.590> but<00:03:29.250> i'll<00:03:29.400> put

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
just cuz they're secret but i'll put

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.470 
just cuz they're secret but i'll put
about<00:03:30.329> eighty-five<00:03:30.870> percent<00:03:31.380> up<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:31.950> on<00:03:32.040> here

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
about eighty-five percent up and on here

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.630 
about eighty-five percent up and on here
for<00:03:33.480> all<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.930> guys<00:03:34.140> who<00:03:34.220> want<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.280> distance

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
for all you guys who want a distance

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.949 
for all you guys who want a distance
cats<00:03:35.850> but<00:03:36.090> don't<00:03:36.269> want<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.540> spend<00:03:36.750> two<00:03:36.930> or

cats but don't want to spend two or
three<00:03:37.290> hundred<00:03:37.799> dollars<00:03:38.250> i'll<00:03:38.400> show<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.819> how

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
three hundred dollars i'll show you how

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.270 
three hundred dollars i'll show you how
to<00:03:39.750> build<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.380> comparable<00:03:41.069> real<00:03:41.510> for<00:03:42.510> a

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
to build a comparable real for a

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.879 
to build a comparable real for a
fraction<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.579> that<00:03:44.730> cost<00:03:45.150> all<00:03:45.989> right<00:03:46.230> God

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
fraction of that cost all right God

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:57.250 
fraction of that cost all right God
distance<00:03:47.220> reals<00:03:47.459> this<00:03:48.060> is<00:03:48.209> crossing<00:03:48.630> out

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260
