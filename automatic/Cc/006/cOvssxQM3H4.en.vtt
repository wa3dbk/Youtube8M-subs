universities<00:02:24.299> so<00:02:24.959> from<00:02:25.560> my<00:02:25.739> perspective<00:02:26.069> as<00:02:26.549> a

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
universities so from my perspective as a

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.910 
universities so from my perspective as a
witness<00:02:27.269> course<00:02:27.569> does<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.080> as<00:02:28.200> program<00:02:28.650> does

as<00:02:29.099> that<00:02:29.880> makes<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.329> connection<00:02:30.870> between

as that makes the connection between

as that makes the connection between
theory<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.860> practice<00:02:32.390> we<00:02:33.390> give<00:02:33.690> students<00:02:34.319> the

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
theory and practice we give students the

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.559 
theory and practice we give students the
theoretical<00:02:35.489> underpinning<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
theoretical underpinning and the

theoretical underpinning and the

knowledge whether underpin and and

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.449 
knowledge whether underpin and and
knowledge<00:02:39.030> has<00:02:39.420> an<00:02:39.720> end<00:02:40.049> in<00:02:40.319> sight<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.799> now

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.850 
knowledge has an end in sight and now
end<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.840> not<00:02:43.049> only<00:02:43.230> improve<00:02:43.410> themselves

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
end is to not only improve themselves

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.670 
end is to not only improve themselves
but<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.489> increase<00:02:45.410> organizations<00:02:46.410> and

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
but to increase organizations and

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.410 
but to increase organizations and
organizational<00:02:47.640> development<00:02:47.970> and

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
organizational development and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.440 
organizational development and
ultimately<00:02:48.959> we<00:02:49.920> hope<00:02:50.129> a<00:02:50.450> societal

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
ultimately we hope a societal

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.500 
ultimately we hope a societal
development<00:02:52.349> as<00:02:52.470> well<00:02:52.799> so<00:02:53.400> just<00:02:53.700> finishing<00:02:54.390> on

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
development as well so just finishing on

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.539 
development as well so just finishing on
that<00:02:54.720> what<00:02:55.079> we're<00:02:55.260> looking<00:02:55.290> at<00:02:55.590> Theory

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
that what we're looking at Theory

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.330 
that what we're looking at Theory
marriage<00:02:57.269> with<00:02:57.660> practice<00:02:58.349> makes<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.160> good

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
marriage with practice makes a good

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:28.980 
marriage with practice makes a good
manager
