00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
Thunder phone 1.47 from what I know the

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.770 
Thunder phone 1.47 from what I know the
only<00:00:09.660> difference<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:10.260> it<00:00:10.530> has<00:00:10.710> some<00:00:11.280> other<00:00:11.780> you

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
only difference is it has some other you

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.539 
only difference is it has some other you
know<00:00:12.870> some<00:00:13.080> more<00:00:13.200> defense<00:00:13.559> with<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.160> track

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
know some more defense with this track

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.570 
know some more defense with this track
here<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.120> it<00:00:15.929> has<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.109> machine<00:00:16.710> gun<00:00:16.949> on<00:00:17.130> top<00:00:17.430> I

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
here and it has a machine gun on top I

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.689 
here and it has a machine gun on top I
believe<00:00:17.940> this<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.300> late<00:00:18.600> model<00:00:18.930> Tiger<00:00:19.289> one

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
believe this is the late model Tiger one

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.040 
believe this is the late model Tiger one
not<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.820> early<00:00:21.029> one<00:00:21.180> as<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.510> could<00:00:21.660> tell<00:00:21.810> by

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
not the early one as you could tell by

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.970 
not the early one as you could tell by
the<00:00:22.109> texturing<00:00:23.010> on<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.400> armor<00:00:24.769> but<00:00:25.769> we're

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
the texturing on the armor but we're

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.620 
the texturing on the armor but we're
gonna<00:00:26.070> look<00:00:26.340> at<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.550> Alma<00:00:26.820> here<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.420> see

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
gonna look at the Alma here and see

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.250 
gonna look at the Alma here and see
what's<00:00:27.869> new<00:00:28.140> has<00:00:29.010> some<00:00:29.250> like<00:00:29.460> weird<00:00:29.789> stuff

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
what's new has some like weird stuff

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.179 
what's new has some like weird stuff
right<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.349> here<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.590> didn't<00:00:31.830> know<00:00:31.920> if<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.040> was

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
right in here I didn't know if that was

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.330 
right in here I didn't know if that was
always<00:00:32.430> there<00:00:32.640> that's<00:00:33.600> pretty<00:00:33.840> weird<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:35.160> man

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
always there that's pretty weird the man

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.310 
always there that's pretty weird the man
looks<00:00:35.700> pretty<00:00:35.910> tough<00:00:36.120> though<00:00:36.329> it's<00:00:36.989> got<00:00:37.140> these

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
looks pretty tough though it's got these

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.590 
looks pretty tough though it's got these
I<00:00:37.739> mean<00:00:38.160> this<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.670> normal<00:00:38.760> Tiger<00:00:39.239> mantlet

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
I mean this is a normal Tiger mantlet

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.380 
I mean this is a normal Tiger mantlet
it's<00:00:39.960> normal<00:00:40.260> tiger<00:00:40.590> body<00:00:40.770> but<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.760> bottom

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
it's normal tiger body but the bottom

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.600 
it's normal tiger body but the bottom
plate<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> hundred<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.620> two<00:00:43.800> with<00:00:44.160> 30<00:00:44.460> on

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
plate is a hundred and two with 30 on

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.299 
plate is a hundred and two with 30 on
top<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.750> angled<00:00:46.170> it's<00:00:46.530> gonna<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:47.100> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
top of it so angled it's gonna be a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.690 
top of it so angled it's gonna be a
little<00:00:47.730> bit<00:00:47.879> harder<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.480> Penn<00:00:48.719> probably<00:00:49.110> like

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
little bit harder to Penn probably like

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.430 
little bit harder to Penn probably like
150<00:00:51.649> 150<00:00:52.649> show<00:00:52.829> depend<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.840> the<00:00:54.840> top<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
150 150 show depend that the top is the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.810 
150 150 show depend that the top is the
same<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.969> machine<00:00:57.270> gun<00:00:57.390> port<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.690> not<00:00:57.930> modeled

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
same the machine gun port is not modeled

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.130 
same the machine gun port is not modeled
neither<00:00:59.820> is<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.120> driver's<00:01:00.510> hatch<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:00.989> it's

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
neither is the driver's hatch so it's

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.539 
neither is the driver's hatch so it's
just<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.410> 100<00:01:02.390> side<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.660> 82<00:01:04.229> 82<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> side<00:01:05.519> of

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
just a 100 side is 82 82 on the side of

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.719 
just a 100 side is 82 82 on the side of
the<00:01:05.670> turret<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.720> back<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.200> tank<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.740> 82<00:01:08.340> as

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
the turret the back of the tank is 82 as

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.640 
the turret the back of the tank is 82 as
well<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> back<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.960> chart<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.350> still

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
well on the back of the chart is still

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.310 
well on the back of the chart is still
82<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.369> actually<00:01:11.549> might<00:01:11.970> be<00:01:12.030> different<00:01:12.360> I

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
82 so that actually might be different I

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.780 
82 so that actually might be different I
don't<00:01:13.770> know<00:01:13.860> what<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.100> normal<00:01:14.189> Tigers<00:01:14.640> we're

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
don't know what the normal Tigers we're

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.580 
don't know what the normal Tigers we're
going<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.970> compare<00:01:15.119> them<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.750> second<00:01:16.259> so

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
going to compare them in a second so

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.010 
going to compare them in a second so
let's<00:01:16.979> compare<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.610> after<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.630> we'll<00:01:18.780> show

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
let's compare it after that we'll show

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.690 
let's compare it after that we'll show
and<00:01:19.710> what<00:01:19.770> racks<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.280> looks<00:01:20.430> like<00:01:20.549> they<00:01:20.670> took

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
and what racks it looks like they took

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.149 
and what racks it looks like they took
the<00:01:21.000> ammo<00:01:21.150> rack<00:01:21.360> out<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.630> right<00:01:22.140> here<00:01:22.560> there's

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
the ammo rack out of right here there's

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.280 
the ammo rack out of right here there's
still<00:01:23.549> one<00:01:23.670> right<00:01:23.820> there<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.720> bunch<00:01:24.990> on

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
still one right there have a bunch on

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.380 
still one right there have a bunch on
the<00:01:25.409> side<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:28.020> know<00:01:28.140> how<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.290> kill<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> tiger

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
the side so we know how to kill a tiger

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.789 
the side so we know how to kill a tiger
let's<00:01:30.390> look<00:01:30.509> at<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.110> real<00:01:31.320> thing<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.680> see

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
let's look at the the real thing and see

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:39.109 
let's look at the the real thing and see
what<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.100> differences<00:01:36.979> 8282<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.790> looks<00:01:38.970> like

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
what the differences 8282 it looks like

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.550 
what the differences 8282 it looks like
they're<00:01:39.509> pretty<00:01:39.750> much<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.079> same<00:01:40.290> actually

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
they're pretty much the same actually

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.440 
they're pretty much the same actually
and<00:01:40.950> they<00:01:41.040> didn't<00:01:41.310> take<00:01:41.430> out<00:01:41.640> at<00:01:41.820> ammo<00:01:42.270> rack

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
and they didn't take out at ammo rack

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.149 
and they didn't take out at ammo rack
right<00:01:42.600> here<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.810> thought<00:01:43.049> there<00:01:43.290> was<00:01:43.470> one<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:43.979> i

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
right here I thought there was one but i

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.030 
right here I thought there was one but i
guess<00:01:44.460> not<00:01:45.079> so<00:01:46.079> they're<00:01:46.500> pretty<00:01:46.710> much<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
guess not so they're pretty much the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.940 
guess not so they're pretty much the
same<00:01:47.899> let's<00:01:48.899> look<00:01:49.020> at<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.229> gun<00:01:49.409> just<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.710> make

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
same let's look at the gun just to make
