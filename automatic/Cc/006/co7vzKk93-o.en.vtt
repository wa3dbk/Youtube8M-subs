and I'm just dabbing that on and I'm

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.770 
and I'm just dabbing that on and I'm
going<00:01:57.860> to<00:01:57.890> place<00:01:58.280> this<00:01:58.520> on<00:01:58.729> my<00:01:59.300> upper<00:01:59.570> lash

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
going to place this on my upper lash

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.450 
going to place this on my upper lash
line<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.290> kind<00:02:00.470> of<00:02:00.560> smoke<00:02:00.890> it<00:02:01.010> out<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.340> make

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
line and kind of smoke it out and make

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.980 
line and kind of smoke it out and make
it<00:02:01.490> look<00:02:01.760> a<00:02:01.850> little<00:02:01.940> bit<00:02:02.120> smudgy<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:02.600> what

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
it look a little bit smudgy and what

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.870 
it look a little bit smudgy and what
this<00:02:03.110> does<00:02:03.290> is<00:02:03.470> it<00:02:03.619> adds<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:03.950> smoky<00:02:04.280> effect<00:02:04.310> but

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
this does is it adds a smoky effect but

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.250 
this does is it adds a smoky effect but
I<00:02:04.909> like<00:02:05.119> how<00:02:05.240> it's<00:02:05.420> brown<00:02:05.659> so<00:02:05.990> it's<00:02:06.110> very

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
I like how it's brown so it's very

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.070 
I like how it's brown so it's very
subtle<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:06.890> I<00:02:07.850> think<00:02:08.240> Browns<00:02:08.479> on<00:02:08.869> your<00:02:09.050> eye

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
subtle and I think Browns on your eye

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.840 
subtle and I think Browns on your eye
for<00:02:09.440> fall<00:02:09.649> are<00:02:09.920> very<00:02:10.130> beautiful<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.670> that's

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
for fall are very beautiful and that's

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.750 
for fall are very beautiful and that's
kind<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.209> the<00:02:11.360> trend<00:02:11.600> for<00:02:12.380> fall<00:02:12.440> so<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.580> next

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
kind of the trend for fall so the next

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.280 
kind of the trend for fall so the next
time<00:02:14.000> we're<00:02:14.150> taking<00:02:14.510> is<00:02:14.660> this<00:02:14.780> kind<00:02:15.020> of<00:02:15.140> like

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
time we're taking is this kind of like

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.140 
time we're taking is this kind of like
it<00:02:15.770> kind<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.040> looks<00:02:16.220> like<00:02:16.400> wood<00:02:16.580> wings<00:02:16.790> by<00:02:16.970> Mac

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
it kind of looks like wood wings by Mac

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.730 
it kind of looks like wood wings by Mac
so<00:02:17.360> it's<00:02:17.480> this<00:02:17.600> kind<00:02:17.810> of<00:02:17.900> shimmery<00:02:18.290> bronze

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
so it's this kind of shimmery bronze

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.470 
so it's this kind of shimmery bronze
brown<00:02:19.130> color<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:19.490> I'm<00:02:19.700> taking<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:20.090> and

placing that on my lower lash line

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.790

instead of eyeliner down there and then

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.830 
instead of eyeliner down there and then
I'm<00:02:24.920> going<00:02:25.070> to<00:02:25.160> connect<00:02:25.550> it<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.760> my<00:02:26.420> upper<00:02:26.660> lash

with<00:03:51.620> this<00:03:51.799> and<00:03:52.040> this<00:03:52.370> really<00:03:52.670> lengthens<00:03:53.209> them

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
with this and this really lengthens them

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.539 
with this and this really lengthens them
and<00:03:53.659> I<00:03:53.840> like<00:03:54.019> how<00:03:54.140> it's<00:03:54.319> a<00:03:54.379> really<00:03:54.950> dark<00:03:55.190> block

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
and I like how it's a really dark block

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.300 
and I like how it's a really dark block
so<00:03:55.970> I<00:03:56.209> love<00:03:56.720> this<00:03:56.870> mascara<00:03:57.109> and<00:03:57.650> then<00:03:58.040> I'm<00:03:58.160> also
