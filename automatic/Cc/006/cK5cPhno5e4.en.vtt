Americans are there it will probably

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.250

seem<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.490> bit<00:00:20.520> more<00:00:20.760> expensive<00:00:21.090> for<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.630> but

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
seem a bit more expensive for you but

for you Britain's out there like myself
it<00:00:24.480> will<00:00:24.600> probably<00:00:24.810> be<00:00:24.930> about<00:00:25.250> that<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.369> same

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
it will probably be about that the same

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.599 
it will probably be about that the same
price<00:00:26.849> may<00:00:27.240> be<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.420> bit<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.630> little<00:00:27.720> bit<00:00:27.930> more<00:00:28.230> um

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
price may be a bit a little bit more um

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.919 
price may be a bit a little bit more um
but<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.730> seats<00:00:30.060> are<00:00:30.210> very<00:00:30.240> comfortable<00:00:30.420> and

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
but the seats are very comfortable and

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.060 
but the seats are very comfortable and
the<00:00:32.239> screens<00:00:33.239> very<00:00:33.540> big<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.050> swear<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:34.950> was<00:00:35.040> like

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
the screens very big I swear it was like

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.270 
the screens very big I swear it was like
super<00:00:35.460> high<00:00:35.700> definition<00:00:36.300> because<00:00:37.280> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
super high definition because the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.100 
super high definition because the
animation<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.940> screen<00:00:39.210> was<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.510> vivid<00:00:39.780> and

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
animation of the screen was so vivid and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.850 
animation of the screen was so vivid and
so<00:00:40.520> such<00:00:41.520> high<00:00:41.790> quality<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.750> almost<00:00:43.079> seemed<00:00:43.410> 3d

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
so such high quality it almost seemed 3d

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.310 
so such high quality it almost seemed 3d
when<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.190> was<00:00:44.280> watching<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.989> also<00:00:46.140> get
