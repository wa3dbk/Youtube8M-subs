00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
images using curves so let's get started

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.550 
images using curves so let's get started
I<00:00:17.949> have<00:00:18.939> this<00:00:19.150> image<00:00:19.359> here<00:00:19.720> of<00:00:20.019> the<00:00:20.289> grass

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
an anchor point here and then anchor

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.230 
an anchor point here and then anchor
point<00:01:24.220> here<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.830> can<00:01:27.130> push<00:01:27.640> and<00:01:27.850> pull<00:01:28.060> your

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
anchor point and move it around by

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.180 
anchor point and move it around by
moving<00:01:31.630> your<00:01:31.780> anchor<00:01:32.170> point<00:01:32.200> in<00:01:32.560> this<00:01:32.770> half<00:01:33.040> of

moving your anchor point in this half of
the<00:01:33.400> grid<00:01:33.700> section<00:01:34.620> will<00:01:35.620> make<00:01:35.860> your<00:01:36.160> pixels

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
the grid section will make your pixels

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.660 
the grid section will make your pixels
darker<00:01:37.540> and<00:01:37.810> moving<00:01:38.530> anchor<00:01:38.890> point<00:01:39.160> in<00:01:39.370> this

darker and moving anchor point in this

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.240 
darker and moving anchor point in this
half<00:01:39.970> of<00:01:40.120> the<00:01:40.300> grid<00:01:40.540> will<00:01:41.350> make<00:01:41.590> your<00:01:41.830> pixels

later and my dog becomes dark on so I'm

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.710 
later and my dog becomes dark on so I'm
gonna<00:02:17.310> make<00:02:17.550> an<00:02:17.760> S<00:02:18.000> shape<00:02:19.850> sort<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:20.910> like<00:02:21.120> this

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.300 

but<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.780> don't<00:02:24.930> want<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.230> overdo<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.770> because

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
but you don't want to overdo it because

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.640 
but you don't want to overdo it because
if<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.700> overdo<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.240> then<00:02:27.570> it<00:02:28.200> will<00:02:28.290> just<00:02:28.470> look

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
if you overdo it then it will just look

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.770 
if you overdo it then it will just look
too<00:02:28.980> dramatic<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:29.850> I'm<00:02:29.970> not<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.360> I'm<00:02:30.600> not

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
too dramatic and I'm not and I'm not

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.320 
too dramatic and I'm not and I'm not
going<00:02:31.050> for<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.320> look<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:32.070> I'm<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:33.000> limit

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
going for that look so I'm the limit

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.560 
going for that look so I'm the limit
mark<00:02:33.600> limit<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.590> curvature<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.250> my<00:02:35.570> s-shaped

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
mark limit the curvature of my s-shaped

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.230 
mark limit the curvature of my s-shaped
Lane<00:02:38.150> I'd<00:02:39.150> say<00:02:39.710> whoops

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
Lane I'd say whoops

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.760 
Lane I'd say whoops
I'll<00:02:42.240> keep<00:02:42.510> about

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.230 

about<00:02:46.400> there<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:47.180> would<00:02:47.330> do<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:48.140> click<00:02:48.380> ok

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
about there that would do and click ok

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.320 
about there that would do and click ok
now<00:02:50.240> if<00:02:50.390> i<00:02:50.570> zoom<00:02:50.600> in<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.970> looks<00:02:53.120> more

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
now if i zoom in it looks more

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.270 
now if i zoom in it looks more
professional<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.350> color<00:02:54.590> stands<00:02:54.980> out<00:02:55.250> a

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
professional and the color stands out a

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.360 
professional and the color stands out a
lot<00:02:55.930> there's<00:02:56.930> definitely<00:02:57.440> more<00:02:57.620> contrast<00:02:58.190> in

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
lot there's definitely more contrast in

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.500 
lot there's definitely more contrast in
the<00:02:58.490> images<00:02:58.970> as<00:02:59.150> well<00:03:00.160> it<00:03:01.160> does<00:03:02.120> it<00:03:02.360> definitely

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
the images as well it does it definitely

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.450 
the images as well it does it definitely
doesn't<00:03:03.050> look<00:03:03.260> as<00:03:03.440> if<00:03:03.590> it<00:03:03.710> was<00:03:03.830> taken<00:03:04.190> from<00:03:04.280> an

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
doesn't look as if it was taken from an

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:10.590 
doesn't look as if it was taken from an
8<00:03:04.610> megapixel<00:03:04.940> camera<00:03:05.650> so<00:03:06.650> let's<00:03:07.250> just<00:03:07.430> compare

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.440 

let's<00:03:11.600> go<00:03:11.870> back<00:03:12.170> to<00:03:12.610> how<00:03:13.610> the<00:03:13.670> image<00:03:14.030> was<00:03:14.150> first

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
let's go back to how the image was first

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.040 
let's go back to how the image was first
taken<00:03:15.670> so<00:03:16.670> this<00:03:16.880> is<00:03:17.060> how<00:03:17.180> it<00:03:17.330> was<00:03:17.450> when<00:03:17.510> I<00:03:17.780> first

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
taken so this is how it was when I first

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.790 
taken so this is how it was when I first
took<00:03:18.260> it<00:03:18.500> as<00:03:18.680> you<00:03:18.980> can<00:03:19.160> see<00:03:19.430> is<00:03:19.670> sort<00:03:20.090> of<00:03:20.210> dull

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
took it as you can see is sort of dull

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.230 
took it as you can see is sort of dull
but<00:03:21.800> then<00:03:22.510> with<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.660> curves<00:03:25.000> looks<00:03:26.000> much

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
but then with the curves looks much

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.090 
but then with the curves looks much
better<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:26.720> much<00:03:27.020> much<00:03:27.410> more<00:03:27.470> professional

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
better and much much more professional

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.010 
better and much much more professional
and<00:03:28.580> adds<00:03:29.150> much<00:03:29.510> more<00:03:29.780> quality<00:03:30.230> to<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.530> image

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
and adds much more quality to the image

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
and adds much more quality to the image
so<00:03:33.700> there<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:34.820> go
