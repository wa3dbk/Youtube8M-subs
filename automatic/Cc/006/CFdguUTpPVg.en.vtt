00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:21.170
 imagine a goal a profession 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:24.170
 the home that requires more than dedication 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.170
 is 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.960
 a dream called aviation 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.910
 the first barrier begins as the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.460
 friends and family is not always the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.659
 supporting the financial factor is another 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.570
 aggravating 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:48.329
 without this you unfortunately can not 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.010
 to move forward in the labor market 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.260
 sometimes stable 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.170
 your future in this investment could 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.510
 not be in favor of a medical examination will be 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.920
 the next step for you to continue and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.949
 sometimes 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.899
 many will not give you the preparation 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.819
 but the important thing is a 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.319
 for this occupation and once again 

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:09.899
 during this phase 

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:12.360
 many have already fallen every 50 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.690
 dreamers starting theoretical dream 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.920
 with the road only 10 arrive at the end 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.920
 proving your dedication 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.319
 learning to fly requires much more 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.100
 than the passion to acquire this 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:28.500
 abiliity 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.159
 The practical classes are only one 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.860
 term agility instructors 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.930
 demanding adverse conditions years and 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.719
 Advanced maneuvers will be that you will 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.700
 during this process 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.469
 planning study focus and standardization 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.390
 reached success 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.810
 for many the private pilot course 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.820
 will be enough but of the others 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.329
 the formation of commercial pilot is what 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.009
 there are more theoretical classes but more 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.460
 I'm going with more capital 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.510
 again everything repeats itself but now you 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.610
 you already know what is essential 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.070
 the road is not easy and the return 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.380
 never be guaranteed that 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.440
 goes looking for bloom status 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.060
 there are usually those who 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.220
 continue to overcome the barriers are the 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.310
 real dreamers every difficulty 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.910
 overcome if he proves the true 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.910
 amateurs 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.030
 are so many uncertainties because the 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:33.660
 bns for this question only exists 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.660
 an answer my dream is to fly 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.150
 the house itself
