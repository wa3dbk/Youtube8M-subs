00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.790

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.340
 hotel sera for syrup and now i'm going 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.740

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:26.359
 kilometer and pure white 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:33.239

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:36.200

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.200
 through that folder 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.060
 Well, you will not believe only I fell 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.789
 only I decided to sunbathe a little and 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.579
 came a big big cloud incomprehensible 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:22.369
 from where for golf 2 for gta it 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.170
 it is quite normal that the sun is samsung 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.869
 then the bug weather turned bad without 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.509
 any signs of this in advance but in 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.590
 In general, I lay down for 20 minutes very much 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.719
 froze now I'm leaving 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.909
 in general, what was interesting was to say it 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:39.319
 what the Italians 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:41.509
 they go to the beach at 11-12 that is 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:44.119
 the time when we on the contrary are already leaving 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.459
 beach because it is harmful they are not 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.670
 reasons with small children go and sit 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:52.729
 up to 3 and if we then exit somewhere in 4 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.979
 then they are the opposite 4 already go and here 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.880
 just once i was on this beach here 5 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:02.979
 hours already such a special machine 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.979
 started to ride that to clean it 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.599
 a popular game on christ is a cafe and 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.209
 bars on the beaches 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:17.190
 here you can help legs by the way this 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:19.800
 mini playground for children here somehow 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.239
 it's just that I left the beach and immediately 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.950
 start the sun go out such a shift 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.880
 5 euros could have happened to me 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.580
 to lie down 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.989
 30 minutes to freeze and and to the sun 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.069
 it turned out but nothing now I ask my husband 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.470
 so he took me 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.400
 work to my niece for a cup 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.400
 warm cappuccino 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.430
 and here are these hotels a bit away from 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.010
 the beach here 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.010
 the hotel is internet on you once he 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.769
 read somewhere on the forums that you can find 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.909
 here rooms in hotels from 50 euros for 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.909
 night and up 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.019
 now we drove to one of the bars 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.930
 owned by my husband's niece with 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:29.090
 his girlfriend that's called for round i 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.079
 chose the moment when there is no one inside 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.680

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:37.650

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.670
 Well, in general, this is what a normal looks like. 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.760
 small bar in italy 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.099
 that's what they have left today from 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.099
 the fact that you can wear to take the snacks 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:53.519
 There are various sandwiches such things 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:56.459

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.909
 coffee machine which is absolutely 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.969
 every mcafee but italy because 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:07.650
 Italians drink coffee at least five times 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:12.150

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.739
 which Italians are jumping on honest this 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:23.400
 beer is whiskey and 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.970
 amaretto then already somewhere goes vodka 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.580

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.820

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.930
 news women are these very 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:44.010
