experience with a bone because they are
teething<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.919> thought<00:00:08.160> mom's<00:00:08.490> nips<00:00:08.940> could

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
teething and I thought mom's nips could

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.459 
teething and I thought mom's nips could
use<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.450> little<00:00:09.719> rest

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
use a little rest

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.970 
use a little rest
