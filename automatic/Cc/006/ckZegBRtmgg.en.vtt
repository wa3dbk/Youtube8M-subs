00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
house soiling and for years I've been

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.750 
house soiling and for years I've been
looking<00:00:22.590> for<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.769> product<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.279> actually

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
looking for a product that actually

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.029 
looking for a product that actually
would<00:00:24.029> reduce<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.920> potentially<00:00:25.920> remove

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039

residual smells in the car pitch and

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.740 
residual smells in the car pitch and
that's<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.490> big<00:00:29.640> plus<00:00:29.849> because<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.420> stops<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
that's a big plus because it stops the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.089 
that's a big plus because it stops the
castle<00:00:31.080> going<00:00:31.289> back<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.619> places<00:00:31.830> where

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
a puppy with him it took me till he was

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.850 
a puppy with him it took me till he was
five<00:01:33.420> months<00:01:33.600> old<00:01:33.780> private<00:01:34.259> potty<00:01:34.530> training

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
five months old private potty training

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.100 
five months old private potty training
because<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.640> just<00:01:36.240> couldn't<00:01:36.479> keep<00:01:36.690> get<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
because I just couldn't keep get the

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.219 
because I just couldn't keep get the
smell<00:01:37.350> out<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.649> house<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.190> had<00:01:38.340> carpet

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
smell out of the house and I had carpet

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.990 
smell out of the house and I had carpet
so<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.619> took<00:01:40.799> me<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.039> much<00:01:41.130> longer<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.580> convince

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
so it took me so much longer to convince

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.340 
so it took me so much longer to convince
him<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.240> he<00:01:42.780> was<00:01:42.869> supposed<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.110> be<00:01:43.170> going

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
him that he was supposed to be going

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.580 
him that he was supposed to be going
outside<00:01:43.940> but<00:01:44.940> the<00:01:45.119> new<00:01:45.509> puppy<00:01:45.899> like<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.409> said

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
outside but the new puppy like I said

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.710 
outside but the new puppy like I said
it's<00:01:46.740> 12<00:01:46.979> weeks<00:01:47.159> old<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.820> feel<00:01:48.090> like<00:01:48.240> now

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
it's 12 weeks old and I feel like now

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.620 
it's 12 weeks old and I feel like now
she<00:01:48.780> has<00:01:49.350> very<00:01:50.340> few<00:01:50.520> accidents<00:01:50.880> maybe<00:01:51.270> once

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
she has very few accidents maybe once

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.859 
she has very few accidents maybe once
every<00:01:52.250> week<00:01:53.250> at<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.909> most<00:01:53.940> she<00:01:54.569> has<00:01:54.750> an

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
every week at the most she has an

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.090 
every week at the most she has an
accident<00:01:55.319> I<00:01:55.380> think<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:55.740> probably<00:01:55.860> because

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
accident I think it's probably because
