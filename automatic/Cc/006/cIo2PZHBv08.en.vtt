00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
really interesting about this - is that

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.660 
really interesting about this - is that
it<00:00:36.480> supports<00:00:36.600> something<00:00:37.109> called<00:00:37.320> 3d<00:00:37.710> mode

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
it supports something called 3d mode

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.729 
it supports something called 3d mode
it<00:00:38.879> looks<00:00:39.179> like<00:00:39.390> Windows<00:00:39.780> 10<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.230> text<00:00:40.589> the

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739

oculus rift has two seperate displays
which<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.140> actually<00:00:43.469> what<00:00:43.589> we<00:00:43.710> hoped<00:00:43.890> would

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
which is actually what we hoped would

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.930 
which is actually what we hoped would
happen<00:00:44.300> and<00:00:45.300> if<00:00:45.749> we<00:00:46.079> look<00:00:46.469> at<00:00:46.589> the<00:00:46.739> new<00:00:47.010> display

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
happen and if we look at the new display

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.549 
happen and if we look at the new display
management<00:00:48.390> you'll<00:00:48.600> see<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.989> it's<00:00:49.440> actually

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
management you'll see that it's actually

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.759 
management you'll see that it's actually
showing<00:00:49.890> up<00:00:50.100> in<00:00:50.219> portrait<00:00:50.640> mode<00:00:50.670> here<00:00:51.089> I'm<00:00:52.079> not

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
showing up in portrait mode here I'm not

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:54.470 
showing up in portrait mode here I'm not
sure<00:00:53.069> how<00:00:53.190> that's<00:00:53.309> gonna<00:00:53.460> respond<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.120> games<00:00:54.359> I

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
sure how that's gonna respond in games I

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.479 
sure how that's gonna respond in games I
haven't<00:00:54.749> gone<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.019> far<00:00:55.079> yet<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:56.219> if<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:56.370> take

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
haven't gone that far yet but if we take

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.680 
haven't gone that far yet but if we take
a<00:00:56.550> look<00:00:56.670> at<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.850> advanced<00:00:57.089> display<00:00:57.390> settings

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
a look at the advanced display settings

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.319 
a look at the advanced display settings
you'll<00:00:57.839> notice<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.289> has<00:00:58.679> 3ds<00:00:59.579> display<00:01:00.149> mode

you'll notice it has 3ds display mode
you'll<00:01:00.510> also<00:01:00.629> notice<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.229> properly

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
you'll also notice that it properly

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.989 
you'll also notice that it properly
detects<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.100> resolution<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.760> each

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:02.999

apparently is coming next month so
really<00:01:35.370> exciting<00:01:35.760> times<00:01:35.940> it<00:01:36.090> looks<00:01:36.270> like<00:01:36.420> AMD

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
really exciting times it looks like AMD

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.360 
really exciting times it looks like AMD
has<00:01:36.930> done<00:01:37.110> something<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.530> make<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.920> rift<00:01:38.100> semi

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
has done something to make the rift semi

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.190 
has done something to make the rift semi
compatible<00:01:39.000> with<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.330> latest<00:01:39.690> driver<00:01:39.930> and

compatible with this latest driver and

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.750 
compatible with this latest driver and
this<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.770> something<00:01:41.040> an<00:01:41.100> oculus<00:01:41.460> actually

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
this is something an oculus actually

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.730 
this is something an oculus actually
wasn't<00:01:42.030> able<00:01:42.120> to<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.510> I<00:01:42.750> haven't<00:01:43.260> tried

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
wasn't able to do I haven't tried

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.120 
wasn't able to do I haven't tried
putting<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.700> oculus<00:01:45.270> driver<00:01:45.990> yet<00:01:46.710> because

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
putting in the oculus driver yet because

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.620 
putting in the oculus driver yet because
I<00:01:47.250> don't<00:01:47.460> think<00:01:47.730> that<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.940> can<00:01:48.090> find<00:01:48.390> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
I don't think that it can find the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.590 
I don't think that it can find the
correct<00:01:48.870> registry<00:01:49.410> locations<00:01:49.920> for<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> new

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
correct registry locations for the new

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.450 
correct registry locations for the new
display<00:01:51.600> driver<00:01:51.900> model<00:01:52.050> for<00:01:52.650> the<00:01:52.830> screen<00:01:53.130> but

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
display driver model for the screen but

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.490 
display driver model for the screen but
this<00:01:53.940> is<00:01:54.090> really<00:01:54.270> good<00:01:54.480> news<00:01:54.510> before<00:01:55.290> we

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
this is really good news before we

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.750 
this is really good news before we
didn't<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:56.010> working<00:01:56.250> at<00:01:56.460> all<00:01:56.580> you

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
didn't have this working at all you

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.370 
didn't have this working at all you
couldn't<00:01:57.090> actually<00:01:57.300> run<00:01:57.750> extended<00:01:58.200> desktop

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
couldn't actually run extended desktop

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.980 
couldn't actually run extended desktop
and<00:01:58.830> oculus<00:01:59.820> cat<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.210> other<00:02:00.300> people<00:02:00.660> over<00:02:00.900> at

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
and oculus cat and other people over at

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.960 
and oculus cat and other people over at
oculus<00:02:01.410> had<00:02:01.620> stated<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.100> me<00:02:02.130> after<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:02.760> found

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
oculus had stated to me after I found

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.220 
oculus had stated to me after I found
the<00:02:03.090> bug<00:02:03.240> last<00:02:03.510> time<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.900> they<00:02:04.050> might

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
the bug last time that they might

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.420 
the bug last time that they might
actually<00:02:04.350> need<00:02:04.650> to<00:02:04.800> write<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.980> new<00:02:05.160> driver

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
actually need to write a new driver

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.719 
actually need to write a new driver
entirely<00:02:06.140> but<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.650> is<00:02:07.800> what<00:02:07.920> they<00:02:08.069> expected

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
entirely but this is what they expected

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.279 
entirely but this is what they expected
to<00:02:08.759> occur<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.450> think<00:02:09.659> a<00:02:09.719> problem<00:02:09.959> may<00:02:10.259> have

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
to occur and I think a problem may have

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.780 
to occur and I think a problem may have
had<00:02:10.469> something<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.829> do<00:02:10.920> with<00:02:10.950> AMD<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.489> general

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
had something to do with AMD in general

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.050 
had something to do with AMD in general
I'm<00:02:11.969> not<00:02:12.180> sure<00:02:12.569> but<00:02:12.930> good<00:02:13.499> day

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060
