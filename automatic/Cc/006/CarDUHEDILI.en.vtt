been rolled and we can freeze that I
think<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.229> sliced<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.670> but<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.729> got<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.880> do<00:01:05.970> I'm

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
think it sliced that but I got to do I'm

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.859 
think it sliced that but I got to do I'm
going<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.270> show<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.510> couple<00:01:06.750> different

that's already been

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.570 
that's already been
slicing<00:01:10.230> but<00:01:10.800> what<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:10.980> can<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.220> as<00:01:11.340> well<00:01:11.460> as

back to the school simplicity side of
things<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.610> wrap<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.900> freeze<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.050> and<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
things you wrap it freeze it and the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.960 
things you wrap it freeze it and the
great<00:01:19.800> thing<00:01:19.950> about<00:01:19.980> freezing<00:01:20.460> an<00:01:20.670> entirely

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
great thing about freezing an entirely

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
thinner than my nitrogen and when it's

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.320 
thinner than my nitrogen and when it's
frozen<00:02:23.510> when<00:02:24.470> it's<00:02:24.590> completely<00:02:25.010> frozen<00:02:25.330> you
