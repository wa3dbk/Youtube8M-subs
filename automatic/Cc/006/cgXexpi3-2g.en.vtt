00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
needs a different amount out of this so

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.970 
needs a different amount out of this so
for<00:00:45.110> this<00:00:45.200> image<00:00:45.790> our<00:00:46.790> presence<00:00:47.540> again<00:00:47.980> the

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
for this image our presence again the

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.729 
for this image our presence again the

channel<00:01:25.659> at<00:01:26.659> this<00:01:26.810> point<00:01:27.049> we<00:01:27.200> had<00:01:27.409> a<00:01:27.619> second

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
channel at this point we had a second

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.870 
channel at this point we had a second
alpha<00:01:29.270> channel<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:31.130> once<00:01:31.340> again<00:01:31.460> holding

ctrl pressing backspace we our image

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.100 
ctrl pressing backspace we our image
appears<00:01:36.409> again<00:01:37.299> this<00:01:38.299> point<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.750> image<00:01:38.930> will

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
appears again this point the image will

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.929 
appears again this point the image will
have<00:01:39.320> more<00:01:39.560> contrast<00:01:40.010> in<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.130> first<00:01:40.400> one<00:01:42.939> the

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
have more contrast in the first one the

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.960 
have more contrast in the first one the
next<00:01:44.240> step<00:01:44.420> is<00:01:44.600> once<00:01:45.140> again<00:01:45.229> to<00:01:45.590> deselect<00:01:45.970> the

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
next step is once again to deselect the

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.710 
next step is once again to deselect the
marching<00:01:47.330> ants<00:01:48.670> then<00:01:49.670> at<00:01:50.060> this<00:01:50.180> point<00:01:50.479> if<00:01:50.630> we

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
marching ants then at this point if we

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.770 
marching ants then at this point if we
try<00:01:50.900> to<00:01:50.960> flatten<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:51.380> image<00:01:51.409> i<00:01:51.650> use<00:01:51.890> it<00:01:52.100> there

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
try to flatten the image i use it there

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.510 
try to flatten the image i use it there
no<00:01:53.780> image<00:01:54.020> will<00:01:54.170> appear<00:01:54.500> because<00:01:54.860> we're<00:01:55.310> on

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
no image will appear because we're on

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.820 
no image will appear because we're on
the<00:01:55.640> alpha<00:01:55.880> channels<00:01:56.270> so<00:01:57.140> we<00:01:57.229> need<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.560> select

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
the alpha channels so we need to select

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.569 
the alpha channels so we need to select
all<00:01:58.220> of<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.580> image<00:01:58.790> by<00:01:58.939> pressing<00:01:58.970> ctrl<00:01:59.840> a<00:02:00.579> then

once<00:02:15.470> we<00:02:15.590> have<00:02:15.710> our<00:02:15.800> find<00:02:16.040> image<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.610> next

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
once we have our find image the next

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.000 
once we have our find image the next
step<00:02:17.090> is<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.390> adjust<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.930> image<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.680> how<00:02:18.950> we

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
step is to adjust the image to how we

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.220 
step is to adjust the image to how we
like<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.460> is<00:02:20.120> there<00:02:20.390> one<00:02:20.570> of<00:02:20.600> two<00:02:20.870> ways<00:02:21.050> of

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
like it is there one of two ways of

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.990 
like it is there one of two ways of
doing<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:21.530> but<00:02:22.430> I'm<00:02:22.520> sure<00:02:22.700> there<00:02:22.880> are<00:02:22.910> many

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
doing this but I'm sure there are many

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.240 
doing this but I'm sure there are many
more<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.930> first<00:02:24.170> one<00:02:24.470> are<00:02:24.710> the<00:02:24.860> first<00:02:25.070> way

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
more the first one are the first way

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.980 
more the first one are the first way
learn<00:02:25.520> to<00:02:25.670> do<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:25.910> with<00:02:26.090> with<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.540> brightness

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
learn to do it with with a brightness

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.540 
learn to do it with with a brightness
and<00:02:27.170> contrast<00:02:27.350> adjustment<00:02:28.310> lever<00:02:28.880> layer<00:02:29.480> and

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
and contrast adjustment lever layer and

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.730 
and contrast adjustment lever layer and
just<00:02:31.550> simply<00:02:31.880> slide<00:02:32.209> in<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.480> contrast<00:02:33.020> to<00:02:33.620> the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
just simply slide in the contrast to the

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.240 
just simply slide in the contrast to the
right<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:34.190> live<00:02:34.280> more<00:02:34.520> contrast<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:36.040> this<00:02:37.040> can

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
right to live more contrast and this can

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.680 
right to live more contrast and this can
work<00:02:37.370> well<00:02:37.550> for<00:02:37.640> some<00:02:37.790> images<00:02:38.150> but<00:02:38.450> doesn't

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
work well for some images but doesn't

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.560 
work well for some images but doesn't
work<00:02:38.840> that<00:02:39.530> well<00:02:39.709> for<00:02:39.770> all<00:02:40.070> so<00:02:41.030> if<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.240> go<00:02:41.270> back

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
work that well for all so if I go back

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:49.300 
work that well for all so if I go back
to<00:02:41.720> this<00:02:41.959> layer<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.350> delete<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:49.010> way<00:02:49.160> I've

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
to this layer and delete it the way I've

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.090 
to this layer and delete it the way I've
found<00:02:49.670> what's<00:02:50.330> best<00:02:50.570> for<00:02:50.720> me<00:02:50.810> is<00:02:50.840> use<00:02:51.350> curves

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
found what's best for me is use curves

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.380 
found what's best for me is use curves
and<00:02:52.930> then<00:02:53.930> using<00:02:54.290> this<00:02:54.380> little<00:02:55.390> selector

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
and then using this little selector

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.100 
and then using this little selector
that's<00:02:56.870> on<00:02:57.080> cs4<00:02:58.150> pressing<00:02:59.150> on<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.390> area<00:03:00.050> I

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
that's on cs4 pressing on the area I

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.820 
that's on cs4 pressing on the area I
want<00:03:00.320> to<00:03:00.470> darken<00:03:01.270> and<00:03:02.270> just<00:03:03.140> hold<00:03:03.380> in<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:03.680> drag

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
want to darken and just hold in and drag

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.400 
want to darken and just hold in and drag
an<00:03:03.950> app<00:03:04.040> doubt<00:03:04.280> that<00:03:04.489> curve<00:03:04.730> down<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.360> then<00:03:06.140> on

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
an app doubt that curve down and then on

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.390 
an app doubt that curve down and then on
the<00:03:06.560> area<00:03:06.830> once<00:03:07.010> brighton<00:03:07.489> &amp;<00:03:08.080> dragon<00:03:09.080> that<00:03:09.200> up
