anything he goes into his greninja just

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.370 
anything he goes into his greninja just
I<00:01:25.710> guess<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.159> sack<00:01:26.430> up<00:01:26.460> why<00:01:27.060> for<00:01:27.390> recoil<00:01:27.990> maybe

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
I guess to sack up why for recoil maybe

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.499 
I guess to sack up why for recoil maybe
hoping<00:01:28.619> out<00:01:28.799> speed<00:01:29.130> me<00:01:29.340> or<00:01:29.490> something<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.360> I

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
hoping out speed me or something and I

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.690 
hoping out speed me or something and I
just<00:01:30.750> kill<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.290> frustration<00:01:31.610> you<00:01:32.610> go

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
just kill that with frustration you go

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.390 
just kill that with frustration you go
into<00:01:32.939> his<00:01:33.150> Aerodactyl<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.560> mega<00:01:34.799> evolves

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
into his Aerodactyl and a mega evolves

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.340 
into his Aerodactyl and a mega evolves
into<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.670> broken<00:01:35.909> image<00:01:36.390> but<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.840> out<00:01:37.020> speed

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
into a broken image but I just out speed

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.840 
into a broken image but I just out speed
it<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.619> one<00:01:37.860> shot<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.280> with<00:01:38.369> wild<00:01:38.700> charge

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
it in one shot it with wild charge

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.270 
it in one shot it with wild charge
anyways<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:40.079> after<00:01:40.350> all<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.590> recoil<00:01:41.009> I've

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
anyways and after all the recoil I've

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.100 
anyways and after all the recoil I've
just<00:01:41.909> enough<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:43.850> kill<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.119> incoming<00:01:45.540> heatran

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
just enough to kill the incoming heatran

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.440 
just enough to kill the incoming heatran
with<00:01:46.320> earthquake<00:01:46.950> because<00:01:47.220> guess<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.180> no

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
with earthquake because guess it no

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.990 
with earthquake because guess it no
diggersby<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.290> part<00:01:49.680> normal<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.250> part<00:01:50.729> ground

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
diggersby is part normal and part ground

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.700 
diggersby is part normal and part ground
which<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.360> that

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
which is that

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.399 
which is that
pretty<00:01:52.430> nice<00:01:52.640> combination<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:54.049> now<00:01:54.200> it's

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
pretty nice combination so now it's

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.160 
pretty nice combination so now it's

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.610 
instead so this florges is going to give
me<00:02:40.250> a<00:02:40.340> lot<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:40.550> problems<00:02:40.940> right<00:02:41.120> now<00:02:41.690> we're

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
me a lot of problems right now we're

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.460 
me a lot of problems right now we're
just<00:02:43.180> just<00:02:44.180> like<00:02:44.360> throwing<00:02:44.930> around<00:02:45.080> weak

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470

attacks<00:02:45.739> i'm<00:02:46.010> hoping<00:02:46.670> for<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.910> burn<00:02:47.180> because

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
attacks i'm hoping for the burn because

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.750 
attacks i'm hoping for the burn because
I<00:02:47.870> pretty<00:02:48.290> sure<00:02:48.470> lava<00:02:48.709> plume<00:02:49.070> has<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.519> same

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
I pretty sure lava plume has the same

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.690 
I pretty sure lava plume has the same
chance<00:02:50.060> of<00:02:50.239> burning<00:02:50.450> as<00:02:50.870> scald<00:02:51.650> but<00:02:52.430> it<00:02:52.550> takes

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
chance of burning as scald but it takes

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.759 
chance of burning as scald but it takes
me<00:02:52.880> like<00:02:52.970> seven<00:02:53.600> turns<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:54.080> finally<00:02:54.500> get<00:02:54.620> the

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
me like seven turns to finally get the

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.250 
me like seven turns to finally get the
burn<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.310> as<00:02:55.760> you'll<00:02:55.970> see<00:02:56.239> in<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.660> few<00:02:57.019> turns

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
burn and as you'll see in a few turns

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.250 
burn and as you'll see in a few turns
actually<00:02:57.920> turns<00:02:58.459> out<00:02:58.610> to<00:02:58.670> be<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:58.970> waste<00:02:59.269> so<00:02:59.900> this

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
actually turns out to be a waste so this

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.530 
actually turns out to be a waste so this
yeah<00:03:00.769> this<00:03:01.040> turn<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.610> finally<00:03:01.910> get<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.299> burn

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540
