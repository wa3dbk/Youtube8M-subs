said earlier you can buy stuff from
survival<00:01:48.180> shops<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.630> water<00:01:49.290> will<00:01:49.500> keep<00:01:49.740> for

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
survival shops that water will keep for

up<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.220> five<00:01:50.460> years<00:01:50.490> i<00:01:50.939> don't<00:01:51.149> think<00:01:51.390> that's

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
up to five years i don't think that's

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.840 
up to five years i don't think that's
practical<00:01:52.259> at<00:01:52.409> all<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.829> that's<00:01:53.549> another

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
practical at all and that's another

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.160 
practical at all and that's another
reason<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.299> I've<00:01:54.540> talked<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.049> about

reason that I've talked to you about

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.780 
reason that I've talked to you about
knowing<00:01:55.619> where<00:01:55.770> your<00:01:55.950> neighborhood<00:01:56.399> funnels

knowing where your neighborhood funnels
are<00:01:56.969> something<00:01:57.899> else<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.439> may<00:01:58.619> want<00:01:58.860> to

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
are something else that you may want to

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.709 
are something else that you may want to
consider<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.399> where<00:01:59.670> if<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.240> don't<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.689> a

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
consider is where if you don't have a

to gather water you're going to have to

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.560 
to gather water you're going to have to
find<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.009> somewhere<00:02:05.579> now<00:02:06.000> if<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.450> got

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
find it somewhere now if you got

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.540 
find it somewhere now if you got

although<00:02:36.459> today<00:02:36.760> that's<00:02:37.000> just<00:02:37.120> used<00:02:37.510> for

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:37.689 
although today that's just used for

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.330 
although today that's just used for
storage<00:02:38.049> but<00:02:38.079> in<00:02:38.379> the<00:02:38.469> event<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.799> i<00:02:38.980> need

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
storage but in the event that i need

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.309 
storage but in the event that i need
that<00:02:39.370> because<00:02:39.879> my<00:02:40.209> other<00:02:40.329> sources<00:02:40.780> dried<00:02:41.079> at

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
that because my other sources dried at

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.559 
that because my other sources dried at
least<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.709> can<00:02:41.859> start<00:02:42.069> capturing<00:02:42.340> water<00:02:42.879> in

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:43.569 
least I can start capturing water in

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.509 
least I can start capturing water in
that<00:02:44.139> area<00:02:44.939> now<00:02:45.939> I<00:02:47.159> don't<00:02:48.159> think<00:02:48.400> it's

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
that area now I don't think it's

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.629 
that area now I don't think it's
practical<00:02:48.969> to<00:02:49.060> keep<00:02:49.239> water<00:02:49.450> for<00:02:49.689> five<00:02:49.870> years<00:02:50.639> I

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
practical to keep water for five years I

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.819 
practical to keep water for five years I
think<00:02:52.629> it's<00:02:52.750> more<00:02:52.810> practical<00:02:53.199> to<00:02:53.500> learn<00:02:53.799> how

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
think it's more practical to learn how

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.509 
think it's more practical to learn how
to<00:02:54.040> filter<00:02:54.310> water<00:02:54.430> or<00:02:55.150> treat<00:02:55.780> water<00:02:56.250> for<00:02:57.250> your

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
to filter water or treat water for your

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.740 
to filter water or treat water for your
drinking<00:02:58.030> needs<00:02:59.969> another<00:03:00.969> source<00:03:01.359> of<00:03:01.510> water

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
drinking needs another source of water

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.379 
drinking needs another source of water
that<00:03:01.989> you<00:03:02.139> may<00:03:02.290> think<00:03:02.349> is<00:03:02.739> a<00:03:03.040> cistern<00:03:03.669> we<00:03:04.209> have
