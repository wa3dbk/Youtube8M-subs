00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
collections together II give like a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.890 
collections together II give like a
bigger<00:00:45.410> sort<00:00:46.400> of<00:00:46.460> choice<00:00:46.760> and<00:00:47.180> it's<00:00:47.720> also

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
bigger sort of choice and it's also

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.110 
bigger sort of choice and it's also
