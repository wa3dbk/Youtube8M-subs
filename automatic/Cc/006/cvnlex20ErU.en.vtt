00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.459
 U 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.740
 won 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.000
 222 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.000
 Here is more Cine first floor 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:24.880
 If such ground floor Sign the damage total cumulative damage accumulated over 50 million 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:29.560
 Or take a hundred fish. 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.810
 4 Max Baron is also cleared easily if you only use one skill 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.349
 I'll go over. 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.349
 You guys are clear. 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:46.120
 It's the second floor. You're not going to be among the oldest. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.110
 It would not be who appreciates the hardest word Now the second floor looked good, then follow 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.890
 I think it will. 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.930
 Look at you. What you guys make the most mistake is the second floor 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.070
 You may find it difficult to 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:02.500
 Because I do not see it. 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:04.869
 Wondering what really matters is you see the jump went off a jump, for example, 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.470
 There's someone like that. 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.320
 Those of us who are doing this drop by almost 99%. 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.940
 because 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:19.650
 Because distance is more than thought, distance is more than thought, and if you do this most 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:24.780
 If you stop like this, you stop, you stop, 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.390
 It's a routine, but that's a better way than this 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:33.240
 Just go right. 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:37.440
 Then do not pull out the right hand . 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.070
 I want you to jump in time with this timing, 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.220
 Yo 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:48.119
 Oh, right here. 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:49.710
 So, jump, jump, jump, jump, Showtime is also a little market so easily hasimyeo 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.300
 Where you can come 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:59.340
 In the case of me, I will remember the road, but it will be much easier. 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:07.050
 When you first click all the way to the right, you should've nureusigo 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:11.850
 Go Down Go Jump Jump Jump Jump Jump Jump Jump Jump 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.709
 So the timing in this way you control the game does living as do more 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.950
 You 'd better go up . 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:20.380
 4 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:26.440
 You're more comfortable with this kind of thing. It 's on the third floor. On the third floor, 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:30.820
 I really like it . It's really good to have a break. 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:34.660
 Gonna take pleasure to know why there is a book shaking Jama 1000 to know 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:39.160
 But you do not have to go up one for every one, just ten 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:42.220
 It goes up to nine hits of one . 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.970
 Cheonggyeong There might be thinking you've not take so long to do something this year 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.120
 It's just that it took him a long time, so it's important that you see a steady 1000. 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:55.300
 And those who have capital are the best. 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.930
 Erie dropped us cuddling Where more wrapper eggs come good 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.930
 Please note 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.890
 So you can fill 5000 10000 20000 and you can get 1,000 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.840
 You only have to fill the dog. 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.200
 When you leave, it goes up all the time. 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.370
 One 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.720
 What time do you go up 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.720
 You can do it this way. 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:22.260
 I'll see what I can get 1000 times soon. 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:26.460
 And most importantly, do not gamble here. 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:30.360

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:35.430
 That word is not recommended hasineunge That's good, not to.You 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:40.950
 O on the screen when trying to attract more air time, but rather why do right-thirds 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:45.600
 I think that it is best to keep the field together. 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.850
 Now I drive spur 28're putting items in from the ability to embed 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.770
 So it's a little better. 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:56.850
 It's okay if you collect it like this , 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:01.200
 If good characters are good reasons for Showdown, I want to apply 3. 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.490
 I've got a lot of drops in it. 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.980

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:12.330

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.920
 Isabelle-charie, etc. 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.400
