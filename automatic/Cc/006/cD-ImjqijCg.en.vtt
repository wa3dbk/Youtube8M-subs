when<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.420> film<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.079> video<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.620> basically<00:00:45.170> okay

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
when I film this video of basically okay

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.950 
when I film this video of basically okay
so<00:00:48.200> let's<00:00:49.200> go<00:00:49.410> over<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.680> tether<00:00:49.950> status<00:00:50.460> now

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
so let's go over the tether status now

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.319 
so let's go over the tether status now
the<00:00:51.960> tether<00:00:52.199> status<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:53.059> tethered<00:00:54.059> which

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the tether status is tethered which

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.889 
the tether status is tethered which
means<00:00:54.629> every<00:00:54.899> time<00:00:56.059> you<00:00:57.059> want<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.480> reboot<00:00:57.780> your

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
means every time you want to reboot your

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.260 
means every time you want to reboot your
device<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:59.219> exit<00:00:59.609> if<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.940> want<00:01:00.149> to

that<00:01:16.860> software<00:01:17.220> or<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> jailbreak<00:01:18.030> again<00:01:18.710> for

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
that software or the jailbreak again for

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.560 
that software or the jailbreak again for
it<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.950> boot<00:01:20.189> your<00:01:20.220> high<00:01:20.729> device<00:01:21.060> integer

it to boot your high device integer

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.980 
it to boot your high device integer
Brett<00:01:21.869> jailbroken<00:01:22.530> mod<00:01:23.270> so<00:01:24.270> where's

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
Brett jailbroken mod so where's

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.260 
Brett jailbroken mod so where's
untethered<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.220> don't<00:01:26.430> need<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.909> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
untethered you don't need to it's a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.730 
untethered you don't need to it's a
bootrom<00:01:27.840> exploit<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.439> therefore<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.640> x

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
bootrom exploit and therefore is x

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.429 
bootrom exploit and therefore is x
basically<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.890> ones<00:01:32.189> on<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:33.570> bootrom<00:01:33.930> when

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
basically just ones on the bootrom when

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.280 
basically just ones on the bootrom when
you<00:01:34.530> boot<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.189> allows<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.210> boot<00:01:37.110> up

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
you boot up and allows it to boot up

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.140 
you boot up and allows it to boot up
instead<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.220> kernel<00:01:38.610> panics<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
instead of the kernel panics and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.219 
instead of the kernel panics and
whatever<00:01:39.840> i<00:01:39.960> think<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.470> kernel<00:01:40.770> panic

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
whatever i think it's a kernel panic

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.710 
whatever i think it's a kernel panic
