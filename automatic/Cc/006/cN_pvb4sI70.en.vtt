what's<00:00:01.079> up<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.260> is<00:00:01.319> insanity<00:00:01.650> and<00:00:02.070> today<00:00:02.399> we

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
what's up this is insanity and today we

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.329 
what's up this is insanity and today we
learn<00:00:02.639> what's<00:00:03.240> called<00:00:03.540> a<00:00:03.780> hook<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.920> a<00:00:04.950> cold

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
learn what's called a hook to a cold

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.980 
learn what's called a hook to a cold
basically<00:00:05.850> footwork<00:00:06.240> variation<00:00:06.750> that<00:00:06.899> you

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
basically footwork variation that you

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.879 
basically footwork variation that you
could<00:00:07.109> also<00:00:07.259> use<00:00:07.410> as<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:08.490> flow<00:00:09.210> variation<00:00:09.929> so<00:00:10.349> it

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
could also use as a flow variation so it

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.289 
could also use as a flow variation so it
starts<00:00:11.370> off<00:00:11.519> with<00:00:12.019> simple<00:00:13.019> hook<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.580> we're

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
starts off with simple hook and we're

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.519 
starts off with simple hook and we're
going<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.570> move<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.850> behind<00:00:17.850> our<00:00:18.029> knee<00:00:18.180> and

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:18.529 
going to move it to behind our knee and

look like you're going too cold but you
go<00:00:56.460> all<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.820> way<00:00:56.850> around

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
go all the way around

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.610 
go all the way around
and<00:00:58.380> then<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.040> cool<00:00:59.520> I'm<00:01:00.270> gonna<00:01:00.390> go<00:01:00.600> wrap<00:01:00.809> this

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
and then you cool I'm gonna go wrap this

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.149 
and then you cool I'm gonna go wrap this
all<00:01:01.829> goes<00:01:02.010> here<00:01:02.309> hook<00:01:03.320> fake<00:01:06.260> down<00:01:07.260> almost<00:01:07.890> like

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
all goes here hook fake down almost like

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.020 
all goes here hook fake down almost like
adding<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.090> Zulu<00:01:09.330> spin<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:10.550> to<00:01:11.550> this<00:01:11.670> variation

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
adding a Zulu spin to to this variation

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.859 
adding a Zulu spin to to this variation
so<00:01:12.900> one<00:01:13.110> more<00:01:13.229> time<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.619> goes<00:01:13.770> hook<00:01:15.290> around

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
so one more time it goes hook around

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.010 
so one more time it goes hook around
colt<00:01:19.520> back<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.550> starting<00:01:20.940> position<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.869> can

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
colt back a starting position you can

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.710 
colt back a starting position you can
add<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.410> into<00:01:22.680> your<00:01:23.340> your<00:01:23.610> flows<00:01:24.000> as<00:01:24.270> well<00:01:24.300> so

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
add this into your your flows as well so

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.749 
add this into your your flows as well so
say<00:01:24.930> for<00:01:24.960> example<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.070> do<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.729> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
say for example so you do like a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.800 
say for example so you do like a
scorpion<00:01:28.430> around<00:01:29.430> here<00:01:31.190> well<00:01:32.360> alright<00:01:33.390> or<00:01:33.600> say

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
scorpion around here well alright or say

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.279 
scorpion around here well alright or say
if<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.050> want<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.320> do<00:01:34.500> maybe<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.550> sweep<00:01:36.289> sweep

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
if you want to do maybe a sweep sweep

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:44.749 
if you want to do maybe a sweep sweep
around<00:01:39.979> boom<00:01:41.330> back<00:01:42.410> alright<00:01:43.410> so<00:01:43.800> again<00:01:44.460> you

around boom back alright so again you

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.279 
around boom back alright so again you
can<00:01:44.910> turn<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.210> into<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.509> footwork<00:01:45.869> pattern

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
can turn this into a footwork pattern

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.020 
can turn this into a footwork pattern
you<00:01:46.440> can<00:01:46.530> add<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:46.830> to<00:01:46.890> your<00:01:47.039> flow<00:01:47.399> there's<00:01:47.940> a
