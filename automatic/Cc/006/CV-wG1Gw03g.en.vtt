I<00:02:06.420> won't<00:02:06.750> know<00:02:06.899> exactly<00:02:07.110> what<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.649> call<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.860> but

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
I won't know exactly what to call it but

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.859 
I won't know exactly what to call it but
it's<00:02:08.220> really<00:02:08.369> it's<00:02:09.000> really<00:02:09.119> high<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:09.690> almost

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869

the<00:02:10.050> height<00:02:10.229> limit<00:02:10.590> I'm<00:02:10.940> assuming<00:02:11.940> because

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
the height limit I'm assuming because

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.730 
the height limit I'm assuming because
it's<00:02:12.330> just<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:12.569> high<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.230> sky

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740

an ocean biome I guess you could say and
it<00:02:43.860> goes<00:02:44.430> back<00:02:44.540> over<00:02:45.540> here<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.620> that's<00:02:46.980> the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
it goes back over here and that's the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.200 
it goes back over here and that's the
end<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.340> map<00:02:47.490> right<00:02:47.700> there<00:02:47.990> so<00:02:49.520> yeah<00:02:50.520> you
