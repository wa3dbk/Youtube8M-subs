 everyone here, by the way, you get that 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.200

 sure a nice one 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.459
 but if I would really really choose somewhere 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.930
 I think I seem to opt for ballet 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.910
 maybe very boring but you have to 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.380
 actually do a lot a lot 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.390
