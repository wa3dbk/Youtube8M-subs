talk to you guys about HMV HMV is a

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.980 
talk to you guys about HMV HMV is a
metabolite<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.980> amino<00:00:14.250> acid<00:00:14.340> leucine

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
metabolite of the amino acid leucine

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.029 
metabolite of the amino acid leucine
leucine<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.260> one<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.710> branched-chain

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039

leucine is one of the branched-chain
amino<00:00:17.250> acids<00:00:18.320> the<00:00:19.320> branched<00:00:19.830> chain<00:00:19.980> amino

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
amino acids the branched chain amino

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.590 
amino acids the branched chain amino
acids<00:00:20.580> are<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.760> ones<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.000> get<00:00:21.180> talked<00:00:21.359> about

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
acids are the ones that get talked about

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.540 
acids are the ones that get talked about
all<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.779> time<00:00:21.990> because<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:23.189> their<00:00:23.310> abundance

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
all the time because of their abundance

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.330 
all the time because of their abundance
and<00:00:23.970> muscle<00:00:24.240> tissue<00:00:24.859> specifically<00:00:25.859> leucine

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
and muscle tissue specifically leucine

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.890 
and muscle tissue specifically leucine
is<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.760> one<00:00:26.939> that's<00:00:27.119> responsible<00:00:27.330> for

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
is the one that's responsible for

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.839 
is the one that's responsible for
increased<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.680> there<00:00:28.830> are<00:00:28.920> for<00:00:29.189> activating

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
increased it there are for activating

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.759 
increased it there are for activating
muscle<00:00:30.210> protein<00:00:30.570> synthesis<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.260> that's<00:00:31.679> why

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
muscle protein synthesis so that's why

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.069 
muscle protein synthesis so that's why
you<00:00:31.830> hear<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> lot<00:00:32.250> about<00:00:32.279> leucine<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.090> when

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
you hear a lot about leucine and when

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.930 
you hear a lot about leucine and when
you<00:00:34.170> take<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.590> leucine<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.130> your<00:00:35.219> body<00:00:35.399> about

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
you take in leucine in your body about

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.720 
you take in leucine in your body about
5%<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.989> gets<00:00:37.170> converted<00:00:37.350> into<00:00:37.739> hmd<00:00:38.460> it's

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
5% of it gets converted into hmd it's

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.190 
5% of it gets converted into hmd it's
gets<00:00:38.910> metabolized<00:00:39.059> there's<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.750> couple<00:00:39.930> steps

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
gets metabolized there's a couple steps

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.310 
gets metabolized there's a couple steps
turns<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.190> hmb<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:42.120> HMV<00:00:42.600> has<00:00:42.750> some<00:00:42.930> unique

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
turns in hmb so HMV has some unique

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.010 
turns in hmb so HMV has some unique
benefits<00:00:43.670> that<00:00:44.670> are<00:00:44.820> independent<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.660> loosing

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
benefits that are independent of loosing

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.770 
benefits that are independent of loosing
yes<00:00:46.230> leucine<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.950> source<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.300> we'll

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
yes leucine is the source of it so we'll

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.770 
yes leucine is the source of it so we'll
focus<00:00:49.110> on<00:00:49.230> HIV<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.800> HMV<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.760> anti<00:00:51.270> catabolic

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
focus on HIV and HMV is anti catabolic

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.840 
focus on HIV and HMV is anti catabolic
specifically<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.739> helps<00:00:53.219> your<00:00:53.340> body<00:00:53.520> stop

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
specifically it helps your body stop

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.479 
specifically it helps your body stop
from<00:00:54.090> breaking<00:00:54.539> down<00:00:54.570> muscle<00:00:54.930> tissue<00:00:55.489> whereas

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
from breaking down muscle tissue whereas

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.799 
from breaking down muscle tissue whereas
leucine<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> other<00:00:57.360> end<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.660> more

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
leucine on the other end is more

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.450 
leucine on the other end is more
responsible<00:00:58.469> for<00:00:58.710> because<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.250> know<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
responsible for because you know the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.819 
responsible for because you know the
other<00:00:59.579> 95%<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.629> not<00:01:00.750> being<00:01:00.809> diverted<00:01:01.289> hmb

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
other 95% of it not being diverted hmb

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.590 
other 95% of it not being diverted hmb
is<00:01:02.070> going<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.699> be<00:01:02.789> increasing<00:01:03.239> protein

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
is going to be increasing protein

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.080 
is going to be increasing protein
synthesis<00:01:04.080> now<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.619> question<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.430> HMV<00:01:06.060> a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
synthesis now the question is is HMV a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.820 
synthesis now the question is is HMV a
rate<00:01:06.450> limiting<00:01:06.630> factor<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.470> for<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.680> matter

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
rate limiting factor and for that matter

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.160 
rate limiting factor and for that matter
our<00:01:08.130> BCA<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.850> rate<00:01:09.390> limiting<00:01:09.689> factor<00:01:09.720> that

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
our BCA is a rate limiting factor that

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.440 
our BCA is a rate limiting factor that
really<00:01:10.380> depends<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:11.189> have<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> video<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.700> BCAAs

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
really depends we have a video on BCAAs

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.149 
really depends we have a video on BCAAs
which<00:01:12.720> will<00:01:12.900> link<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.290> we<00:01:13.650> kind<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.920> go<00:01:14.010> into

going to go do a good job at preventing
some<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.710> muscle<00:02:02.100> from<00:02:02.430> being<00:02:02.640> burned

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
some of that muscle from being burned

some of that muscle from being burned
maybe<00:02:04.649> but<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.610> question<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.060> compared<00:02:06.479> to

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
maybe but the question is compared to

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.199 
maybe but the question is compared to
what<00:02:06.780> HMP<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.799> not<00:02:07.950> cheap<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.849> do<00:02:09.030> want

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
what HMP is not cheap so if you do want

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.240 
what HMP is not cheap so if you do want
to<00:02:09.239> take<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:10.050> got<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.379> take<00:02:10.560> about<00:02:10.800> three

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
to take it you got to take about three

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.640 
to take it you got to take about three
to<00:02:11.280> four

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
to four

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.649 
to four
grams<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:12.099> day<00:02:12.129> don't<00:02:12.760> really<00:02:13.090> go<00:02:13.209> beyond<00:02:13.510> that

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
grams a day don't really go beyond that

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:15.119 
grams a day don't really go beyond that
at<00:02:13.810> some<00:02:13.989> point<00:02:14.230> it's<00:02:14.379> diminishing<00:02:14.799> returns

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
at some point it's diminishing returns

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.130 
at some point it's diminishing returns
and<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.370> costs<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.670> lot<00:02:15.790> of<00:02:15.849> money<00:02:16.030> if<00:02:16.780> you<00:02:16.959> do

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
and it costs a lot of money if you do

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.750 
and it costs a lot of money if you do
use<00:02:17.379> it<00:02:17.560> use<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.220> divided<00:02:18.640> doses

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
use it use it and divided doses

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.520 
use it use it and divided doses
throughout<00:02:19.269> the<00:02:19.390> day<00:02:19.569> if<00:02:19.780> you're<00:02:20.170> using<00:02:20.319> it

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
throughout the day if you're using it

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.660 
throughout the day if you're using it
for<00:02:20.560> an<00:02:20.709> acute<00:02:20.980> effect<00:02:21.280> cuz<00:02:21.400> you're<00:02:21.489> going<00:02:21.610> to

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
for an acute effect cuz you're going to

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.160 
for an acute effect cuz you're going to
Train<00:02:21.849> fasted<00:02:22.299> you<00:02:22.360> want<00:02:22.480> to<00:02:22.569> use<00:02:22.659> about<00:02:22.750> three

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
Train fasted you want to use about three

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.259 
Train fasted you want to use about three
grams<00:02:23.470> about<00:02:23.650> an<00:02:23.829> hour<00:02:23.950> before<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.430> train<00:02:24.670> now

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
grams about an hour before you train now

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.449 
grams about an hour before you train now
when<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:25.989> say<00:02:26.200> maybe<00:02:26.470> that<00:02:26.799> means<00:02:27.040> compared<00:02:27.400> to

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
when I say maybe that means compared to

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.940 
when I say maybe that means compared to
what<00:02:27.640> well<00:02:28.120> I<00:02:28.450> would<00:02:28.959> just<00:02:29.200> say<00:02:29.409> you<00:02:29.439> could

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
what well I would just say you could

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.250 
what well I would just say you could
maybe<00:02:30.220> use<00:02:30.489> five<00:02:31.180> grams<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.659> whey<00:02:31.810> protein

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
maybe use five grams of whey protein

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.080 
maybe use five grams of whey protein
which<00:02:32.409> has<00:02:32.769> plenty<00:02:33.220> of<00:02:33.370> leucine<00:02:33.819> in<00:02:33.939> there

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
which has plenty of leucine in there

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.640 
which has plenty of leucine in there
some<00:02:34.540> of<00:02:34.659> that<00:02:34.720> leucine<00:02:35.170> is<00:02:35.230> going<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.560> be

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
some of that leucine is going to be

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.649 
some of that leucine is going to be
converted<00:02:36.040> into<00:02:36.159> hmb<00:02:36.730> plus<00:02:37.239> you're<00:02:37.420> getting

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659 
converted into hmb plus you're getting

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.839 
converted into hmb plus you're getting
all<00:02:37.870> 20<00:02:38.230> amino<00:02:38.260> acids<00:02:38.980> never<00:02:39.459> mind<00:02:39.700> other

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
all 20 amino acids never mind other

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.460 
all 20 amino acids never mind other
benefits<00:02:40.359> beyond<00:02:40.599> that<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:40.989> I<00:02:41.049> say<00:02:41.260> weigh

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
benefits beyond that and I say weigh

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.599 
benefits beyond that and I say weigh
because<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.920> tends<00:02:42.099> to<00:02:42.189> sit<00:02:42.340> in<00:02:42.400> your<00:02:42.489> stomach

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
because it tends to sit in your stomach

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.910 
because it tends to sit in your stomach
really<00:02:43.030> well<00:02:43.329> around<00:02:44.019> training<00:02:44.440> that's<00:02:44.739> my

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
really well around training that's my

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.589 
really well around training that's my
personal<00:02:45.430> preference<00:02:45.909> I<00:02:46.000> find<00:02:46.269> it<00:02:46.389> doesn't

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
personal preference I find it doesn't

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:47.610 
personal preference I find it doesn't
mean<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.750> weigh<00:02:46.870> me<00:02:46.930> down<00:02:47.049> or<00:02:47.319> anything<00:02:47.440> like

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
mean to weigh me down or anything like

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.879 
mean to weigh me down or anything like
that

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
that

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:51.000 
that
I<00:02:48.040> don't<00:02:48.609> pun<00:02:48.760> intended<00:02:48.879> but<00:02:49.629> see<00:02:50.319> how<00:02:50.500> options

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
I don't pun intended but see how options

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.000 
I don't pun intended but see how options
is<00:02:51.129> the<00:02:51.250> point<00:02:51.870> now<00:02:52.870> if<00:02:53.170> H<00:02:53.409> and<00:02:53.560> B<00:02:53.590> is<00:02:53.769> in<00:02:53.799> a

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
is the point now if H and B is in a

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.339 
is the point now if H and B is in a
supplement<00:02:54.400> that<00:02:54.519> you<00:02:54.639> really<00:02:54.940> really<00:02:55.030> like

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
supplement that you really really like

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.300 
supplement that you really really like
they<00:02:56.349> and<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:56.769> like<00:02:56.950> all<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.189> other

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
they and you like all the other

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.410 
they and you like all the other
ingredients<00:02:57.459> it's<00:02:58.000> not<00:02:58.120> like<00:02:58.239> hey<00:02:58.389> I

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
ingredients it's not like hey I

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.670 
ingredients it's not like hey I
shouldn't<00:02:58.989> take<00:02:59.109> it<00:02:59.260> because<00:02:59.349> like<00:02:59.530> I<00:02:59.620> said

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
shouldn't take it because like I said

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.619 
shouldn't take it because like I said
there<00:03:00.459> is<00:03:00.579> some<00:03:00.760> interesting<00:03:01.150> research<00:03:01.299> on

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
there is some interesting research on

hmb most of the most interesting
research<00:03:03.370> and<00:03:03.760> effects<00:03:04.000> are<00:03:04.329> going<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.629> be<00:03:04.720> for

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
research and effects are going to be for

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.179 
research and effects are going to be for
populations<00:03:05.620> where<00:03:05.739> they<00:03:05.799> have<00:03:05.889> muscle

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:06.189 
populations where they have muscle

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:07.440 
populations where they have muscle
wasting<00:03:06.519> diseases<00:03:06.790> actually<00:03:07.090> there's<00:03:07.359> some

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
wasting diseases actually there's some

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.729 
wasting diseases actually there's some
interesting<00:03:07.780> stuff<00:03:07.989> there<00:03:08.109> but<00:03:08.139> for

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
interesting stuff there but for

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.050 
interesting stuff there but for
otherwise<00:03:09.069> healthy<00:03:09.489> adults<00:03:09.939> you<00:03:10.030> have

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
otherwise healthy adults you have

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.059 
otherwise healthy adults you have
alternatives<00:03:10.840> especially<00:03:11.620> focusing<00:03:12.010> on

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
alternatives especially focusing on

to waste away and lose all my muscle

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.400 
to waste away and lose all my muscle
tissue<00:03:18.669> if<00:03:19.000> it's<00:03:19.449> worth<00:03:19.599> it<00:03:19.810> hey<00:03:19.930> give<00:03:20.230> it<00:03:20.349> a

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
tissue if it's worth it hey give it a

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.839 
tissue if it's worth it hey give it a
shot<00:03:20.590> as<00:03:20.799> I<00:03:20.919> said<00:03:21.099> there<00:03:21.250> is<00:03:21.370> some<00:03:21.639> positive

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
shot as I said there is some positive

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.000 
shot as I said there is some positive
research<00:03:22.419> in<00:03:22.569> that<00:03:22.720> realm<00:03:22.930> but<00:03:23.620> again<00:03:23.859> I<00:03:23.889> don't

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
research in that realm but again I don't

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.800 
research in that realm but again I don't
want<00:03:24.370> to<00:03:24.400> make<00:03:24.549> it<00:03:24.669> seem<00:03:24.849> like<00:03:24.879> hey<00:03:25.239> you<00:03:25.569> have

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
want to make it seem like hey you have

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.899 
want to make it seem like hey you have
to<00:03:26.139> use<00:03:26.169> this<00:03:26.470> if<00:03:26.680> you're<00:03:26.829> cutting<00:03:27.099> it's<00:03:27.549> just

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:27.909 
to use this if you're cutting it's just

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.119 
to use this if you're cutting it's just
not<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.150> case<00:03:28.389> it<00:03:28.840> can<00:03:29.139> be<00:03:29.319> used<00:03:29.530> by<00:03:29.709> men<00:03:29.980> or

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
not the case it can be used by men or

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.119 
not the case it can be used by men or
women<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:30.609> again<00:03:31.569> just<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.810> recap<00:03:31.989> it<00:03:32.650> is<00:03:32.859> a

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
women and again just to recap it is a

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.159 
women and again just to recap it is a
metabolite<00:03:33.760> of<00:03:33.970> leucine<00:03:34.449> so<00:03:34.720> if<00:03:34.989> you're

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:35.169 
metabolite of leucine so if you're

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:37.110 
metabolite of leucine so if you're
loosing<00:03:35.859> intake<00:03:36.190> I<00:03:36.400> eat<00:03:36.579> your<00:03:36.730> protein<00:03:36.849> and

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
loosing intake I eat your protein and

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.050 
loosing intake I eat your protein and
take<00:03:37.359> a<00:03:37.389> sample<00:03:37.659> I<00:03:38.040> really<00:03:39.040> don't<00:03:39.340> think<00:03:39.459> I<00:03:39.819> put

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
take a sample I really don't think I put

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.819 
take a sample I really don't think I put
it<00:03:40.180> in<00:03:40.269> a<00:03:40.359> need<00:03:40.569> it's<00:03:41.019> one<00:03:41.290> of<00:03:41.409> those<00:03:41.500> things

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
it in a need it's one of those things

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.460 
it in a need it's one of those things
that<00:03:42.010> if<00:03:42.340> it<00:03:42.940> fits<00:03:43.150> your<00:03:43.239> budget<00:03:43.419> and<00:03:43.900> you<00:03:44.379> know

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
that if it fits your budget and you know

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.050 
that if it fits your budget and you know
you<00:03:44.530> want<00:03:44.709> to<00:03:44.799> give<00:03:44.889> it<00:03:44.979> a<00:03:45.010> shot<00:03:45.250> by<00:03:45.879> all<00:03:46.030> means

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
you want to give it a shot by all means

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.059 
you want to give it a shot by all means
there's<00:03:46.510> enough<00:03:46.750> positive<00:03:46.959> research<00:03:47.530> for<00:03:47.829> you

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069
