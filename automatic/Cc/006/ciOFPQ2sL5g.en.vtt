yogurt<00:01:32.009> let's<00:01:32.729> divide<00:01:33.119> our<00:01:33.479> egg<00:01:33.960> into<00:01:34.380> egg

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
yogurt let's divide our egg into egg

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.730 
yogurt let's divide our egg into egg
white<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.579> egg<00:01:35.850> yolk<00:01:36.299> while<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.500> that

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
white and egg yolk while we do that

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.960 
white and egg yolk while we do that
because<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:39.060> egg<00:01:39.240> white<00:01:39.920> contains<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.369> five

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
because the egg white contains the five

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.499 
because the egg white contains the five
proteins<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:43.320> they<00:01:43.470> might<00:01:43.860> be<00:01:44.130> allergic<00:01:44.640> for

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
proteins that they might be allergic for

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.719 
proteins that they might be allergic for
