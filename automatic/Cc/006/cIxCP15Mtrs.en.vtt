00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:05.950
 in case the sidewalks are still ready to create an environment 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.629
 extremely interesting 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.209
 in the case of the afternoon 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.209
 in citizen music 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.720
 let's make a cake jun 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.250
 kelly where xocolat and orange need flour eggs cocoa powder 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.319
 orange liqueur sugar butter glas 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.479
 and a lazio impeller is made of paper 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.430
 and we'll start by throwing in a bowl 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.800
 the prison passage 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.580
 and the butter before the butter 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.480
 we have put it in the microwave to temper the 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.420
 to melt a little bit and power it works while Baltic 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.960
 bring down 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.220
 gasca moss the eggs 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.180
 and they are or goes to microwave to temper the 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.050
 because yes we will not run the risk of being cut 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.560
 mass 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.920
 Isora guide we toss the cocoa to the flour 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.240
 we also add the impeller of that paper soda 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.189
 and with the already warm eggs we have already removed them from the micro waves 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:58.539
 we are adding them 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.049
 little by little it is much better little by little while we go 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.980
 doing everything right 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.299
 10 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:36.310
 and with the eggs already fully incorporated but beaten 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.090
 we will miss adding the flour with the enchanted 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.879
 and the base is paper we do not mix everything well we will beat everything well 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.719
 and so we have left hamas once finalized we prepare the mold 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:54.769
 then we'll see the oven 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.109
 in this case we have chosen to do it in an individual mold so that those 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:04.040
 narration cakes but we could perfectly use it another kind of 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.629
 molding make big cake 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.629
 for wolf cut it 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.779
 once the dough in the prepared mold 

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:16.239
 what we will do is take it to the oven 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.499
 at a power of 220 degrees i 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:24.049
 about 15 minutes degree will also depend the size of the 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:24.909
 cake 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.009
 you see there is the result 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:31.360
 We have taken it out of the oven 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.569
 we are going to prepare the syrup where we are going to bathe the cakes 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:36.879
 Water 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:41.980
 orange liqueur sugar and red orange one then we will see the proportions 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.639
 on our billboards 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.429
 i posadas 

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:47.020
 the clicks 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.580
 the cakes we do it upside down so that environment is impregnated and so that 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.319
 when I turn 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.029
 their witty and stay well bathed we take therefore always 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:02.029
 down 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.339
 we can accompany with cream 

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:08.919
 from ea orange drawers 

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:12.099
 we free the imagination that's why we present ourselves 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.519
 just like that with nothing else 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:21.160
 let's go over our recipe our cake our chocolate ic ic 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.349

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:29.449
 340 grams of sugar 270 of butter 70 of almond powder that in this 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.369

00:04:33.369 --> 00:04:38.710
 350 grams of eggs mass 60 grams of cocoa powder 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.189

 sugar 500 or stop b cuatro 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:57.019
 i orange zest which caused another orange liqueur 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.680
 we mix the sugar with the butter and the almond powder we assemble 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.450
 lightly chamo the eggs at intervals 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.780
 add the cream and finally the rest of the ingredients 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.880
 we bake at 220 degrees centigrade and to make the orange syrup 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.889
 we lost the water and the sugar and when it is tempered we add which 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.889
 came in and the skin fringe 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:26.599
 We submerge the cakes in the syrup, let them drain and serve them 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.080
 and we have a sweet recipe 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.139
