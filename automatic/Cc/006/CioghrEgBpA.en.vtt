00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
is exciting today we're going to look at

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.710 
is exciting today we're going to look at
some<00:00:15.590> lamps<00:00:15.889> of<00:00:16.250> Judea<00:00:16.610> modern<00:00:17.090> day<00:00:17.210> Israel

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
some lamps of Judea modern day Israel

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.170 
some lamps of Judea modern day Israel
and<00:00:17.960> see<00:00:18.260> how<00:00:18.530> the<00:00:18.590> lamps<00:00:19.190> evolved<00:00:19.789> through

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:20.180 
and see how the lamps evolved through

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.320 
and see how the lamps evolved through
the<00:00:21.050> periods<00:00:21.439> of<00:00:21.560> time<00:00:21.800> we're<00:00:22.609> going<00:00:22.820> to<00:00:23.000> start

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
the periods of time we're going to start

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.710 
the periods of time we're going to start
with<00:00:23.689> the<00:00:23.810> earliest<00:00:24.259> lamp<00:00:24.679> which<00:00:25.550> is<00:00:25.820> early

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
with the earliest lamp which is early

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.579 
with the earliest lamp which is early
early<00:00:27.320> middle<00:00:27.919> Bronze<00:00:28.189> Age<00:00:28.460> roughly<00:00:29.349> 2200<00:00:30.349> to

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:30.589 
early middle Bronze Age roughly 2200 to

1800<00:00:31.429> BCE<00:00:31.939> the<00:00:32.780> time<00:00:33.020> of<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:33.290> patriarchs<00:00:34.510> as

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
1800 BCE the time of the patriarchs as

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.190 
1800 BCE the time of the patriarchs as
you<00:00:35.810> can<00:00:35.990> see<00:00:36.200> it's<00:00:36.440> a<00:00:36.620> four<00:00:36.920> edged<00:00:37.280> lamp<00:00:38.200> this

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
you can see it's a four edged lamp this

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.470 
you can see it's a four edged lamp this
was<00:00:39.410> made<00:00:39.680> really<00:00:40.010> by<00:00:40.250> having<00:00:40.610> a<00:00:40.730> flat<00:00:41.090> sheet

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
was made really by having a flat sheet

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.470 
was made really by having a flat sheet
and<00:00:41.540> pinching<00:00:42.230> up<00:00:42.470> the<00:00:42.680> edge<00:00:44.680> as<00:00:46.090> time<00:00:47.090> went<00:00:47.300> on

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
and pinching up the edge as time went on

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.160 
and pinching up the edge as time went on
approximately<00:00:48.190> 1800<00:00:49.190> to<00:00:49.340> 1500<00:00:50.150> BC<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.870> middle

Bronze Age lamp becomes simpler one edge
basically<00:00:55.880> a<00:00:55.910> disc<00:00:56.270> made<00:00:56.720> on<00:00:56.900> the<00:00:57.050> potter's

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
basically a disc made on the potter's

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.730 
basically a disc made on the potter's
wheel<00:00:57.470> which<00:00:58.010> is<00:00:58.220> just<00:00:58.960> formed<00:00:59.960> up<00:01:00.140> slight

wheel which is just formed up slight
pinch<00:01:03.460> this<00:01:04.460> gets<00:01:04.759> larger<00:01:05.420> more<00:01:05.840> developed

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
pinch this gets larger more developed

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.220 
pinch this gets larger more developed
still<00:01:07.189> simple<00:01:07.700> no<00:01:08.479> base<00:01:09.340> but<00:01:10.340> more<00:01:10.700> defined

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
still simple no base but more defined

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.250 
still simple no base but more defined
this<00:01:12.230> is<00:01:12.490> approximately<00:01:13.490> 1200<00:01:14.330> BC<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:15.050> Late

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
this is approximately 1200 BC the Late

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.010 
this is approximately 1200 BC the Late
Bronze<00:01:15.290> Age<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.220> then<00:01:16.970> as<00:01:17.270> we<00:01:17.510> get<00:01:17.690> into<00:01:17.840> the

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
Bronze Age and then as we get into the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.120 
Bronze Age and then as we get into the
Iron<00:01:18.230> Age<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:19.310> lamps<00:01:19.700> start<00:01:20.090> having<00:01:20.570> a<00:01:20.720> rim

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
Iron Age the lamps start having a rim

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.160 
Iron Age the lamps start having a rim
start<00:01:22.130> being<00:01:22.840> constructed<00:01:23.840> in<00:01:23.900> a<00:01:23.990> more

sophisticated<00:01:24.409> way<00:01:25.180> this<00:01:26.180> lamp<00:01:26.480> would<00:01:26.659> date

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
sophisticated way this lamp would date

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.950 
sophisticated way this lamp would date
probably<00:01:27.530> about<00:01:27.680> a<00:01:27.740> thousand<00:01:28.430> BC<00:01:28.880> to<00:01:29.090> 800<00:01:29.570> BC

587<00:01:37.940> BC<00:01:38.330> the<00:01:39.229> land<00:01:39.470> start<00:01:39.979> getting<00:01:40.400> more

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
587 BC the land start getting more

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.280 
587 BC the land start getting more
developed<00:01:42.159> smaller<00:01:43.159> rims<00:01:44.060> pinches<00:01:44.900> and<00:01:45.200> now

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
developed smaller rims pinches and now

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.630 
developed smaller rims pinches and now
we<00:01:45.350> start<00:01:45.800> seeing<00:01:46.070> vases<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.060> so<00:01:47.900> on<00:01:48.400> so<00:01:49.400> these

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
we start seeing vases and so on so these

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.539 
we start seeing vases and so on so these
legs<00:01:50.150> really<00:01:50.750> was<00:01:51.320> pulled<00:01:51.650> into<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.310> pre

of<00:01:56.030> Moses<00:01:56.540> and<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:57.409> first<00:01:57.710> temple<00:01:58.220> period

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.770 

then<00:02:01.280> we<00:02:01.430> get<00:02:01.580> into<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:02.030> second<00:02:02.450> temple

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
then we get into the second temple

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.530 
then we get into the second temple
period<00:02:02.810> lamps<00:02:03.670> but<00:02:04.670> we<00:02:04.790> see<00:02:05.000> here<00:02:05.030> a<00:02:05.270> lab

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
period lamps but we see here a lab

this one which would have been made by
Judean<00:02:15.290> powders<00:02:15.849> as<00:02:16.849> you<00:02:17.090> see

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
Judean powders as you see

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.550 
Judean powders as you see
learn<00:02:18.040> shape<00:02:18.610> or<00:02:18.850> form<00:02:19.480> however<00:02:19.960> the<00:02:20.170> judean

learn shape or form however the judean

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.740 
learn shape or form however the judean
is<00:02:20.800> missing<00:02:21.250> some<00:02:21.520> of<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.670> designs<00:02:22.090> are<00:02:22.420> older

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
is missing some of the designs are older

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.700 
is missing some of the designs are older
designs<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.470> basically<00:02:23.860> looks<00:02:24.250> more<00:02:24.580> simple

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
designs and basically looks more simple

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.190 
designs and basically looks more simple
now<00:02:26.710> there's<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:27.190> much<00:02:27.460> skier<00:02:27.910> so<00:02:28.180> lamp<00:02:28.420> which

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
now there's a much skier so lamp which

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.990 
now there's a much skier so lamp which
dates<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.740> the<00:02:29.980> same<00:02:30.280> time<00:02:30.610> which<00:02:30.970> is

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
dates to the same time which is

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.190 
dates to the same time which is
approximately<00:02:31.420> second<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.500> first<00:02:32.710> century<00:02:33.250> BC
