shock<00:00:49.420> we<00:00:49.540> were<00:00:49.629> talking<00:00:49.960> about<00:00:50.019> the

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
shock we were talking about the

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.170 
shock we were talking about the
internals<00:00:50.800> of<00:00:50.860> the<00:00:50.949> shock<00:00:51.129> absorber<00:00:51.609> which<00:00:52.059> is

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
internals of the shock absorber which is

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.060 
internals of the shock absorber which is
where<00:00:52.329> the<00:00:52.420> piston<00:00:52.570> runs<00:00:52.930> up<00:00:53.109> and<00:00:53.289> down<00:00:53.350> we

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
where the piston runs up and down we

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.310 
where the piston runs up and down we
call<00:00:54.280> a<00:00:54.309> big<00:00:54.550> ball<00:00:54.760> because<00:00:55.059> it's<00:00:55.269> a<00:00:55.390> 45<00:00:56.079> mil

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
call a big ball because it's a 45 mil

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.990 
call a big ball because it's a 45 mil
ball<00:00:56.559> which<00:00:56.739> is<00:00:56.890> much<00:00:57.100> bigger<00:00:57.309> than<00:00:57.609> what<00:00:57.850> most

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
ball which is much bigger than what most

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.060

people<00:00:58.329> would<00:00:58.390> run<00:00:58.600> in<00:00:58.809> bore<00:00:59.050> size<00:00:59.320> and<00:00:59.590> the

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
people would run in bore size and the

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.950 
people would run in bore size and the
fact<00:01:00.280> that<00:01:00.370> it<00:01:00.550> externally<00:01:01.059> adjustable<00:01:01.660> we're

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
need a different shock absorber if you

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.010 
need a different shock absorber if you
