Ulta<00:05:10.640> and<00:05:10.880> I<00:05:11.030> just<00:05:11.360> used<00:05:11.840> a<00:05:12.110> lash<00:05:12.740> glue<00:05:12.950> to<00:05:13.220> put

Ulta and I just used a lash glue to put

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.280 
Ulta and I just used a lash glue to put
them<00:05:13.490> on<00:05:13.640> my<00:05:13.670> face<00:05:13.970> and<00:05:14.240> it<00:05:14.810> worked<00:05:15.020> super

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
super well and I think it tied to look

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.330 
super well and I think it tied to look
together<00:05:17.090> so<00:05:17.630> perfectly<00:05:17.830> so<00:05:18.830> that<00:05:19.070> is<00:05:19.220> the

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
together so perfectly so that is the

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.560 
together so perfectly so that is the
