00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 before starting with the video remember 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.180
 if you want to buy our coins 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.610
 fifa coins to the 'dot com' you will have a 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.679
 6 cycle code is cool and you have 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.690
 all all the information the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.460
 very toxic description that gives you 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.920
 you are welcome one day to the channel and 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.760
 hey it 's like it's a pretty review 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.920
 special for me 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.510
 first of all say that he could not 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.039
 upload videos since I had some tests 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.779
 with the captor and then that I had 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.310
 gone on a trip this weekend but 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.750
 quiet, okay, let's go back to the rhythm 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.810
 usual channel we will continue with 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.149
 the series we are going to continue to but 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.059
 well I decided to bring you this first 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.940
 review of a legend on my channel in the 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.290
 first that I went up as you see is from hernÃ¡n 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.150
 Crespo is a player that I loved 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.250
 the truth 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.900
 yes it is true that it provides owen before 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.970
 to try to curl and convince me 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.130
 very much more than after 5 leg 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.650
 bad and those 4 filigrees are magic the 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.540
 truth as you see the good the shot the 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.090
 pace and acceleration now you're going to see 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.160
 in the clips he has an amazing shot 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.650
 that can go perfectly 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.780
 speed but especially especially 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.580
 acceleration when you make a 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.140
 dribble you will see that it is coarse as it says 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.960
 there that is one of the bad things that 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.640
 It's rough to see everyone with the sense 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.350
 that when he's going to do a dribble if 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.270
 you want to do several followed by the 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.880
 suits' rough but acceleration 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.979
 compensate say the slowness that you the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.690
 player to do the dribbling so 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.580
 So much remains in a pretty player 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.229
 complete to have the four of 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.150
 watermarks we can make dribbles like the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.070
 Let's make spin turns as the 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.600
 advanced game fake voley that is this 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.420
 last one I like a lot and 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.690
 probably bring tutorial but good 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.920
 as I give it 8.5 out of 10 on average I 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.380
 I think it's a pretty score 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.540
 good for what it is besides you are going to see 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.970
 that 9 matches 14 goals 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.040
 it's great what happens is that he does not attend 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.170
 ok it's a forward that is to be 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.119
 single 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.400
 the staff has not taught you yet the 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.200
 I will probably teach is a template 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.880
 fairly simple voucher consists of di 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.770
 Maria and a couple of players more than not 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.840
 I'm going to say but hey, he has already 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.549
 delighted that after a super player 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.830
 complete and before trying any 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.110
 another legend I recommend it buy it 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.239
 cheap now went up pretty go the 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.649
 prices but I think this player does 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.000
 that it's worth it if it's true that 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.010
 to be Argentine because he has to 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.830
 to interpenetrate with di maria and this guy 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.900
 of people or with another legend that is the 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.540
 another option now you will be seeing 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.430
 these two clips that are good points 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.200
 for you to come or less acceleration 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.720
 here for example this one how much 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.269
 enter and other times it's cool on the line 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.730
 of goal but good and in full to him 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:34.489
 baiser that buy it for 2 million 645 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.920
 thousand coins I think it's a price 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.920
 well to pay for it but right now 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.260
 I would not recommend buying it since it 's 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.790
 about three million so good 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.739
 guys this stays here and now 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.510
 I'm going to leave them with some great goals 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.850
 truth to stay to see the goals deserves 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.440
 worth it and little more to say many 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.230
 thanks for watching the video if you want more 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.470

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.459
 150 likes, I'm not asking for more, so 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.409
