owned<00:01:03.809> realistically<00:01:04.809> I<00:01:05.379> believe<00:01:05.800> it<00:01:05.920> does

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
owned realistically I believe it does

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.070 
owned realistically I believe it does
more<00:01:06.760> than<00:01:06.820> that<00:01:06.970> but<00:01:07.300> we'll<00:01:07.420> find<00:01:07.630> out<00:01:07.840> one

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
more than that but we'll find out one

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.139 
more than that but we'll find out one
day<00:01:08.110> soon<00:01:08.590> I'll<00:01:09.430> just<00:01:09.640> give<00:01:09.820> you<00:01:09.850> a<00:01:09.970> little

day soon I'll just give you a little

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.530 
day soon I'll just give you a little
tour<00:01:10.450> here<00:01:10.479> of<00:01:10.840> the<00:01:10.930> amplifier<00:01:11.440> show<00:01:12.280> you

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
tour here of the amplifier show you

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.230 
tour here of the amplifier show you
there's<00:01:13.540> a<00:01:13.630> remote<00:01:14.020> terminal<00:01:14.970> grounded<00:01:15.970> 12

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
there's a remote terminal grounded 12

volt believed we can fit 4 gauge in
there<00:01:18.700> looks<00:01:19.630> pretty<00:01:19.869> tight<00:01:20.140> but<00:01:20.350> I<00:01:20.380> think<00:01:20.590> we

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
there looks pretty tight but I think we

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.280 
there looks pretty tight but I think we
can<00:01:20.800> fit<00:01:20.950> it<00:01:21.040> in<00:01:21.160> there<00:01:21.340> as<00:01:21.700> you<00:01:21.850> can<00:01:22.000> see<00:01:22.290> once

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
can fit it in there as you can see once

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.160 
can fit it in there as you can see once
an<00:01:23.440> externally<00:01:23.979> fuse<00:01:24.310> 150<00:01:25.119> amp<00:01:25.330> to<00:01:25.750> use<00:01:25.990> so

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
an externally fuse 150 amp to use so

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.820 
an externally fuse 150 amp to use so
that's<00:01:26.380> a<00:01:26.710> no<00:01:27.160> joke<00:01:27.520> here<00:01:27.850> kicker<00:01:28.750> XS<00:01:29.320> 100

you how to bridge the amplifier and here

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.370 
you how to bridge the amplifier and here
we<00:01:50.110> have<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.920> docking<00:01:51.369> port<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.810> that

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
we have the the docking port that that

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.719 
we have the the docking port that that
kicker<00:01:53.650> had<00:01:54.040> with<00:01:54.340> these<00:01:54.520> particular

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
kicker had with these particular

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.380 
kicker had with these particular
amplifiers<00:01:55.450> now<00:01:55.659> this<00:01:55.930> is<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.760> bypass<00:01:57.760> module

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
amplifiers now this is a bypass module

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.350 
amplifiers now this is a bypass module
and<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.799> could<00:01:59.920> also<00:02:00.070> get<00:02:00.580> different<00:02:00.939> types

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
and you could also get different types

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.170 
and you could also get different types
of<00:02:01.570> modules<00:02:02.110> that<00:02:02.500> would<00:02:02.650> work<00:02:02.890> like

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
of modules that would work like

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.210 
of modules that would work like
crossover<00:02:04.180> modules<00:02:05.729> equalizer<00:02:06.729> modules<00:02:07.420> etc

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
crossover modules equalizer modules etc

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.039 
crossover modules equalizer modules etc
but<00:02:09.220> I<00:02:09.459> believe<00:02:09.880> for<00:02:10.179> this<00:02:10.269> amplifier<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.899> work

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049 
but I believe for this amplifier to work

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:12.600 
but I believe for this amplifier to work
you<00:02:11.230> do<00:02:11.410> have<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.739> have<00:02:11.890> some<00:02:11.920> kind<00:02:12.459> of<00:02:12.519> a

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
you do have to have some kind of a

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.570 
you do have to have some kind of a
module<00:02:12.850> in<00:02:13.180> here<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:14.470> make<00:02:14.680> sure<00:02:14.709> you<00:02:15.070> if<00:02:15.459> you

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
module in here so make sure you if you

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.300 
module in here so make sure you if you
buy<00:02:15.730> one<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:16.030> these<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:16.299> you<00:02:16.480> either<00:02:16.600> have<00:02:16.900> a

buy one of these that you either have a

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.880 
buy one of these that you either have a
bypass<00:02:18.310> module<00:02:18.760> or<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:18.970> have<00:02:19.180> one<00:02:19.450> of<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.930> ZRX

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
bypass module or you have one of the ZRX

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.460 
bypass module or you have one of the ZRX
modules<00:02:21.549> to<00:02:21.760> make<00:02:21.940> sure<00:02:22.209> that<00:02:22.780> it'll<00:02:23.110> work<00:02:23.260> for

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
modules to make sure that it'll work for

models including the XS 100 XS 50 and
course<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.739> Z<00:03:25.950> ours<00:03:26.190> you<00:03:26.730> know<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.940> big<00:03:27.090> one

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
course to Z ours you know the big one

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.780 
course to Z ours you know the big one
but<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.660> Z<00:03:27.810> or<00:03:27.930> 1000<00:03:28.620> but<00:03:29.459> it's<00:03:29.610> interesting

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
but the Z or 1000 but it's interesting

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.720 
but the Z or 1000 but it's interesting
too<00:03:30.060> now<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.209> didn't<00:03:30.599> know<00:03:31.459> well<00:03:32.459> I<00:03:32.489> knew<00:03:32.700> that

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
too now I didn't know well I knew that

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.160 
too now I didn't know well I knew that
the<00:03:33.030> sync<00:03:33.299> link<00:03:33.510> was<00:03:33.720> extra<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:35.430> was<00:03:35.579> $39<00:03:36.540> so

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
the sync link was extra it was $39 so

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.569 
the sync link was extra it was $39 so
that's<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.560> one<00:03:37.680> that<00:03:37.799> you<00:03:37.950> could<00:03:38.099> link

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
that's the one that you could link

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.720 
that's the one that you could link
multiple<00:03:39.030> apps<00:03:39.209> together<00:03:40.160> but<00:03:41.160> what<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.340> didn't

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
multiple apps together but what I didn't

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.349 
multiple apps together but what I didn't
know<00:03:41.760> is<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:42.900> end<00:03:43.079> caps<00:03:43.440> were<00:03:43.769> actually

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
know is that the end caps were actually

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.150 
know is that the end caps were actually
optional<00:03:45.359> they<00:03:46.109> didn't<00:03:46.350> come<00:03:46.500> with<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.680> amps

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
optional they didn't come with the amps

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.920 
optional they didn't come with the amps
I<00:03:47.280> thought<00:03:47.519> they<00:03:47.700> did<00:03:48.000> and<00:03:48.299> they've<00:03:48.420> just<00:03:48.630> lost

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
I thought they did and they've just lost

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.870 
I thought they did and they've just lost
like<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.380> lot<00:03:49.560> of<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.739> Fosgate<00:03:50.310> ones<00:03:50.519> over<00:03:50.790> the

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
like a lot of the Fosgate ones over the

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.420 
like a lot of the Fosgate ones over the
years<00:03:51.209> but<00:03:51.540> there<00:03:52.139> were<00:03:52.230> $19<00:03:52.889> a<00:03:52.920> pair<00:03:53.220> so

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
years but there were $19 a pair so

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.059 
years but there were $19 a pair so
that's<00:03:53.609> why<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.819> don't<00:03:54.030> see<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.269> lot<00:03:54.420> of<00:03:54.480> the

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
that's why you don't see a lot of the

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.340 
that's why you don't see a lot of the
end<00:03:56.069> caps<00:03:56.400> with<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.060> Zr<00:03:57.600> series<00:03:58.139> amplifiers

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
end caps with the Zr series amplifiers

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.620 
end caps with the Zr series amplifiers
they<00:03:58.980> didn't<00:03:59.250> come<00:03:59.400> with<00:03:59.430> them<00:03:59.730> very

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
they didn't come with them very

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.050 
they didn't come with them very
interesting<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:02.010> here's<00:04:02.639> the<00:04:02.790> actual

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
quick so even the little Z or 120 was

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.249 
quick so even the little Z or 120 was
$2.99<00:05:00.509> there<00:05:01.509> you<00:05:01.599> go<00:05:01.719> just<00:05:01.900> a<00:05:02.050> little

what it's all about the heatsink on this

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.080 
what it's all about the heatsink on this
is<00:05:30.159> heavy

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
is heavy

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.540 
is heavy
since<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:31.810> amplifier<00:05:32.199> is<00:05:32.319> around<00:05:32.500> 17<00:05:33.039> pounds

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
since the amplifier is around 17 pounds

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.270 
since the amplifier is around 17 pounds
but<00:05:33.639> it<00:05:33.759> sure<00:05:33.940> feels<00:05:34.120> heavier<00:05:34.770> 17<00:05:35.770> pounds<00:05:36.159> to

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
but it sure feels heavier 17 pounds to

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.760 
but it sure feels heavier 17 pounds to
me<00:05:36.460> the<00:05:37.330> first<00:05:37.659> thing<00:05:37.900> that<00:05:37.930> I<00:05:38.139> noticed<00:05:38.620> it

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
me the first thing that I noticed it

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.499 
me the first thing that I noticed it
just<00:05:38.800> sticks<00:05:39.159> way<00:05:39.340> out<00:05:39.490> as<00:05:39.639> a<00:05:39.729> toroid<00:05:40.150> here<00:05:40.389> is
