the 13th okay so I'll do my 165 like

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:02.969 
the 13th okay so I'll do my 165 like
this<00:02:00.720> okay<00:02:01.720> so<00:02:02.320> here's<00:02:02.500> how<00:02:02.530> this<00:02:02.800> little

half step patents this is a targeting
method<00:02:42.400> that<00:02:43.299> a<00:02:43.329> lot<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.599> bass<00:02:43.750> players<00:02:43.780> use

00:02:44.399 --> 00:02:44.409 
method that a lot of bass players use

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:47.819 
method that a lot of bass players use
where<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:46.360> chord<00:02:46.599> you're<00:02:46.750> going<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:47.079> you<00:02:47.620> just

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
where the chord you're going to you just

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.460 
where the chord you're going to you just
start<00:02:48.099> from<00:02:48.659> four<00:02:49.659> notes<00:02:49.930> back

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
start from four notes back

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.020 
start from four notes back

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
so if I'm going to D I'm starting on B

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.460 
so if I'm going to D I'm starting on B
nothing<00:02:55.030> going<00:02:55.450> back<00:02:55.599> to<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.780> I'm<00:02:56.019> starting<00:02:56.379> on
