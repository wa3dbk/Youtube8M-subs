00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hello my name is gabriel de cava 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.490
 technologies in this video I'm going to 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.259
 show the temperature gun as 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.170
 we can see here is a gun 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.179
 infrared to work in the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.400
 cell phones or in any product 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.279
 electronic you need to measure the 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.460
 temperature this type of gun is very 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.490
 good works very well has very good 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.920
 precision and I'll show you how it is 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.060
 this gun and how it works like 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.170
 we can see from this side we have the 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.120
 temperature the temperature range that 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.239
 measured is 50 degrees centigrade 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.489
 up to 550 degrees centigrade and 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.469
 then here we have the display that we 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.070
 indicates the temperature as we can see 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.050
 here on the display has a display of 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.170
 quartz of the traditional ones that when 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.379
 you learn it when you learn it or 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.880
 squeezing the trigger is going to light up 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.640
 the background as we can see now 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.200
 there we see that it has 23 degrees that 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.990
 we are obviously pointing to the table 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.670
 if we point to the hand directly we 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.880
 mark the temperature at hand that would be 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:12.080
 30 and 17 approximately after has the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:15.230
 function for celsius and fahrenheit and 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.690
 then it has the function to turn on the 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.810
 light only here if you want you can 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.430
 turn on or off the bottom here we have the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.190
 This button that we can turn on and off 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.740
 the background light and then we have the 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.930
 This button activates or deactivates the 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.479
 laser or as we can see here there 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.180
 deactivates there we activate the laser if it 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.100
 I tighten it back there we deactivate it if 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.650
 he pressed it there we activated it as we can 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.140
 see there on the cell phone 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.090
 then with the laser it tells you where 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.670
 is measuring the temperature as 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.590
 we can see there in the cell phone has a 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.470
 temperature of 22 degrees approximately 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.830
 and if I put my hand automatically goes up 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:58.550
 at 32 degrees this can help you 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:01.760
 example to be able to take the screen out of 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.980
 galaxy in this case is a samsung galaxy 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.770
 4 but it works for most of the 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.530
 cell phones, the ideal is that the 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.110
 100 degrees like this in this way you can 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.390
 prevent the screen from turning golden and 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.790
 ruin the screen so let's 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.090
 start so you can see how it works 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.700
 doing the demonstration for that we're going 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.940
 to use this black heat gun 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.100
 in the care 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.050
 from this side we can see where it is 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.180
 marked which is the temperature that I 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.160
 I use I do not put it to the maximum that maximum 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.160
 it would be and I put it a little 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.180
 I put it almost in the middle a little bit more 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.939
 that in the middle to be able to work as 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.849
 we can see here I have the screen of a 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:47.530
 out 2 it seems like an out 1 and we're going to 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.140
 apply more heat for you to see 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:54.209
 how it starts to get golden when 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.209
 one passes temperature 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.379
 we are passing the 220 degrees 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.840
 124 and as we can see, it started 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.510
 put golden obviously the more 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.540
 temperature we give it more golden it's going to 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.510
 put the screen so ideally never 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.610
 is to go over 100 degrees now we're going to 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.390
 see to do the work in this 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.270
 phone 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.700
 the ideal is to heat it several times and 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.530
 go measuring if it's the first time 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.660
 You do this kind of work, it suits you 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.730
 go measuring permanently the only thing that 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.180
 you have to keep in mind is that when 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.130
 pass the peak of the heat gun that 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.040
 you are not measuring the peak then 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.260
 then that way you always have to 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.540
 keep in mind to measure the screen and 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.890
 not the peak when one does this and the 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.310
 heat gun is obviously 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.050
 running one is going to have other errors 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.760
 in the recorded reading we will be 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.520
 reading in the heat gun the peak and 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.510
 apart the phone then out there good 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.460
 do it a couple of seconds like this and be 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.260
 pointing on the screen to be able 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.270
 read it and not be doing it 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.560
 permanently when you do it for 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.710
 first time obviously you are going to do it 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.530
 permanently and then eventually 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.080
 and regulating is for and you are going to give him 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.729
 you are going to give 15 seconds and you measure it 15 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.520
 seconds does not tell me when you get to the 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.259
 100 degrees there you start directly to 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.810
 work when you cools the screen 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:38.819
 a little bit directly you start it 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.590
 warm up and so on so 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.150
 let's see on the screen obviously 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.729
 real in this we're going to have to 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.729
 change so you can see what the process is like 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.159
 we give it a little more 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.200
 there we have the 76 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.320
 and there we arrived at 97 so now 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.000
 we could almost start working without 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.100
 obviously problem that is all going 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.130
 cooling fast and we have to start 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.849
 work pretty fast to avoid that 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.580
 cool 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:58.369
 if we touch it if one sees that it is losing 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:01.330
 temperature as is this case we have 

00:05:58.369 --> 00:06:01.330
 to heat it back 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.220
 and we get to 100 back 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.840
 and we reached the 100 almost obviously it 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:34.470
 it's going to cool you have to try to work 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.470
 finely fast here 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.430
 We have taken off the phone but 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:22.830
 well the idea is not going to do all the 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:25.150
 process here in front of the camera because 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:27.970
 the idea was to show you 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:30.460
 the gun is the thermometer 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:33.750
 infrared so I hope that I have 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:36.480
 liked the video if you liked accord 

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:38.310
 to click on I like to share it 

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.570
 with your friends and see you in the next 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.570
 class until then
