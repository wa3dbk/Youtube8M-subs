so<00:00:03.950> that's<00:00:04.950> my<00:00:06.080> q6600<00:00:07.080> on<00:00:09.290> 3600<00:00:10.290> mega<00:00:10.679> else

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
so that's my q6600 on 3600 mega else

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.570 
so that's my q6600 on 3600 mega else
it's<00:00:11.990> an<00:00:12.990> XP<00:00:14.000> sp3<00:00:15.139> installed<00:00:16.139> five<00:00:17.039> years<00:00:17.340> ago

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
it's an XP sp3 installed five years ago

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.920 
it's an XP sp3 installed five years ago
it's<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.869> lot<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.350> crap<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:19.980> but<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.210> think<00:00:21.480> the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
it's a lot of crap on it but I think the

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.019 
it's a lot of crap on it but I think the
system<00:00:22.109> kicks<00:00:22.980> some<00:00:23.550> asses<00:00:25.519> have<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.550> look<00:00:26.789> at

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
system kicks some asses have a look at

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.070 
system kicks some asses have a look at
the<00:00:27.269> temperature<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.650> says<00:00:29.330> system<00:00:30.330> 39

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
the temperature it says system 39

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.630 
the temperature it says system 39
degrees<00:00:31.489> civil<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.940> dat<00:00:33.239> green<00:00:34.219> before<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.430> ask

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
degrees civil so dat green before I ask

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.470 
degrees civil so dat green before I ask
the<00:00:35.880> system<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.690> cool<00:00:39.739> cooler<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.480> hottie

excuse really a monster of a cooler it

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.220 
excuse really a monster of a cooler it
has<00:00:47.219> some<00:00:47.489> bad<00:00:47.660> reputations<00:00:48.660> because<00:00:49.050> the

has some bad reputations because the
people<00:00:49.530> are<00:00:49.739> too<00:00:50.399> stupid<00:00:50.480> to<00:00:51.480> install<00:00:52.340> this

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
people are too stupid to install this

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.029 
people are too stupid to install this
cooler<00:00:53.789> correctly<00:00:54.629> if<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.199> do<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.440> cook<00:00:55.829> in

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
cooler correctly if you do is cook in

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.220 
cooler correctly if you do is cook in
the<00:00:56.160> correct<00:00:56.460> way<00:00:57.050> you<00:00:58.050> will<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.579> unlimited

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
the correct way you will have unlimited

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.250 
the correct way you will have unlimited
cooling<00:01:01.250> possibilities<00:01:02.809> one<00:01:03.809> moment<00:01:03.989> are

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
cooling possibilities one moment are

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:12.730 
cooling possibilities one moment are
going<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.680> show<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.920> my<00:01:05.420> sister<00:01:06.420> from<00:01:06.630> spawn

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.410 

I<00:01:14.619> see<00:01:15.619> on<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.040> video<00:01:16.130> is<00:01:16.430> not<00:01:16.460> so<00:01:16.909> good<00:01:17.180> to

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
I see on the video is not so good to

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.820 
I see on the video is not so good to
read<00:01:17.720> but<00:01:18.530> you<00:01:19.070> see<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.549> CBO<00:01:19.939> temperature<00:01:20.570> is

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
read but you see the CBO temperature is

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.350 
read but you see the CBO temperature is
31<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.220> the<00:01:22.369> two<00:01:23.320> ram<00:01:24.320> temperature<00:01:25.040> is<00:01:25.250> 39<00:01:26.030> so

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
31 so the two ram temperature is 39 so

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.620 
31 so the two ram temperature is 39 so
they<00:01:26.479> ate<00:01:28.689> the<00:01:29.689> power<00:01:30.049> supply<00:01:30.350> is<00:01:30.950> 25<00:01:31.789> 26

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
they ate the power supply is 25 26

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.790 
they ate the power supply is 25 26
degree

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800

you

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:02:05.920 

you

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.460 

that's<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.680> last<00:02:06.860> step<00:02:07.190> of<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.670> 3dmark<00:02:09.820> 2006

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
that's the last step of the 3dmark 2006

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.670 
that's the last step of the 3dmark 2006
you

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.360 

you<00:02:15.219> see<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.579> system<00:02:15.790> is<00:02:16.269> stable<00:02:17.159> more<00:02:18.159> or

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
you see the system is stable more or

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.660 
you see the system is stable more or
less

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670

I<00:02:20.760> haven't<00:02:21.890> noticed<00:02:22.890> any<00:02:23.130> problems<00:02:24.050> but<00:02:25.050> i

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
I haven't noticed any problems but i

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.559 
I haven't noticed any problems but i
must<00:02:26.700> say<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:27.720> i<00:02:27.989> haven't<00:02:28.200> played

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.650 

very<00:02:31.469> much<00:02:32.269> mrs.<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.629> settings

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.560 

so<00:02:37.320> now<00:02:37.830> let's<00:02:38.070> have<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.280> look<00:02:38.370> at<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.940> CPU

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
so now let's have a look at the CPU

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.230 
so now let's have a look at the CPU
temperature<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:41.400> has<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.900> increased<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:44.240> 42

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
temperature it has the increased to 42

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.710 
temperature it has the increased to 42
degrees<00:02:45.660> Max<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.470> now<00:02:46.860> as<00:02:47.100> its<00:02:47.490> back<00:02:47.820> on<00:02:48.060> 14

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
degrees Max and now as its back on 14

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.280 
degrees Max and now as its back on 14
and<00:02:49.440> only<00:02:49.920> three<00:02:50.370> seconds<00:02:50.730> as<00:02:50.850> I've<00:02:51.180> seen

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.130 

let's<00:02:55.290> fuse<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.280> results<00:02:56.850> online<00:02:57.060> maybe<00:02:57.990> I

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
let's fuse the results online maybe I

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:06.220 
let's fuse the results online maybe I
have<00:02:58.320> to<00:02:58.500> stop<00:02:59.490> my<00:02:59.700> firewall

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
really nice piece of technology but it

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:24.820 
really nice piece of technology but it

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.180 

you<00:05:06.950> see<00:05:07.190> dar<00:05:07.910> voltage<00:05:08.560> has<00:05:09.560> been<00:05:09.830> increased

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
you see dar voltage has been increased

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.300 
you see dar voltage has been increased
to<00:05:10.400> the<00:05:11.050> accommodated<00:05:12.050> level<00:05:12.440> of<00:05:12.620> course<00:05:13.130> they

to the accommodated level of course they

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.230 
to the accommodated level of course they
are<00:05:13.370> too<00:05:13.990> poor<00:05:14.990> and<00:05:15.440> one<00:05:16.190> or<00:05:16.520> two<00:05:16.580> point<00:05:17.180> one

are too poor and one or two point one
five<00:05:17.920> free

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:27.880 

I<00:05:22.060> set<00:05:23.060> the<00:05:23.240> CBO<00:05:23.690> voltage<00:05:24.230> to<00:05:24.760> 1.45<00:05:25.760> even<00:05:26.890> it

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
I set the CBO voltage to 1.45 even it

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.940 
I set the CBO voltage to 1.45 even it
might<00:05:28.250> not<00:05:28.460> be<00:05:28.520> necessary<00:05:29.330> to<00:05:29.450> go<00:05:29.990> this<00:05:30.500> high

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
might not be necessary to go this high

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:43.900 
might not be necessary to go this high
it<00:05:31.670> depends<00:05:32.120> on<00:05:32.210> your<00:05:32.540> CBO

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:52.190 

you
