00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
weather but just as important we harvest

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.420 
weather but just as important we harvest
all<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.689> our<00:01:30.960> own<00:01:31.080> rainwater<00:01:31.530> all<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.189> water

this because you said you harness the
rain<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:15.299> capture<00:02:16.019> the<00:02:16.170> rainwater<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.890> use

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160

it<00:02:17.340> all<00:02:17.459> through<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.730> RV<00:02:18.090> I'll<00:02:18.630> tell<00:02:18.810> me<00:02:18.900> about

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
it all through the RV I'll tell me about

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.420 
it all through the RV I'll tell me about
how<00:02:19.110> this<00:02:19.290> works<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.620> comes<00:02:19.860> we<00:02:20.010> collect<00:02:20.310> the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
how this works it comes we collect the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.619 
how this works it comes we collect the
water<00:02:20.550> off<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.849> rain<00:02:21.120> in<00:02:21.239> one<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.390> two

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
water off the rain in one of two

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.030 
water off the rain in one of two

water i'll do

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.830 
water i'll do
a<00:02:25.920> smaller<00:02:26.310> way<00:02:26.550> when<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.180> water<00:02:27.390> runs<00:02:27.600> off

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
a smaller way when the water runs off

knocks<00:02:33.690> out<00:02:33.930> all<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.260> bad<00:02:34.410> guys<00:02:34.680> in<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.100> water

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
knocks out all the bad guys in the water

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.010 
knocks out all the bad guys in the water
and<00:02:35.520> then<00:02:35.790> goes<00:02:36.000> right<00:02:36.240> in<00:02:36.360> so<00:02:36.540> we<00:02:36.660> can<00:02:36.690> use<00:02:36.900> it

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
and then goes right in so we can use it

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.360 
and then goes right in so we can use it
on<00:02:37.110> board<00:02:37.350> for<00:02:37.500> everything<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.220> don't<00:02:38.340> even

know this uh Brian I had skin cancer and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.680 
know this uh Brian I had skin cancer and
unlike<00:02:41.730> most<00:02:41.880> people<00:02:42.209> when<00:02:42.330> he<00:02:42.390> got<00:02:42.480> skin

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
unlike most people when he got skin

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.180 
unlike most people when he got skin
cancer<00:02:42.720> he<00:02:43.080> thought<00:02:43.260> about<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.590> power<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:43.950> the

cancer he thought about the power of the
Sun<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.760> he<00:02:45.030> thought<00:02:45.150> about<00:02:45.360> how<00:02:45.570> he<00:02:45.630> could

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
Sun and he thought about how he could

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.510 
Sun and he thought about how he could
harness<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.440> how<00:02:46.500> does<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:46.800> RV<00:02:47.160> harness<00:02:47.430> the

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
harness and how does this RV harness the

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.920 
harness and how does this RV harness the
power<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.820> Sun<00:02:48.060> great<00:02:48.420> question<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.840> know

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
power of the Sun great question you know

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.480 
power of the Sun great question you know

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
all the time on a sunny day it's free

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.780 
all the time on a sunny day it's free
energy<00:03:01.410> now<00:03:01.739> they<00:03:01.950> each<00:03:02.100> cost<00:03:02.370> me<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.700> know

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
energy now they each cost me you know

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.280 
energy now they each cost me you know
it's<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.940> little<00:03:03.030> bit<00:03:03.239> to<00:03:03.360> put<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:03.600> in<00:03:03.720> there<00:03:03.900> but

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
it's a little bit to put it in there but

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.560 
it's a little bit to put it in there but
over<00:03:04.650> time<00:03:04.890> yeah<00:03:05.519> I<00:03:05.550> don't<00:03:05.820> have<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.030> plug<00:03:06.209> in<00:03:06.390> I

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
over time yeah I don't have to plug in I

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.120 
over time yeah I don't have to plug in I
don't<00:03:06.930> have<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.110> go<00:03:07.140> to<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.350> campground<00:03:07.950> and

don't have to go to a campground and

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.800 
don't have to go to a campground and
plug<00:03:08.310> in<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.610> find<00:03:08.730> energy<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.239> can<00:03:09.330> get<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.720> off

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810
