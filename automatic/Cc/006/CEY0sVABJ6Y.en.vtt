one<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.350> first<00:02:16.560> pieces<00:02:16.740> we<00:02:17.070> felt<00:02:17.280> we<00:02:17.370> had

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
one of the first pieces we felt we had

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.520 
one of the first pieces we felt we had
to<00:02:17.700> redesign<00:02:17.970> was<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.720> first<00:02:18.930> pot<00:02:19.230> in<00:02:19.410> the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
to redesign was the first pot in the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.280 
to redesign was the first pot in the
living<00:02:19.800> room<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.790> was<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.090> large<00:02:21.540> static<00:02:22.080> piece

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
living room it was a large static piece

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.560 
living room it was a large static piece
that<00:02:22.590> lacked<00:02:22.860> functionality<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.300> we<00:02:24.420> replaced

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
that lacked functionality so we replaced

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.900 
that lacked functionality so we replaced
it<00:02:24.960> with<00:02:25.020> a<00:02:25.440> wall<00:02:25.710> that<00:02:26.070> you<00:02:26.550> would<00:02:26.700> see

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
it with a wall that you would see

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.780 
it with a wall that you would see
commonly<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.780> condominium<00:02:28.170> but<00:02:28.830> we<00:02:29.280> could

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
commonly in a condominium but we could

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.750 
commonly in a condominium but we could
use<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.090> spin<00:02:30.540> screen<00:02:30.900> as<00:02:31.080> well<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.650> this<00:02:32.340> spin

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
use a spin screen as well and this spin

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.880 
use a spin screen as well and this spin
screen<00:02:33.060> actually<00:02:33.510> rotates<00:02:34.020> between<00:02:34.230> two

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890

rooms inset into a drywall partition the
screen<00:02:40.410> rotates<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.459> then<00:02:41.580> doubles<00:02:41.970> as<00:02:42.150> a

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
screen rotates and then doubles as a
