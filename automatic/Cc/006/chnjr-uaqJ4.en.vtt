specsavers<00:04:18.020> and<00:04:18.260> vision<00:04:18.859> express<00:04:19.220> to<00:04:19.730> be

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
specsavers and vision express to be

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.150 
specsavers and vision express to be
almost<00:04:20.440> like<00:04:21.440> the<00:04:21.590> last<00:04:21.799> pair<00:04:21.980> of<00:04:22.010> glasses

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
that I call from specs anyways I go to

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.140
