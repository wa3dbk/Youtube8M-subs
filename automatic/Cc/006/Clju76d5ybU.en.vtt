to do the elastico chop and the Ronaldo

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.270 
to do the elastico chop and the Ronaldo
job<00:00:08.940> so<00:00:09.719> let's<00:00:09.990> not<00:00:10.170> waste<00:00:10.380> any<00:00:10.679> time<00:00:11.040> at<00:00:11.190> all

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
job so let's not waste any time at all

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.310 
job so let's not waste any time at all
and<00:00:11.550> start<00:00:11.910> with<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.179> elastico<00:00:12.570> job<00:00:12.809> you'll

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
and start with the elastico job you'll

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.259 
and start with the elastico job you'll
at<00:00:13.469> least<00:00:13.710> need<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.920> 5<00:00:14.309> star<00:00:14.549> scaler<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.969> do<00:00:15.089> this

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
at least need a 5 star scaler to do this

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.510 
at least need a 5 star scaler to do this
skill<00:00:15.509> move<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.960> don't<00:00:16.289> think<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.070> elastico

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
skill move I don't think the elastico

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.400 
skill move I don't think the elastico
job<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.880> one<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.390> most<00:00:18.690> effective<00:00:19.199> skill

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
job is one of the most effective skill

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.439 
job is one of the most effective skill
moves<00:00:19.619> in<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.800> game<00:00:19.980> but<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.760> does<00:00:20.970> look<00:00:21.180> cool

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
moves in the game but it does look cool

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.179 
moves in the game but it does look cool
and<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:21.869> also<00:00:22.140> good<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.560> use<00:00:22.800> some<00:00:23.010> different

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
and it's also good to use some different

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.189 
and it's also good to use some different
skill<00:00:23.609> moves<00:00:23.850> every<00:00:24.269> now<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.600> then<00:00:24.689> if<00:00:24.900> you

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
skill moves every now and then if you

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.900 
skill moves every now and then if you
keep<00:00:25.350> spamming<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.859> same<00:00:25.949> skill<00:00:26.460> moves<00:00:26.699> your

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
keep spamming the same skill moves your

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.240 
keep spamming the same skill moves your
opponent<00:00:27.420> will<00:00:27.720> reach<00:00:27.960> your<00:00:28.170> place<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:29.220> you

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
opponent will reach your place so you

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.130 
opponent will reach your place so you
can<00:00:29.460> do<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> elastico<00:00:30.150> chop<00:00:30.330> by<00:00:30.480> flicking<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
can do the elastico chop by flicking the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.049 
can do the elastico chop by flicking the
right<00:00:31.410> stick<00:00:31.679> down<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.130> then<00:00:32.550> flick<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.030> to

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
right stick down and then flick it to

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.690 
right stick down and then flick it to
the<00:00:33.239> left<00:00:33.480> or<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.350> right<00:00:34.440> depending<00:00:34.860> on

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
the left or to the right depending on

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.280 
the left or to the right depending on
which<00:00:35.910> direction<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.540> want<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.780> end<00:00:36.960> up<00:00:37.050> with

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
which direction you want to end up with

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.830 
which direction you want to end up with
I<00:00:37.550> obviously<00:00:38.550> chose<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:39.120> do<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.600> left

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
I obviously chose to do it to the left

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.319 
I obviously chose to do it to the left
in<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.290> example<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.399> I'll<00:00:41.550> show<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.030> few

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
in this example so I'll show you a few

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.940 
in this example so I'll show you a few
examples<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:43.020> when<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.500> can<00:00:43.680> use<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
examples of when you can use the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.400 
examples of when you can use the
elastico<00:00:44.399> job<00:00:44.610> as<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.360> said<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.750> don't<00:00:45.870> think

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
elastico job as I said I don't think

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.380 
elastico job as I said I don't think
it's<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.739> very<00:00:47.100> effective<00:00:47.399> skill<00:00:47.789> move<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.270> it

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
it's a very effective skill move but it

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.330 
it's a very effective skill move but it
isn't<00:00:48.870> fun<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.230> use<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> same<00:00:49.770> skill<00:00:50.070> moves

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
isn't fun to use the same skill moves

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.939 
isn't fun to use the same skill moves
all<00:00:50.550> over<00:00:51.059> again<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:51.989> tend<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.530> use<00:00:52.620> it

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
all over again so I tend to use it

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.040 
all over again so I tend to use it
basically<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.699> mix<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.120> up<00:00:54.210> just<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.809> little<00:00:54.840> bit

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
basically to mix it up just a little bit

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.990 
basically to mix it up just a little bit
so<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.500> won't<00:00:55.800> get<00:00:56.039> too<00:00:56.250> predictable<00:00:56.520> you

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
so I won't get too predictable you

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.450 
so I won't get too predictable you
should<00:00:57.989> use<00:00:58.170> a<00:00:58.379> logical<00:00:58.739> chop<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> left

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
should use a logical chop to the left

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.310 
should use a logical chop to the left
when<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> defender<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.510> running<00:01:00.840> towards<00:01:01.230> you

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
when the defender is running towards you

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.609 
when the defender is running towards you
from<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.770> left<00:01:01.949> from<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.340> 45°<00:01:03.180> angle<00:01:03.350> there<00:01:04.350> has

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
from the left from a 45° angle there has

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.380 
from the left from a 45° angle there has
to<00:01:04.650> be<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.920> bit<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.339> space<00:01:05.549> between<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
to be a bit of space between you and the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.910 
to be a bit of space between you and the
defender<00:01:06.479> which<00:01:06.990> you'll<00:01:07.200> see<00:01:07.290> in<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
defender which you'll see in the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.520 
defender which you'll see in the
examples<00:01:08.600> if<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.810> defender<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.260> running

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
examples if the defender is running

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.620 
examples if the defender is running
towards<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.920> from<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> right<00:01:11.490> from<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> 45°

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
towards you from the right from a 45°

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.300 
towards you from the right from a 45°
angle<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:13.170> should<00:01:13.200> obviously<00:01:14.010> do<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
angle you should obviously do the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.920 
angle you should obviously do the
elastico<00:01:14.790> job<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> right<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.810> guess

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
elastico job to the right but I guess

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.679 
elastico job to the right but I guess
that<00:01:16.350> kinda<00:01:16.830> speaks<00:01:17.070> for<00:01:17.250> itself<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.820> let's

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
that kinda speaks for itself so let's

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.510 
that kinda speaks for itself so let's
head<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.320> second<00:01:19.770> skill<00:01:19.950> move<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.310> this

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
head on to the second skill move of this

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.060 
head on to the second skill move of this
episode<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.450> Ronaldo<00:01:21.869> chop<00:01:21.900> you'll<00:01:22.860> at<00:01:23.040> least

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
episode the Ronaldo chop you'll at least

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.890 
episode the Ronaldo chop you'll at least
need<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> four<00:01:23.909> star<00:01:24.119> skillet<00:01:24.509> through<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
need a four star skillet through the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.170 
need a four star skillet through the
skill<00:01:25.140> move<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:26.070> Ronaldo<00:01:26.490> chop<00:01:26.520> was<00:01:26.880> one<00:01:27.090> of

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
skill move the Ronaldo chop was one of

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.660 
skill move the Ronaldo chop was one of
the<00:01:27.299> most<00:01:27.479> effective<00:01:28.140> skills<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.740> FIFA<00:01:29.040> 13<00:01:29.070> and

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the most effective skills on FIFA 13 and

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.149 
the most effective skills on FIFA 13 and
it's<00:01:30.060> still<00:01:30.390> kind<00:01:30.750> effective<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.470> FIFA<00:01:31.710> 14

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
it's still kind effective on FIFA 14

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.880 
it's still kind effective on FIFA 14
I<00:01:32.310> think<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.390> animation<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.020> less<00:01:34.320> fluent<00:01:34.770> on

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
I think the animation is less fluent on

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.190 
I think the animation is less fluent on
FIFA<00:01:35.220> 14<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:35.970> guess<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.450> should<00:01:36.689> use<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.079> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
FIFA 14 but I guess I should use it a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.499 
FIFA 14 but I guess I should use it a
bit<00:01:37.500> more<00:01:37.680> often<00:01:38.009> anyways<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
bit more often anyways you can do the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.289 
bit more often anyways you can do the
Ronaldo<00:01:39.900> chop<00:01:39.930> by<00:01:40.320> holding<00:01:40.770> l2<00:01:41.250> which<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.790> LT

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
Ronaldo chop by holding l2 which is LT

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.690 
Ronaldo chop by holding l2 which is LT
on<00:01:42.420> Xbox<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.200> then<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.890> move<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.100> left<00:01:44.579> stick

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
on Xbox and then you move the left stick

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.080 
on Xbox and then you move the left stick
to<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.119> bottom<00:01:45.390> left<00:01:45.750> or<00:01:46.020> bottom<00:01:46.799> right<00:01:47.090> then

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
to the bottom left or bottom right then

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.719 
to the bottom left or bottom right then
press<00:01:48.420> square<00:01:48.780> plus<00:01:49.229> X<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.250> lot<00:01:50.490> like<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
press square plus X it's a lot like the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.880 
press square plus X it's a lot like the
fake<00:01:51.119> shot<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.750> scoop<00:01:51.990> turn<00:01:52.200> two<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
fake shot and the scoop turn two of the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.350 
fake shot and the scoop turn two of the
skill<00:01:53.130> moves<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.520> discussed<00:01:53.909> in<00:01:54.119> previous

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
skill moves I discussed in previous

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.209 
skill moves I discussed in previous
episode<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.020> if<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.380> haven't<00:01:55.470> checked<00:01:56.009> it<00:01:56.130> out

episode so if you haven't checked it out

I'll leave links in the description

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.709 
I'll leave links in the description
below<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:59.189> I'll<00:01:59.340> show<00:01:59.579> you<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.759> few<00:02:00.119> examples<00:02:00.149> of

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
below so I'll show you a few examples of

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.200 
below so I'll show you a few examples of
the<00:02:00.869> Ronaldo<00:02:01.200> chop<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.560> an<00:02:01.710> actual<00:02:02.189> game<00:02:02.310> it's

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
the Ronaldo chop in an actual game it's

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.420 
the Ronaldo chop in an actual game it's
very<00:02:03.509> effective<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.020> use<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.770> wing<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.159> cut

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
very effective to use on the wing to cut

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.249 
very effective to use on the wing to cut
inside<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.210> shouldn't<00:02:06.570> spend<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.990> skill

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
inside but you shouldn't spend the skill

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.960 
inside but you shouldn't spend the skill
move<00:02:07.469> because<00:02:07.860> then<00:02:08.160> your<00:02:08.369> opponent<00:02:08.849> will

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
move because then your opponent will

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.540 
move because then your opponent will
have<00:02:09.060> an<00:02:09.209> easy<00:02:09.479> time<00:02:09.810> reading<00:02:10.229> your

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
have an easy time reading your

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.730 
have an easy time reading your
lays<00:02:10.700> try<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.750> mix<00:02:12.020> it<00:02:12.140> up<00:02:12.230> with<00:02:12.290> some<00:02:12.440> other

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
lays try to mix it up with some other

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.890 
lays try to mix it up with some other
skill<00:02:13.100> so<00:02:13.520> you<00:02:13.550> won't<00:02:13.880> get<00:02:14.120> too<00:02:14.330> predictable

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
skill so you won't get too predictable

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.350 
skill so you won't get too predictable
so<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.010> perfect<00:02:16.220> moment<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.760> use<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.120> skill

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
so the perfect moment to use the skill

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.300 
so the perfect moment to use the skill
move<00:02:17.540> is<00:02:17.750> probably<00:02:18.440> when<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.710> defender<00:02:19.220> is

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
move is probably when a defender is

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.730 
move is probably when a defender is
tracking<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:19.880> down<00:02:19.910> doing<00:02:20.450> when<00:02:21.350> he's<00:02:21.500> about

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
tracking you down doing when he's about

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.500 
tracking you down doing when he's about
to<00:02:22.130> hang<00:02:22.370> on<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:22.910> should<00:02:23.090> use<00:02:23.120> the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
to hang on you you should use the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.570 
to hang on you you should use the
Ronaldo<00:02:23.900> chop<00:02:23.950> when<00:02:24.950> you<00:02:25.070> give<00:02:25.220> your<00:02:25.340> opponent

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
Ronaldo chop when you give your opponent

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.610 
Ronaldo chop when you give your opponent
the<00:02:25.850> time<00:02:26.030> to<00:02:26.240> hang<00:02:26.480> on<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:26.780> it's<00:02:27.020> more<00:02:27.350> likely

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
the time to hang on you it's more likely

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.130 
the time to hang on you it's more likely
you'll<00:02:27.950> lose<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.340> ball<00:02:28.520> so<00:02:29.510> this<00:02:29.810> was<00:02:30.020> my

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
you'll lose the ball so this was my

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.170 
you'll lose the ball so this was my
