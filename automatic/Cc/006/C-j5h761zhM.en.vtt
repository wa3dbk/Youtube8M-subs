00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.189
 Hello friends today would like to 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:11.550
 talk for a few 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.429
 nemoto topic but I think that among my 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.820
 subscribers are quite a few people who 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.060
 maybe this topic is interesting speech 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.060
 will talk about computer games 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.840
 I bought a new type monitor here 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.980
 so gaming 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.980
 and on the occasion of giving away the origin 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:40.390
 3 battles for free, I downloaded it set and 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.030
 discovered that I forgot how to play 3d 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.920
 shooters 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.900
 last so normal last 3d 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:53.230
 shooter in which I say active played 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:55.660
 till it was the third quake and then so from 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.740
 occasionally all inside there 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.740
 against such bullshit 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.489
 and i play mostly that is under after 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.890
 after the third sticky somehow more 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.540
 began to play strategy and all sorts of there 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:15.110
 hack hack and slash 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.850
 i type diablo and i set myself mean 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.800
 this third battle decided but okay 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.979
 the multiplayer does not immediately go on even 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.780
 practice on cats 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.940
 went to play singles realized that damn I'm 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.470
 I do not understand what is happening in this 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:35.720
 the game does not see where the enemies are somehow slow 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:39.149
 I react to everything happening and so on 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.900
 although at one time even participated in 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:48.970
 qualifications on 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:52.210
 Those same world Cyber ​​games in general I not 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.870
 I know what happened, whether there are any games 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.750
 3d shooters have become incomprehensible but I'm still 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.680
 that noticed that the schedule and 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.670
 of course beautiful 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.910
 but no doubt but all this 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.340
 prevents to play the gameplay somehow 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:17.160
 distracted there is always some sorts 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:22.410
 then I don't know damn dust all those shards and 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:25.010
 so on all this makes it difficult to shoot like 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.010
 it turned out 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.820
 us 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:44.330
 I don't know, maybe this is because 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.330
 too old became the reaction is not that 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.880
 or used too play such 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.880
 measured games like i mostly play 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.980
 world of tanks world of tanks 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:02.850
 now recently began to play 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.850
 potatoes and planes too 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.849
 well, plus diablo and starcraft here 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.150
 such games and somehow 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:17.230
 when it seemed that shooters need to be re-started 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.849
 get used to learn to play tell in 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.040
 what games do you play if you play 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.010
 in general, but I think that among my 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.930
 many gamers followers 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:32.190
 but see tell me how are you 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.440
 The situation is this with these cases 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.140
 but then compared to the third 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:44.930
 for centuries the visual part of what is happening 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:48.780
 of course has changed very much 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.330
 Yes, I remember when we played in the second there 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.730
 meet like the opposite as much as possible 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:00.600
 graphics were downplayed by all effects and removed 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:03.590
 some tear out your eyes color left well 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.590
 what happens 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:13.540
 only so that nothing interferes with the process 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.370
 shooting and aiming and now somehow 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.449
 games seem to have become more calculated on 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:22.000
 what you will admire with what 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:24.180
 prettiness in this game they are gaming 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.180
 by process 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.710
 I do not know what you think about this 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.360
 tell me everything will be interesting 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.270
 went to ride 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.320
 have a great weekend to all of my 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.320
 good luck to all
