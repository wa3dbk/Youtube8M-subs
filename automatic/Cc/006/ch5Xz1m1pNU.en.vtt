00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.630
 the book of dj is a very chingón book 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.000
 there appears a photo of chair and in the 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.130
 cover and to see it you have to do 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.510
 one thing you have to enter the house of 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.820
 lester as you know you can not 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.830
 enter as well as simply touching and 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.690
 that ter pedals stop pulling fabric and 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.270
 open media to you do not have to make a 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.440
 cliché right now I am teaching you 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.420
 basically what they have to do is 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.860
 I forgot to record the location but good 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.900
 they can search it anywhere 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.430
 it is very complicated that but of all 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.409
 ways to see if you look for a photo and you 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.210
 I put down the description how they are 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.940
 seeing I'm on the roof has uploaded me 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.010
 a very changoleón form and there I am going to 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.650
 take out my cell phone later I will accept 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.269
 a mission or an activity and as you know 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.460
 then reject it if that 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.229
 inside is not very easy in fact yesterday 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.750
 uploaded the video not the video of how 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:06.820
 enter the police department and if 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.740
 there we are already inside the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.479
 home of lester something strange is that not 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.920
 is the sternum is something strange that 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.140
 will be doing the folk in Gordillo 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.880
 everyone's favorite let's go to the 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.700
 bookshelf 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.799
 let's look at this fucking book with 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.509
 the image of seagate the image is very 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.820
 chingona is not a very image 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.530
 representative of him back we see the 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.850
 virgin guadeloupe good I do not know if it is 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.490
 specifically the virgin of guadeloupe 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.070
 but we see as religious graffiti and 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.140
 we see our black favorites and jay 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.670
 there we also see that it says emily cross 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.670
 that apparently is the writer of the book 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.140
 I do not know the truth but maybe it's a 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.720
 crime book a book of 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.060
 famous gang members a drug book and 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.130
 of assassins or segway of gang member 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.610
 I think it could be and there you go and jane or 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.500
 maybe cholos bands of girls do not 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.360
 it looks and I think that in my book it 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.640
 wrote this book and as follows it is 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.009
 a very famous character is not from the 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.110
 History of gta no bueno de san andreas 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.390
 to be specific, something strange is that 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.119
 is this circle not marking sugar like this 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.119
 as highlighting that his spike 5 maybe 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.099
 It's very ugly, I do not know what you think 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.980
 it's very cool, we do not finally see something that 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:17.290

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.420
 this say the photo of the follow that was the 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.980
 most false thing in history there are people 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.210
 that you need to put a sign 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.580

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.100

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.060

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.160
