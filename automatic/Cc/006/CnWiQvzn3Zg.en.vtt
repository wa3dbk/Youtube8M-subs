since you're gonna be starting on F and

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.430 
since you're gonna be starting on F and
you're<00:01:07.030> gonna<00:01:07.150> be<00:01:07.330> going<00:01:07.570> up<00:01:07.690> in<00:01:07.810> six<00:01:08.200> so<00:01:09.070> six

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
then up the scale scale and then you

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.670 
then up the scale scale and then you
repeat<00:01:18.520> that<00:01:18.700> for<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.330> B<00:01:19.720> flat<00:01:19.869> portion<00:01:20.200> which

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
repeat that for the B flat portion which

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.460 
repeat that for the B flat portion which
is<00:01:20.710> sexually<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.400> E<00:01:21.430> flat<00:01:21.520> whore<00:01:22.470> except

and then you go up chromatically so

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.260 
and then you go up chromatically so
you're<00:02:00.189> going<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.340> start<00:02:00.549> on<00:02:00.700> jeans<00:02:01.030> Oh<00:02:01.240> a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
sixth up from that then go up a half

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.980 
sixth up from that then go up a half
step<00:02:04.960> for<00:02:05.229> each<00:02:05.380> finger<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:07.149> then<00:02:07.540> up<00:02:07.689> a<00:02:07.810> half

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
step for each finger and then up a half

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:21.080 
step for each finger and then up a half

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
gonna start on the F below middle C

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:44.940 
gonna start on the F below middle C
here's<00:02:29.980> middle<00:02:30.160> C<00:02:31.200> G<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:33.640> you're<00:02:34.090> gonna<00:02:34.180> play

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:20.640 

do<00:03:11.750> that<00:03:11.930> twice

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.309 

then<00:03:21.129> you<00:03:21.250> go<00:03:21.400> back<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.849> beat<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:23.170> one

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
then you go back to the beat the one

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.500 
then you go back to the beat the one
that<00:03:23.530> starts<00:03:23.830> on<00:03:23.950> b-flat<00:03:24.280> sequence<00:03:24.879> which<00:03:25.330> is

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
that starts on b-flat sequence which is

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:33.420 
that starts on b-flat sequence which is
B<00:03:25.810> flat<00:03:27.299> a<00:03:28.299> flat<00:03:28.330> D<00:03:29.140> flat<00:03:29.860> to<00:03:30.159> B<00:03:30.580> flat<00:03:32.430> that

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
B flat a flat D flat to B flat that

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.800 
B flat a flat D flat to B flat that
twice

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:56.580 

back<00:03:41.319> down<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:42.000> fnd<00:03:43.000> sequence

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.080 

then<00:03:57.010> you're<00:03:57.220> gonna<00:03:57.310> do<00:03:57.610> a<00:03:57.790> flat<00:03:58.349> me<00:03:59.349> natural

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
then you're gonna do a flat me natural

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.190 
then you're gonna do a flat me natural
then<00:04:01.090> you're<00:04:01.269> just<00:04:01.450> gonna<00:04:01.540> go<00:04:01.750> down<00:04:01.930> a<00:04:01.959> half

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
then you're just gonna go down a half

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.820 
then you're just gonna go down a half
step<00:04:02.530> to<00:04:02.560> G

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
step to G

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.880 
step to G
down<00:04:05.010> a<00:04:05.040> half<00:04:05.250> step<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.550> e-flat<00:04:06.470> then<00:04:07.470> just<00:04:07.740> go

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
down a half step to e-flat then just go

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.680 
down a half step to e-flat then just go
up<00:04:07.920> a<00:04:08.250> half<00:04:08.460> step<00:04:08.640> in<00:04:08.880> your<00:04:09.000> left<00:04:09.210> hand<00:04:09.330> so<00:04:09.600> you

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
up a half step in your left hand so you

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.150 
up a half step in your left hand so you
we're<00:04:09.900> here<00:04:10.200> so<00:04:10.410> you're<00:04:10.500> just<00:04:10.590> going<00:04:10.770> to<00:04:10.860> go<00:04:10.980> up

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
we're here so you're just going to go up

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.690 
we're here so you're just going to go up
a<00:04:11.190> half<00:04:11.460> step<00:04:11.610> to<00:04:11.760> a<00:04:12.480> flat<00:04:13.010> if<00:04:14.010> your<00:04:14.160> pinky<00:04:14.520> up

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
a half step to a flat if your pinky up

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.580 
a half step to a flat if your pinky up
half<00:04:15.030> step<00:04:15.300> to<00:04:15.330> E<00:04:15.540> natural

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.510 

and<00:04:18.680> then<00:04:18.919> a<00:04:19.130> natural<00:04:21.010> so<00:04:22.010> this<00:04:22.190> is<00:04:22.310> out<00:04:22.430> the

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
and then a natural so this is out the

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.159 
and then a natural so this is out the
half<00:04:22.669> step<00:04:22.910> here<00:04:23.150> and<00:04:23.510> then<00:04:23.600> this<00:04:23.780> is<00:04:23.840> moving

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
half step here and then this is moving

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.070 
half step here and then this is moving
up<00:04:24.350> a<00:04:24.440> half<00:04:24.620> step<00:04:24.770> here<00:04:25.100> to<00:04:25.250> F<00:04:25.810> then<00:04:26.810> back<00:04:27.050> down

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
up a half step here to F then back down

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.340 
up a half step here to F then back down
to<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.620> a<00:04:27.650> flat<00:04:28.240> and<00:04:29.240> then<00:04:29.600> the<00:04:29.720> F<00:04:29.840> goes<00:04:30.110> down

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
to the a flat and then the F goes down

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:43.540 
to the a flat and then the F goes down
to<00:04:30.710> e<00:04:30.740> natural<00:04:31.449> do<00:04:32.449> not<00:04:32.600> twice
