00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.830 
let's take a look at her tail it's kind
of<00:01:53.040> cooled<00:01:53.430> down<00:01:53.700> because<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.299> kind<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.600> cold

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
of cooled down because it's kind of cold

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.020 
of cooled down because it's kind of cold
in<00:01:55.049> my<00:01:55.170> house<00:01:55.320> today<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.549> pink<00:01:56.850> is

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
in my house today and so the pink is

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.850 
in my house today and so the pink is
fading<00:01:57.479> away<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.869> little<00:01:58.140> bit<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:58.590> see<00:01:58.649> a

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
fading away a little bit you can see a

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.819 
fading away a little bit you can see a
green<00:01:59.280> color<00:01:59.670> so<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.000> almost<00:02:00.119> looks<00:02:00.509> like<00:02:00.829> her

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
green color so it almost looks like her

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.260 
green color so it almost looks like her
tail<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.189> kind<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.460> resting<00:02:02.850> over<00:02:03.119> or

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
tail is kind of resting over or

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.610 
tail is kind of resting over or
something<00:02:03.750> as<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> little<00:02:04.200> weird

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
something as a little weird

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.590 
something as a little weird
let's<00:02:04.770> put<00:02:04.980> on<00:02:05.100> some<00:02:05.370> more<00:02:05.520> warm<00:02:05.850> water<00:02:06.180> there

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
let's put on some more warm water there

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.890 
let's put on some more warm water there
we<00:02:06.690> go<00:02:06.840> we<00:02:07.530> are<00:02:07.680> back<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.950> pink<00:02:08.630> looks<00:02:09.630> really

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:09.900 
we go we are back to pink looks really

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.600 
we go we are back to pink looks really
good<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.080> she's<00:02:10.470> outside<00:02:10.860> it'll<00:02:11.130> stay<00:02:11.340> pink

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
good so she's outside it'll stay pink

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.610 
good so she's outside it'll stay pink
very<00:02:11.880> well<00:02:12.090> but<00:02:12.360> if<00:02:12.570> you're<00:02:12.720> inside<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.530> it's

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
very well but if you're inside and it's

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.580 
very well but if you're inside and it's
cold<00:02:14.000> then<00:02:15.000> we<00:02:15.780> would<00:02:15.870> probably<00:02:16.140> turn<00:02:16.230> back<00:02:16.470> to

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
cold then we would probably turn back to

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.930 
cold then we would probably turn back to
green<00:02:16.800> pretty<00:02:17.010> quick<00:02:17.220> so<00:02:17.460> let<00:02:17.610> me<00:02:17.640> put<00:02:17.730> some
