00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 Hi, here we are on the side of the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.809
 acting Thursday is what he sits 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.300
 and I'm cooler if you guys 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.660
 to consider but here today the theme until 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.960
 are appearing in the images in the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.920
 famous internet using books scholarship 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.920
 on the red carpet 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:30.090
 And as you can see I transmit my 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.800
 I weigh and my little terezinha short 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.740
 the world looks that there are our people of them 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.470
 use more as a cut né to anyone who imagines 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.660
 He dominated but is listening to a 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.360
 Correntinha is going to stay one more thing 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.840
 practice of using it in everyday life 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.930
 lolita book is a classic né in the famous 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.090
 and I saw the great Natalie accusing her 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.250
 book bag and I wanted to do 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.250
 inspired I told you to see 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.199
 I put a hot filter to let 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:07.050
 happier 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.659
 but you can also is coated with 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.030
 fabric you can paint because you 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.940
 made on the original back so that 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.960
 I saw year red carpet the side is 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.420
 black 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.580
 I wanted to make gold because it reminds me more 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.640
 a real book you can use 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.620
 3d dimensional ink had ended then 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.619
 I had to improvise and I paid for it 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.810
 idea of marrying with golden enamel 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.079
 super cool was super cool super 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.149
 shiny for the locks I've used 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.530
 is very easy to tell and it is 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.630
 super cheap too 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.860
 this here is a handle of an old purse 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.500
 that I do not know more 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.979
 but you can use other members of 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.719
 leather bag or conca who had in 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.789
 craft stores and you already 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.770
 for some time you should have 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.560
 remembered a video I made and 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.780
 we are doing a scholarship book more 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.460
 with a real book if you will not turn 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.350
 I'll leave the link here somewhere. 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.810
 of the screen for you to see ugly too 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.530
 cool but at that time I have not yet 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.860
 had developed the idea I discovered 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.500
 that there was one of mdf's 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.990
 book format and with much easier 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.360
 you can do to use as a purse or 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.910
 objects or leave my heart 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.950
 I did with the lolita inspired book 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.430
 but you can do to balance you 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.739
 I just want to force more curricular 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.719
 in our group that if you reproduce 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.879
 in some br you have seen here in the river the 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:35.430
 cyclists can have us photos on the 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.040
 social networking using the hashtag ebx group 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.870
 do not forget to choose the theme that 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.939
 You most want to see us reproduce. 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.040
 here on the 31st we open a 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.879
 form and a link will also be 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.219
 down here 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.829
 without further ado we are going to 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:52.829
 need a book in mdf you 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.959
 you find in craft shops in ink 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:58.730
 the color you prefer 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:01.709
 always try to think in the same way 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.560
 very good in this process until the book 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:10.980
 already completely painted then lower use 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:16.889
 for the small parts and do not forget 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:20.549
 from the sides of the book was the 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:25.099
 felt you can check with fabric or even 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.099
 I spent paint adhesive and pasted 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:43.450
 while I dried I took the opportunity to 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:46.240
 finishing touches on painting with a ruler 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.180
 and a pen is permanent and an edge 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.500
 on the cover of the book and one has time and 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:57.120
 you can do with black ink and 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.120
 reinforced a little traffic 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.100
 the crushing now of 1 100 500 now 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.490
 redone there to serve me as a bar 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.940
 would have a thin brush and a white 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:18.330
 I started to make sure everything is little. 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:20.970
 beat this science with the dash for 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:24.030
 effect would be permanent pen and against 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.600
 the law and then I took the opportunity to correct 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.600
 some failures 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.210
 with the golden enamel I went through the 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.210
 edge 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.080
 and letters with there to help me and 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.410
 be very careful with toney with the pen 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.410
 black 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:22.619
 I hate seeing you close and my father 

00:05:20.369 --> 00:05:28.439
 helped in this part and that there is a 

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:31.549
 box on each side for this and 2 for 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:31.549
 the black fish
