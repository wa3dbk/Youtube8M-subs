played a game of call of duty on and I

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.020 
played a game of call of duty on and I
got<00:01:58.780> hooked<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.650> was<00:01:59.979> so<00:02:00.189> much<00:02:00.340> fun<00:02:00.400> back<00:02:00.820> then

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
got hooked it was so much fun back then

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.149 
got hooked it was so much fun back then
especially<00:02:01.240> during<00:02:01.840> call<00:02:02.110> of<00:02:02.200> duty<00:02:02.380> 4<00:02:02.409> that's

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
especially during call of duty 4 that's

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.730 
especially during call of duty 4 that's
when<00:02:03.369> I<00:02:03.400> started<00:02:03.850> so<00:02:04.119> like<00:02:04.659> I<00:02:04.780> said<00:02:04.840> it<00:02:05.500> was

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
when I started so like I said it was

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.649 
when I started so like I said it was
definitely<00:02:06.010> a<00:02:06.250> lot<00:02:06.520> of<00:02:06.700> fun<00:02:06.909> you<00:02:07.119> can<00:02:07.299> use<00:02:07.450> any

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
definitely a lot of fun you can use any

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.419 
definitely a lot of fun you can use any
weapon<00:02:07.990> on<00:02:08.259> that<00:02:08.439> map<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:08.979> would<00:02:09.069> do<00:02:09.220> well

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
weapon on that map and it would do well

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.270 
weapon on that map and it would do well
for<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:09.759> so<00:02:09.789> that's<00:02:10.569> that<00:02:10.929> now<00:02:11.319> number<00:02:11.620> 9<00:02:12.010> I

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
for you so that's that now number 9 I

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.339 
for you so that's that now number 9 I
actually<00:02:12.730> have<00:02:13.090> an<00:02:13.330> advanced<00:02:13.780> warfare<00:02:14.110> map

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
actually have an advanced warfare map

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.770 
actually have an advanced warfare map
and<00:02:14.560> that's<00:02:14.709> Detroit<00:02:15.280> now<00:02:15.879> the<00:02:16.480> reasoning

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
and that's Detroit now the reasoning

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.809 
and that's Detroit now the reasoning
behind<00:02:16.810> this<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.500> because<00:02:17.799> I<00:02:18.010> actually<00:02:18.250> enjoy

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
behind this is because I actually enjoy

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.390 
behind this is because I actually enjoy
this<00:02:18.849> map<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.450> lot<00:02:19.689> you<00:02:20.169> can<00:02:20.319> rush<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:21.099> can<00:02:21.249> use

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
this map a lot you can rush you can use

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.519 
this map a lot you can rush you can use
any<00:02:21.609> submachine<00:02:22.510> gun<00:02:22.719> you<00:02:22.840> can<00:02:22.989> use<00:02:23.139> a<00:02:23.169> shotgun

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:23.529 
any submachine gun you can use a shotgun

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:24.309 
any submachine gun you can use a shotgun
you<00:02:23.889> can<00:02:24.040> use

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
you can use

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.800 
you can use
sniper<00:02:24.590> an<00:02:24.920> assault<00:02:25.489> rifle<00:02:25.549> this<00:02:26.150> map<00:02:26.359> is<00:02:26.390> good

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
sniper an assault rifle this map is good

high<00:02:45.620> up<00:02:45.650> on<00:02:45.950> my<00:02:45.980> list<00:02:46.340> is<00:02:46.489> because<00:02:46.879> it<00:02:47.480> wasn't

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
high up on my list is because it wasn't

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.349 
high up on my list is because it wasn't
that<00:02:48.469> great<00:02:48.709> of<00:02:48.859> a<00:02:48.950> map<00:02:49.159> but<00:02:49.579> the<00:02:49.670> thing<00:02:49.700> was<00:02:49.909> it

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
that great of a map but the thing was it

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.869 
that great of a map but the thing was it
was<00:02:50.450> always<00:02:50.739> hectic<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:52.189> that's<00:02:52.639> something

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
was always hectic and that's something

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.759 
was always hectic and that's something
that<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:53.120> enjoy<00:02:53.269> about<00:02:53.629> call<00:02:54.079> of<00:02:54.109> duty<00:02:54.409> I<00:02:54.439> didn't

really<00:02:54.919> like<00:02:55.249> the<00:02:55.489> map<00:02:55.730> layout<00:02:56.180> per<00:02:56.750> se<00:02:56.959> but<00:02:57.590> I

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
really like the map layout per se but I

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.220
