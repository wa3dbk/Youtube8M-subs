wires<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.450> vines<00:00:06.690> using<00:00:07.649> blender<00:00:08.010> I've

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
wires and vines using blender I've

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.089 
wires and vines using blender I've
upgraded<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:10.260> stable<00:00:10.620> release<00:00:10.860> of

time<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.560> this<00:00:19.619> recording<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.600> let's<00:00:21.600> get

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
time of this recording so let's get

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.019 
time of this recording so let's get
started<00:00:22.189> the<00:00:23.189> first<00:00:23.220> thing<00:00:23.519> we're<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.699> do<00:00:23.850> is

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
started the first thing we're to do is

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.929 
started the first thing we're to do is
create<00:00:24.660> our<00:00:24.840> new<00:00:25.019> blend<00:00:25.500> file<00:00:25.710> here<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.430> make

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
create our new blend file here and make

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.200 
create our new blend file here and make
a<00:00:26.970> new<00:00:27.210> scene<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:28.490> delete<00:00:29.490> this<00:00:29.640> cube<00:00:29.910> because

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
a new scene and delete this cube because

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.690 
a new scene and delete this cube because
we're<00:00:30.480> not<00:00:30.510> going<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.779> need<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.460> now<00:00:32.460> it's

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
we're not going to need it now it's

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.880 
we're not going to need it now it's
really<00:00:32.940> important<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:34.200> make<00:00:34.410> sure<00:00:34.440> that

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
really important that you make sure that

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.950 
really important that you make sure that
your<00:00:35.070> 3d<00:00:35.370> cursor<00:00:35.520> stays<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.210> exact<00:00:36.570> center

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
your 3d cursor stays in the exact center

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.260 
your 3d cursor stays in the exact center
of<00:00:37.640> the<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.180> scene<00:00:39.390> here<00:00:39.629> or<00:00:39.840> else<00:00:40.040> your

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
of the of the scene here or else your

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.010 
of the of the scene here or else your
coordinates<00:00:42.270> are<00:00:42.329> going<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.510> be<00:00:42.600> all<00:00:42.690> screwy

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
coordinates are going to be all screwy

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.470 
coordinates are going to be all screwy
and<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.500> not<00:00:43.649> going<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.829> look<00:00:43.920> right<00:00:43.980> so

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
and it's not going to look right so

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.270 
and it's not going to look right so
let's<00:00:45.480> go<00:00:45.600> ahead<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.809> add<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.039> we're<00:00:47.160> going

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
let's go ahead and add and we're going

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.139 
let's go ahead and add and we're going
to<00:00:47.340> add<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:48.710> cylinder<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.640> cylinder

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
to add a cylinder and in this cylinder

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.610 
to add a cylinder and in this cylinder
we're<00:00:51.360> going<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.600> put<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.840> vertices<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.410> about

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
we're going to put the vertices at about

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.450 
we're going to put the vertices at about
at<00:00:53.280> five<00:00:53.670> or<00:00:54.120> some<00:00:54.390> small<00:00:54.750> number<00:00:55.100> that<00:00:56.100> we<00:00:56.309> can

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
at five or some small number that we can

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.430 
at five or some small number that we can
always<00:00:56.760> adjust<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.750> make<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.050> look<00:00:58.230> better

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
always adjust to make this look better

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.340 
always adjust to make this look better
later<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.120> we<00:01:00.120> also<00:01:00.270> want<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.570> do<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.960> uncheck

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
later and we also want to do is uncheck

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.399 
later and we also want to do is uncheck
this<00:01:01.800> where<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.190> says<00:01:02.430> cap<00:01:02.699> ends<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.019> we

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
this where it says cap ends so that we

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.550 
this where it says cap ends so that we
don't<00:01:04.500> have<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.890> ends<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.460> our<00:01:05.640> our<00:01:06.150> cylinder

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
don't have the ends to our our cylinder

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.190 
don't have the ends to our our cylinder
now<00:01:07.560> if<00:01:08.310> we<00:01:08.369> press<00:01:08.790> our<00:01:09.030> hit<00:01:09.479> rotate<00:01:09.960> and

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
now if we press our hit rotate and

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.990 
now if we press our hit rotate and
rotate<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.100> 90<00:01:11.850> degrees<00:01:11.880> along<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.140> y-axis<00:01:14.000> we

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
rotate it 90 degrees along the y-axis we

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.990 
rotate it 90 degrees along the y-axis we
should<00:01:15.299> have<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.259> cylinder<00:01:17.189> now<00:01:17.310> with<00:01:17.549> no<00:01:17.700> ends

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
should have a cylinder now with no ends

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.289 
should have a cylinder now with no ends
that<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:19.460> basically<00:01:20.460> pointed<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
that is basically pointed in the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.859 
that is basically pointed in the
direction<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.869> x-axis<00:01:23.030> now<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.299> what<00:01:24.780> we

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
direction of the x-axis now on what we

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.960 
direction of the x-axis now on what we
want<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.110> do<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.560> go<00:01:26.250> over<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.580> button

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
want to do is go over to this button

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.330 
want to do is go over to this button
where<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.240> says<00:01:27.450> modifiers<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.290> we're<00:01:29.009> going

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
where it says modifiers and we're going

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.690 
where it says modifiers and we're going
to<00:01:29.400> create<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.770> less<00:01:31.770> worth<00:01:32.040> let's<00:01:32.310> add<00:01:32.490> this

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
to create a less worth let's add this

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.050 
to create a less worth let's add this
this<00:01:33.210> array<00:01:33.509> modifier<00:01:34.020> now<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.610> thing<00:01:35.909> can

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
this array modifier now this thing can

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.740 
this array modifier now this thing can
be<00:01:36.090> really<00:01:36.930> screwy<00:01:37.229> sometimes<00:01:38.540> there<00:01:39.540> are<00:01:39.689> a

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
be really screwy sometimes there are a

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.170 
be really screwy sometimes there are a
couple<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:40.049> things<00:01:40.259> we<00:01:40.470> need<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.650> do<00:01:40.740> here<00:01:40.979> a

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
couple of things we need to do here a

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.440 
couple of things we need to do here a
under<00:01:42.180> fit<00:01:42.450> type<00:01:42.689> select<00:01:43.259> them<00:01:43.790> fit<00:01:44.790> curve<00:01:45.119> and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
under fit type select them fit curve and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.179 
under fit type select them fit curve and
actually<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> curve<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.890> we're<00:01:47.009> going<00:01:47.130> to

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
actually the curve that we're going to

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.350 
actually the curve that we're going to
be<00:01:47.310> using<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:48.979> with<00:01:49.979> your<00:01:50.220> 3d<00:01:50.729> cursor<00:01:50.880> where<00:01:51.270> it

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
be using is with your 3d cursor where it

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.760 
be using is with your 3d cursor where it
is<00:01:51.450> right<00:01:51.720> there<00:01:51.780> let's<00:01:52.170> let's<00:01:52.590> add<00:01:52.740> another

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
is right there let's let's add another

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.219 
is right there let's let's add another
curve<00:01:53.250> real<00:01:53.520> quick<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.000> just<00:01:54.060> put<00:01:54.810> in<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.990> path

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
curve real quick and just put in a path

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.550 
curve real quick and just put in a path
and<00:01:55.590> this<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.610> actually<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.060> curve<00:01:57.560> basically

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
and this is actually the curve basically

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.980 
and this is actually the curve basically
the<00:01:58.680> way<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:58.979> works<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.659> after<00:02:00.659> we're<00:02:00.810> done

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the way this works is after we're done

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.420 
the way this works is after we're done
you're<00:02:01.229> going<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.409> be<00:02:01.530> able<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:01.920> modify

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
you're going to be able to just modify

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.160 
you're going to be able to just modify
the<00:02:02.490> path<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.329> will<00:02:03.479> build<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.930> vines

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the path and it will build the vines

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.429 
the path and it will build the vines
around<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.310> path<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:06.329> let's<00:02:06.930> go<00:02:07.079> back<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.290> our

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
around the path so let's go back to our

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.669 
around the path so let's go back to our
cylinder<00:02:07.860> here<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.869> under<00:02:09.869> curve<00:02:10.140> for<00:02:10.530> your

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
cylinder here and under curve for your

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.400 
cylinder here and under curve for your
array<00:02:11.220> modifier

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
array modifier

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.860 
array modifier
select<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.680> NURBS<00:02:14.310> path<00:02:14.610> now<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.750> is

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
select this NURBS path now this is

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.230 
select this NURBS path now this is
really<00:02:16.050> screwy<00:02:16.440> because<00:02:16.860> in<00:02:17.430> some<00:02:17.700> tutorials

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
really screwy because in some tutorials

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.840 
really screwy because in some tutorials
it<00:02:18.420> says<00:02:18.660> who<00:02:18.960> that<00:02:19.920> your<00:02:20.070> relative<00:02:20.430> offset

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
it says who that your relative offset

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.910 
it says who that your relative offset
should<00:02:21.090> be<00:02:21.240> you<00:02:21.450> know<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:21.720> X<00:02:22.200> here<00:02:22.530> at<00:02:22.650> one

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
should be you know this X here at one

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.520 
should be you know this X here at one
and<00:02:23.160> then<00:02:23.310> all<00:02:23.850> these<00:02:24.060> others<00:02:24.540> at<00:02:24.720> zero<00:02:25.020> but<00:02:25.320> I

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
and then all these others at zero but I

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.680 
and then all these others at zero but I
found<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.190> sometimes<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.880> does<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.420> and

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
found that sometimes it does this and

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.410 
found that sometimes it does this and
all<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.840> have<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.050> do<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.380> change<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:29.360> one<00:02:30.360> to

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
all you have to do is change this one to

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.800 
all you have to do is change this one to
a<00:02:30.540> zero<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.200> this<00:02:31.830> under<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.700> Z<00:02:32.910> offset<00:02:33.150> make

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
a zero and this under the Z offset make

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.320 
a zero and this under the Z offset make
that<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.020> one<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.530> that's<00:02:35.280> well<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:36.180> should

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
that a one and that's well that should

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.560 
that a one and that's well that should
fix<00:02:36.540> your<00:02:36.720> problem<00:02:37.400> now<00:02:38.400> what<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.300> will<00:02:39.450> do

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
fix your problem now what this will do

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.010 
fix your problem now what this will do
right<00:02:39.780> now<00:02:39.930> this<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.230> will<00:02:40.620> just<00:02:42.020> extend

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
right now this this will just extend

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.140 
right now this this will just extend
keep<00:02:43.260> creating<00:02:43.590> new<00:02:43.950> cylinders<00:02:44.820> for<00:02:45.030> the

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
keep creating new cylinders for the

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.600 
keep creating new cylinders for the
length<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:47.010> curve<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.340> we<00:02:47.460> have

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
length of the of the curve that we have

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.270 
length of the of the curve that we have
there<00:02:47.850> now<00:02:48.480> what<00:02:49.230> we<00:02:49.350> want<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.650> do<00:02:49.800> is<00:02:49.980> we<00:02:50.130> also

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
there now what we want to do is we also

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.010 
there now what we want to do is we also
want<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.610> deform<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:51.270> where<00:02:51.450> if<00:02:51.570> we<00:02:51.630> decide

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
want to deform it so where if we decide

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.560 
want to deform it so where if we decide
to<00:02:52.080> move<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.590> curve<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:53.150> spirals<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.300> such

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
to move the curve and spirals and such

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.280 
to move the curve and spirals and such
it<00:02:55.140> will<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:56.040> cylinders<00:02:56.430> will<00:02:56.610> follow

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
it will the cylinders will follow

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.260 
it will the cylinders will follow
respectively<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:58.550> what<00:02:59.550> we<00:02:59.670> want<00:02:59.850> to<00:02:59.910> do<00:03:00.060> is

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
respectively so what we want to do is

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.290 
respectively so what we want to do is
select<00:03:00.510> this<00:03:00.870> box<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.740> says<00:03:01.950> merge<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.610> then

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
select this box that says merge and then

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.540 
select this box that says merge and then
we<00:03:03.390> want<00:03:03.570> to<00:03:03.660> add<00:03:03.750> another<00:03:03.930> modifier<00:03:04.590> for<00:03:05.370> our

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
we want to add another modifier for our

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.180 
we want to add another modifier for our
cylinder<00:03:05.900> in<00:03:06.900> older<00:03:07.260> versions<00:03:07.290> i<00:03:07.800> think<00:03:08.040> it's

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
cylinder in older versions i think it's

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.970 
cylinder in older versions i think it's
just<00:03:08.220> called<00:03:08.580> deform<00:03:09.680> but<00:03:10.680> we're<00:03:10.830> going<00:03:10.920> to

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
just called deform but we're going to

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
just called deform but we're going to
use<00:03:11.220> this<00:03:11.430> curve<00:03:11.760> right<00:03:12.120> here<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:13.850> under<00:03:14.850> the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
use this curve right here and under the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.320 
use this curve right here and under the
curve<00:03:15.330> we're<00:03:15.840> going<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.730> write<00:03:17.730> by<00:03:17.880> this<00:03:18.060> box

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
curve we're going to write by this box

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.280 
curve we're going to write by this box
we're<00:03:18.540> going<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.720> select<00:03:18.900> nerves<00:03:19.320> path<00:03:19.620> and

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
we're going to select nerves path and

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.690 
we're going to select nerves path and
that<00:03:22.290> should<00:03:22.500> be<00:03:22.590> pretty<00:03:22.740> much<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.190> now<00:03:23.370> now

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
that should be pretty much it now now

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.600 
that should be pretty much it now now
what<00:03:23.850> happens<00:03:23.880> is<00:03:24.570> when<00:03:25.470> we<00:03:25.710> go<00:03:26.010> down<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.580> our

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
what happens is when we go down to our

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.390 
what happens is when we go down to our
our<00:03:27.390> path<00:03:27.720> here<00:03:28.280> let's<00:03:29.280> uh<00:03:29.520> select<00:03:30.330> our<00:03:30.510> path

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
our path here let's uh select our path

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.480 
our path here let's uh select our path
go<00:03:32.400> into<00:03:32.820> edit<00:03:33.450> mode<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:34.050> select<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.130> one<00:03:35.280> end

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
go into edit mode and select the one end

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.760 
go into edit mode and select the one end
and<00:03:35.700> let's<00:03:36.120> see<00:03:36.300> if<00:03:36.390> we<00:03:36.510> grab<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:36.930> here<00:03:37.110> we<00:03:37.650> go

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
and let's see if we grab it here we go

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.700 
and let's see if we grab it here we go
I'll<00:03:37.890> see<00:03:38.600> so<00:03:39.600> what<00:03:39.720> happens<00:03:40.050> is<00:03:40.200> if<00:03:40.380> we<00:03:40.500> press

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
I'll see so what happens is if we press

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.770 
I'll see so what happens is if we press
G<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.250> we<00:03:41.400> grab<00:03:41.610> it<00:03:41.760> it's<00:03:41.910> actually<00:03:42.330> going<00:03:42.510> to

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
G and we grab it it's actually going to

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.720 
G and we grab it it's actually going to
extend<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.950> form<00:03:44.780> based<00:03:45.780> on<00:03:46.220> where<00:03:47.220> we<00:03:47.340> put

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
extend and form based on where we put

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.810 
extend and form based on where we put
our<00:03:47.790> path<00:03:48.090> now<00:03:48.360> you<00:03:48.420> can<00:03:48.690> also<00:03:48.840> extrude<00:03:49.440> and

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
our path now you can also extrude and

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.380 
our path now you can also extrude and
really<00:03:50.820> do<00:03:50.940> pretty<00:03:51.150> much<00:03:51.240> whatever<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:51.780> want

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
really do pretty much whatever you want

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.630 
really do pretty much whatever you want
to<00:03:54.390> create<00:03:54.630> your<00:03:54.840> your<00:03:55.500> vines<00:03:55.740> here<00:03:56.040> or<00:03:56.460> your

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
to create your your vines here or your

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.660 
to create your your vines here or your
wire<00:03:57.080> now<00:03:58.080> one<00:03:58.350> of<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.530> things<00:03:58.590> I've<00:03:59.070> noticed

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
wire now one of the things I've noticed

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.690 
wire now one of the things I've noticed
is<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.030> if<00:04:00.360> you<00:04:00.480> want<00:04:00.750> to<00:04:00.870> scale<00:04:01.140> this<00:04:01.320> down

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
is that if you want to scale this down

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.370 
is that if you want to scale this down
if<00:04:02.700> this<00:04:02.910> is<00:04:03.090> you<00:04:03.330> know<00:04:03.420> way<00:04:03.600> too<00:04:03.660> large<00:04:03.990> let's

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
if this is you know way too large let's

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.070 
if this is you know way too large let's
go<00:04:04.470> back<00:04:04.650> to<00:04:04.680> your<00:04:04.890> cylinder<00:04:05.630> you<00:04:06.630> want<00:04:06.840> to<00:04:06.930> be

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
go back to your cylinder you want to be

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.040 
go back to your cylinder you want to be
in<00:04:07.290> edit<00:04:07.650> mode<00:04:07.680> when<00:04:08.070> you<00:04:08.160> scale<00:04:08.460> down<00:04:09.050> if

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
in edit mode when you scale down if

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.440 
in edit mode when you scale down if
you're<00:04:10.350> in<00:04:10.500> object<00:04:10.920> mode<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.370> then<00:04:12.210> you<00:04:12.330> hit

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
you're in object mode and then you hit

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.260 
you're in object mode and then you hit
scale<00:04:12.780> it's<00:04:13.380> going<00:04:13.530> to<00:04:13.620> scale<00:04:13.890> down

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
scale it's going to scale down

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.240 
scale it's going to scale down
everything<00:04:15.270> so<00:04:15.930> you're<00:04:16.500> really<00:04:16.680> not<00:04:16.830> going<00:04:17.160> to

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
everything so you're really not going to

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.590 
everything so you're really not going to
get<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.430> results<00:04:17.820> you<00:04:17.910> want<00:04:18.150> if<00:04:18.270> you<00:04:18.359> try<00:04:18.570> to

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
get the results you want if you try to

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.950 
get the results you want if you try to
scale<00:04:18.960> down<00:04:18.989> and<00:04:19.580> in<00:04:20.580> object<00:04:21.330> mode<00:04:21.390> here<00:04:21.750> so

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
scale down and in object mode here so

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.480 
scale down and in object mode here so
let's<00:04:22.500> go<00:04:22.590> into<00:04:22.770> edit<00:04:22.830> mode<00:04:23.010> it's<00:04:23.400> gonna

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
let's go into edit mode it's gonna

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.040 
let's go into edit mode it's gonna
to<00:04:24.580> de<00:04:24.970> straighten<00:04:25.300> out<00:04:25.389> the<00:04:25.509> cylinder<00:04:25.840> again

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
to de straighten out the cylinder again

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.950 
to de straighten out the cylinder again
and<00:04:26.340> just<00:04:27.340> scale<00:04:27.580> it<00:04:27.610> down<00:04:27.759> however<00:04:28.599> small<00:04:28.780> you

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
and just scale it down however small you

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.700 
and just scale it down however small you
want<00:04:29.110> it<00:04:30.569> about<00:04:31.569> there<00:04:31.900> so<00:04:32.199> and<00:04:32.229> when<00:04:32.500> you<00:04:32.590> go

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
want it about there so and when you go

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.400 
want it about there so and when you go
back<00:04:32.860> into<00:04:33.069> object<00:04:33.400> mode<00:04:33.430> you'll<00:04:33.729> notice<00:04:34.000> that

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
back into object mode you'll notice that

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.279 
back into object mode you'll notice that
it<00:04:35.410> forms<00:04:35.919> back<00:04:36.099> into<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.610> curve<00:04:37.449> again<00:04:37.630> now

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
it forms back into the curve again now

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.610 
it forms back into the curve again now
we<00:04:38.349> do<00:04:38.590> this<00:04:38.770> because<00:04:39.840> it<00:04:40.840> does<00:04:41.080> this<00:04:41.289> because

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
we do this because it does this because

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.460 
we do this because it does this because
we<00:04:42.400> haven't<00:04:42.639> applied<00:04:42.759> our<00:04:43.060> modifiers<00:04:43.810> yet<00:04:44.139> and

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
we haven't applied our modifiers yet and

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.650 
we haven't applied our modifiers yet and
you<00:04:44.889> really<00:04:44.979> don't<00:04:45.310> want<00:04:45.490> to<00:04:45.550> do<00:04:45.639> that<00:04:45.669> until

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
you really don't want to do that until

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.330 
you really don't want to do that until

just apply both of these and and there
you<00:05:27.849> have<00:05:27.880> it<00:05:28.000> creates<00:05:28.690> the<00:05:29.039> the<00:05:30.090> array

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
you have it creates the the array

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.659 
you have it creates the the array
objects<00:05:32.169> that<00:05:32.349> were<00:05:32.500> your<00:05:32.650> old<00:05:32.830> cylinders<00:05:33.340> and

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
objects that were your old cylinders and

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.110 
objects that were your old cylinders and
from<00:05:34.539> here<00:05:34.750> you<00:05:34.810> can<00:05:35.130> start<00:05:36.130> modifying<00:05:36.460> it<00:05:36.880> so

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
from here you can start modifying it so

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.330 
from here you can start modifying it so
if<00:05:37.270> I<00:05:37.389> want<00:05:37.630> to<00:05:37.750> add<00:05:38.320> another<00:05:38.349> modifier<00:05:39.099> I

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
if I want to add another modifier I

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.719 
if I want to add another modifier I
could<00:05:40.860> give<00:05:41.860> it<00:05:41.889> a<00:05:42.099> sub<00:05:42.370> serve<00:05:44.490> something<00:05:45.490> like

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
could give it a sub serve something like

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.270 
could give it a sub serve something like
that<00:05:45.940> and<00:05:46.090> get<00:05:46.300> a<00:05:46.330> very<00:05:46.780> smooth<00:05:47.710> look<00:05:48.009> for<00:05:48.250> a

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
that and get a very smooth look for a

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.839 
that and get a very smooth look for a
wire<00:05:51.000> now<00:05:52.000> you<00:05:52.060> should<00:05:52.419> still<00:05:52.750> be<00:05:52.930> able<00:05:52.960> to<00:05:53.849> now

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
wire now you should still be able to now

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:56.279 
wire now you should still be able to now
see<00:05:55.120> at<00:05:55.210> this<00:05:55.330> point<00:05:55.419> you<00:05:55.690> can't<00:05:55.870> really<00:05:55.930> mess

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
see at this point you can't really mess

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.110 
see at this point you can't really mess
with<00:05:56.319> the<00:05:56.560> scale<00:05:56.860> and<00:05:57.099> more<00:05:57.340> so<00:05:57.610> make<00:05:58.090> sure

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
with the scale and more so make sure

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.149 
with the scale and more so make sure
it's<00:05:58.900> really<00:05:59.199> the<00:05:59.319> way<00:05:59.409> you<00:05:59.440> want<00:05:59.770> it<00:05:59.830> before

it's really the way you want it before
you<00:06:00.340> apply<00:06:00.759> that<00:06:00.849> modifier<00:06:01.449> and<00:06:02.099> and<00:06:03.099> even

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
you apply that modifier and and even

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.850 
you apply that modifier and and even
before<00:06:03.849> you<00:06:04.060> a<00:06:04.210> sub<00:06:04.690> sir<00:06:04.870> if<00:06:04.990> you<00:06:05.259> want<00:06:05.500> to<00:06:05.620> end

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
select the ends here the five vertices

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.129 
select the ends here the five vertices
with<00:06:14.590> this<00:06:14.770> vertex<00:06:15.370> select<00:06:15.759> mode<00:06:15.940> and<00:06:16.180> if<00:06:17.020> you

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:17.139

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.660 
with this vertex select mode and if you
hit<00:06:17.259> alt<00:06:17.469> em<00:06:18.780> oops

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
if you all them in the merge at center

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.880 
if you all them in the merge at center
then<00:06:23.700> you<00:06:23.880> can<00:06:24.030> actually<00:06:24.290> create<00:06:25.290> this<00:06:25.530> point

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:25.890 
then you can actually create this point

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.170 
then you can actually create this point
just<00:06:26.880> depending<00:06:27.150> on<00:06:27.240> what<00:06:27.360> you<00:06:27.480> want<00:06:27.510> to<00:06:27.690> do<00:06:27.840> so

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
let's go back to subserve make sure your

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.630 
let's go back to subserve make sure your
render<00:06:33.660> is<00:06:33.780> also<00:06:34.080> set<00:06:34.350> to<00:06:34.490> however<00:06:35.490> many

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640 
render is also set to however many

subdivisions<00:06:37.310> you're<00:06:38.310> going<00:06:38.460> to<00:06:38.520> use<00:06:38.700> or<00:06:38.940> else

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
it's not going to look the same and then

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.400 
it's not going to look the same and then
you<00:06:41.790> can<00:06:41.910> just<00:06:42.060> edit<00:06:42.210> it<00:06:42.390> from<00:06:42.600> there<00:06:42.780> you<00:06:43.290> know

you can just edit it from there you know

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.310 
you can just edit it from there you know
in<00:06:43.590> the<00:06:43.620> end<00:06:44.180> extend<00:06:45.180> stuff<00:06:45.480> you<00:06:45.990> know<00:06:46.110> if<00:06:46.200> you
