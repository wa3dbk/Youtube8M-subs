00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:06.830
 hello to all so today this is 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.389
 for a new video so on 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.910
 the lighting in the incredible so a 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.580
 essential elements of the aquarium 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.789
 For me anyway 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.740
 so in an aquarium 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.949
 what is good is to have a 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:26.130
 reflector then effector it is this 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.310
 little trick over there that fixed 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.109
 onions finally normally the led is 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.800
 good because the letters is orient 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.219
 directly a premium let's take it like that 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.989
 the advantage or for others certainly 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:43.110
 its focus the light and me by 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.340
 example mine effect plus 150% and 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.140
 laurel finds to be all the light 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:51.539
 on it not live on the hood or 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:54.870
 So that's it, that's it's a 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.960
 saint and mans so the duration 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.370
 so it's 8 to 12 o'clock then 12 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.050
 hours it's great maximum because 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.129
 otherwise there is seaweed going on 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.760
 train and so eight hours for example 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.549
 for example it can be four reignite 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.580
 2h break 80 turn on or so while 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.930
 continuous as an end as you want 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.439
 the location of the aquarium in relation 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.360
 outside so depending on where 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.290
 you put for example in relation to 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.909
 a window the window will create a 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.020
 light when it's open 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.570
 obviously but so the sun will create 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.540
 a light that will be variable in 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.810
 depending on the location and depending 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.350
 bath of what he will get up when he 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.590
 goes to bed 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.320
 that's why sometimes 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:50.970
 finally me for example mine he is 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.909
 slightly beside and no and not finally and 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.100
 light the light and pass on 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.750
 obviously but be careful it's not 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.399
 serious because there is light like 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.460
 that will regulate a little 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:09.050
 think to regulate but so neon vaval 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:13.230
 but at a certain brightness coop 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.840
 some of the advice of m lacroix y 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.720
 are in front of a window 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.970
 me personally as the incredible 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:26.210
 it is slightly next to the window 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:32.520
 what is that here it is and the cua 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:34.620
 fuchsia that's going montcoal month the ca did 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:39.120
 still not a problem to imitate 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.590
 here I have no point this issue if you 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.410
 have other questions map put the 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.950
 month in the commentary to the next 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.950
 times our video
