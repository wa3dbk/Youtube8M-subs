cut<00:01:39.280> their<00:01:39.430> teeth<00:01:39.579> on<00:01:39.759> each<00:01:39.880> other<00:01:40.090> they

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
cut their teeth on each other they

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.580 
cut their teeth on each other they
compare<00:01:40.600> themselves<00:01:40.780> to<00:01:41.020> each<00:01:41.110> other<00:01:41.380> and

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
compare themselves to each other and

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.590 
compare themselves to each other and
then<00:01:41.710> they<00:01:42.250> all<00:01:42.369> went<00:01:42.399> out<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:42.909> improve

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
then they all went out and improve

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.480 
then they all went out and improve
themselves<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:44.170> a<00:01:44.200> degree<00:01:44.350> in<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.590> summer<00:01:44.920> so

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
themselves to a degree in the summer so

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.520 
themselves to a degree in the summer so
I<00:01:45.520> just<00:01:45.789> I'm<00:01:46.090> biased<00:01:46.420> towards<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.200> Premier

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
I just I'm biased towards the Premier

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.679 
I just I'm biased towards the Premier
League<00:01:47.680> and<00:01:47.799> I<00:01:47.860> think<00:01:48.100> at<00:01:48.549> home<00:01:48.909> against

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
League and I think at home against

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.359 
League and I think at home against
Juventus<00:01:50.229> they're<00:01:50.619> going<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:50.799> have<00:01:51.159> their

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
Juventus they're going to have their

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.770 
Juventus they're going to have their
best<00:01:51.520> foot<00:01:51.759> forward<00:01:52.000> it's<00:01:52.270> going<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.659> be<00:01:52.750> a

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
best foot forward it's going to be a

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.870 
best foot forward it's going to be a
boring<00:01:53.079> and<00:01:53.350> low-scoring<00:01:53.649> game<00:01:53.979> though<00:01:54.159> mhm

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
boring and low-scoring game though mhm

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.350 
boring and low-scoring game though mhm
okay<00:01:55.299> well<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:57.130> save<00:01:57.700> you<00:01:57.850> haven't<00:01:58.180> backed

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
okay well and save you haven't backed

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.609 
okay well and save you haven't backed

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
think that will be sort of like a

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.090 
think that will be sort of like a
telling<00:02:04.479> sign<00:02:04.689> of<00:02:04.810> who<00:02:04.990> we<00:02:05.200> may<00:02:05.350> say<00:02:05.560> win<00:02:05.979> this

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
telling sign of who we may say win this

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
side down they basically will almost

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.580 
side down they basically will almost
in<00:02:16.910> my<00:02:17.270> opinion<00:02:17.690> have<00:02:17.840> won<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.260> group<00:02:18.410> by

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
in my opinion have won the group by

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.260 
in my opinion have won the group by
winning<00:02:18.920> in<00:02:19.010> Madrid<00:02:19.370> but<00:02:19.790> that's<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.090> tough

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
winning in Madrid but that's a tough

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.700 
winning in Madrid but that's a tough
place<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.690> win<00:02:20.840> I<00:02:21.020> mean<00:02:21.170> they're<00:02:21.350> going<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.590> go

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
place to win I mean they're going to go

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.140 
place to win I mean they're going to go
in<00:02:21.890> there<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.130> be<00:02:22.280> somewhat<00:02:22.700> safe<00:02:22.940> and

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
in there and be somewhat safe and

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.900 
in there and be somewhat safe and
cautious<00:02:23.590> draw<00:02:24.590> would<00:02:24.800> suit<00:02:25.100> them<00:02:25.310> just<00:02:25.640> fine

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
cautious draw would suit them just fine

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.690 
cautious draw would suit them just fine
if<00:02:26.600> you<00:02:27.020> ventus<00:02:27.500> wins<00:02:27.770> to<00:02:28.400> answer<00:02:28.610> your

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
if you ventus wins to answer your

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.850 
if you ventus wins to answer your
question<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.480> had<00:02:29.660> two<00:02:29.780> straws<00:02:30.080> in<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.380> let<00:02:30.770> it

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
question you had two straws in a let it

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.040 
question you had two straws in a let it
go<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.160> think<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:32.180> group<00:02:32.750> is<00:02:32.900> almost

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
go I think the the group is almost

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.170 
go I think the the group is almost
theirs<00:02:33.440> if<00:02:33.950> they<00:02:34.190> end<00:02:34.370> up<00:02:34.520> not<00:02:34.580> winning<00:02:35.060> the

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
theirs if they end up not winning the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.000 
theirs if they end up not winning the
group<00:02:35.300> but<00:02:35.660> then<00:02:35.810> again<00:02:35.900> winning<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.830> group

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
group but then again winning the group

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.620 
group but then again winning the group
is<00:02:37.160> one<00:02:37.340> thing<00:02:37.580> and<00:02:37.790> but<00:02:37.940> but<00:02:38.120> all<00:02:38.240> you<00:02:38.360> want<00:02:38.540> to

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
is one thing and but but all you want to

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.450 
is one thing and but but all you want to
do<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:39.020> get<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.380> knockout<00:02:39.800> stage<00:02:40.100> just

do is get to the knockout stage just
getting<00:02:40.730> through<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.240> big<00:02:41.420> thing<00:02:41.630> so<00:02:41.740> so

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
getting through is the big thing so so

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.380 
getting through is the big thing so so
but<00:02:42.980> mathematically<00:02:43.700> from<00:02:43.880> this<00:02:44.090> point

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
but mathematically from this point

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.440 
but mathematically from this point
looking<00:02:45.380> up<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:46.130> ventus's<00:02:46.610> is<00:02:46.880> in<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.270> good

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
situation but i still lean towards

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.420 
situation but i still lean towards
Atletico<00:02:51.110> finding<00:02:51.590> a<00:02:51.650> way<00:02:51.800> to<00:02:51.860> win<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.250> group

surprised that they are they are as high
as<00:03:05.570> that<00:03:05.810> do<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.740> think<00:03:06.830> that's<00:03:06.980> based<00:03:07.220> on

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
as that do you think that's based on

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.150 
as that do you think that's based on
their<00:03:07.580> first<00:03:07.790> round<00:03:08.000> matches<00:03:08.800> yeah<00:03:09.800> most

their first round matches yeah most

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.590 
their first round matches yeah most

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600

in Las Vegas I would look for two and a

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.380 
in Las Vegas I would look for two and a

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
half seek it out and I would avoid the

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.780 
half seek it out and I would avoid the
two<00:05:05.630> it<00:05:06.050> could<00:05:06.260> push<00:05:06.500> it<00:05:06.530> do<00:05:06.860> but<00:05:07.250> why<00:05:07.400> do<00:05:07.460> you

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 
two it could push it do but why do you

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.610 
two it could push it do but why do you
want<00:05:07.970> to<00:05:08.000> push<00:05:08.210> when<00:05:08.390> you<00:05:08.510> could<00:05:08.630> possibly<00:05:09.050> pay

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
want to push when you could possibly pay

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.140 
want to push when you could possibly pay
a<00:05:09.650> little<00:05:09.860> more<00:05:10.040> premium<00:05:10.520> and<00:05:10.640> get<00:05:10.730> a<00:05:10.760> win<00:05:11.000> at

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
a little more premium and get a win at

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.880 
a little more premium and get a win at
two<00:05:11.270> and<00:05:11.450> a<00:05:11.480> half<00:05:11.660> yeah<00:05:12.200> exactly

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
two and a half yeah exactly

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.290 
two and a half yeah exactly
so<00:05:13.130> then<00:05:13.280> would<00:05:13.400> you<00:05:13.490> also<00:05:13.670> go<00:05:13.910> for<00:05:14.060> the<00:05:14.150> both

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
so then would you also go for the both

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.210 
so then would you also go for the both
teams<00:05:14.570> to<00:05:14.780> score<00:05:14.810> no<00:05:15.470> bet<00:05:15.710> I<00:05:15.740> don't<00:05:15.920> have<00:05:16.100> the

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
teams to score no bet I don't have the

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.210 
teams to score no bet I don't have the
odds<00:05:16.340> to<00:05:16.490> hand<00:05:16.700> but<00:05:16.880> I<00:05:16.910> think<00:05:17.120> it's<00:05:17.210> around<00:05:17.300> 1.8

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
odds to hand but I think it's around 1.8

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.860 
odds to hand but I think it's around 1.8
most<00:05:19.220> definitely<00:05:19.760> that<00:05:20.090> this<00:05:20.300> is<00:05:20.450> the<00:05:20.600> perfect

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
most definitely that this is the perfect

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.810 
most definitely that this is the perfect
game<00:05:21.230> for<00:05:21.260> that<00:05:21.590> type<00:05:21.770> of<00:05:21.800> situation<00:05:22.100> we<00:05:22.640> could

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
game for that type of situation we could

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.820 
game for that type of situation we could
be<00:05:22.910> looking<00:05:23.090> at<00:05:23.420> a<00:05:23.450> Medeco<00:05:24.290> wouldn't<00:05:24.560> like<00:05:24.680> the

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
be looking at a Medeco wouldn't like the

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.370 
be looking at a Medeco wouldn't like the
reality<00:05:25.100> of<00:05:25.280> a<00:05:25.430> 0-0<00:05:25.940> score<00:05:26.270> but<00:05:26.990> there's<00:05:27.170> going

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
reality of a 0-0 score but there's going

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.800 
reality of a 0-0 score but there's going
to<00:05:27.440> be<00:05:27.500> I'm<00:05:28.370> guessing<00:05:29.360> there's<00:05:29.540> going<00:05:29.690> to<00:05:29.750> be

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
to be I'm guessing there's going to be

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.320 
to be I'm guessing there's going to be
less<00:05:30.560> than<00:05:30.800> eight<00:05:31.010> quality<00:05:31.640> shots<00:05:31.970> on-target

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
less than eight quality shots on-target

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.020 
less than eight quality shots on-target
for<00:05:33.110> both<00:05:33.230> teams<00:05:33.500> combined<00:05:34.010> this<00:05:34.610> is<00:05:34.669> going<00:05:34.970> to

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
for both teams combined this is going to

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.150 
for both teams combined this is going to
be<00:05:35.210> if<00:05:35.720> you<00:05:35.840> watched<00:05:36.050> manchester<00:05:36.740> city<00:05:36.980> and
