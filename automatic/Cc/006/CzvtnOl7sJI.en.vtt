00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.330
 within technopolis one of the most surprising projects is this 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.399
 train the one that has some special features heart 

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:09.929
 really hourly 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.129
 this is a credit and 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.600
 which is ecological that up 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.150
 if not less fuel than any other 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.300
 that transports well in 2 50 people 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.630
 and this is a little different from the one we came from 2003 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.369
 looking for 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.449
 swimmers all Argentine inventions because this is not 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.260
 They will make better quality of life and fuel savings 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.179
 are one of the many concerns not this believe 

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:42.650
 min faithful to herself the president disposed 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.350
 which will work in this sample 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.480
 it is part of science and technology at the service of the everyday things of 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.559
 idc to bring people to start 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.460
 in this case within a theme park 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.700
 verón also works in other provinces 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.429
 it's a train that one can not 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:04.180
 strangely adapt to reality because made in some places 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.210
 percent would for example connect villages through this means the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.100
 remains of transfusion troglio colón 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.130
 the car works against sold goods to 4 delivery 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.750
 there one in santa fe 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.280
 the area of ​​arrival of the other 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.280
 and it's a low-floor light engine car 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.770
 with a 1-point engine toxic was taken very low consumption very low maintenance 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.730
 and today it was done for that parla knew that it was bad state where the town 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.240
 well your car life 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.970
 what are the baby characteristics 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.380
 day that you should train percent this type of the car is because there trains 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.300
 with another type of structure that they surely need, for example, 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.330
 bear more weight not - of all 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.830
 next autumn-winter 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.700
 are alerted for medium gauge narrow gauge narrow gauge 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.800
 and they are good 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.850
 as he said bobbies running between rivers 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.110
 and in holy faith and added we are not here adapting to technopolis to 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.859
 living place 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:16.209
 it is necessary that there is a way exists before you can think of a new trace 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.819
 no no I think I owe a lot to take over the front of the country 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.789
 it is in disuse and 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:27.789
 the fernando had been me I have problem because 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.709
 it has no weight 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.889
 so that it lacks a sleeper andévalo 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.469
 it's not like another conventional train that weighs 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.029
 one ton that does not allow it 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:42.079
 what was the role of adif per hundred to be able to sustain or to be able to 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.200
 present this train in this sample and 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.160
 i also thinking about the use in the day of life 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.439
 everyday 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.479
 good the 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:54.169
 as it is inaugural is the first thing you see 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:58.920
 percent of course we analyze it our specialists 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:03.489
 Our professionals were permanently doing the tests 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.689
 that they should be seen 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:07.260
 i percent 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.909
 until the transport headquarters authorized jarque this 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.989
 terence 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.900
 produced the Argentine fact that this is one of the things that we as 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.089
 government we promote the theme of 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:21.789
 grazie 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:24.139
 argentina creations 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:28.389
 With Argentine material, the added value of labor is 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.089
 fundamental 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:31.379
 i percent 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.170
 if we add that we look for 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.109
 elements that bring us closer to the future 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.760
 with the reality that we have well said the designers 

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:42.749
 percent 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:47.180
 it has been possible to use places where other trains will tehran because they do not 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:48.569
 can use 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.289
 science we conceive technology we conceive it 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:57.919
 always with character ad the daily thing that is when 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.520
 according to the magistrate surely Brazil in addition to the project and express 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.710
 deputy to the province buenos aires mandate fulfilled percent could 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.680
 change the lives of many peoples that have been isolated after 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.700
 of the closures of many roads and many branches 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.840
 percent the 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.930
 will again have a hundred connections through the railroads 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.680
 for that is fundamental north 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.939
 the 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:27.569
 the history 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:31.569
 recent shows us that there have been towns 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:36.899
 realized where their microeconomy was affected and without 

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:38.419
 nothing 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:44.270
 unite those people back would act again later that the economy the micro 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.650
 conomy is mobilized without prejudice to 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.840
 p also analyze how much much cheaper much more 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.099
 ask much cheaper 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:05:00.290
 it's a challenge per hundred and the challenges from 2003 to now 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.499
 They have been our strength 

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:07.150
 percent everything indicates that the civil servants well 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.780
 this year so many others that we are doing well we are tracking 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.059
 because there are a lot of odds 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:18.490
 that show eae that are appearing to be able 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.940
 shorten distances the idea is that it returns drop of the towns by the ball 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.210
 leave again the community is again connected 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.940
 and that was the most perverse thing, not only from the economic point of view, 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.350
 even from the social, the cultural, the family that did not see their 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:42.060
 relatives only at the moment they had to go to bury them that was 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.229
 terrible so that's why we bet the train
