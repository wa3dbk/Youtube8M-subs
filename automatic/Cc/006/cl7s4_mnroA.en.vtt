00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
um I don't know I kind of thought that

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.910 
um I don't know I kind of thought that
based<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.140> his<00:01:13.320> team<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.650> didn't<00:01:13.799> have<00:01:13.890> a

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
based on his team you didn't have a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.230 
based on his team you didn't have a
whole<00:01:14.159> lot<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.430> could<00:01:14.640> set<00:01:14.820> up<00:01:14.939> other<00:01:15.060> than

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
whole lot that could set up other than

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.940 
whole lot that could set up other than
maybe<00:01:15.479> sword<00:01:15.810> stance<00:01:16.020> sauce<00:01:16.259> book<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:16.680> I<00:01:16.710> kind

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
maybe sword stance sauce book so I kind

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.560 
maybe sword stance sauce book so I kind
of<00:01:16.979> thought<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.189> would<00:01:17.280> be<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.369> bulk<00:01:17.640> upset<00:01:18.030> but

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
of thought it would be a bulk upset but

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.910 
of thought it would be a bulk upset but
the<00:01:18.659> fact<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.900> he<00:01:18.990> led<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> fit<00:01:19.560> should<00:01:19.830> have

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
the fact that he led the fit should have

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.100 
the fact that he led the fit should have
revealed<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.820> me<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.390> could<00:01:21.869> quite

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
revealed to me that it could quite

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.990 
revealed to me that it could quite
possibly<00:01:22.140> be<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.650> trickster<00:01:22.920> but<00:01:23.820> after

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
possibly be a trickster but after

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.969 
possibly be a trickster but after
tricking<00:01:24.450> him<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.900> know<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.680> live

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
tricking him I know that I can live

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.499 
tricking him I know that I can live
another<00:01:26.130> hit<00:01:26.460> thanks<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> fact<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.330> he

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
another hit thanks to the fact that he

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.510 
another hit thanks to the fact that he
has<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.840> scarf<00:01:28.170> not<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.380> band<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.159> hit<00:01:29.340> him<00:01:29.400> with

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
has a scarf not a band so I hit him with

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.859 
has a scarf not a band so I hit him with
an<00:01:29.610> overheat<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.150> then<00:01:30.299> switched<00:01:30.570> out<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.810> my

Zapdos now knowing that my substitute

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.179 
Zapdos now knowing that my substitute
would<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.640> able<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.939> survive<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.270> hit<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:36.780> a

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
from a psycho cut if he decided to stay

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.420 
from a psycho cut if he decided to stay

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
in and fought her out I do just go for

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.649 
in and fought her out I do just go for
the<00:01:41.490> substitute<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.240> way<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.360> can<00:01:42.540> get<00:01:42.600> a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
the substitute so that way I can get a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.149 
the substitute so that way I can get a
free<00:01:42.810> sub<00:01:43.049> but<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.380> actually<00:01:43.500> option<00:01:43.890> up<00:01:44.070> to

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
free sub but you actually option up to

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.450 
free sub but you actually option up to
nidoking<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.390> maybe<00:01:45.840> he's<00:01:46.079> checking<00:01:46.619> if<00:01:47.310> I

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
nidoking so maybe he's checking if I

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.160 
nidoking so maybe he's checking if I
carry<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.909> hidden<00:01:48.119> power<00:01:48.270> ice<00:01:48.570> maybe<00:01:48.990> he

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
carry the hidden power ice maybe he

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.600 
carry the hidden power ice maybe he
wants<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.470> make<00:01:49.590> sure<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.979> he<00:01:50.100> doesn't<00:01:50.340> get<00:01:50.549> a

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
you know take a super effective hidden

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.770 
you know take a super effective hidden
power<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.490> face<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.030> he<00:01:54.149> may<00:01:54.390> be<00:01:54.450> there<00:01:54.689> was

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
power to the face so he may be there was

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.260

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
a pivotal switch here into his what I

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.789 
a pivotal switch here into his what I
would<00:01:57.509> guess<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:57.990> especially<00:01:58.409> defensive

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
would guess is especially defensive

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
running one on this team myself so he

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.499 
running one on this team myself so he
just<00:02:05.100> goes<00:02:05.250> for<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.490> Roar<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.820> phase<00:02:06.000> me<00:02:06.210> up<00:02:06.329> he

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
just goes for the Roar to phase me up he

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.910 
just goes for the Roar to phase me up he
doesn't<00:02:06.750> want<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.930> deal<00:02:07.140> with<00:02:07.170> my<00:02:07.320> substitute

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
doesn't want to deal with my substitute

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.490 
doesn't want to deal with my substitute
which<00:02:08.069> makes<00:02:08.280> sense<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:09.140> he<00:02:10.140> doesn't<00:02:10.319> really

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
which makes sense and he doesn't really

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.440 
which makes sense and he doesn't really
know<00:02:10.739> what<00:02:10.770> moves<00:02:11.190> my<00:02:11.310> zapdos<00:02:11.670> packs<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.330> he

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
know what moves my zapdos packs so he

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.250 
know what moves my zapdos packs so he
doesn't<00:02:12.599> know<00:02:12.810> if

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260

would<00:02:39.239> be<00:02:39.359> a<00:02:39.390> special<00:02:39.930> attacker<00:02:40.230> but<00:02:41.010> with<00:02:41.220> the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
would be a special attacker but with the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.039 
would be a special attacker but with the
immense<00:02:41.730> power<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.209> V<00:02:42.329> create<00:02:42.629> I<00:02:42.750> guess<00:02:42.900> that

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
immense power of V create I guess that

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.240 
immense power of V create I guess that
was<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.170> little<00:02:43.379> foolish<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.799> me<00:02:43.829> to<00:02:43.950> think<00:02:44.069> that

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
was a little foolish of me to think that

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.800 
was a little foolish of me to think that
he<00:02:44.430> would<00:02:44.579> not<00:02:44.790> run<00:02:44.939> the<00:02:45.000> physical<00:02:45.420> variant

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
he would not run the physical variant

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.809 
he would not run the physical variant
but<00:02:46.349> either<00:02:46.530> way<00:02:46.769> gonna<00:02:47.010> go<00:02:47.099> to<00:02:47.220> my<00:02:47.370> physically

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
but either way gonna go to my physically

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.699 
but either way gonna go to my physically

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.670 
should easily be able to take two hits

but unfortunately for me he is going to

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.649 
but unfortunately for me he is going to
nab<00:02:52.829> himself<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.280> critical<00:02:53.670> hit<00:02:53.790> here<00:02:54.090> with<00:02:54.510> in

easily make V create able to finish me
off<00:02:59.099> here<00:02:59.430> so<00:02:59.970> that's<00:03:00.209> gonna<00:03:00.359> be<00:03:00.930> pretty

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
off here so that's gonna be pretty

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.530 
off here so that's gonna be pretty
problematic<00:03:01.950> for<00:03:02.459> me<00:03:02.519> because<00:03:02.909> I<00:03:03.090> just<00:03:03.299> went

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
problematic for me because I just went

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.580 
problematic for me because I just went
from<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.840> situation<00:03:04.019> that<00:03:04.319> was<00:03:04.440> very

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
from a situation that was very

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.009 
from a situation that was very
manageable<00:03:05.099> to<00:03:05.700> being<00:03:06.209> on<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:06.450> ropes<00:03:06.659> in<00:03:06.900> this

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
manageable to being on the ropes in this

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.680 
manageable to being on the ropes in this
battle<00:03:07.379> thanks<00:03:07.799> to<00:03:08.010> not<00:03:08.819> just<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.150> crit<00:03:09.420> but

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
battle thanks to not just the crit but

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.149 
battle thanks to not just the crit but
also<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:10.019> very<00:03:10.230> nice<00:03:10.440> prediction<00:03:10.680> from<00:03:10.950> him

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
also a very nice prediction from him

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.220 
also a very nice prediction from him
onto<00:03:11.430> my<00:03:11.459> switching<00:03:11.819> to<00:03:11.909> a<00:03:11.940> Napoleon<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:12.629> me

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
onto my switching to a Napoleon and me

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.720 
onto my switching to a Napoleon and me
playing<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.590> little<00:03:13.680> too<00:03:13.950> safe<00:03:14.159> by<00:03:14.370> going<00:03:14.579> for

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
playing a little too safe by going for

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.099 
playing a little too safe by going for
the<00:03:14.790> close<00:03:14.970> combat<00:03:15.209> undid<00:03:15.569> it<00:03:15.629> onto<00:03:16.019> these

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
the close combat undid it onto these

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.619 
the close combat undid it onto these
Victini<00:03:16.500> so<00:03:17.280> now<00:03:17.669> is<00:03:17.849> not<00:03:18.030> much<00:03:18.239> else<00:03:18.389> to<00:03:18.480> take

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
Victini so now is not much else to take

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:19.819 
Victini so now is not much else to take
care<00:03:18.690> of<00:03:18.870> this<00:03:18.989> Victini<00:03:19.349> I<00:03:19.440> am<00:03:19.620> just<00:03:19.769> gonna

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
care of this Victini I am just gonna

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.259 
care of this Victini I am just gonna
have<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.129> go<00:03:20.310> for<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.489> sucker<00:03:20.760> punch<00:03:20.819> with<00:03:21.150> my

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
have to go for the sucker punch with my

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.479 
have to go for the sucker punch with my
hitmontop<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.379> hope<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.859> he<00:03:23.010> doesn't<00:03:23.190> think

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
hitmontop and hope that he doesn't think

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.309 
hitmontop and hope that he doesn't think
about<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.879> option<00:03:24.389> maybe<00:03:24.900> he<00:03:25.109> didn't<00:03:25.290> think

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
about that option maybe he didn't think

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.960 
about that option maybe he didn't think
sucker<00:03:25.650> punch<00:03:25.919> would<00:03:26.069> kill<00:03:26.250> maybe<00:03:26.549> since<00:03:26.819> it's

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
sucker punch would kill maybe since it's

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.270 
sucker punch would kill maybe since it's
not<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.449> common<00:03:27.750> on<00:03:28.079> hitmontop<00:03:28.379> he<00:03:29.069> didn't

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
not that common on hitmontop he didn't

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.670 
not that common on hitmontop he didn't
expect<00:03:29.519> it<00:03:29.790> either<00:03:30.569> way<00:03:31.079> he<00:03:31.260> brings<00:03:31.440> in<00:03:31.560> his

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
expect it either way he brings in his

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.229 
expect it either way he brings in his
Gallade<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.280> then<00:03:32.370> double<00:03:32.639> switches<00:03:32.910> his<00:03:33.030> apt

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
Gallade and then double switches his apt

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.050 
Gallade and then double switches his apt
those<00:03:33.449> I'm<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:34.620> wasn't<00:03:35.190> sure<00:03:35.430> if<00:03:35.609> sucker<00:03:35.790> punch

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
those I'm I wasn't sure if sucker punch

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.479 
those I'm I wasn't sure if sucker punch
would<00:03:36.209> kill<00:03:36.449> sadly<00:03:37.079> enough<00:03:37.199> so<00:03:37.889> I<00:03:38.220> switched

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
would kill sadly enough so I switched

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.280 
would kill sadly enough so I switched
into<00:03:38.760> my<00:03:39.060> Rotom<00:03:39.359> h-has<00:03:39.690> fodder<00:03:39.989> but

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.750 
into my Rotom h-has fodder but
thankfully<00:03:40.739> since<00:03:40.980> he<00:03:41.160> did<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.370> double<00:03:41.639> switch

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
thankfully since he did a double switch

thankfully since he did a double switch
of<00:03:41.910> his<00:03:42.030> own<00:03:42.209> I<00:03:42.419> am<00:03:42.629> gonna<00:03:42.780> be<00:03:42.930> able<00:03:43.049> to

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
outspeed him and go for a trick which

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.210 
outspeed him and go for a trick which
will<00:03:45.780> limit<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.199> options<00:03:46.379> that<00:03:46.620> his<00:03:46.799> zapdos

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
will limit the options that his zapdos

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.960 
will limit the options that his zapdos
has<00:03:47.510> because<00:03:48.510> he<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:48.870> now<00:03:49.519> banded<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.790> band

do<00:05:38.580> anything<00:05:38.849> to<00:05:39.180> me<00:05:39.330> so<00:05:39.449> I<00:05:39.570> don't<00:05:39.900> know<00:05:39.990> if

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
do anything to me so I don't know if

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:41.899 
do anything to me so I don't know if
that<00:05:40.320> was<00:05:40.409> actually<00:05:40.680> part<00:05:40.830> of<00:05:40.919> his<00:05:41.039> plan<00:05:41.220> or<00:05:41.669> if

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
that was actually part of his plan or if

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.000 
that was actually part of his plan or if
you<00:05:42.000> just<00:05:42.030> wanted<00:05:42.330> rocks<00:05:42.599> up<00:05:42.870> but<00:05:43.470> considering

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
you just wanted rocks up but considering

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.260 
you just wanted rocks up but considering
that<00:05:44.039> I<00:05:44.190> don't<00:05:44.460> really<00:05:44.550> have<00:05:44.669> anything<00:05:44.970> else

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
that I don't really have anything else

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
left on my team vulnerable the rocks

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.580 
left on my team vulnerable the rocks
since<00:05:47.610> you<00:05:47.729> took<00:05:47.849> out<00:05:48.000> my<00:05:48.150> rota<00:05:48.360> mage<00:05:48.599> I'm<00:05:48.870> not

so sure that was the greatest of plans
he<00:05:51.180> probably<00:05:51.389> should<00:05:51.599> have<00:05:51.659> just<00:05:51.720> tried<00:05:51.930> to

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
he probably should have just tried to

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.390 
he probably should have just tried to
keep<00:05:52.199> the<00:05:52.380> pressure<00:05:52.590> up<00:05:52.710> with<00:05:53.010> his<00:05:53.130> middle
