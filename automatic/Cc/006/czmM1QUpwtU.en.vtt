00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
the one thing i don't like about megaman

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.500 
the one thing i don't like about megaman
a<00:03:25.389> is<00:03:25.690> your<00:03:26.200> life<00:03:26.410> charges<00:03:26.980> do<00:03:27.129> not<00:03:27.510> recharge

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
a is your life charges do not recharge

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.659 
a is your life charges do not recharge
after<00:03:28.900> each<00:03:29.410> level<00:03:29.799> unless<00:03:30.280> you<00:03:30.519> have<00:03:30.639> a

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
after each level unless you have a

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.580 
after each level unless you have a
certain<00:03:30.910> power<00:03:31.120> up<00:03:31.419> but<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.169> power-ups

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
certain power up but the power-ups

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.119 
certain power up but the power-ups
relatively<00:03:33.160> useless<00:03:33.310> in<00:03:33.700> my<00:03:33.819> opinion<00:03:35.129> the

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
relatively useless in my opinion the

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.470 
relatively useless in my opinion the
thing<00:03:36.549> is<00:03:36.579> though<00:03:36.760> when<00:03:36.970> you<00:03:37.120> get<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.269> game<00:03:37.450> over

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
thing is though when you get a game over

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.810 
thing is though when you get a game over
in<00:03:37.840> megaman<00:03:38.199> 8<00:03:38.410> it'll<00:03:39.070> start<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.430> back<00:03:39.579> at<00:03:39.729> the

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:58.550 
last half way point kind of hard to

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:00.760 
last half way point kind of hard to
explain<00:03:58.670> but<00:03:59.150> I'll<00:03:59.570> go<00:04:00.050> over<00:04:00.080> it<00:04:00.380> when<00:04:00.500> I<00:04:00.530> can
