they're<00:01:58.409> pretty<00:01:58.619> elusive<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:59.250> wouldn't

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
they're pretty elusive I wouldn't

is<00:02:16.570> it<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:16.780> an<00:02:16.930> alpha<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:17.470> everything

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
is it is an alpha so everything

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.760 
is it is an alpha so everything
apparently<00:02:18.070> is<00:02:18.340> made<00:02:18.490> of<00:02:18.580> chicken<00:02:18.820> and<00:02:19.770> you

to make gunpowder and then you can use

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.570 
to make gunpowder and then you can use
the<00:03:04.270> metal<00:03:04.709> fragments<00:03:05.709> that<00:03:05.800> you've<00:03:05.950> got<00:03:06.160> to

then make that into a pistol and then

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.699 
then make that into a pistol and then
you<00:03:10.239> use<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.570> leftover<00:03:10.900> metal<00:03:11.230> fragments

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
you use the leftover metal fragments

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.250 
you use the leftover metal fragments
with<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.330> with<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.480> gun<00:03:13.720> powder<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:14.230> make

with the with the gun powder to make
nine<00:03:14.560> millimeter<00:03:15.010> ammunition<00:03:15.640> and<00:03:16.120> then<00:03:16.660> you

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
nine millimeter ammunition and then you

harvesting something and just take it
off<00:04:01.420> of<00:04:01.450> him<00:04:01.690> which<00:04:02.019> would<00:04:02.260> make<00:04:02.410> sense

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
off of him which would make sense

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.729

because<00:04:02.769> I've<00:04:03.130> done<00:04:03.160> it<00:04:03.340> before<00:04:04.140> yeah<00:04:05.140> the

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
because I've done it before yeah the

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.220 
because I've done it before yeah the
game<00:04:05.920> overall<00:04:06.250> after<00:04:07.180> you<00:04:07.269> acquire<00:04:07.570> would<00:04:07.930> I

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
game overall after you acquire would I

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.630 
game overall after you acquire would I
I'm<00:04:08.590> think<00:04:08.890> I'm<00:04:09.010> going<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.190> have<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.370> do<00:04:09.610> a

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
I'm think I'm going to have to do a

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.550 
I'm think I'm going to have to do a
building<00:04:10.090> tutorial<00:04:10.209> outside<00:04:10.930> this<00:04:11.170> because<00:04:11.530> I

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
building tutorial outside this because I

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.170 
building tutorial outside this because I
really<00:04:11.860> can't<00:04:12.070> fit<00:04:12.250> that<00:04:12.370> into<00:04:12.549> into<00:04:13.120> a

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
really can't fit that into into a

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.310 
really can't fit that into into a
tutorial<00:04:13.650> without<00:04:14.650> showing<00:04:15.070> you<00:04:16.229> but<00:04:17.229> the

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
tutorial without showing you but the

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.319 
tutorial without showing you but the
game<00:04:17.500> overall<00:04:17.829> my<00:04:18.220> review<00:04:18.700> I<00:04:18.729> think<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.150> game
