toughest challenges programming drums so

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.530

what<00:00:29.259> I<00:00:29.320> say<00:00:29.500> to<00:00:29.560> that<00:00:29.650> is<00:00:29.830> a<00:00:30.300> coming<00:00:31.300> from

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
what I say to that is a coming from

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.170

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
that as a child you know a lot of the

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.020 
that as a child you know a lot of the
artists<00:00:37.750> that<00:00:38.440> I<00:00:38.770> look<00:00:39.070> up<00:00:39.220> to<00:00:39.430> and<00:00:39.550> many<00:00:39.760> of<00:00:39.880> us

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
artists that I look up to and many of us

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.690 
artists that I look up to and many of us
look<00:00:40.270> up<00:00:40.420> to<00:00:40.660> learn<00:00:41.110> from<00:00:41.350> other<00:00:41.530> people<00:00:41.700> they

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
look up to learn from other people they

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.180 
look up to learn from other people they
use<00:00:42.910> drum<00:00:43.210> brakes<00:00:43.510> from<00:00:44.440> funk<00:00:44.860> and<00:00:45.040> soul

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
use drum brakes from funk and soul

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.580 
use drum brakes from funk and soul
records<00:00:45.700> and<00:00:45.969> they<00:00:46.570> use<00:00:46.750> drum<00:00:47.110> breaks<00:00:47.320> from

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
records and they use drum breaks from

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.530 
records and they use drum breaks from
all<00:00:47.770> sorts<00:00:48.070> of<00:00:48.160> things<00:00:48.370> and<00:00:48.700> learned<00:00:49.420> from

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
all sorts of things and learned from

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.660 
all sorts of things and learned from
that<00:00:49.870> so<00:00:50.260> you<00:00:50.680> know<00:00:50.770> they<00:00:51.040> just<00:00:51.070> took<00:00:51.460> those

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
that so you know they just took those

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.540 
that so you know they just took those
elements<00:00:52.180> and<00:00:52.540> a<00:00:52.960> lot<00:00:53.500> of<00:00:53.530> times<00:00:53.830> copied<00:00:54.370> them

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
elements and a lot of times copied them

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.480 
elements and a lot of times copied them
and<00:00:54.790> then<00:00:55.360> over<00:00:55.930> time<00:00:56.170> they<00:00:57.010> learned<00:00:57.250> how<00:00:57.460> to

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490 
and then over time they learned how to

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.280 
and then over time they learned how to
develop<00:00:57.730> a<00:00:58.090> style<00:00:58.390> of<00:00:58.570> programming<00:00:58.810> that

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
develop a style of programming that

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.590 
develop a style of programming that
worked<00:00:59.680> for<00:00:59.890> them<00:01:00.040> and<00:01:00.370> I<00:01:01.120> think<00:01:01.150> that's<00:01:01.450> a

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
worked for them and I think that's a

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.740 
worked for them and I think that's a
good<00:01:01.720> way<00:01:01.780> to<00:01:02.130> model<00:01:03.130> your<00:01:03.509> development<00:01:04.509> as<00:01:04.689> a

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
good way to model your development as a

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.160 
good way to model your development as a
as<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.650> drum<00:01:06.220> programmer<00:01:06.670> so<00:01:07.479> I'm<00:01:07.810> gonna<00:01:07.900> show

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
as a drum programmer so I'm gonna show

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.910 
as a drum programmer so I'm gonna show
today<00:01:08.740> one<00:01:09.640> book<00:01:09.850> that<00:01:09.880> is<00:01:10.450> really<00:01:11.409> nice<00:01:11.590> it

on<00:02:21.939> the<00:02:22.120> shining<00:02:22.510> so<00:02:23.409> I've<00:02:23.499> grabbed<00:02:23.739> a<00:02:23.799> couple

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
on the shining so I've grabbed a couple

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.409 
on the shining so I've grabbed a couple
of<00:02:24.129> drum<00:02:24.340> samples<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.849> I<00:02:24.909> think<00:02:25.120> will<00:02:25.269> work

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:25.419 
of drum samples that I think will work

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:27.160 
of drum samples that I think will work
well<00:02:25.719> with<00:02:25.749> this<00:02:26.079> break

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
well with this break

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.280 
well with this break
we're<00:02:27.470> gonna<00:02:27.560> program<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.160> hi-hats<00:02:28.459> first

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
we're gonna program the hi-hats first

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.610 
we're gonna program the hi-hats first
and<00:02:30.290> if<00:02:30.650> you<00:02:30.800> look<00:02:31.069> at<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.120> sheet<00:02:32.380> you'll<00:02:33.380> see

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
and if you look at the sheet you'll see

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.210 
and if you look at the sheet you'll see
the<00:02:34.010> top<00:02:34.250> line<00:02:35.230> is<00:02:36.230> where<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.620> high<00:02:36.739> hats<00:02:36.980> are

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
the top line is where the high hats are

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.000 
the top line is where the high hats are
and<00:02:38.739> since<00:02:39.739> the<00:02:40.580> smaller<00:02:40.910> subdivision<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:42.080> a

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
and since the smaller subdivision is a

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.640 
and since the smaller subdivision is a
sixteenth<00:02:43.610> note<00:02:43.989> we're<00:02:44.989> gonna<00:02:45.050> keep<00:02:45.350> it<00:02:45.530> in

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
sixteenth note we're gonna keep it in

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.160 
sixteenth note we're gonna keep it in
the<00:02:45.770> sixteenth<00:02:46.250> note<00:02:46.459> grid<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:47.750> first<00:02:47.989> high

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
the sixteenth note grid the first high

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.130 
the sixteenth note grid the first high
hat<00:02:48.410> it<00:02:48.800> is<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.819> this<00:02:50.300> I<00:02:50.480> think<00:02:50.510> this<00:02:50.810> is<00:02:50.959> gonna

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
hat it is and this I think this is gonna

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.170 
hat it is and this I think this is gonna
start<00:02:51.440> here<00:02:51.650> in<00:02:51.709> a<00:02:51.770> second<00:02:52.130> so<00:02:52.640> we'll<00:02:53.000> just

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
start here in a second so we'll just

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.800 
start here in a second so we'll just
stop<00:02:53.450> it

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.350 

the<00:02:56.810> first<00:02:57.050> high<00:02:57.230> hat<00:02:57.440> hit<00:02:57.880> it's<00:02:58.880> on<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.120> first

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
the first high hat hit it's on the first

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:08.039 
the first high hat hit it's on the first
beat<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:01.670> second<00:03:02.090> one<00:03:02.239> is<00:03:02.830> on<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:04.310> end<00:03:04.700> of<00:03:05.540> one

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
beat the second one is on the end of one

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.690 
beat the second one is on the end of one
and<00:03:09.049> then<00:03:09.860> this<00:03:10.040> is<00:03:10.250> two<00:03:12.069> and<00:03:13.069> then<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.370> end<00:03:13.549> of

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
and then this is two and then the end of

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.030 
and then this is two and then the end of
2<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.860> the<00:03:15.860> of<00:03:16.340> two<00:03:16.580> so<00:03:17.569> we<00:03:17.720> have<00:03:17.750> one<00:03:18.260> E<00:03:18.560> and

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
2 and the of two so we have one E and

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:30.820 
2 and the of two so we have one E and
two<00:03:20.030> E<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:24.130> then<00:03:25.130> we<00:03:25.280> have<00:03:25.430> three<00:03:25.940> E<00:03:26.209> and<00:03:29.830> and

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
two E and then we have three E and and

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.220 
two E and then we have three E and and
then<00:03:31.430> that's<00:03:32.090> an<00:03:32.269> eighth<00:03:32.450> note<00:03:32.480> so<00:03:33.049> it

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
then that's an eighth note so it

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.319 
then that's an eighth note so it
occupies<00:03:33.920> both<00:03:34.160> of<00:03:34.310> these<00:03:34.400> spaces<00:03:34.700> just<00:03:35.180> like

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
occupies both of these spaces just like

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:41.140 
occupies both of these spaces just like
here<00:03:36.880> then<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:38.060> four<00:03:38.390> we<00:03:38.870> have<00:03:38.989> four<00:03:39.019> and<00:03:40.150> that

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
here then the four we have four and that

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.910 
here then the four we have four and that
occupies<00:03:41.660> two<00:03:41.870> spaces<00:03:42.200> because<00:03:42.620> it's<00:03:42.769> an

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
occupies two spaces because it's an

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.069 
occupies two spaces because it's an
eighth<00:03:43.010> note<00:03:43.040> and<00:03:43.579> then<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:46.810> so<00:03:47.810> that's<00:03:47.930> the

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
eighth note and then and so that's the

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:49.449 
eighth note and then and so that's the
first<00:03:48.109> measure<00:03:48.590> of<00:03:48.890> hi-hats

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
first measure of hi-hats

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.030 
first measure of hi-hats
so<00:03:50.299> let's<00:03:50.420> go<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:50.600> the<00:03:50.690> second<00:03:51.019> measure<00:03:51.200> the

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
so let's go to the second measure the

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.370 
so let's go to the second measure the
second<00:03:52.400> measure<00:03:52.549> measure<00:03:53.060> is<00:03:53.359> a<00:03:53.390> high<00:03:53.690> hat<00:03:53.900> but

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
second measure measure is a high hat but

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.599 
second measure measure is a high hat but
it's<00:03:54.530> accented<00:03:55.040> so<00:03:55.130> we're<00:03:55.250> gonna<00:03:55.340> hit<00:03:55.489> this

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.609 
it's accented so we're gonna hit this

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:04.599 
it's accented so we're gonna hit this
accent<00:03:58.570> then<00:03:59.570> that's<00:04:00.530> an<00:04:00.650> eighth<00:04:03.489> then<00:04:04.489> we

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
accent then that's an eighth then we

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.980 
accent then that's an eighth then we
have<00:04:04.700> another<00:04:04.820> eighth<00:04:06.910> 16

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:23.350 

and<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.700> 3/16<00:04:17.180> and<00:04:18.180> 1/8<00:04:18.620> still<00:04:19.620> in<00:04:19.740> the<00:04:19.860> three

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.760 

and<00:04:24.360> then<00:04:24.950> an<00:04:25.950> eighth<00:04:26.190> on<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:26.520> four<00:04:26.790> and<00:04:27.770> we'll

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
and then an eighth on the four and we'll

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.500 
and then an eighth on the four and we'll
go<00:04:28.950> to<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.160> open<00:04:29.810> and<00:04:30.810> then<00:04:31.250> an<00:04:32.250> eighth<00:04:32.790> on<00:04:33.450> the
