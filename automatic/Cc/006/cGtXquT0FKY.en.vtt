How to Promote Your Website with Google Maps
and Yandex Maps?

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.700
Website promotion with Google and Yandex Maps
is another method of attracting Internet users'

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.610
attention to your company.
By placing physical address of your company

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.550
on Google and Yandex Maps, you increase the
chance that users find your website, purchase

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.100
your goods, and use your services.
The recent research on attention tracking

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.539
have found out that the SERPs tagged on Google
and Yandex Maps attract users' attention the

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:32.439
most in comparison to ordinary SERPs. For
instance, when you search for "sushi Moscow",

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.339
the search engine will show up not only ordinary
search results but also the results of sushi

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.540
bars with tagged physical addresses on Google
and Yandex Maps. These sushi bars will be

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.949
shown on a map of the city with special tags.
Thanks to the map, users who look for sushi

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.769
bars will find their bearings and select the
nearest sushi bar quicker. All the companies

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.229
what have physical addresses are interested
in being tagged on Google and Yandex Maps.

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.739
These tags are important for banks, offices,
and retailers.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.089
The SERPs provided by Google and Yandex Maps
are formed the same way as ordinary SERPs;

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.810
therefore, the tags of websites with the highest
score sit on top. If you want to promote your

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.880
company on Google and Yandex Maps, you should
optimize the provided info with selected keywords

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.330
and phrases, add photos and videos. However,
positive reviews are the best for your SERPs.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.560
The good news is that you can place the info
about your company on Google and Yandex Maps

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.370
for free. However, if you want to be special
and move to the top as quick as possible,

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.810
you can prioritize your company (of course,
this service is paid). By prioritizing your

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.950
company on Google and Yandex Maps, you make
your company's tag bigger and more vivid.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.760
In addition to that, users get quick access
to detailed info about your company.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.210
Google and Yandex Maps placement is not difficult
but results in a considerable rise in number

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.720
of new visitors. As smartphones and tablets
become more and more popular, users get more

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.890
mobile and use maps more often. The method
is very up-to-the-minute.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.090
Google and Yandex Maps placement is very important
for companies that don't have their own websites.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.780
Companies that work in services -- cafes,
restaurants, diners, bars, hairdressing saloons,

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.780

Maps instead of their own websites.
