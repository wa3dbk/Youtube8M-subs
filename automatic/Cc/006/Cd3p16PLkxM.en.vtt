00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.730 

why<00:04:09.160> is<00:04:09.220> that<00:04:09.390> because<00:04:12.990> he<00:04:13.990> has<00:04:14.140> some<00:04:14.350> sugars

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
why is that because he has some sugars

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.780 
why is that because he has some sugars
in<00:04:14.890> it<00:04:14.920> because<00:04:15.190> it's<00:04:15.400> chocolate<00:04:15.820> milk<00:04:16.000> but<00:04:17.790> it

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
in it because it's chocolate milk but it

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.290 
in it because it's chocolate milk but it
is<00:04:18.820> not<00:04:19.090> bad<00:04:19.299> as<00:04:19.480> the<00:04:19.720> pop-tarts<00:04:20.290> you're<00:04:20.440> right

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:21.300 
is not bad as the pop-tarts you're right

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.970 
is not bad as the pop-tarts you're right
yes<00:04:22.300> other<00:04:23.140> chocolate<00:04:23.410> melts<00:04:23.800> that<00:04:23.890> are

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
yes other chocolate melts that are

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.890 
yes other chocolate melts that are
loaded<00:04:24.160> with<00:04:24.310> high<00:04:24.520> fructose<00:04:24.850> corn<00:04:25.300> syrup<00:04:25.450> so

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
loaded with high fructose corn syrup so

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.060 
loaded with high fructose corn syrup so
that's<00:04:26.050> another<00:04:26.290> thing<00:04:26.590> that<00:04:26.740> you<00:04:26.830> need<00:04:26.980> to

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
that's another thing that you need to

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.990 
that's another thing that you need to
watch<00:04:27.190> out<00:04:27.430> for<00:04:28.020> cereals<00:04:29.020> such<00:04:29.230> as<00:04:29.470> tachi

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
watch out for cereals such as tachi

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.570 
watch out for cereals such as tachi
cereals<00:04:31.080> are<00:04:32.080> very<00:04:32.410> high<00:04:32.590> in<00:04:32.620> fiber<00:04:32.950> and<00:04:33.190> low

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
cereals are very high in fiber and low

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.090 
cereals are very high in fiber and low
in<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.820> added<00:04:34.090> sugars<00:04:34.450> and<00:04:34.720> or<00:04:34.840> not<00:04:35.070> do<00:04:36.070> not

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
in the added sugars and or not do not

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.760

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
contain the high fructose corn syrup so

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.710 
contain the high fructose corn syrup so
if<00:04:38.950> you<00:04:39.280> just<00:04:39.520> drink<00:04:39.760> milk<00:04:39.940> with<00:04:40.120> once<00:04:40.360> in<00:04:40.480> mind
