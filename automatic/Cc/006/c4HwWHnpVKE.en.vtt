there<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.500> grew<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.860> microgravity<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:48.059> wanted

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
there and grew in microgravity we wanted

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.670 
there and grew in microgravity we wanted
something<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.690> kind<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.079> represented

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
something that kind of represented

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.979 
something that kind of represented
Hawaii<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.280> who<00:00:50.430> we<00:00:50.640> were<00:00:50.879> here<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.510> Hawaii<00:00:51.780> we

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
Hawaii and who we were here in Hawaii we

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.029 
Hawaii and who we were here in Hawaii we
may<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:53.070> limitations<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.739> products<00:00:55.739> command

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
may have limitations to products command

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.389 
may have limitations to products command
for<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.340> mainland<00:00:56.940> if<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.690> could<00:00:57.960> grow<00:00:58.920> plants

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
for the mainland if we could grow plants

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.860 
for the mainland if we could grow plants
up<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.030> space<00:01:00.270> shuttle

up on the space shuttle

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.569 
up on the space shuttle
that<00:01:01.230> would<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.500> helpful<00:01:02.190> for<00:01:02.309> them<00:01:02.489> because

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
that would be helpful for them because

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.579 
that would be helpful for them because
we<00:01:02.670> could<00:01:02.850> eat<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.300> also<00:01:03.420> provide<00:01:03.840> oxygen<00:01:04.080> I

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
we could eat and also provide oxygen I

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.010 
we could eat and also provide oxygen I

am a total space geek I have a schooling
in<00:01:07.320> engineering<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.340> then<00:01:08.640> military

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
in engineering and then military

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.359 
in engineering and then military
training<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.810> electronics<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:11.070> got<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
training and electronics we got the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.070 
training and electronics we got the
girls<00:01:11.610> together<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.330> came<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.720> realize

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
girls together and we came to realize

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.719 
girls together and we came to realize
that<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.409> was<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> group<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.130> girls<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.670> was

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
that this was a group of girls that was

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.580 
that this was a group of girls that was
interested<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.750> same<00:01:15.960> things<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.409> I<00:01:16.500> was

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
programmed all the programming they

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.260 
programmed all the programming they
designed<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.830> circuit<00:01:22.100> board<00:01:22.430> layouts

I'm signing the circuit board I would

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.620 
I'm signing the circuit board I would
take<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.550> measurements<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:35.240> then<00:01:35.360> I<00:01:35.390> would

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
take the measurements and then I would

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.350 
take the measurements and then I would
draw<00:01:35.960> out<00:01:36.490> diagrams<00:01:37.490> on<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:37.880> piece<00:01:38.030> of<00:01:38.180> graph

together a PowerPoint presentation I
worked<00:01:51.410> on<00:01:51.560> programming<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:52.850> my<00:01:53.150> favorite

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
worked on programming and my favorite

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.680 
worked on programming and my favorite
part<00:01:54.050> was<00:01:54.380> when<00:01:54.830> we<00:01:55.490> were<00:01:55.580> successful<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:56.540> when

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
part was when we were successful so when

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.350 
part was when we were successful so when
we<00:01:56.869> hit<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.200> play<00:01:57.320> button<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:58.040> we<00:01:58.190> could<00:01:58.400> see

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
we hit the play button and we could see

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.330 
we hit the play button and we could see
the<00:01:59.570> valve<00:01:59.780> work<00:02:00.080> or<00:02:00.320> see<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.740> right<00:02:01.010> lights

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
the valve work or see the right lights

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.330 
the valve work or see the right lights
turn<00:02:01.640> on<00:02:01.820> we<00:02:02.600> went<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:03.140> novel<00:02:03.619> farms<00:02:03.950> which<00:02:04.190> is

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
turn on we went to novel farms which is

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.670 
turn on we went to novel farms which is
in<00:02:04.460> Hawaii<00:02:04.610> we<00:02:05.360> met<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.990> guy<00:02:06.170> who's<00:02:06.470> in<00:02:06.650> charge

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
in Hawaii we met the guy who's in charge

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.040 
in Hawaii we met the guy who's in charge
of<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.250> novel<00:02:07.580> farms<00:02:07.970> he<00:02:08.479> had<00:02:08.600> this<00:02:08.780> cool

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
of the novel farms he had this cool

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.560 
of the novel farms he had this cool
watering<00:02:09.560> system<00:02:10.040> chorus<00:02:10.369> for<00:02:10.610> him<00:02:10.760> so<00:02:11.300> we

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
watering system chorus for him so we

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.930 
watering system chorus for him so we
took<00:02:11.720> some<00:02:11.959> of<00:02:11.990> that<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.470> we<00:02:12.730> incorporated<00:02:13.730> it

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
took some of that and we incorporated it

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.170 
took some of that and we incorporated it
into<00:02:14.090> of<00:02:14.330> our<00:02:14.510> experiment<00:02:15.500> yeah<00:02:16.100> they<00:02:16.400> came<00:02:17.000> to

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
into of our experiment yeah they came to

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.199 
into of our experiment yeah they came to
the<00:02:17.300> farm<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:18.310> they<00:02:19.310> walked<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.730> farm<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.180> a

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
the farm and they walked the farm and a

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.940 
the farm and they walked the farm and a
lot<00:02:20.570> of<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.690> girls<00:02:20.870> in<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.200> was<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.709> first

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
lot of the girls in the I was the first

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.710 
lot of the girls in the I was the first
time<00:02:22.160> they<00:02:22.400> they<00:02:22.790> had<00:02:22.880> been<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.390> farm<00:02:23.660> so

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
time they they had been to the farm so

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.560 
time they they had been to the farm so
we<00:02:23.989> had<00:02:24.170> them<00:02:24.380> come<00:02:25.220> over<00:02:25.370> we<00:02:25.910> had<00:02:26.090> been<00:02:26.239> taste

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
we had them come over we had been taste

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.290 
we had them come over we had been taste
a<00:02:26.870> lot<00:02:27.080> of<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.580> products<00:02:28.580> that<00:02:28.610> we<00:02:28.760> grow<00:02:28.910> on

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
a lot of the products that we grow on

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.600 
a lot of the products that we grow on
the<00:02:29.450> farm<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.019> never<00:02:30.890> cease<00:02:31.130> having<00:02:31.370> seen<00:02:31.580> a

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
the farm and never cease having seen a

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.970 
the farm and never cease having seen a
farm<00:02:31.940> they<00:02:32.810> were<00:02:32.870> surprised<00:02:33.380> at<00:02:33.560> how<00:02:33.650> fast

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
farm they were surprised at how fast

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.880 
farm they were surprised at how fast
things<00:02:34.280> grow<00:02:34.640> for<00:02:34.880> example<00:02:35.390> or<00:02:35.930> how<00:02:36.590> slow

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
things grow for example or how slow

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.100 
things grow for example or how slow
things<00:02:37.160> roll<00:02:37.430> he<00:02:38.180> grew<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.390> different<00:02:38.810> things

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
things roll he grew a different things

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.040 
things roll he grew a different things
more<00:02:39.860> organic<00:02:40.430> things<00:02:40.700> they'll<00:02:41.630> also<00:02:41.750> grow

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
more organic things they'll also grow

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.979 
more organic things they'll also grow
microgreens<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.980> that's<00:02:43.820> how<00:02:44.570> we<00:02:44.630> actually

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
microgreens and that's how we actually

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.810 
microgreens and that's how we actually
came<00:02:45.320> up<00:02:45.500> with<00:02:45.560> oh<00:02:46.040> yeah<00:02:46.250> maybe<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:46.610> should

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
came up with oh yeah maybe you should

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.610 
came up with oh yeah maybe you should
stand<00:02:47.000> up<00:02:47.120> on<00:02:47.269> micro<00:02:47.570> green<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.140> girls<00:02:48.410> on<00:02:48.500> our

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
stand up on micro green the girls on our

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.259 
stand up on micro green the girls on our
quest<00:02:49.070> came<00:02:49.519> into<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:50.390> program<00:02:51.310> shy<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:53.000> less

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
quest came into the program shy and less

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.560 
quest came into the program shy and less
talkative<00:02:54.200> less<00:02:54.769> able<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.310> express<00:02:56.209> their

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
science and stem and after the project I

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.370 
science and stem and after the project I
noticed<00:03:00.950> that<00:03:01.250> they<00:03:01.490> we're<00:03:02.270> willing<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.630> talk

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
noticed that they we're willing to talk

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.910 
noticed that they we're willing to talk
to<00:03:03.590> an<00:03:03.680> adult<00:03:03.980> about<00:03:04.490> a<00:03:04.850> specific<00:03:05.920> engineering

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
to an adult about a specific engineering

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.840 
to an adult about a specific engineering
idea<00:03:07.910> or<00:03:08.390> a<00:03:08.500> programming<00:03:09.500> idea<00:03:10.070> that<00:03:10.760> was

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
idea or a programming idea that was

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.730 
idea or a programming idea that was
something<00:03:11.240> they<00:03:11.390> weren't<00:03:11.570> able<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.960> do<00:03:12.290> before

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
something they weren't able to do before

something they weren't able to do before
this<00:03:12.920> project<00:03:13.220> we<00:03:13.940> questioned<00:03:14.360> ourselves<00:03:14.840> on

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
this project we questioned ourselves on

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.350 
this project we questioned ourselves on
the<00:03:15.200> meeting<00:03:15.500> and<00:03:15.620> it<00:03:16.040> was<00:03:16.310> just<00:03:16.520> a<00:03:16.640> sheer

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
the meeting and it was just a sheer

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.900 
the meeting and it was just a sheer
feeling<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:17.870> disbelief<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:18.680> on<00:03:19.010> astonishment

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
feeling of disbelief and on astonishment

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.670 
feeling of disbelief and on astonishment
we<00:03:20.540> couldn't<00:03:20.840> believe<00:03:20.960> that<00:03:21.320> we're<00:03:21.440> even

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
we couldn't believe that we're even

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.200 
we couldn't believe that we're even
gonna<00:03:21.800> send<00:03:22.130> something<00:03:22.280> up<00:03:22.460> into<00:03:22.580> space<00:03:22.760> it's

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
gonna send something up into space it's

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.090 
gonna send something up into space it's
like<00:03:23.360> me<00:03:23.480> unthinkable<00:03:24.110> because<00:03:24.770> we<00:03:24.890> didn't

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
like me unthinkable because we didn't

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.040 
like me unthinkable because we didn't
really<00:03:25.190> know<00:03:25.430> each<00:03:25.610> other<00:03:25.730> so<00:03:26.150> we<00:03:26.450> then<00:03:26.630> we're

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
really know each other so we then we're

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.380 
really know each other so we then we're

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
all super quiet golden you know how to

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.390 
all super quiet golden you know how to
act<00:03:29.660> with<00:03:29.900> each<00:03:30.200> other<00:03:30.410> but<00:03:30.890> we<00:03:31.130> were<00:03:31.280> like

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
act with each other but we were like

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.640 
act with each other but we were like
then<00:03:31.910> you<00:03:31.970> were<00:03:32.060> all<00:03:32.240> under<00:03:32.660> qualified<00:03:33.230> to<00:03:33.500> do

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
then you were all under qualified to do

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.920 
then you were all under qualified to do
this<00:03:33.830> because<00:03:34.040> it's<00:03:34.520> not<00:03:34.640> up<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.420> mean<00:03:35.690> this<00:03:35.750> is

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
this because it's not up I mean this is

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.110 
this because it's not up I mean this is
an<00:03:36.140> experience<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.800> most<00:03:37.370> people<00:03:37.640> can't<00:03:37.880> say

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
an experience that most people can't say

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.410 
an experience that most people can't say
they<00:03:38.300> participated<00:03:39.230> in<00:03:39.350> and<00:03:40.090> just<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.240> fact

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
they participated in and just the fact

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.970 
they participated in and just the fact
that<00:03:41.510> we<00:03:41.720> sensitive<00:03:42.200> to<00:03:42.380> space<00:03:42.590> it's<00:03:42.860> just

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
that we sensitive to space it's just

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.620 
that we sensitive to space it's just
really<00:03:43.100> rewarding<00:03:43.730> it's<00:03:44.150> been<00:03:44.360> a<00:03:44.390> really

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
really rewarding it's been a really

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.770 
really rewarding it's been a really
different<00:03:45.290> experience<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:46.430> I'm<00:03:47.330> really<00:03:47.600> glad

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
different experience and I'm really glad

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.090 
different experience and I'm really glad
that<00:03:47.900> gus-gus<00:03:48.200> is<00:03:48.500> going<00:03:48.710> into<00:03:48.800> something

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
that gus-gus is going into something

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.030 
that gus-gus is going into something
like<00:03:49.340> this<00:03:49.490> it's<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.390> good<00:03:51.020> time<00:03:51.290> all<00:03:51.680> the

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
like this it's a good time all the

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.710 
like this it's a good time all the
things<00:03:52.280> that<00:03:52.400> I've<00:03:52.580> learned<00:03:52.610> here<00:03:53.150> is<00:03:53.330> really

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
things that I've learned here is really

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.650 
things that I've learned here is really
important<00:03:54.400> working<00:03:55.400> together<00:03:55.760> being

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
important working together being

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.440 
important working together being
open-minded<00:03:57.080> thinking<00:03:57.980> out<00:03:58.190> of<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.370> box<00:03:58.490> this

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
open-minded thinking out of the box this

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.760 
open-minded thinking out of the box this
project<00:04:00.020> can<00:04:00.110> open<00:04:00.470> up<00:04:00.590> my<00:04:01.480> ideas<00:04:02.480> of<00:04:02.810> going<00:04:03.470> to

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
project can open up my ideas of going to

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.560 
project can open up my ideas of going to
something<00:04:04.130> with<00:04:04.340> space<00:04:04.580> this<00:04:04.940> really<00:04:05.270> helps
