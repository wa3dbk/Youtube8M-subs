00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.439
 I re dispose of the elements roughly 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.299
 under the same conditions as when he 

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:09.000
 there was the crash so there I have the car 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.530
 drivers with the gps tracker that was at 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.799
 pretty much right next door that was passing on 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.000
 the threads that went to the brains of 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:19.950
 depth and drift laughs I got 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.420
 put in rtl mode as I was at the moment 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.510
 of the crash when he passed alone in 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.800
 the bm and so we can notice that the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.070
 the LEDs and flashes 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:33.440
 they are in rhythm on two 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.440
 blink when all is well 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:41.480
 the blue and red flashes in phase i 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.859
 here brains that move very little 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.850
 so I show you that when I call 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:49.980
 the tracker there is a break in the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.230
 rhythms the blinks and the 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.159
 brains start to wriggle by 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.559
 against for now I'm not 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:01:00.089
 happened to recreate the major incident when 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.670
 the more the auto pilot has rocked all 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:05.180
 alone in October to endss fashion writing a 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.170
 brain that has stuck in position 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.780
 fable ok I do not know anyway who 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.000
 inserted the brain from the depth 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:18.080
 went into pity mode so here I go 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.080
 call the tracker 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:54.170
 here already disturbed now I'm going 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.160
 wait for them to return the sms 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.510
 have us again a slight 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:04.760
 disruption of the self drivers and the 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.760
 brains at the moment the sms is emitted 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.830
 The beep you hear is simply 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.280
 because I put my chaining a microphone 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.280
 to see fashion 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:31.390
 here it is he has sent his text to 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.730
 slightly disturbed 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.860
 for electronic circuits and 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.150
 now we find brains that 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:46.300
 scarcely quarrels and the pace of 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.390
 regular blinking so my fear 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.040
 is that here I am close to a relay 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.690
 so maybe just as he 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.400
 know he's close to a relay the 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.330
 tracker that behaves like a 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.989
 cellphone 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.730
 he did not like in his full power 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.850
 so all I need is my plane 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.940
 found in an area where it goes badly where 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.320
 there is a weak relay signal and that 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.420
 he wants to report to the antenna 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.769
 relay it will signal in its full 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.930
 power to get to the 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.130
 relecq signal is weak and at this 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.050
 that moment maybe only in its full 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.870
 power it goes a lot more disturbed 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.070
 all the electronics that surrounds that 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.170
 I had to do it alone and that's 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.170
 now by taking all this 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.890
 configuration in an area where there is 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.890
 very little network 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.030
 so I call the freak 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.080
 already brands like the brain of the 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.080
 fretille depth 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:14.000
 a little less obvious just now 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.510
 so the jelly positioned under the car 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.130
 pilot the tracker he goes again 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.130
 wriggle when he's going to send me his sms 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:36.340
 good for now he has never moved back 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.340
 in total this mode they will remain rtl 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:05:06.759
 there he sent this sms fabien fruits and 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:22.379
 both and that change the display to 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:22.379
 eyzies of a new disruption 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:30.810
 Well, here it is, ah, here it is. 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:37.270
 nav mode 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:41.560
 that's it we reproduced the bug it is 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.580
 switched to navigation mode and suddenly bah 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.509
 now he moves alone because 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.279
 that they in navigation mode 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.039
 good luck that's good we reproduced the 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:49.659
 breakdown so that wants his life a beautiful and well 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:53.529
 of the gps tracker when he is too close 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:54.400
 other pilots who disrupts and suddenly 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:56.620
 we see that now I have more than one 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.419
 only blinking of the blue tongue of 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.750
 the blue led adie which means it 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.589
 went into navigation mode alone 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.879
 so now remains to souse to what 

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:06.150
 distance must put it for that disturbs 

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:08.199
 not it will be the next step 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.270
 so here I show you that every time 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:12.129
 which I call the tracker which is right 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.330
 underneath the auto drivers the 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:15.330
 brains panick 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.389
 there I call him 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:37.860
 this is a brazen brain 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:44.910
 does the same when the tracker returns me 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:46.800
 an SMS but knowing that there I am in 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.560
 an area I have a good reception of 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.190
 gsm networks so the tracker did not like 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.190
 in all its power 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.020
 so this morning it was more obvious 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:00.210
 because we went to the mountains in 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:03.419
 an area where there was little 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:06.169
 network and so the disturbances is 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:06.169
 even more obvious
