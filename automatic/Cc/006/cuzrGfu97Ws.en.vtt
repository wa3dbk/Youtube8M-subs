00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
it or they just don't want to get it

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.240 
it or they just don't want to get it

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
trigger all the way when i'm using a

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.790 
trigger all the way when i'm using a
foul<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.910> just<00:03:03.510> have<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:03.870> stop<00:03:04.140> right<00:03:04.650> where

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
foul and just have it stop right where

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.260 
foul and just have it stop right where
the<00:03:04.920> gun<00:03:05.190> shoots<00:03:05.490> and<00:03:05.700> just<00:03:05.850> keep<00:03:05.970> on<00:03:06.090> doing

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
the gun shoots and just keep on doing

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.970 
the gun shoots and just keep on doing
that<00:03:06.360> so<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.600> pump<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.440> most<00:03:07.680> amount<00:03:07.890> of

bullets possible enough in the little
amount<00:03:10.800> of<00:03:10.920> time<00:03:11.690> similar<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.900> way<00:03:12.990> when

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
amount of time similar to the way when

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.960 
amount of time similar to the way when

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
and so forth and that's the way I view

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.160 
and so forth and that's the way I view
it<00:03:35.130> when<00:03:35.820> people<00:03:36.120> say<00:03:36.300> a<00:03:36.330> scuf<00:03:36.600> controller<00:03:36.930> is

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
it when people say a scuf controller is

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.360 
it when people say a scuf controller is
a<00:03:37.200> modded<00:03:37.710> controller<00:03:38.060> think<00:03:39.060> again<00:03:39.390> I

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
a modded controller think again I

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.790 
a modded controller think again I
consider<00:03:41.370> something<00:03:41.640> cheating<00:03:42.620> when<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.710> when

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800
