00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
this is our new 5-3 wedge cylinder head

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.529 
this is our new 5-3 wedge cylinder head
for<00:00:17.420> our<00:00:17.779> nano<00:00:17.990> threes<00:00:18.350> and<00:00:19.000> 959<00:00:20.000> versions<00:00:20.420> we

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
for our nano threes and 959 versions we

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.660 
for our nano threes and 959 versions we
have<00:00:20.570> the<00:00:21.080> state's<00:00:21.800> 2<00:00:22.009> cylinder<00:00:22.369> head<00:00:22.520> it's

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
have the state's 2 cylinder head it's

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.820 
have the state's 2 cylinder head it's
got<00:00:22.820> some<00:00:23.000> quite<00:00:23.869> a<00:00:23.900> few<00:00:24.050> updates<00:00:24.230> on<00:00:24.619> it<00:00:24.650> and

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
got some quite a few updates on it and

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.679 
got some quite a few updates on it and
stuff<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.250> for<00:00:25.820> the<00:00:25.880> prologue<00:00:26.300> for<00:00:26.630> the

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
stuff and for the prologue for the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.189 
stuff and for the prologue for the
proton<00:00:26.990> class<00:00:27.310> 305<00:00:28.310> so<00:00:29.210> I've<00:00:29.750> got<00:00:29.869> these<00:00:30.019> and

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
proton class 305 so I've got these and

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.560 
proton class 305 so I've got these and
all<00:00:30.260> our<00:00:30.380> new<00:00:30.529> engines<00:00:31.460> that<00:00:32.210> are<00:00:32.300> going<00:00:32.480> out

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
all our new engines that are going out

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.180 
all our new engines that are going out
to<00:00:32.720> the<00:00:32.809> public<00:00:32.989> and<00:00:33.290> seeing<00:00:33.890> really<00:00:34.010> good

have<00:00:39.769> a<00:00:40.750> little<00:00:41.750> sharp<00:00:42.050> engineer<00:00:42.739> and<00:00:43.010> a

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
have a little sharp engineer and a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.600 
have a little sharp engineer and a
programmer<00:00:44.110> one<00:00:45.110> good<00:00:45.410> thing<00:00:45.440> about<00:00:45.680> it<00:00:45.950> is<00:00:46.280> we

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
programmer one good thing about it is we

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.220 
programmer one good thing about it is we
design<00:00:47.390> and<00:00:48.370> manufacture<00:00:49.840> or<00:00:50.840> a<00:00:50.870> lot<00:00:51.110> of

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
design and manufacture or a lot of

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.139 
design and manufacture or a lot of
people<00:00:51.559> don't<00:00:52.340> have<00:00:52.579> that<00:00:53.050> facility<00:00:54.050> and

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
people don't have that facility and

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.729 
people don't have that facility and
we've<00:00:56.149> got<00:00:56.329> different<00:00:56.690> people<00:00:56.989> to<00:00:57.260> call<00:00:57.500> us

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
we've got different people to call us

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.590 
we've got different people to call us
and<00:00:57.920> one<00:00:58.039> let's<00:00:58.190> design<00:00:58.550> something<00:00:58.940> for<00:00:59.149> them

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
and one let's design something for them

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.729 
and one let's design something for them
and<00:00:59.840> we<00:01:00.350> can<00:01:00.379> do<00:01:00.680> that<00:01:00.920> too<00:01:01.340> for<00:01:01.610> vegetarian

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
and we can do that too for vegetarian

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.940 
and we can do that too for vegetarian
but<00:01:03.739> I<00:01:04.190> have<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:05.119> good<00:01:05.570> staff<00:01:05.869> here<00:01:06.259> so<00:01:06.500> I'm<00:01:06.680> very

heads<00:01:17.390> here's<00:01:17.660> a<00:01:17.690> completed<00:01:18.110> engine<00:01:18.530> we<00:01:18.830> just

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
heads here's a completed engine we just

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.430 
heads here's a completed engine we just
freshen<00:01:19.340> up<00:01:19.429> for<00:01:19.640> a<00:01:19.700> customer<00:01:20.179> and<00:01:20.440> getting
