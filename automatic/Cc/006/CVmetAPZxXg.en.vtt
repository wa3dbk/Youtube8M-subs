style of cooking as well I think that's

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.570

what<00:04:31.960> cooking<00:04:32.170> is<00:04:32.320> about<00:04:32.560> it's<00:04:32.950> about<00:04:33.070> like

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
what cooking is about it's about like

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.850 
what cooking is about it's about like

feeding the people you love is caring

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.520 
feeding the people you love is caring
for<00:04:36.190> babies<00:04:36.280> and<00:04:36.880> then<00:04:37.120> like<00:04:37.990> cooking<00:04:38.380> on<00:04:38.470> a

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.140 
for babies and then like cooking on a
mat<00:04:38.710> I<00:04:38.800> think<00:04:39.070> about<00:04:39.280> and<00:04:39.490> I<00:04:39.520> think<00:04:39.730> we<00:04:39.850> kind<00:04:40.090> of

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
mat I think about and I think we kind of

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.890 
mat I think about and I think we kind of
take<00:04:40.300> that<00:04:40.360> I<00:04:42.120> think<00:04:43.120> that's<00:04:43.240> what<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.660> judges

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
take that I think that's what the judges

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.960 
take that I think that's what the judges
picked<00:04:44.320> up<00:04:44.500> a<00:04:44.620> lot<00:04:44.770> from<00:04:44.950> our<00:04:45.100> dishes<00:04:45.370> is<00:04:45.760> there

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.140 
then it kind of felt like we got pushed
through<00:05:48.530> the<00:05:48.710> back<00:05:48.920> and<00:05:49.160> I<00:05:49.250> was<00:05:49.280> just<00:05:49.670> uh<00:05:49.850> I

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
through the back and I was just uh I

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.270 
through the back and I was just uh I
don't<00:05:50.480> know<00:05:50.690> I've<00:05:50.900> got<00:05:51.080> enough<00:05:51.320> lifted<00:05:51.890> me<00:05:52.100> I'm

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
don't know I've got enough lifted me I'm

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.180 
don't know I've got enough lifted me I'm
you<00:05:52.550> know<00:05:52.640> running<00:05:52.910> on<00:05:53.090> empty<00:05:53.300> now<00:05:53.750> so<00:05:54.020> I<00:05:54.560> think

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
you know running on empty now so I think

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.650 
you know running on empty now so I think
that<00:05:55.370> definitely<00:05:55.580> took<00:05:55.970> the<00:05:56.120> wind<00:05:56.270> out<00:05:56.450> of<00:05:56.510> me

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
that definitely took the wind out of me

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.320 
that definitely took the wind out of me
but<00:05:57.020> and<00:05:57.290> had<00:05:57.680> to<00:05:57.800> go<00:05:57.920> home<00:05:58.130> and<00:05:58.400> just<00:05:58.490> refocus

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
but and had to go home and just refocus

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.540 
but and had to go home and just refocus
and<00:05:59.720> get<00:06:00.410> through<00:06:00.650> the<00:06:00.800> next<00:06:00.920> challenge<00:06:01.250> but<00:06:01.490> I

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
and get through the next challenge but I

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.390 
and get through the next challenge but I
found<00:06:01.730> it<00:06:01.940> really<00:06:01.970> hard<00:06:02.390> actually<00:06:03.100> I<00:06:04.100> think

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
found it really hard actually I think

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.640 
found it really hard actually I think
regardless<00:06:04.700> of<00:06:05.300> how<00:06:05.450> many<00:06:05.510> like<00:06:06.140> challenges

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
regardless of how many like challenges

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.230 
regardless of how many like challenges
they<00:06:06.770> did<00:06:06.950> throw<00:06:07.190> at<00:06:07.280> us<00:06:07.430> like<00:06:07.670> we<00:06:07.910> would<00:06:08.060> just

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
they did throw at us like we would just

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.030 
they did throw at us like we would just
we<00:06:08.450> just<00:06:08.480> were<00:06:08.810> just<00:06:08.840> going<00:06:09.170> to<00:06:09.230> keep<00:06:09.350> going<00:06:09.770> no

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:10.040 
we just were just going to keep going no

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.770 
we just were just going to keep going no
matter<00:06:10.070> how<00:06:10.490> many<00:06:10.730> times<00:06:11.060> they<00:06:11.540> didn't

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
matter how many times they didn't

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.810 
matter how many times they didn't
eliminate<00:06:11.960> someone<00:06:12.410> we<00:06:13.070> just<00:06:13.280> do<00:06:13.460> our<00:06:13.490> best

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
eliminate someone we just do our best

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.040 
eliminate someone we just do our best
even<00:06:14.030> though<00:06:14.300> it<00:06:14.390> was<00:06:14.540> disheartening

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
even though it was disheartening

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.570 
even though it was disheartening
sometimes<00:06:15.560> that's<00:06:15.920> what's<00:06:16.100> good<00:06:16.220> about<00:06:16.310> being

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
sometimes that's what's good about being

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.830 
sometimes that's what's good about being
in<00:06:16.670> a<00:06:16.790> jury<00:06:17.000> you<00:06:17.240> know<00:06:17.330> you<00:06:17.450> can<00:06:17.600> just<00:06:17.690> be<00:06:17.810> like

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
in a jury you know you can just be like

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.780 
in a jury you know you can just be like
come<00:06:18.080> on<00:06:18.230> it's<00:06:18.530> just<00:06:18.710> do<00:06:18.830> it<00:06:18.980> and<00:06:19.190> that's<00:06:19.700> a

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:19.790
