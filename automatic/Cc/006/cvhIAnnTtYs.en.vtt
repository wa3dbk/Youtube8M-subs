00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.259 
series one and if i remember i think it
was<00:03:45.959> like<00:03:46.019> 40<00:03:46.530> or<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:46.860> for<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.700> United<00:03:48.239> Kingdom

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
worth about forty to fifty dollars

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.100 
worth about forty to fifty dollars
actually<00:05:48.790> already<00:05:48.880> sold<00:05:49.150> one<00:05:49.330> for<00:05:49.360> like<00:05:49.570> 48

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
actually already sold one for like 48

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.590 
actually already sold one for like 48
and<00:05:50.350> only<00:05:50.530> had<00:05:50.620> one<00:05:50.830> other<00:05:51.100> one<00:05:51.430> so<00:05:51.730> i<00:05:51.970> got

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
and only had one other one so i got

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.659 
and only had one other one so i got
three<00:05:52.750> those<00:05:52.870> a<00:05:52.900> stack<00:05:53.200> now<00:05:53.410> still<00:05:53.770> that's

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
three those a stack now still that's

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.430 
three those a stack now still that's
probably<00:05:55.270> the<00:05:55.360> highlight<00:05:55.600> of<00:05:55.750> this<00:05:55.900> box<00:05:56.140> and

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
probably the highlight of this box and

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.170 
probably the highlight of this box and
given<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:56.860> condition<00:05:57.310> stuff<00:05:57.580> of<00:05:57.700> their<00:05:57.850> stuff

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
given the condition stuff of their stuff

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.850 
given the condition stuff of their stuff
so<00:05:59.790> maybe<00:06:00.870> the<00:06:01.870> fact<00:06:02.020> that<00:06:02.140> i<00:06:02.260> have<00:06:02.380> this<00:06:02.470> video

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
so maybe the fact that i have this video

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.680 
so maybe the fact that i have this video
could<00:06:03.190> be<00:06:03.250> good<00:06:03.640> proof<00:06:03.910> that<00:06:04.180> i<00:06:04.210> didn't<00:06:04.510> get

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
could be good proof that i didn't get

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.980 
could be good proof that i didn't get
two<00:06:05.530> of<00:06:05.560> these<00:06:05.830> as<00:06:06.190> i<00:06:06.370> ordered<00:06:06.760> as<00:06:07.090> you<00:06:07.720> can<00:06:07.840> see

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
two of these as i ordered as you can see

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.050 
two of these as i ordered as you can see
here<00:06:08.200> there's<00:06:08.380> no<00:06:08.770> others<00:06:09.100> in<00:06:09.310> here<00:06:09.550> the<00:06:09.820> box

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
here there's no others in here the box

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.670 
here there's no others in here the box

wasn't open locate our tampered with
anyway<00:06:12.130> so<00:06:12.720> hopefully<00:06:13.720> i<00:06:13.750> can<00:06:13.780> somehow<00:06:14.080> get

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
anyway so hopefully i can somehow get

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.550 
anyway so hopefully i can somehow get
that<00:06:14.380> result<00:06:14.830> but<00:06:15.750> anyways<00:06:16.750> I<00:06:17.050> guess<00:06:17.350> that's

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
that result but anyways I guess that's

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.890 
that result but anyways I guess that's
all<00:06:17.710> for<00:06:17.740> this<00:06:18.040> video<00:06:18.250> so<00:06:18.760> subscribe<00:06:19.390> you
