 Cho Yong Pil - Tea House in the Winter 

00:00:21.182 --> 00:00:27.600
 In that way .. I walked in the wind 

00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:34.800
 That early morning I entered the tea house 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.300
 I sat by the window with some dried flowers beside me 

00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:49.300
 Then I drove my unit 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.900
 Because of this beautiful sin .. 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.400
 Which we call love !! 

00:00:58.146 --> 00:01:04.600
 I have spent this long night .. lonely 

00:01:05.263 --> 00:01:08.700
 If this is love .. 

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:12.600
 Has left a wound in my heart ..! 

00:01:13.017 --> 00:01:18.500
 Why do I still torture myself? 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.600
 Even though my face was smiling .. 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.900
 I'm still crying inside me ..! 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.600
 Uh it's love wound .. 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.000
 Because of this beautiful sin .. 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.500
 Which we call love .. !! 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.500
 I have spent this long night .. lonely 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.600
 If this is love .. 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.700
 Has left a wound in my heart .. 

00:02:25.787 --> 00:02:31.200
 Why am I still tormenting him so? 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.000
 Even though my face was smiling ... 

00:02:36.283 --> 00:02:40.000
 I'm still crying inside me ..! 

00:02:40.263 --> 00:02:50.700
 Uh it's love wound .. 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.960
