00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.189
 no no 

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.769
 It's been a while since I'm in my 

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:10.940
 channel to see when was the last time 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:13.030
 I uploaded a video but a month without uploading 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.000
 videos 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.490
 hello youtube users I hope not 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.500
 bother them my absence will see I was with 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.200
 many things to do that I forgot 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.730
 be active on my channel plus I did 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.890
 a video and I thought about uploading the week 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.169
 gone but for some reason I did not 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.899
 I find a pity but that you 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:34.360
 can do good resuming I wanted to do 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.460
 a video of who has more advantage xbox 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.579
 one or playstation 4 for the user 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.890
 proto man 20 xx but you know what 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.379
 it happened to me and I did not have time to do it 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.780
 but he here I intend to make this a 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.940
 little quick do not worry I have something 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.730
 of time lately but I want to do 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.710
 other videos well I'm going to compare these 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.890
 two consoles and see which of the two 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.579
 have more advantages to see the xbox one 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.609
 it costs $ 499 I remember reading 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:06.430
 that they lowered the price I think I'm not 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:09.970
 sure and the playstation 4 is known to 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.790
 it costs 399 dollars a big difference 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.490
 do not believe we see the characteristics of 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.920
 the controls the xbox one says it includes 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.480
 more than 40 improvements with respect to the command 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.330
 wireless xbox 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.160
 60 is more enveloping thanks to the 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.320
 impulse triggers and their new 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.170
 Vibration motors of the triggers is 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.630
 more accurate and more comfortable the dual 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.700
 shock 4 has a touch panel to have 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.400
 new ways to play and interact with 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.500
 the games a lighting bar that 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.260
 gives useful game information as per 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.120
 example the health bar was changed the 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.490
 start and select buttons for a new 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.710
 Share button serves to share 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.660
 your triumphs and achievements when loading plays 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.940
 real time austria mo when uploading 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.740
 recorded videos to facebook has 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.560
 integrated mono speaker connection and 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.170
 hearing aids and in addition to a new design and 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.030
 improved vibration I forgot that 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.070
 has an accessory called a camera 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.200
 playstation that you use to share 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.030
 some video of you while you play the 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.220
 video will be in high definition and 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.280
 Chat with your voice and other things 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.240
 this would be like 'lucky neck 2 clear that 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.580
 It has some characteristics 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.730
 interesting so there's no need 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.980
 mention it now the games something I 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.660
 He says it will be difficult and I think 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.910
 that this point is taken to their tastes 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.870
 since there are many games we throw a 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.940
 glance 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.209
 to stand out in the xbox one I will say that they are 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.150
 halo of master chief projection super 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:39.010
 ultra r3 arcade remix at 5 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.110
 guardians rise are another of harris in 3 and 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.670
 killer instinct and on playstation 4 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:49.360
 they are uncharted 4 the order 1886 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.450
 infamous second sonic and zone shadow file 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.090
 and some others more in the territory 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.480
 of hardware the ps 4 is superior to xbox 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.609
 one since it has a gddr5 memory and more 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.470
 nuclei in gpu what benefits you 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.319
 have more resolution and better graphics 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.480
 in video games the bad of these 2 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.549
 ps4 and xbox one is that they do not have 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.459
 backwards compatibility so if you want 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:15.040
 Play a ps3 ps2 game in format 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.560
 physical will not be possible the same to xbox 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.379
 one with the xbox 360 games and the 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.829
 first but sony is fixing this 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:27.390
 problem with a service called gaikai 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.390
 Microsoft has not talked about this topic 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.250
 there are many issues to discuss 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.200
 these two consoles but I think with 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.090
 this is enough or I think so 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.830
 now analyzing all the 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:42.620
 features that we saw earlier 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.620
 they know the winner very well and it is 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.359
 playstation 4 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.560
 well I think that after the seen it was 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:58.049
 something obvious and good the reality is that the 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.620
 PlayStation 4 is selling 10 million 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.870
 of consoles and the xbox one 5 million in 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.600
 my opinion if they tell me to choose a 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:12.180
 only console of the two know which one I choose 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.180
 well the wiiu xd up soon
