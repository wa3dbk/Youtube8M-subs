running a lava and go this way a little

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.449 
running a lava and go this way a little
bit<00:01:21.910> you<00:01:22.179> do<00:01:22.360> have<00:01:22.569> a<00:01:22.840> nice<00:01:23.140> five<00:01:23.649> diamonds

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
which is enough to make you a diamond

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.309 
which is enough to make you a diamond
pickaxe<00:01:26.709> and<00:01:26.920> a<00:01:27.369> diamond<00:01:28.149> sword<00:01:28.479> I<00:01:28.780> thought

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
pickaxe and a diamond sword I thought

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.219 
pickaxe and a diamond sword I thought
that<00:01:29.470> was<00:01:29.590> kind<00:01:29.860> of<00:01:29.890> nice<00:01:30.069> because<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:32.080> main

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
that was kind of nice because the main

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.630 
that was kind of nice because the main
problem<00:01:32.500> that<00:01:32.530> I<00:01:32.679> have<00:01:32.920> is<00:01:32.950> always<00:01:33.340> finding

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
problem that I have is always finding

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.710 
problem that I have is always finding
diamonds<00:01:33.849> when<00:01:34.179> it<00:01:34.300> comes<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.569> playing

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
diamonds when it comes to playing

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.919 
diamonds when it comes to playing
survival<00:01:35.259> mode<00:01:35.410> so<00:01:35.679> that<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.899> first

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
survival mode so that is the first

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.339 
survival mode so that is the first
feature<00:01:38.800> of<00:01:39.190> the<00:01:39.700> seed<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.869> second<00:01:41.229> feature

00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:41.349 
feature of the seed the second feature

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:48.480 
feature of the seed the second feature
is<00:01:41.649> that<00:01:41.740> there<00:01:42.340> is<00:01:42.459> actually<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:43.440> a<00:01:47.490> jungle

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
it a stronghold the coordinates roughly

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:12.390 
it a stronghold the coordinates roughly
X<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.970> 588<00:03:06.970> Z<00:03:07.960> of<00:03:09.750> 515<00:03:10.750> so<00:03:11.680> let's<00:03:12.070> go<00:03:12.220> ahead<00:03:12.250> and

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
X of 588 Z of 515 so let's go ahead and

X of 588 Z of 515 so let's go ahead and
dig<00:03:12.940> down<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:15.400> fall<00:03:15.880> right<00:03:16.450> into<00:03:16.720> a

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
dig down and you fall right into a

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.680 
dig down and you fall right into a
stronghold<00:03:17.410> now<00:03:17.770> I<00:03:17.800> don't<00:03:17.950> exactly<00:03:18.460> know<00:03:18.880> what

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
stronghold now I don't exactly know what

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.580 
stronghold now I don't exactly know what
all<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:20.110> included<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.970> screenshot<00:03:21.970> in<00:03:22.960> this

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
all is included a screenshot in this

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.290 
all is included a screenshot in this
stronghold<00:03:24.070> I<00:03:24.340> haven't<00:03:24.610> really<00:03:24.700> explored<00:03:25.150> it

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
stronghold I haven't really explored it

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.300 
stronghold I haven't really explored it
much<00:03:25.330> but<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:26.380> I<00:03:26.410> guess<00:03:26.800> is<00:03:26.980> for<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.280> to

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
much but that I guess is for you to

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.160 
much but that I guess is for you to
figure<00:03:27.550> out<00:03:27.820> since<00:03:28.480> there's<00:03:28.630> a<00:03:28.690> chest<00:03:28.900> right

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
figure out since there's a chest right

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.690 
figure out since there's a chest right
here<00:03:29.200> I<00:03:29.380> might<00:03:29.530> as<00:03:29.590> well<00:03:29.770> look<00:03:29.890> in<00:03:30.040> it<00:03:30.160> but

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
here I might as well look in it but

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.340 
here I might as well look in it but
inside<00:03:31.060> this<00:03:31.240> chest<00:03:31.570> is<00:03:31.720> actually<00:03:32.050> an<00:03:32.140> ender

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
inside this chest is actually an ender

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.750 
inside this chest is actually an ender
pearl<00:03:32.530> a<00:03:32.620> golden<00:03:33.010> apple<00:03:33.070> which<00:03:33.430> is<00:03:33.550> kind<00:03:33.730> of

pearl a golden apple which is kind of
cool<00:03:33.820> and<00:03:34.180> an<00:03:35.140> apple<00:03:35.650> so<00:03:36.580> that's<00:03:36.700> pretty<00:03:36.850> cool

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
cool and an apple so that's pretty cool

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.850 
cool and an apple so that's pretty cool

is<00:05:07.900> actually<00:05:08.379> pretty<00:05:08.819> difficult<00:05:09.819> to<00:05:10.210> make<00:05:10.690> as

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
is actually pretty difficult to make as

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.029 
is actually pretty difficult to make as
far<00:05:11.710> as<00:05:11.740> a<00:05:12.630> efficiency<00:05:13.630> with<00:05:14.020> your<00:05:14.560> materials

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039

far as a efficiency with your materials
there<00:05:15.580> is<00:05:15.759> a<00:05:15.789> ton<00:05:16.150> more<00:05:16.690> stuff<00:05:16.990> in<00:05:17.139> the<00:05:17.229> seed

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
there is a ton more stuff in the seed

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.320 
there is a ton more stuff in the seed
guys<00:05:17.770> but<00:05:18.069> there's<00:05:18.280> too<00:05:18.490> much<00:05:18.669> to<00:05:18.940> show<00:05:19.120> it<00:05:19.240> in

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
guys but there's too much to show it in

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.770 
guys but there's too much to show it in
one<00:05:19.509> video<00:05:19.720> there<00:05:20.530> is<00:05:20.710> actually<00:05:20.979> oh<00:05:21.880> by<00:05:22.750> the
