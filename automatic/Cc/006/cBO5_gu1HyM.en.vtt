hello guys Jeffery speaking here so

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.330 
hello guys Jeffery speaking here so
today<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.600> would<00:00:12.990> like<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.620> do<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:14.250> review<00:00:14.990> for<00:00:15.990> my

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
today I would like to do a review for my

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.990 
today I would like to do a review for my
TPU<00:00:17.340> keeper<00:00:17.970> protector<00:00:18.680> so<00:00:19.680> today<00:00:20.190> the<00:00:20.430> title

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
TPU keeper protector so today the title

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.130 
TPU keeper protector so today the title
would<00:00:21.180> be<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.510> comparison<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:23.900> silicon<00:00:24.900> and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
would be the comparison of silicon and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.060 
would be the comparison of silicon and
TPU<00:00:25.770> keep<00:00:26.039> apart<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.580> kibo<00:00:27.090> protector<00:00:27.770> so<00:00:28.770> as

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
TPU keep apart the kibo protector so as

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.939 
TPU keep apart the kibo protector so as
you<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.369> see<00:00:29.430> in<00:00:29.730> front<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:31.199> my<00:00:31.619> newly

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
you can see in front of you is my newly

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.419 
you can see in front of you is my newly
bought<00:00:32.539> TPU<00:00:33.539> kiba<00:00:33.929> protector<00:00:34.620> for<00:00:35.309> my

00:00:35.419 --> 00:00:35.429 
bought TPU kiba protector for my

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:39.790 
bought TPU kiba protector for my
notebook<00:00:35.999> that<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.929> the<00:00:37.140> Lenovo<00:00:37.640> y4<00:00:38.640> v<00:00:38.850> OH

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
notebook that is the Lenovo y4 v OH

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.290 
notebook that is the Lenovo y4 v OH
so<00:00:42.289> actually<00:00:43.289> I<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.769> used<00:00:44.249> a<00:00:44.579> silicon

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
so actually I have used a silicon

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.319 
so actually I have used a silicon
keyboard<00:00:45.780> protector<00:00:46.469> for<00:00:46.710> my<00:00:46.920> notebook<00:00:47.699> since

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
keyboard protector for my notebook since

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.449 
keyboard protector for my notebook since
three<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.989> think<00:00:49.019> half<00:00:49.710> half<00:00:50.190> years<00:00:50.639> ago<00:00:50.940> and

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:52.459 
three I think half half years ago and

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:56.329 
three I think half half years ago and
the<00:00:53.459> experience<00:00:54.179> is<00:00:54.420> not<00:00:54.690> quite<00:00:55.109> good<00:00:55.499> so

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:56.339 
the experience is not quite good so

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.270 
the experience is not quite good so
that's<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.969> reason<00:00:57.420> why<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:58.019> switched<00:00:58.499> to<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
that's the reason why I switched to the

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.449 
that's the reason why I switched to the
tip<00:00:59.549> you<00:00:59.579> keep<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.149> protector<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.109> now<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:02.100> would

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:02.459 
tip you keep a protector and now I would

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:04.660 
tip you keep a protector and now I would
like<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.639> show<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.269> guys<00:01:03.329> my<00:01:03.899> previous

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
like to show to you guys my previous

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.020 
protector and I will put it side-by-side
to<00:01:18.120> show<00:01:18.390> some<00:01:18.810> difference<00:01:19.380> between<00:01:20.010> the<00:01:20.550> TPU

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
to show some difference between the TPU

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.930 
to show some difference between the TPU
kiba<00:01:21.390> protector<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.430> silicon<00:01:23.430> cable

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
kiba protector and silicon cable

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.560

protector<00:01:24.740> so<00:01:25.740> first<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.280> all<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.730> would<00:01:27.540> like

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
protector so first of all I would like

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.290 
protector so first of all I would like
to<00:01:27.750> talk<00:01:28.200> about<00:01:28.410> the<00:01:29.130> physical<00:01:29.700> properties<00:01:30.270> of

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
to talk about the physical properties of

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.620 
to talk about the physical properties of
these<00:01:30.780> two<00:01:31.200> different<00:01:31.980> materials<00:01:32.630> keyboard

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
these two different materials keyboard

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.390 
these two different materials keyboard
protector<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:35.160> as<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:36.390> know<00:01:36.600> these<00:01:37.530> two

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
protector so as you know these two

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.790 
protector so as you know these two
keyboard<00:01:39.210> protectors<00:01:39.810> are<00:01:40.080> made<00:01:40.140> from

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
keyboard protectors are made from

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.050 
keyboard protectors are made from
different<00:01:41.070> materials<00:01:41.870> the<00:01:42.870> one<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.710> TPU<00:01:44.340> one

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
different materials the one is TPU one

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.810 
different materials the one is TPU one
is<00:01:45.330> silicon<00:01:45.900> so<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.470> course<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.280> properties

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
is silicon so of course the properties

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.050 
is silicon so of course the properties
of<00:01:48.030> these<00:01:48.240> two<00:01:48.600> kiba<00:01:49.380> protectors<00:01:49.980> will<00:01:50.760> be

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
of these two kiba protectors will be

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.300 
of these two kiba protectors will be
different<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.490> as<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.700> can<00:01:53.850> see<00:01:54.650> the<00:01:55.650> TPU<00:01:56.070> keep

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
different so as you can see the TPU keep

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.810 
different so as you can see the TPU keep
a<00:01:56.430> protector<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:58.200> transparency<00:01:59.100> degree<00:01:59.520> for

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
a protector the transparency degree for

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.660 
a protector the transparency degree for
this<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.330> is<00:02:00.720> higher<00:02:01.340> compared<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
this one is higher compared to the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.290 
this one is higher compared to the
silicon<00:02:03.210> tire<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:05.100> silicon<00:02:05.580> tire<00:02:05.850> as<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.180> can

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
silicon tire the silicon tire as you can

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.800 
silicon tire the silicon tire as you can
see<00:02:06.740> it<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:08.369> color<00:02:08.670> would<00:02:09.149> be<00:02:09.299> a<00:02:09.329> little<00:02:09.719> bit

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
see it the color would be a little bit

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.440 
see it the color would be a little bit
yellowish<00:02:10.170> compared<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.489> TPU<00:02:12.090> kiba

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
yellowish compared to the TPU kiba

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.809 
yellowish compared to the TPU kiba
protector<00:02:13.019> which<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.249> can<00:02:14.459> say

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
protector which is I can say

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.539 
protector which is I can say
is<00:02:15.859> almost<00:02:16.859> transparent<00:02:18.379> and<00:02:19.379> of<00:02:19.769> course<00:02:20.219> the

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
is almost transparent and of course the

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.239 
is almost transparent and of course the
aesthetic<00:02:21.209> value<00:02:21.540> for<00:02:21.840> TPU<00:02:22.200> kiba<00:02:22.650> protector

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:23.249 
aesthetic value for TPU kiba protector

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:27.319 
aesthetic value for TPU kiba protector
will<00:02:23.730> be<00:02:23.849> nicer<00:02:24.120> as<00:02:24.629> when<00:02:25.530> I<00:02:25.739> put<00:02:26.249> the<00:02:26.760> typical

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
will be nicer as when I put the typical

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.770 
will be nicer as when I put the typical
keyboard<00:02:27.749> protector<00:02:28.469> on<00:02:28.680> my<00:02:29.219> keyboard<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:30.060> can

when I put it on my keyboard it won't
sleep<00:03:25.409> so<00:03:25.889> easily<00:03:26.780> so<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:28.019> has<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.319> better<00:03:28.799> grip

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
sleep so easily so it has a better grip

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:33.050 
sleep so easily so it has a better grip
on<00:03:29.459> my<00:03:29.639> keyboard<00:03:29.939> but<00:03:30.930> for<00:03:31.259> the<00:03:31.379> TPU<00:03:31.829> type<00:03:32.280> it

will<00:03:33.299> be<00:03:33.449> a<00:03:33.479> little<00:03:33.720> bit<00:03:34.189> slippery<00:03:35.189> you<00:03:35.579> see

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
will be a little bit slippery you see

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.780 
will be a little bit slippery you see
when<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:36.840> move<00:03:37.259> a<00:03:37.439> little<00:03:37.620> bit<00:03:37.919> I<00:03:38.129> put<00:03:38.549> some

when I move a little bit I put some

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.289 
when I move a little bit I put some
force<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:40.169> will<00:03:40.379> easily<00:03:41.069> come<00:03:41.639> up<00:03:41.849> from<00:03:42.150> my

compared to the silicon kippa protector

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:18.469 
compared to the silicon kippa protector
and<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:15.209> answer<00:04:15.689> is<00:04:15.930> yes<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.789> can<00:04:17.789> eat<00:04:18.180> or

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
and the answer is yes and can eat or

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.790 
and the answer is yes and can eat or
could<00:04:19.469> it<00:04:19.500> affect<00:04:20.099> the<00:04:20.969> typing<00:04:21.539> speed<00:04:21.570> or<00:04:22.289> yeah

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
could it affect the typing speed or yeah

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.689 
could it affect the typing speed or yeah
the<00:04:23.010> typing<00:04:24.050> for<00:04:25.050> me<00:04:25.229> it<00:04:25.469> doesn't<00:04:25.740> affect<00:04:26.430> so

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699 
the typing for me it doesn't affect so

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.730 
the typing for me it doesn't affect so
much<00:04:27.000> it<00:04:27.570> still<00:04:27.990> feels

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
much it still feels

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.230 
much it still feels
really<00:04:29.400> nice<00:04:30.260> it<00:04:31.260> gives<00:04:31.590> a<00:04:31.740> really<00:04:32.240> great

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
really nice it gives a really great

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.970 
really nice it gives a really great
response<00:04:33.800> and<00:04:34.800> I<00:04:35.340> love<00:04:35.550> it<00:04:36.260> the<00:04:37.260> silicon<00:04:37.710> tire

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
response and I love it the silicon tire

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.210 
response and I love it the silicon tire
it<00:04:38.310> also<00:04:38.730> giving<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.240> same<00:04:39.710> feeling<00:04:40.710> for<00:04:40.980> to

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
it also giving the same feeling for to

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.660 
it also giving the same feeling for to
me<00:04:41.370> so<00:04:41.850> for<00:04:42.510> me<00:04:42.630> it<00:04:42.810> doesn't<00:04:43.050> give<00:04:43.950> that<00:04:44.310> much

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
me so for me it doesn't give that much

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.770 
me so for me it doesn't give that much
of<00:04:44.940> different<00:04:45.510> in<00:04:46.260> terms<00:04:46.620> of<00:04:46.830> stiffness<00:04:47.160> and

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
of different in terms of stiffness and

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.260 
of different in terms of stiffness and
the<00:04:48.780> third<00:04:49.050> one<00:04:49.290> I<00:04:49.500> want<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.400> talk<00:04:50.580> about<00:04:50.760> is

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
the third one I want to talk about is

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.820 
the third one I want to talk about is
the<00:04:52.280> surface<00:04:53.300> so<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.450> surface<00:04:54.720> of<00:04:55.200> the<00:04:55.470> TPU

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
the surface so the surface of the TPU

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.880 
the surface so the surface of the TPU
keyboard<00:04:56.280> protector<00:04:56.910> is<00:04:57.800> really<00:04:58.800> smooth<00:05:00.890> so

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
keyboard protector is really smooth so

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.690 
keyboard protector is really smooth so
if<00:05:02.250> you<00:05:02.490> have<00:05:02.990> you<00:05:03.990> have<00:05:04.020> oily<00:05:04.830> fingers<00:05:05.280> and

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
if you have you have oily fingers and

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.120 
if you have you have oily fingers and
you<00:05:06.240> lay<00:05:06.480> your<00:05:06.750> fingers<00:05:07.170> on<00:05:07.350> this<00:05:07.560> typically

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
you lay your fingers on this typically

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.790 
you lay your fingers on this typically
the<00:05:08.430> TPU<00:05:08.790> keyboard<00:05:09.210> protector<00:05:09.720> you<00:05:10.440> do<00:05:10.620> not

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
the TPU keyboard protector you do not

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.100 
the TPU keyboard protector you do not
need<00:05:11.070> to<00:05:11.310> worry<00:05:11.550> about<00:05:11.790> that<00:05:12.150> because<00:05:12.330> you<00:05:12.870> can

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
need to worry about that because you can

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.680 
need to worry about that because you can
easily<00:05:13.470> wipe<00:05:13.950> it<00:05:14.130> out<00:05:14.480> using<00:05:15.480> a<00:05:15.660> wet<00:05:16.470> cloth<00:05:16.890> a

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
easily wipe it out using a wet cloth a

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.590 
easily wipe it out using a wet cloth a
damn<00:05:18.690> cliff<00:05:19.050> is<00:05:19.290> really<00:05:19.860> easy<00:05:20.160> but<00:05:21.120> for<00:05:21.450> the

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
damn cliff is really easy but for the

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.160 
damn cliff is really easy but for the
slick<00:05:21.930> contact<00:05:22.440> I<00:05:22.680> top<00:05:23.130> it<00:05:23.160> because<00:05:23.910> as<00:05:24.690> you<00:05:24.930> as

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
slick contact I top it because as you as

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:27.830 
slick contact I top it because as you as
I<00:05:25.410> have<00:05:25.560> mentioned<00:05:26.100> before<00:05:26.130> the<00:05:27.060> surface<00:05:27.570> of

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
I have mentioned before the surface of

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.620 
I have mentioned before the surface of
this<00:05:28.110> silicon<00:05:28.980> keeper<00:05:29.370> protector<00:05:30.030> is<00:05:30.570> a

this silicon keeper protector is a

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.000 
this silicon keeper protector is a
little<00:05:31.110> bit<00:05:31.200> little<00:05:31.680> bit

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
little bit little bit

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.630 
little bit little bit
rubberized<00:05:32.960> so<00:05:33.960> it<00:05:34.290> gives<00:05:34.620> some<00:05:34.830> texture<00:05:35.430> on

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
rubberized so it gives some texture on

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.760 
rubberized so it gives some texture on
it<00:05:35.670> so<00:05:36.570> when<00:05:36.840> the<00:05:37.170> dust

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
it so when the dust

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.330 
it so when the dust
for<00:05:38.070> example<00:05:38.670> stick<00:05:39.270> on<00:05:39.510> the<00:05:40.070> silicon<00:05:41.070> te

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.040 
for example stick on the silicon te
keepa<00:05:41.850> protector<00:05:43.880> it<00:05:44.880> is<00:05:45.030> a<00:05:45.060> little<00:05:45.390> bit<00:05:45.690> hard

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
keepa protector it is a little bit hard

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.610 
keepa protector it is a little bit hard
to<00:05:46.280> use<00:05:47.280> a<00:05:47.310> damp<00:05:47.700> cloth<00:05:48.090> or<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:48.690> wet<00:05:48.930> cloth<00:05:49.230> to

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
to use a damp cloth or the wet cloth to

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.450 
to use a damp cloth or the wet cloth to
wipe<00:05:49.830> it<00:05:50.040> out

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
wipe it out

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.510 
wipe it out
because<00:05:51.300> the<00:05:51.990> dust<00:05:52.230> or<00:05:52.620> the<00:05:52.650> dirt<00:05:52.950> is<00:05:53.220> still

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
because the dust or the dirt is still

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.630 
because the dust or the dirt is still
visible<00:05:54.290> so<00:05:55.290> usually<00:05:56.750> you<00:05:57.750> have<00:05:58.020> to<00:05:58.610> wash<00:05:59.610> it

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
visible so usually you have to wash it

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.340 
visible so usually you have to wash it
under<00:06:00.210> the<00:06:00.360> tap<00:06:00.690> water<00:06:00.990> or<00:06:01.850> for<00:06:02.850> my<00:06:03.000> case<00:06:03.350> I

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
under the tap water or for my case I

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.960 
under the tap water or for my case I
will<00:06:04.800> use<00:06:05.070> a<00:06:05.640> toothbrush<00:06:06.650> to<00:06:07.650> brush<00:06:07.970> the

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:08.970 
will use a toothbrush to brush the

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.140 
will use a toothbrush to brush the
surface<00:06:09.210> of<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:09.660> silicon<00:06:10.080> to<00:06:10.320> make<00:06:10.590> it

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
surface of the silicon to make it

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.250 
surface of the silicon to make it
cleaner<00:06:12.150> and<00:06:14.180> the<00:06:15.180> fourth<00:06:15.450> one<00:06:15.690> I<00:06:15.870> would<00:06:16.140> like

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260 
cleaner and the fourth one I would like

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.920 
cleaner and the fourth one I would like
to<00:06:16.470> talk<00:06:16.620> about<00:06:16.920> is<00:06:17.160> the<00:06:17.370> last<00:06:17.730> elastic<00:06:18.630> city

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930 
to talk about is the last elastic city

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.610 
to talk about is the last elastic city
so<00:06:19.800> the<00:06:19.950> elasticity<00:06:20.550> for<00:06:21.270> the<00:06:21.510> slick<00:06:21.750> con<00:06:21.930> is

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
so the elasticity for the slick con is

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.610 
so the elasticity for the slick con is
really<00:06:23.040> high<00:06:23.250> and<00:06:23.820> for<00:06:24.750> the<00:06:24.900> tip<00:06:25.140> you<00:06:25.260> keep<00:06:25.500> a

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
really high and for the tip you keep a

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.830 
really high and for the tip you keep a
protector<00:06:26.220> it<00:06:26.670> is<00:06:27.000> not<00:06:27.300> that<00:06:27.630> elastic<00:06:29.210> so<00:06:30.210> the

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
protector it is not that elastic so the

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.780 
protector it is not that elastic so the
next<00:06:31.110> thing<00:06:31.350> I<00:06:31.470> would<00:06:31.530> like<00:06:31.620> to<00:06:31.860> talk<00:06:32.040> about<00:06:32.400> is

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:32.790 
next thing I would like to talk about is

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.470 
next thing I would like to talk about is
the<00:06:33.390> method<00:06:33.900> of<00:06:34.160> how<00:06:35.160> we<00:06:35.580> are<00:06:35.700> going<00:06:35.730> to<00:06:36.150> clean

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:36.480 
the method of how we are going to clean

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.750 
the method of how we are going to clean
the<00:06:37.020> this

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
the this

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.760 
the this
two<00:06:37.910> different<00:06:38.540> materials<00:06:39.190> keep<00:06:40.190> a<00:06:40.310> protector

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770 
two different materials keep a protector

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.580 
two different materials keep a protector
so<00:06:42.770> usually<00:06:43.310> the<00:06:43.490> cleaning<00:06:43.970> method<00:06:44.420> is<00:06:44.990> almost

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
so usually the cleaning method is almost

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:50.110 
so usually the cleaning method is almost
the<00:06:45.770> same<00:06:46.540> I<00:06:47.540> have<00:06:48.170> actually<00:06:49.040> regarding<00:06:49.970> on

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.120 
the same I have actually regarding on

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.690 
the same I have actually regarding on
these<00:06:50.330> problems<00:06:51.020> on<00:06:51.470> all<00:06:51.770> these<00:06:51.920> methods<00:06:52.280> I

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:52.700 
these problems on all these methods I

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.080 
these problems on all these methods I
have<00:06:53.060> referred<00:06:53.660> to<00:06:53.960> one<00:06:54.800> of<00:06:55.010> the<00:06:55.250> resellers<00:06:55.880> in

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:56.090 
have referred to one of the resellers in

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.080 
have referred to one of the resellers in
eBay<00:06:56.510> and<00:06:56.750> I<00:06:57.050> asked<00:06:57.590> him<00:06:57.860> this<00:06:58.190> question<00:06:58.250> on

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.090 
eBay and I asked him this question on

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.850 
eBay and I asked him this question on
how<00:06:59.690> to<00:06:59.750> clean<00:07:00.290> up<00:07:00.530> the<00:07:01.130> keeper<00:07:01.580> protector<00:07:02.210> and

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:02.860 
how to clean up the keeper protector and

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.840 
how to clean up the keeper protector and
he<00:07:03.860> he<00:07:04.610> taught<00:07:04.910> me<00:07:05.150> to<00:07:05.440> to<00:07:06.440> wash<00:07:06.740> them<00:07:07.130> using<00:07:07.730> a

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:07.850 
he he taught me to to wash them using a

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.320 
he he taught me to to wash them using a
warm<00:07:08.090> water<00:07:08.330> which<00:07:09.140> is<00:07:09.380> around<00:07:09.710> 60<00:07:10.490> to<00:07:10.520> 70

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.330 
warm water which is around 60 to 70

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.460 
warm water which is around 60 to 70
degree<00:07:11.660> Celsius<00:07:12.820> I<00:07:13.820> think<00:07:14.420> the<00:07:14.840> reason<00:07:15.230> maybe

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.470 
degree Celsius I think the reason maybe

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.890 
degree Celsius I think the reason maybe
it<00:07:15.860> will<00:07:16.010> be<00:07:16.190> the<00:07:16.700> dirt<00:07:17.150> will<00:07:17.420> be<00:07:17.450> easily

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:17.900 
it will be the dirt will be easily

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.130 
it will be the dirt will be easily
removed<00:07:18.530> if<00:07:18.920> you<00:07:19.670> use<00:07:19.910> a<00:07:19.940> warm<00:07:20.300> water<00:07:20.540> compared

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.140 
removed if you use a warm water compared

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.880 
removed if you use a warm water compared
to<00:07:21.290> a<00:07:21.320> cold<00:07:21.650> water<00:07:21.890> and<00:07:22.600> the<00:07:23.600> second<00:07:24.050> thing<00:07:24.710> you

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:24.890 
to a cold water and the second thing you

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.910 
to a cold water and the second thing you
have<00:07:24.920> to<00:07:25.340> bear<00:07:25.670> in<00:07:25.850> mind<00:07:25.880> is<00:07:26.360> you<00:07:27.080> can<00:07:27.410> only<00:07:27.680> use

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:27.920 
have to bear in mind is you can only use

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.260 
have to bear in mind is you can only use
the<00:07:28.550> soft<00:07:28.880> detergent<00:07:29.570> for<00:07:30.350> example<00:07:31.100> hand<00:07:31.850> soap

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.270 
the soft detergent for example hand soap

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.130 
the soft detergent for example hand soap
or<00:07:32.540> dish<00:07:33.260> detergent<00:07:34.060> you<00:07:35.060> cannot<00:07:35.570> use<00:07:35.930> the

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:36.140 
or dish detergent you cannot use the

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:42.670 
or dish detergent you cannot use the
body<00:07:36.380> stop<00:07:36.770> or<00:07:37.100> for<00:07:37.400> example<00:07:37.970> or<00:07:39.250> shampoo

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:42.680 

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.610 

so<00:07:43.280> in<00:07:43.639> conclusion<00:07:43.880> I'm<00:07:44.720> really<00:07:45.259> satisfied

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:45.620 
so in conclusion I'm really satisfied

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.129 
so in conclusion I'm really satisfied
with<00:07:46.070> my<00:07:46.520> newly<00:07:46.850> poured<00:07:47.449> TPU<00:07:48.440> kiba<00:07:48.860> protector

00:07:50.129 --> 00:07:50.139 
with my newly poured TPU kiba protector

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:54.070 
with my newly poured TPU kiba protector
however<00:07:51.139> it<00:07:51.680> only<00:07:51.860> gives<00:07:52.280> me<00:07:52.460> some<00:07:53.030> give<00:07:53.900> me
