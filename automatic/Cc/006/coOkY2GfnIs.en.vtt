00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:05.509
- This one is called --

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:07.521
- Mountain Dew Me.

00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:09.472
- Exactly, it's tropical; it's festive,

00:00:09.472 --> 00:00:11.645
and she is tropical and fest --

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:12.600
That's a shark's tooth?

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:13.892
- Yeah, it's a real shark's tooth.

00:00:13.892 --> 00:00:14.713
- Did you catch it?

00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:17.069
- Of course I did. Why do you ask?

00:00:17.069 --> 00:00:20.594
- That's (mumbles)

00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:22.149
Seriously, she got a picture on the wall.

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:23.667
- I do. (laughs)

00:00:24.575 --> 00:00:25.176
- Are you ready for this one?

00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:25.826
- Yeah.

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:28.410
- Okay. Midori.

00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:30.193
(laughs)

00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:33.624
- An evil laugh.

00:00:33.624 --> 00:00:35.184
- Triple Sec.

00:00:38.254 --> 00:00:39.827
Pineapple juice.

00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:44.421
- Right about there.

00:00:44.421 --> 00:00:45.795
- Okay, beautiful.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:49.288
And then we hit that with
a splash of Mountain Dew.

00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:53.189
- Maybe you should have done this.

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:55.032
- You should have shaken
it before you opened it.

00:00:55.032 --> 00:00:55.967
- Are you kidding?

00:00:55.967 --> 00:00:57.268
- No, seriously, that's how you mix it.

00:00:57.268 --> 00:00:58.558
- I was just joking, [go ahead]. (laughs)

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:01.629
- What? Squirt all over me.

00:01:02.075 --> 00:01:02.804
Like that?

00:01:02.804 --> 00:01:03.779
- That's good.

00:01:03.932 --> 00:01:05.137
That's good.

00:01:05.137 --> 00:01:06.726
- Okay, a splash of the Dew.

00:01:06.726 --> 00:01:09.407
- Garnish with a lemon, a lime. Sorry.

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:14.579
What's this again? The Mountain Dew?

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:15.328
- Mountain Dew Me.

00:01:15.328 --> 00:01:17.038
- You gotta fix that, the lime.

00:01:17.314 --> 00:01:21.141
And there you have it!
The Mountain Dew Me!

00:01:21.771 --> 00:01:23.017
(laughter)

00:01:23.017 --> 00:01:24.694
- You're so weird.

00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:26.659
- Go ahead. Hit that.
Tell me what you think.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:27.996
- Okay.

00:01:33.156 --> 00:01:36.123
- Dude, that's (mumbles). (laughs)

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:38.464
And there you have it,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:40.518
A [manly] drink. (laughs)

00:01:40.518 --> 00:01:41.602
- That was really good.

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:42.158
- Really?

00:01:42.158 --> 00:01:42.637
- Mm hmm.

00:01:42.637 --> 00:01:43.659
- You like it?

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:44.921
- That's so good.

00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:45.684
- Really?

00:01:45.684 --> 00:01:48.745
- Yes! It's perfect for the
beach, for the pool, relaxing.

00:01:48.745 --> 00:01:50.411
It's so refreshing. I love it.

00:01:50.411 --> 00:01:54.121
- Sure, sure, sure, sure. (laughs)

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:57.907
There you have her seal of approval.

00:01:57.907 --> 00:01:58.943
You know what I mean?

00:01:58.943 --> 00:02:01.556
If you drink that much of a
drink, it must be awesome.

00:02:01.556 --> 00:02:02.682
- It is really good.

00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:06.013
(laughter)

00:02:06.013 --> 00:02:07.395
- Tipsy Bartender!

00:02:07.395 --> 00:02:07.862
- Bye.

00:02:07.862 --> 00:02:08.885
- [Voiceover] Mountain Dew Me,

00:02:08.885 --> 00:02:11.494
I gotta try that. (laughs)
