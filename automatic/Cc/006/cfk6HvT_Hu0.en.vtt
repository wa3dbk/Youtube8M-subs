had only recently been relegated from

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.190 
had only recently been relegated from
the<00:00:32.579> Premiership<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.600> took<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.809> one-nil<00:00:34.110> lead

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
the Premiership we took a one-nil lead

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.020 
the Premiership we took a one-nil lead
pretty<00:00:34.620> early<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.160> game<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.579> they

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
pretty early on in this game and they

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.549 
pretty early on in this game and they
kind<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.420> equalize<00:00:36.690> pretty<00:00:37.050> straight<00:00:37.380> soon

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
kind of equalize pretty straight soon

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.440 
kind of equalize pretty straight soon
straight<00:00:37.800> after<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.730> he<00:00:38.879> looked<00:00:39.059> like<00:00:39.239> there

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
straight after and he looked like there

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.580 
straight after and he looked like there
was<00:00:39.510> hardly<00:00:39.690> any<00:00:39.870> chance<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.320> game<00:00:40.379> that

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
was hardly any chance in this game that

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.750 
was hardly any chance in this game that
so<00:00:40.770> it's<00:00:40.980> pretty<00:00:41.010> much<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.250> game<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.700> was

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
so it's pretty much a game that was

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.580 
so it's pretty much a game that was
again<00:00:42.210> all<00:00:42.750> based<00:00:42.960> around<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.260> middle<00:00:43.469> to

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
again all based around the middle to

again all based around the middle to
pitch<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.520> saw<00:00:44.789> their<00:00:45.000> 90th<00:00:45.420> minute<00:00:45.480> I

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
pitch and I saw their 90th minute I

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.049 
pitch and I saw their 90th minute I
nearly<00:00:45.899> had<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> goal<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.129> Keough<00:00:47.730> headed

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
nearly had a goal but I Keough headed

wide that came finished one all it's not

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.500

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
has been sold someone or if he's just

I'm<00:02:13.950> pretty<00:02:14.130> confident<00:02:14.370> going<00:02:14.550> into<00:02:14.670> this

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
I'm pretty confident going into this

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.300 
I'm pretty confident going into this
game<00:02:14.990> but<00:02:15.990> within<00:02:16.230> five<00:02:16.500> minutes<00:02:16.680> they<00:02:17.130> put<00:02:17.280> a

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
game but within five minutes they put a

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.340 
game but within five minutes they put a
cross<00:02:17.490> in<00:02:17.550> there<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.150> then<00:02:18.870> he<00:02:18.990> turns<00:02:19.200> my

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
cross in there and then he turns my

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.080 
cross in there and then he turns my
defender<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:20.010> then<00:02:20.130> turns<00:02:20.460> my<00:02:20.580> other<00:02:20.760> one<00:02:20.910> and

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
defender and then turns my other one and

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.910 
defender and then turns my other one and
passes<00:02:21.390> across<00:02:21.510> and<00:02:21.930> my<00:02:22.410> slide<00:02:22.590> tackle<00:02:22.830> which

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
passes across and my slide tackle which

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.470 
passes across and my slide tackle which
is<00:02:22.980> just<00:02:23.160> a<00:02:23.250> little<00:02:23.400> bit<00:02:23.640> too<00:02:23.820> late<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.150> believe

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
is just a little bit too late I believe

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.060 
is just a little bit too late I believe
and<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.140> ball<00:02:25.290> goes<00:02:25.440> underneath<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.830> player

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
and the ball goes underneath the player

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.560 
and the ball goes underneath the player
and<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.880> part<00:02:27.090> straight<00:02:27.210> across<00:02:27.360> the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
and it is part straight across the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
and in the 20th minute a defender then

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.670 
and in the 20th minute a defender then
took<00:02:33.270> out<00:02:33.390> my<00:02:33.480> golly<00:02:33.630> there<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.080> some<00:02:34.440> reason

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
took out my golly there and some reason

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.960

the championship so it's definitely a

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.790 
the championship so it's definitely a
game<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:52.020> we<00:02:52.110> like<00:02:52.230> differently<00:02:52.650> should<00:02:52.740> be

managed<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:54.990> make<00:02:55.110> it<00:02:55.260> 2-1<00:02:55.440> for<00:02:55.830> us<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.190> nice

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
managed to make it 2-1 for us of a nice

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.890 
managed to make it 2-1 for us of a nice
little<00:02:56.610> shot<00:02:56.850> in<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.000> edge<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.210> area<00:02:57.540> and

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
little shot in the edge of the area and

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.210 
little shot in the edge of the area and
again<00:02:58.200> here<00:02:58.410> Kia<00:02:58.590> picks<00:02:58.770> up<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.920> ball<00:02:59.070> and

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
again here Kia picks up the ball and

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.530 
again here Kia picks up the ball and
shoots<00:02:59.490> to<00:02:59.580> make<00:02:59.700> it<00:02:59.820> till<00:02:59.940> we<00:03:00.060> turns<00:03:00.240> offender

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
shoots to make it till we turns offender

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.150 
shoots to make it till we turns offender
and<00:03:00.660> shoots<00:03:00.990> and<00:03:01.170> bitsy<00:03:01.620> -<00:03:01.800> I<00:03:01.830> think<00:03:01.980> that's

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
and shoots and bitsy - I think that's

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.920 
and shoots and bitsy - I think that's
most<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.460> goals<00:03:02.700> iug<00:03:03.000> score<00:03:03.240> is<00:03:03.360> I<00:03:03.540> get<00:03:03.870> the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
most of the goals iug score is I get the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.450 
most of the goals iug score is I get the
Borneo's<00:03:04.230> D<00:03:04.350> area<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.680> in<00:03:04.740> turn<00:03:04.980> leave<00:03:05.280> see

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
Borneo's D area and in turn leave see

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.800 
Borneo's D area and in turn leave see
how<00:03:05.550> I<00:03:05.580> get<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.730> win<00:03:05.820> here<00:03:06.030> at<00:03:06.180> turn<00:03:06.420> and<00:03:06.720> then

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
how I get a win here at turn and then

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.910 
how I get a win here at turn and then
just<00:03:06.960> shoot<00:03:07.110> straight<00:03:07.260> away<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.770> seems

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
just shoot straight away and that seems

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.050 
just shoot straight away and that seems
to<00:03:07.950> be<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.100> very<00:03:08.280> easy<00:03:08.430> way<00:03:08.580> of<00:03:08.640> scoring<00:03:08.790> in

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
to be a very easy way of scoring in

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.270 
to be a very easy way of scoring in
career<00:03:09.330> mode<00:03:09.510> seems<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.560> be<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.650> tactic<00:03:11.160> that

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
career mode seems to be a tactic that

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.710 
career mode seems to be a tactic that
I've<00:03:11.370> seemed<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.730> employ<00:03:12.150> throughout<00:03:12.630> the

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
I've seemed to employ throughout the

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.300 
I've seemed to employ throughout the
time<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.140> it's<00:03:13.260> got<00:03:13.380> there<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.620> I've<00:03:14.280> got

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
time and it's got there and I've got

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.580 
time and it's got there and I've got
very<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:14.850> bear<00:03:15.060> at<00:03:15.210> doing<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:16.290> see<00:03:16.410> here

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
very a bear at doing it and you see here

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.199 
very a bear at doing it and you see here
Piazza<00:03:17.190> on<00:03:17.280> there<00:03:17.400> makes<00:03:17.550> it<00:03:17.640> free<00:03:17.880> -<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.150> the

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
Piazza on there makes it free - in the

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.910 
Piazza on there makes it free - in the
72nd<00:03:18.660> minute<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:18.989> has<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.320> great<00:03:19.530> comeback<00:03:19.830> for

72nd minute and has a great comeback for

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.650 
72nd minute and has a great comeback for

us obviously - no down so we've managed

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.330 
us obviously - no down so we've managed

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
to kind of defy that momentum not

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.130 
to kind of defy that momentum not

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
usually very very hard to bring it back

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.100 
usually very very hard to bring it back
and<00:03:29.070> in<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.790> 76<00:03:30.150> minute<00:03:30.360> about<00:03:30.600> for<00:03:30.840> 3<00:03:30.959> or<00:03:31.080> 4

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110

and in a 76 minute about for 3 or 4
minutes<00:03:31.260> I'll<00:03:31.530> just<00:03:31.800> call<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:31.980> one<00:03:32.220> because

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
minutes I'll just call that one because

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.430 
minutes I'll just call that one because
it<00:03:32.880> was<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.030> nice<00:03:33.120> for<00:03:33.390> now<00:03:33.450> although<00:03:33.570> chop<00:03:33.900> cuts

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
it was a nice for now although chop cuts

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.130 
it was a nice for now although chop cuts
the<00:03:34.560> defender<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.190> then<00:03:36.180> slices<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.780> into<00:03:36.870> D

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
the defender and then slices it into D

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.810 
the defender and then slices it into D
bot<00:03:37.290> slices<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:38.010> don't<00:03:38.160> slot<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.520> into<00:03:38.610> the

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
bot slices you don't slot it into the

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.600 
bot slices you don't slot it into the
bottom<00:03:39.090> corner<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:40.590> make<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.800> 4-2<00:03:41.040> and<00:03:41.250> that's

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
bottom corner to make it 4-2 and that's

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.610 
bottom corner to make it 4-2 and that's
rounded<00:03:42.360> off<00:03:42.420> a<00:03:42.600> great<00:03:42.840> comeback<00:03:43.140> for<00:03:43.320> us<00:03:43.440> and

got<00:03:56.610> 10<00:03:56.820> games<00:03:57.060> left<00:03:57.300> so<00:03:58.020> where<00:03:58.320> were<00:03:58.380> we<00:03:58.440> can

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
got 10 games left so where were we can

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.949 
got 10 games left so where were we can
through<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:58.950> is<00:03:59.130> a<00:03:59.330> we<00:04:00.330> how<00:04:00.420> it's<00:04:00.570> hard<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:00.780> say

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
through it is a we how it's hard to say

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.380 
through it is a we how it's hard to say
but<00:04:01.620> I<00:04:01.680> don't<00:04:01.830> think<00:04:02.160> I<00:04:02.340> genuinely<00:04:02.550> want<00:04:03.180> to

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
but I don't think I genuinely want to

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.940 
but I don't think I genuinely want to
get<00:04:03.600> to<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.930> playoffs<00:04:04.110> maybe<00:04:04.590> gets<00:04:04.770> Flair

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
get to the playoffs maybe gets Flair

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.530 
get to the playoffs maybe gets Flair
some<00:04:05.130> lose<00:04:05.340> but<00:04:05.640> I<00:04:05.700> don't<00:04:05.880> think<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:06.270> my<00:04:06.330> team

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
some lose but I don't think that my team

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.970 
some lose but I don't think that my team
will<00:04:06.720> be<00:04:06.750> ready<00:04:07.050> for<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.410> premature<00:04:07.560> let's<00:04:07.920> go

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
will be ready for the premature let's go

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.830 
will be ready for the premature let's go
out<00:04:08.070> there<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.610> I<00:04:08.790> think<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.150> would<00:04:09.570> just<00:04:09.720> make

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
out there and I think it would just make

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.840 
out there and I think it would just make
the<00:04:09.989> series<00:04:10.350> pretty<00:04:11.070> much<00:04:11.220> a<00:04:11.459> relegation

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
the series pretty much a relegation

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.250 
the series pretty much a relegation
battle<00:04:12.390> the<00:04:12.480> next<00:04:12.630> season<00:04:12.810> which<00:04:12.930> I<00:04:12.959> guess

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
battle the next season which I guess

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.180 
battle the next season which I guess
they<00:04:13.350> could<00:04:13.470> be<00:04:13.530> quite<00:04:13.650> interesting<00:04:14.010> to<00:04:14.100> watch

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
they could be quite interesting to watch

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.039 
they could be quite interesting to watch
me<00:04:14.430> just<00:04:14.610> battling<00:04:15.269> against<00:04:15.600> teams<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:15.959> it's

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
me just battling against teams and it's

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.840 
me just battling against teams and it's
losing<00:04:16.169> every<00:04:16.530> game<00:04:16.680> but<00:04:17.250> I<00:04:17.310> think<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.669> best

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
losing every game but I think the best

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.270 
losing every game but I think the best
option<00:04:18.060> I<00:04:18.450> want<00:04:18.630> is<00:04:18.810> for<00:04:18.870> me<00:04:19.200> to<00:04:19.320> kind<00:04:20.130> of<00:04:20.160> do

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
option I want is for me to kind of do

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.860 
option I want is for me to kind of do
well<00:04:20.459> in<00:04:20.549> this<00:04:20.640> season<00:04:21.000> just<00:04:21.150> get<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.660> nice

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
well in this season just get a nice

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.480 
well in this season just get a nice
decent<00:04:22.350> finish<00:04:22.800> in<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:22.979> top<00:04:23.130> half<00:04:23.340> of<00:04:23.400> the

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
decent finish in the top half of the

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.520 
decent finish in the top half of the
table<00:04:23.640> possibly<00:04:24.419> not<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.539> playoffs<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.140> then

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
table possibly not the playoffs and then

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.660 
table possibly not the playoffs and then
throughout<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.550> summer<00:04:26.789> will<00:04:27.150> build<00:04:27.390> my

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
good potential so for a letís and they

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.240 
good potential so for a letís and they
can<00:04:37.900> improve<00:04:38.260> and<00:04:38.770> then<00:04:38.860> when<00:04:38.950> I<00:04:38.980> get<00:04:39.130> into

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
season I'll go in there and I have a lot

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.510 
season I'll go in there and I have a lot
of<00:04:43.840> players<00:04:43.990> a<00:04:44.080> lot<00:04:44.200> of<00:04:44.260> potential<00:04:44.530> that<00:04:45.280> would

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
of players a lot of potential that would

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.580 
of players a lot of potential that would
have<00:04:45.610> improved<00:04:46.000> throughout<00:04:46.240> time<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.600> by

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
have improved throughout time and by

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.350 
have improved throughout time and by
that<00:04:47.770> point<00:04:47.950> they<00:04:48.130> may<00:04:48.370> have<00:04:48.970> an<00:04:49.060> overwrite

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
that point they may have an overwrite

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.700 
that point they may have an overwrite
it'd<00:04:49.570> be<00:04:49.630> good<00:04:49.780> enough<00:04:49.990> for<00:04:50.050> me<00:04:50.320> to<00:04:50.560> actually

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
it'd be good enough for me to actually

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.900 
it'd be good enough for me to actually
compete<00:04:51.190> with<00:04:51.430> in<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.610> Premiership

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
compete with in the Premiership

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.210 
compete with in the Premiership

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
obviously if I was to go up via to play

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.950 
obviously if I was to go up via to play
off<00:04:54.370> this<00:04:54.520> season<00:04:54.730> there's<00:04:55.480> no<00:04:55.630> chance<00:04:55.810> my

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.450 
off this season there's no chance my
team<00:04:56.110> would<00:04:56.230> be<00:04:56.290> anywhere<00:04:56.560> near<00:04:56.770> ready<00:04:57.010> and<00:04:57.310> it
