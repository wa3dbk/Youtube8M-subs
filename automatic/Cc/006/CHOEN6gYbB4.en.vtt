before<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:06.210> was<00:01:06.450> even<00:01:06.600> achievable<00:01:07.290> what<00:01:07.799> you

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
before this was even achievable what you

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.370 
before this was even achievable what you
had<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.280> was<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.670> had<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.880> pretty<00:01:09.510> much<00:01:09.720> get

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
had to do was you had to pretty much get

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.100 
had to do was you had to pretty much get
it<00:01:10.500> modded<00:01:10.770> into<00:01:11.159> your<00:01:11.310> game<00:01:11.490> or<00:01:11.990> you<00:01:12.990> could

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
it modded into your game or you could

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.450 
it modded into your game or you could
have<00:01:13.140> had<00:01:13.350> somebody<00:01:13.619> moderate<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.220> then<00:01:14.369> they

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
have had somebody moderate and then they

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.890 
have had somebody moderate and then they
could<00:01:14.610> duplicate<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:15.119> for<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.450> or<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.689> believe

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
could duplicate it for you or I believe

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.420 
could duplicate it for you or I believe
there<00:01:16.259> was<00:01:16.320> another<00:01:16.619> little<00:01:16.950> glitchy<00:01:17.220> could

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
there was another little glitchy could

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.429 
there was another little glitchy could
have<00:01:17.520> done<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.820> get<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.119> into<00:01:18.240> your<00:01:18.360> game<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:19.380> I

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
have done to get it into your game but I

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.100 
have done to get it into your game but I
had<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:19.920> modeled<00:01:20.340> into<00:01:20.520> mine<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:20.960> it<00:01:21.960> was<00:01:22.080> a

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
had it modeled into mine and it was a

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.020 
had it modeled into mine and it was a
rare<00:01:22.470> vehicle<00:01:22.740> which<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.250> why<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.430> used<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.939> in

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
rare vehicle which is why I used it in

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.570 
rare vehicle which is why I used it in
all<00:01:24.270> my<00:01:24.420> videos<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.799> was<00:01:25.890> really<00:01:26.070> cool<00:01:26.369> but

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
all my videos and it was really cool but

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.910 
all my videos and it was really cool but
now<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.939> seems<00:01:26.970> like<00:01:27.509> they<00:01:28.229> want<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.590> kind<00:01:28.799> of

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
now it seems like they want to kind of

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.580 
now it seems like they want to kind of
take<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.939> away<00:01:30.060> from<00:01:30.450> people<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.020> they've

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
take that away from people and they've

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.440 
take that away from people and they've
actually<00:01:31.770> made<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.280> possible<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.880> now<00:01:33.150> have
