than you know an m16 near the FAMAS is

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.469 
than you know an m16 near the FAMAS is
the<00:01:10.740> best<00:01:10.920> gun<00:01:11.100> at<00:01:11.340> cetera<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.360> reality

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the best gun at cetera but in reality

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.429 
the best gun at cetera but in reality
that's<00:01:12.840> not<00:01:13.049> how<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.260> goes

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
that's not how it goes

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.510 
that's not how it goes
in<00:01:13.979> reality<00:01:14.479> um<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:16.470> game<00:01:16.680> guys<00:01:16.920> try<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.280> have

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
in reality um the game guys try to have

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.300 
in reality um the game guys try to have
their<00:01:17.869> their<00:01:18.869> guns<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.650> something<00:01:20.159> in

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
their their guns have something in

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.340 
their their guns have something in
common<00:01:20.340> with<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.299> real-life<00:01:21.509> guns<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.259> know

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
common with the real-life guns you know

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.020 
common with the real-life guns you know
oftentimes<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.130> rate<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.430> fire<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.640> stuff

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
oftentimes the rate of fire and stuff

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.660 
oftentimes the rate of fire and stuff
like<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.540> accurate<00:01:24.990> but<00:01:25.619> they<00:01:26.159> also<00:01:26.310> make

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
like that is accurate but they also make

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.550 
like that is accurate but they also make
changes<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.299> gun<00:01:27.450> compared<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.259> real<00:01:28.409> life

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
changes to the gun compared to real life

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.429 
changes to the gun compared to real life
so<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:30.240> guns<00:01:30.420> are<00:01:30.540> balanced<00:01:30.990> right<00:01:31.110> and

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
so that the guns are balanced right and

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.550 
so that the guns are balanced right and
if<00:01:31.829> they<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.340> really<00:01:32.670> well<00:01:32.850> then<00:01:33.810> every

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
if they do this really well then every

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.230 
if they do this really well then every
gun<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:35.130> sort<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.430> perfect<00:01:35.820> for<00:01:36.000> its<00:01:36.119> own

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
m16 which in real life pretty similar

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.490

gun<00:01:55.610> in<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.750> game<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.110> know<00:01:58.200> they<00:01:58.320> can

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
gun in in the game you know they can

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.969 
gun in in the game you know they can
behave<00:01:58.619> very<00:01:58.890> differently<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.759> I<00:01:59.790> think<00:02:00.000> I

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
behave very differently so I think I

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:07.029 
behave very differently so I think I
might<00:02:01.979> be<00:02:02.390> getting<00:02:03.390> pretty<00:02:03.509> close<00:02:04.820> alright<00:02:06.020> so

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
might be getting pretty close alright so

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.350 
might be getting pretty close alright so
now<00:02:08.039> what<00:02:08.190> you've<00:02:08.340> seen<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.729> I've<00:02:08.879> cut<00:02:09.119> through

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
now what you've seen is I've cut through

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.210 
now what you've seen is I've cut through
what<00:02:09.840> was<00:02:09.989> called<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.319> casing<00:02:10.709> right<00:02:11.009> this

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
what was called the casing right this

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.309 
what was called the casing right this
green<00:02:11.459> part<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.120> case<00:02:12.390> around<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:13.050> shotgun

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
green part is the case around a shotgun

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.010 
green part is the case around a shotgun
shell

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
shell

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:24.300 
shell
and<00:02:14.530> if<00:02:15.160> I<00:02:15.280> open<00:02:15.490> this<00:02:15.730> up<00:02:19.320> come<00:02:20.320> on<00:02:20.440> they<00:02:23.310> in

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
and if I open this up come on they in

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.260 
and if I open this up come on they in
this<00:02:24.490> case<00:02:25.110> there<00:02:26.110> are<00:02:26.260> nine<00:02:26.530> pellets<00:02:27.490> or<00:02:27.880> bb's

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
this case there are nine pellets or bb's

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.250 
this case there are nine pellets or bb's
I<00:02:28.450> think<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.780> there's<00:02:28.960> what<00:02:29.140> they're

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
I think that there's what they're

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.050 
I think that there's what they're
actually<00:02:29.620> called<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.490> hopefully<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:30.940> can

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
actually called and hopefully you can

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.090 
actually called and hopefully you can
see<00:02:31.300> these<00:02:31.450> okay<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.410> these<00:02:32.620> are<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.890> things

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
see these okay and these are the things

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.220 
see these okay and these are the things
that<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.700> do<00:02:33.820> the<00:02:33.970> hurting<00:02:34.300> right<00:02:34.630> they're

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
that that do the hurting right they're

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.660 
that that do the hurting right they're
kind<00:02:35.410> of<00:02:35.470> like<00:02:35.590> little<00:02:35.650> musket<00:02:36.130> balls<00:02:36.340> and

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
kind of like little musket balls and

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.570 
kind of like little musket balls and
when<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.510> shoot<00:02:37.690> they<00:02:37.870> spray<00:02:38.200> out<00:02:38.580> depending

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
when you shoot they spray out depending

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.010 
when you shoot they spray out depending
on<00:02:39.700> how<00:02:39.820> far<00:02:40.090> you<00:02:40.150> are<00:02:40.450> but<00:02:40.690> let's<00:02:40.840> say

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
on how far you are but let's say

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.320 
on how far you are but let's say
something<00:02:41.290> like<00:02:41.560> 10<00:02:41.830> 20<00:02:42.040> yards<00:02:42.490> they'll<00:02:43.120> spray

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
something like 10 20 yards they'll spray

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.530 
something like 10 20 yards they'll spray
out<00:02:43.510> in<00:02:43.750> a<00:02:43.840> little<00:02:44.320> hole<00:02:44.590> like<00:02:44.770> that<00:02:44.920> big<00:02:45.130> and

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
out in a little hole like that big and

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.970 
out in a little hole like that big and
in<00:02:46.540> each<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.750> these<00:02:46.960> things<00:02:47.260> weighs<00:02:47.500> like

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
in each of these things weighs like

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.680 
in each of these things weighs like
almost<00:02:48.310> as<00:02:48.520> much<00:02:48.640> as<00:02:48.850> I<00:02:48.940> can<00:02:49.000> I'm<00:02:49.270> millimeter

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
almost as much as I can I'm millimeter

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.930 
almost as much as I can I'm millimeter
bullet<00:02:50.470> does<00:02:50.650> but<00:02:51.400> they<00:02:51.490> don't<00:02:51.640> get<00:02:51.730> shot

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
bullet does but they don't get shot

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.820 
bullet does but they don't get shot
quite<00:02:52.180> as<00:02:52.300> fast<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:53.110> those<00:02:53.320> are<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.650> things

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
quite as fast so those are the things

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.230 
quite as fast so those are the things
that<00:02:53.920> do<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.220> hurting<00:02:54.520> and<00:02:55.060> then<00:02:55.210> in<00:02:55.450> here

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
that do the hurting and then in here

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.890 
that do the hurting and then in here

this is the wad so you could actually

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.140 
this is the wad so you could actually
and<00:03:02.440> some<00:03:02.620> people<00:03:02.860> do<00:03:03.010> this<00:03:03.160> put<00:03:03.730> anything<00:03:03.910> in

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
little bit packed there we go

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.390 
little bit packed there we go
there's<00:03:47.680> more<00:03:48.870> so<00:03:49.870> this<00:03:50.110> gunpowder<00:03:50.590> was

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
there's more so this gunpowder was

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.180 
there's more so this gunpowder was
behind<00:03:51.760> this<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:53.530> thing<00:03:53.800> here<00:03:54.040> is<00:03:54.160> a

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
behind this and this thing here is a

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.400 
behind this and this thing here is a
primer<00:03:54.550> we<00:03:54.970> don't<00:03:55.120> know<00:03:55.240> if<00:03:55.540> I'll<00:03:55.690> be<00:03:55.840> able<00:03:55.930> if

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
primer we don't know if I'll be able if

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:57.990 
primer we don't know if I'll be able if
you'll<00:03:56.530> be<00:03:56.650> able<00:03:56.890> to<00:03:57.010> see<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.370> primer<00:03:57.700> very

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
you'll be able to see the primer very

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.440 
you'll be able to see the primer very
well<00:03:58.320> but<00:03:59.550> what<00:04:00.550> happens<00:04:00.880> is<00:04:01.000> if<00:04:01.120> you<00:04:01.150> tap

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
well but what happens is if you tap

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.810 
well but what happens is if you tap
right<00:04:01.720> here<00:04:02.020> it<00:04:02.620> creates<00:04:02.980> a<00:04:03.160> small<00:04:03.490> little

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
right here it creates a small little

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.630 
right here it creates a small little
explosion<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:04.630> then<00:04:05.410> that<00:04:05.620> sets<00:04:06.430> this

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
explosion and then that sets this

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.220 
explosion and then that sets this
gunpowder<00:04:07.150> off<00:04:07.420> which<00:04:07.660> creates<00:04:07.960> a<00:04:08.020> bigger

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
gunpowder off which creates a bigger

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.190 
gunpowder off which creates a bigger
explosion<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:09.240> then<00:04:10.240> that<00:04:10.420> launches<00:04:10.959> this

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
explosion and then that launches this

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.070 
explosion and then that launches this
forward<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:12.190> whatever's<00:04:12.730> in<00:04:12.760> this<00:04:13.080> goes

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
forward and whatever's in this goes

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.770 
forward and whatever's in this goes
shooting<00:04:14.560> at<00:04:14.740> you<00:04:15.040> know<00:04:15.150> hopefully<00:04:16.150> a<00:04:16.359> bad<00:04:16.540> guy

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
shooting at you know hopefully a bad guy

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.229 
shooting at you know hopefully a bad guy
or<00:04:17.080> in<00:04:17.739> my<00:04:17.890> case<00:04:17.950> usually<00:04:18.340> like<00:04:18.670> a<00:04:18.700> piece<00:04:19.120> of

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
or in my case usually like a piece of

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.660 
or in my case usually like a piece of
paper<00:04:19.390> that's<00:04:19.920> that's<00:04:20.920> what<00:04:21.070> I<00:04:21.100> tend<00:04:21.370> to<00:04:21.459> shoot

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
paper that's that's what I tend to shoot

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.570 
paper that's that's what I tend to shoot
so<00:04:22.390> on<00:04:22.600> so<00:04:23.320> this<00:04:23.440> is<00:04:23.500> how<00:04:23.770> a<00:04:24.010> shotgun<00:04:24.280> shell

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
so on so this is how a shotgun shell

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.670 
so on so this is how a shotgun shell
works<00:04:24.820> and<00:04:25.150> I<00:04:25.750> thought<00:04:26.050> you<00:04:26.229> know<00:04:26.260> maybe<00:04:26.530> they

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
works and I thought you know maybe they

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.870 
works and I thought you know maybe they
were

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
were

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.610 
were
some<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.240> you<00:04:27.360> who've<00:04:28.020> never<00:04:28.170> seen<00:04:28.500> this

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
some of you who've never seen this

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.130 
some of you who've never seen this
before<00:04:28.800> and<00:04:29.480> and<00:04:30.480> it<00:04:30.600> would<00:04:30.660> capture<00:04:30.900> your

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
before and and it would capture your

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.710 
before and and it would capture your
interest<00:04:31.290> and<00:04:31.910> you<00:04:32.910> know<00:04:32.970> if<00:04:33.180> you're<00:04:33.330> if

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
interest and you know if you're if

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.450 
interest and you know if you're if

hope you guys like this and let's get
onto<00:04:58.650> some<00:04:58.860> gameplay<00:05:01.790> hey<00:05:02.790> guys<00:05:02.970> so<00:05:03.240> the

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
onto some gameplay hey guys so the

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.730 
onto some gameplay hey guys so the
original<00:05:03.570> idea<00:05:03.810> for<00:05:04.050> this<00:05:04.290> was<00:05:04.500> to<00:05:04.620> have

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
original idea for this was to have

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.440 
original idea for this was to have
shotgun<00:05:05.220> gameplay<00:05:05.610> like<00:05:05.760> a<00:05:05.790> real<00:05:06.000> short<00:05:06.240> thing

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
shotgun gameplay like a real short thing

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.940 
shotgun gameplay like a real short thing
but<00:05:06.810> since<00:05:06.990> I<00:05:07.050> didn't<00:05:07.260> have<00:05:07.290> any<00:05:07.560> I<00:05:07.620> use<00:05:07.800> this

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
but since I didn't have any I use this

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.010 
but since I didn't have any I use this
gun<00:05:08.460> game<00:05:08.670> stuff<00:05:08.940> where<00:05:09.180> I<00:05:09.210> use<00:05:09.450> all<00:05:09.660> kinds<00:05:09.990> of

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
gun game stuff where I use all kinds of

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.330 
gun game stuff where I use all kinds of
rounds<00:05:10.320> and<00:05:10.410> let's<00:05:10.560> talk<00:05:10.710> about<00:05:10.920> all<00:05:11.040> kinds<00:05:11.310> of

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
rounds and let's talk about all kinds of

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.850 
rounds and let's talk about all kinds of
guns<00:05:11.490> so<00:05:11.730> shotguns<00:05:12.690> are<00:05:12.840> a<00:05:12.870> lot<00:05:13.170> more<00:05:13.200> deadly

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
guns so shotguns are a lot more deadly

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.560 
guns so shotguns are a lot more deadly
in<00:05:13.890> real<00:05:14.310> life<00:05:14.490> than<00:05:14.730> they<00:05:14.850> are<00:05:14.880> in<00:05:15.300> the<00:05:15.420> game

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
in real life than they are in the game

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.760 
in real life than they are in the game
right<00:05:15.750> shotguns<00:05:16.110> are<00:05:16.230> actually<00:05:16.500> one<00:05:16.620> of<00:05:16.650> the

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
right shotguns are actually one of the

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.190 
right shotguns are actually one of the
deadliest<00:05:17.070> things<00:05:17.340> you'll<00:05:17.520> find<00:05:17.790> and<00:05:18.200> it

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
deadliest things you'll find and it

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.500 
deadliest things you'll find and it
turns<00:05:19.500> out<00:05:19.680> that<00:05:19.740> the<00:05:20.190> the<00:05:20.520> reason<00:05:20.820> they<00:05:20.940> don't

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
turns out that the the reason they don't

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.300 
turns out that the the reason they don't
use<00:05:21.870> shotguns<00:05:22.350> like<00:05:22.530> they<00:05:22.770> are<00:05:22.920> in<00:05:23.010> real<00:05:23.160> life

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
use shotguns like they are in real life

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.350 
use shotguns like they are in real life
in<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.460> game<00:05:23.640> is<00:05:23.760> because<00:05:23.910> that<00:05:24.060> wouldn't<00:05:24.300> be

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
in the game is because that wouldn't be

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.150 
in the game is because that wouldn't be
any<00:05:24.480> fun<00:05:24.600> shopkins<00:05:25.140> would<00:05:25.260> just<00:05:25.410> be<00:05:25.560> like

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160

bullets than they use in modern times
and<00:05:56.540> what<00:05:57.540> happened<00:05:57.870> was<00:05:58.220> the<00:05:59.220> US<00:05:59.460> Army<00:05:59.790> they

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
and what happened was the US Army they

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.730 
and what happened was the US Army they
did<00:06:00.060> this<00:06:00.180> study<00:06:00.270> and<00:06:00.510> they<00:06:00.750> decided<00:06:01.080> that<00:06:01.230> the

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
did this study and they decided that the

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.320 
did this study and they decided that the
the<00:06:02.010> bullets<00:06:02.220> that<00:06:02.430> the<00:06:02.820> Americans<00:06:03.210> were

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
the bullets that the Americans were

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.570 
the bullets that the Americans were
carrying<00:06:03.750> were<00:06:03.900> too<00:06:04.080> big<00:06:04.290> so<00:06:04.860> a<00:06:04.890> typical

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
carrying were too big so a typical

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.310 
carrying were too big so a typical
American<00:06:06.000> was<00:06:06.120> carrying<00:06:06.510> something<00:06:06.870> like<00:06:07.050> I

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
American was carrying something like I

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.810 
American was carrying something like I
don't<00:06:07.650> know<00:06:07.890> I'll<00:06:08.040> make<00:06:08.160> up<00:06:08.310> a<00:06:08.400> number<00:06:08.700> you

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
don't know I'll make up a number you

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.910 
don't know I'll make up a number you
know<00:06:08.910> a<00:06:08.940> hundred<00:06:09.300> rounds<00:06:09.870> of<00:06:09.990> extra<00:06:10.410> ammo<00:06:10.560> on

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:10.920 
know a hundred rounds of extra ammo on

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.410 
know a hundred rounds of extra ammo on
them<00:06:11.070> as<00:06:11.190> they<00:06:11.520> went<00:06:11.730> through<00:06:11.910> the<00:06:12.000> woods<00:06:12.180> and

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:12.420 
them as they went through the woods and

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.990 
them as they went through the woods and
fought<00:06:13.050> and<00:06:13.320> they<00:06:13.980> figured<00:06:14.520> out<00:06:14.640> like<00:06:14.850> you

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
fought and they figured out like you

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.460 
fought and they figured out like you
know<00:06:15.120> what<00:06:15.360> if<00:06:15.600> they<00:06:15.810> have<00:06:15.990> this<00:06:16.170> smaller

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
know what if they have this smaller

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.990 
know what if they have this smaller
round<00:06:16.770> the<00:06:16.920> smaller<00:06:17.220> bullet<00:06:17.610> then<00:06:17.760> they<00:06:17.850> can

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
round the smaller bullet then they can

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.640 
round the smaller bullet then they can
carry<00:06:18.210> 200<00:06:18.810> rounds<00:06:18.960> and<00:06:19.290> they<00:06:19.500> eventually

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
carry 200 rounds and they eventually

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.380 
carry 200 rounds and they eventually
discovered<00:06:20.370> like<00:06:20.520> you<00:06:20.880> know<00:06:21.000> what<00:06:21.210> a

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:21.390 
discovered like you know what a

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.530 
discovered like you know what a
seven-man<00:06:22.200> team<00:06:22.530> of<00:06:22.950> Marines<00:06:23.280> can<00:06:24.120> be<00:06:24.330> as

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540 
seven-man team of Marines can be as

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.570 
seven-man team of Marines can be as
effective<00:06:25.020> as<00:06:25.140> a<00:06:25.200> 12-man<00:06:25.890> team<00:06:26.130> of<00:06:26.310> Marines

effective as a 12-man team of Marines
you<00:06:26.820> know<00:06:26.910> using<00:06:27.420> the<00:06:27.720> bigger<00:06:27.900> fatter<00:06:28.170> bullet

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
you know using the bigger fatter bullet

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.350 
you know using the bigger fatter bullet
why<00:06:28.860> because<00:06:29.400> they<00:06:29.520> can<00:06:29.640> carry<00:06:29.850> more<00:06:30.060> they<00:06:30.210> can

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
why because they can carry more they can

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.390 
why because they can carry more they can
have<00:06:30.510> a<00:06:30.540> higher<00:06:30.810> sustained<00:06:31.380> rate<00:06:32.190> of<00:06:32.250> fire

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
have a higher sustained rate of fire

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.710 
have a higher sustained rate of fire
look<00:06:32.760> I'd<00:06:32.850> even<00:06:33.000> know<00:06:33.120> this<00:06:33.180> guy<00:06:33.450> in<00:06:33.540> the<00:06:33.600> room

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 
look I'd even know this guy in the room

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.540 
look I'd even know this guy in the room
with<00:06:33.870> me<00:06:33.960> I'm<00:06:34.470> baking<00:06:34.680> higher<00:06:34.950> have<00:06:35.310> a<00:06:35.340> higher

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
with me I'm baking higher have a higher

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:36.830 
with me I'm baking higher have a higher
sustained<00:06:35.940> rate<00:06:36.060> of<00:06:36.120> fire<00:06:36.360> they<00:06:36.570> can<00:06:36.720> get

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840 
sustained rate of fire they can get

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.210 
sustained rate of fire they can get
you'll<00:06:36.990> carry<00:06:37.229> more<00:06:37.440> bullets<00:06:37.740> they<00:06:37.860> can<00:06:38.040> shoot

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
you'll carry more bullets they can shoot

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.370 
you'll carry more bullets they can shoot
more<00:06:38.460> if<00:06:38.850> you<00:06:39.030> picture<00:06:39.390> like<00:06:39.600> an<00:06:39.750> enemy<00:06:40.080> force

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
more if you picture like an enemy force

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.010 
more if you picture like an enemy force
trying<00:06:40.590> to<00:06:40.740> overrun<00:06:41.310> seven<00:06:42.300> guys<00:06:42.450> sort<00:06:42.750> of<00:06:42.840> dug

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
trying to overrun seven guys sort of dug

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.690 
trying to overrun seven guys sort of dug
in<00:06:43.200> in<00:06:43.320> the<00:06:43.410> woods<00:06:43.620> then<00:06:44.220> they're<00:06:44.400> gonna<00:06:44.490> have

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:44.700 
in in the woods then they're gonna have

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.190 
in in the woods then they're gonna have
a<00:06:44.730> huge<00:06:45.030> advantage<00:06:45.150> if<00:06:45.540> they<00:06:45.570> can<00:06:45.780> carry<00:06:45.990> more

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:46.200 
a huge advantage if they can carry more

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.170 
a huge advantage if they can carry more
around<00:06:46.470> so<00:06:46.680> they<00:06:46.830> shrunk<00:06:47.190> the<00:06:47.490> the<00:06:47.820> round<00:06:48.000> that

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.180 
around so they shrunk the the round that

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.210 
around so they shrunk the the round that
they<00:06:48.330> carried<00:06:48.690> to<00:06:49.170> the<00:06:49.350> two<00:06:49.470> to<00:06:49.650> three<00:06:49.920> which

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 
they carried to the two to three which

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.970 
they carried to the two to three which
is<00:06:50.340> a<00:06:50.370> smaller<00:06:51.150> thing<00:06:51.620> take<00:06:52.620> that<00:06:52.800> to<00:06:52.950> the

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:52.980 
is a smaller thing take that to the

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.500 
is a smaller thing take that to the
extreme<00:06:53.070> and<00:06:53.760> say<00:06:53.940> you<00:06:54.000> know<00:06:54.150> why<00:06:54.270> doesn't

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:54.510 
extreme and say you know why doesn't

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.150 
extreme and say you know why doesn't
everyone<00:06:54.660> carry<00:06:54.960> shotguns<00:06:55.410> if<00:06:55.650> shotguns<00:06:56.040> are
