what<00:00:03.030> would<00:00:03.149> you<00:00:03.210> say<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.600> the<00:00:03.870> significance

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
what would you say the the significance

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.320 
what would you say the the significance
of<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:04.950> new<00:00:05.100> motorsport<00:00:05.640> from<00:00:05.910> your<00:00:06.060> point<00:00:06.270> of

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
of the new motorsport from your point of

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.419 
of the new motorsport from your point of
view<00:00:06.390> very<00:00:06.660> significant<00:00:07.470> on<00:00:07.620> two<00:00:07.890> levels

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
view very significant on two levels

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.070 
view very significant on two levels
first<00:00:08.700> on<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.000> motor<00:00:09.150> racing<00:00:09.510> side<00:00:09.690> clearly

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
first on the motor racing side clearly

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.330 
first on the motor racing side clearly
it's<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> new<00:00:10.410> technology<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:11.010> people<00:00:11.160> are

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
it's a new technology and people are

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.919 
it's a new technology and people are
getting<00:00:11.429> very<00:00:11.730> excited<00:00:12.030> about<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.300> on<00:00:12.840> the

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
getting very excited about it on the

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.030 
getting very excited about it on the
second<00:00:13.170> level<00:00:13.290> it's<00:00:13.530> about<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.830> automotive

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
second level it's about the automotive

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.980 
second level it's about the automotive
industry<00:00:14.250> as<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.610> whole<00:00:14.880> clearly<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:15.929> a

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
industry as a whole clearly this is a

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.750 
industry as a whole clearly this is a
new<00:00:16.109> technology<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:16.619> you<00:00:17.039> know<00:00:17.160> we<00:00:17.279> all<00:00:17.400> we

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
new technology that you know we all we

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.730 
new technology that you know we all we
are<00:00:17.789> all<00:00:18.000> going<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.240> drive<00:00:18.449> very<00:00:18.630> soon<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.109> we

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
are all going to drive very soon and we

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.220 
are all going to drive very soon and we
need<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.330> motor<00:00:21.330> racing<00:00:21.660> will<00:00:21.810> drive<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
need to motor racing will drive the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.040 
need to motor racing will drive the
innovation<00:00:22.740> for<00:00:22.890> those<00:00:23.010> cows<00:00:23.390> how<00:00:24.390> fast<00:00:24.779> will

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
innovation for those cows how fast will

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.779 
innovation for those cows how fast will
they<00:00:25.260> be<00:00:25.320> able<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.680> go<00:00:25.890> well<00:00:26.340> they<00:00:26.490> go<00:00:26.609> very

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
they be able to go well they go very

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.099 
they be able to go well they go very
fast<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.210> mean<00:00:27.330> that's<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.539> thing<00:00:27.720> it's<00:00:27.869> quite

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
fast I mean that's the thing it's quite

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.419 
fast I mean that's the thing it's quite
easy<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.349> make<00:00:28.590> an<00:00:28.680> electric<00:00:28.859> car<00:00:29.099> go<00:00:29.250> very

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
easy to make an electric car go very

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.429 
easy to make an electric car go very
fast<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.849> fastest<00:00:30.150> car<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.539> goes<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.779> 280

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
fast the fastest car we have goes to 280

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.680 
fast the fastest car we have goes to 280
km<00:00:31.800> eases<00:00:32.040> power<00:00:32.250> which<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.730> really<00:00:32.969> quick<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
km eases power which is really quick the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.120 
km eases power which is really quick the
challenge<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.200> far<00:00:34.410> has<00:00:34.530> been<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.710> make<00:00:34.950> them

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
challenge so far has been to make them

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.920 
challenge so far has been to make them
last<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.880> make<00:00:36.030> them<00:00:36.149> go<00:00:36.329> fast<00:00:36.540> for<00:00:36.719> quite<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
last and make them go fast for quite a

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.780 
last and make them go fast for quite a
long<00:00:37.050> time<00:00:37.110> but<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> latest<00:00:37.739> batteries<00:00:38.219> allow

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
long time but the latest batteries allow

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.940 
long time but the latest batteries allow
us<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.030> do<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.270> now<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.410> problems

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
us to do that now one of the problems

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.160 
us to do that now one of the problems
that<00:00:41.040> motorsport<00:00:41.700> does<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.050> is

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
that motorsport does have is that it is

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.290 
that motorsport does have is that it is
noisy<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.710> course<00:00:43.950> now<00:00:44.219> if<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.149> have

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
noisy of course now if you can have

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.389 
noisy of course now if you can have
racing<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.050> wire<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:46.950> much<00:00:47.129> quieter

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
racing that is wire it's much quieter

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.520 
racing that is wire it's much quieter
than<00:00:47.700> traditional<00:00:48.180> racing<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.930> perhaps<00:00:49.140> that

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
than traditional racing and perhaps that

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.380 
than traditional racing and perhaps that
spreads<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.430> hours<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.239> have

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
spreads the the hours that you can have

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.580 
spreads the the hours that you can have
racing<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.170> forth

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
racing and so forth

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.290 
racing and so forth
normally<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.460> finish<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.879> maybe<00:00:54.000> six

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
normally we have to finish it maybe six

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.119 
normally we have to finish it maybe six
o'clock<00:00:54.690> or<00:00:54.840> something<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.440> maybe<00:00:55.920> we

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
o'clock or something like that maybe we

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.459 
o'clock or something like that maybe we
could<00:00:56.250> do<00:00:56.399> some<00:00:56.640> evening<00:00:56.969> events<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:58.170> maybe

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
could do some evening events and maybe

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.680 
could do some evening events and maybe
we<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.800> use<00:00:58.949> other<00:00:59.219> circuits<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.030> facilities

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
we can use other circuits and facilities

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.990 
we can use other circuits and facilities
that<00:01:01.379> are<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:01.829> not<00:01:02.010> able<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.430> be<00:01:02.520> used<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
that are just not able to be used in the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.030 
that are just not able to be used in the
moment<00:01:03.329> street<00:01:03.809> circuits<00:01:04.290> things<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:04.799> that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
moment street circuits things like that

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.359 
moment street circuits things like that
so<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.700> opens<00:01:06.210> doors<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:07.280> widens<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
so it opens doors and widens the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.190 
so it opens doors and widens the
possibility<00:01:09.060> that's<00:01:09.570> good<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:09.930> everyone

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
possibility that's good for everyone

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.080 
possibility that's good for everyone
we've<00:01:11.040> looked<00:01:11.250> at<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.520> terms<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
we've looked at this in terms of a

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.120 
we've looked at this in terms of a
five-year<00:01:12.479> plan<00:01:12.750> that's<00:01:13.409> as<00:01:13.590> close<00:01:13.770> as<00:01:13.830> we've

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
five-year plan that's as close as we've

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.920 
five-year plan that's as close as we've
got<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.460> terms<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.909> time<00:01:15.090> scale<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.689> think

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
got in terms of the time scale I think

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.810 
got in terms of the time scale I think
realistically<00:01:16.560> what<00:01:17.009> our<00:01:17.520> immediate

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
realistically what our immediate

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.880 
realistically what our immediate
intention<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.960> establish<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:19.860> a

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
intention is to is establish this as a

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.300 
intention is to is establish this as a
serious<00:01:20.390> motorsports<00:01:21.390> event<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.710> widen

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
serious motorsports event and to widen

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.609 
serious motorsports event and to widen
the<00:01:23.549> appeal<00:01:23.850> as<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.150> say<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.689> general<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
the appeal as you say to a general a

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.230 
the appeal as you say to a general a
wider<00:01:26.040> general<00:01:26.430> selection<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.909> public

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
wider general selection of the public

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.630 
wider general selection of the public
and<00:01:27.479> also<00:01:28.290> just<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.710> do<00:01:28.860> what<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.250> was<00:01:29.460> set

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
and also just to do what this was set

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.670 
and also just to do what this was set
out<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.909> do<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.210> that's<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.509> make<00:01:30.680> electric

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
out to do and that's to make electric

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.740 
out to do and that's to make electric
cars<00:01:31.950> more<00:01:32.340> credible<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:32.850> more<00:01:33.150> sexy<00:01:33.540> in

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
cars more credible and more sexy in

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.929 
cars more credible and more sexy in
terms<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.530> speed<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.860> think<00:01:35.040> we'll<00:01:35.700> really<00:01:35.820> be

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
terms of speed I think we'll really be

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.730 
terms of speed I think we'll really be
able<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.329> match<00:01:36.540> its<00:01:36.990> additional<00:01:37.200> motor

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
able to match its additional motor

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.410 
able to match its additional motor
racing<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.250> shouldn't<00:01:38.490> be<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.579> problem<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.090> you

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
racing it shouldn't be a problem and you

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.580 
racing it shouldn't be a problem and you
can<00:01:39.540> already<00:01:39.689> see<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.110> some<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.439> road

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
can already see that in some of the road

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.319 
can already see that in some of the road
cars<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.130> Tesla<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.090> some<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
cars like the Tesla and and some of the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.899 
cars like the Tesla and and some of the
other<00:01:42.420> ones<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.689> GM<00:01:43.079> Ferrari<00:01:43.649> are<00:01:44.640> getting

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
other ones that GM Ferrari are getting

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.359 
other ones that GM Ferrari are getting
involved<00:01:45.270> with<00:01:45.329> electric<00:01:45.750> power<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.799> it

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
involved with electric power and it

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.030 
involved with electric power and it
really<00:01:47.579> won't<00:01:47.700> take<00:01:47.820> long<00:01:48.110> before<00:01:49.110> there's<00:01:49.979> an

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
really won't take long before there's an

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.130 
really won't take long before there's an
identical<00:01:50.460> match<00:01:50.640> at<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.420> moment<00:01:51.720> if<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.930> if

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
identical match at the moment if you if

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.330 
identical match at the moment if you if
you<00:01:52.229> put<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> straight<00:01:52.680> petrol<00:01:53.009> against<00:01:53.220> a

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
you put a straight petrol against a

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.179 
you put a straight petrol against a
straight<00:01:53.520> electric<00:01:54.479> powered<00:01:54.899> car<00:01:55.200> maybe<00:01:56.040> the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
straight electric powered car maybe the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.249 
straight electric powered car maybe the
top<00:01:56.369> speed<00:01:56.700> won't<00:01:56.939> be<00:01:57.119> quite<00:01:57.509> there<00:01:57.750> but<00:01:57.810> we're

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
top speed won't be quite there but we're

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.480 
top speed won't be quite there but we're
already<00:01:58.439> talking<00:01:58.590> about<00:01:58.770> speeds<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.369> nearly

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
already talking about speeds of nearly

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.069 
already talking about speeds of nearly
300<00:02:00.030> kilometres<00:02:00.600> an<00:02:00.659> hour

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
300 kilometres an hour

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.170 
300 kilometres an hour
so<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:01.890> plenty<00:02:02.219> fast<00:02:02.399> enough<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.909> hold<00:02:03.060> a

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
so it's plenty fast enough to hold a

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.200 
so it's plenty fast enough to hold a
motor<00:02:03.540> race<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.020> it's<00:02:04.140> faster<00:02:04.560> than<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.950> know

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
motor race and it's faster than you know

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.549 
motor race and it's faster than you know
60%<00:02:05.479> of<00:02:05.930> existing<00:02:06.500> petrol<00:02:07.220> racing
