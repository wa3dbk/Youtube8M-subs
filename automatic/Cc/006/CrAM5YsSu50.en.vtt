great show awesome awesome uh look at

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.339 
great show awesome awesome uh look at
this<00:00:23.800> base<00:00:24.070> you<00:00:24.279> got<00:00:24.340> like<00:00:24.609> a<00:00:24.640> a<00:00:26.250> bass<00:00:27.250> guitar

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
this base you got like a a bass guitar

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.859 
this base you got like a a bass guitar
playing<00:00:29.349> through<00:00:29.560> eventide<00:00:29.949> stompboxes<00:00:30.869> so

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
playing through eventide stompboxes so

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.020 
playing through eventide stompboxes so
we<00:00:32.410> have<00:00:32.589> a<00:00:32.619> couple<00:00:32.890> new<00:00:33.129> things<00:00:33.160> this<00:00:33.519> year<00:00:33.699> at

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
we have a couple new things this year at

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.149 
we have a couple new things this year at
Eventide<00:00:34.890> namm<00:00:35.890> 2014<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:37.300> h<00:00:37.449> nine<00:00:37.750> core<00:00:38.530> it

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:39.159 
Eventide namm 2014 the h nine core it

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:42.060 
Eventide namm 2014 the h nine core it
looks<00:00:39.820> the<00:00:39.940> same<00:00:40.120> as<00:00:40.299> the<00:00:40.420> h<00:00:40.540> nine<00:00:40.979> but<00:00:41.979> the

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
looks the same as the h nine but the

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.369 
looks the same as the h nine but the
difference<00:00:42.370> is<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:43.629> a<00:00:43.720> hundred<00:00:43.930> dollars

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
difference is it's a hundred dollars

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.140 
difference is it's a hundred dollars
less<00:00:45.369> and<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:47.350> only<00:00:47.470> comes<00:00:47.799> with<00:00:48.150> one

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:49.150 
less and it only comes with one

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.700 
less and it only comes with one
algorithm<00:00:49.479> and<00:00:49.930> one<00:00:50.229> algorithm<00:00:50.710> coupon<00:00:51.540> so

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
algorithm and one algorithm coupon so

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.219 
algorithm and one algorithm coupon so
it's<00:00:53.710> a<00:00:54.150> less<00:00:55.150> expensive<00:00:55.479> way<00:00:55.720> to<00:00:55.869> get<00:00:56.080> into

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:56.229 
it's a less expensive way to get into

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:59.009 
it's a less expensive way to get into
the<00:00:56.440> h<00:00:56.559> nine<00:00:56.860> format<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:57.760> of<00:00:58.000> course<00:00:58.030> you<00:00:58.809> can

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
the h nine format and of course you can

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.090 
the h nine format and of course you can
go<00:00:59.379> in<00:00:59.559> the<00:00:59.909> app<00:01:00.909> store<00:01:00.939> and<00:01:01.720> try<00:01:02.680> out<00:01:02.830> an

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
go in the app store and try out an

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.520 
go in the app store and try out an
audition<00:01:03.369> and<00:01:03.610> purchase<00:01:04.059> new<00:01:04.750> algorithms<00:01:05.290> for

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
audition and purchase new algorithms for

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.050 
audition and purchase new algorithms for
it<00:01:05.650> so<00:01:05.770> you<00:01:05.860> can<00:01:05.979> completely<00:01:06.369> customize<00:01:06.580> it

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
it so you can completely customize it

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.270 
it so you can completely customize it
from<00:01:07.180> the<00:01:07.270> ground<00:01:07.360> up<00:01:07.630> and<00:01:07.840> that<00:01:08.530> came<00:01:08.830> from<00:01:09.100> a

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
from the ground up and that came from a

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.120 
from the ground up and that came from a
request<00:01:09.670> from<00:01:09.790> a<00:01:09.939> lot<00:01:10.090> of<00:01:10.390> our<00:01:10.869> customers<00:01:11.130> who

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
request from a lot of our customers who

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.399 
request from a lot of our customers who
said<00:01:12.369> well<00:01:12.549> can't<00:01:12.820> we<00:01:12.909> just<00:01:13.060> get<00:01:13.409> essentially

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
said well can't we just get essentially

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.190 
said well can't we just get essentially
an<00:01:14.500> empty<00:01:14.920> h9<00:01:15.880> and<00:01:17.700> start<00:01:18.700> from<00:01:19.060> scratch<00:01:19.200> in

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
an empty h9 and start from scratch in

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.770 
an empty h9 and start from scratch in
terms<00:01:20.679> of<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:21.340> algorithms<00:01:21.789> that<00:01:21.999> it<00:01:22.270> contains

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
terms of the algorithms that it contains

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.090 
terms of the algorithms that it contains
so<00:01:23.409> that's<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.679> h<00:01:23.770> nine<00:01:23.979> core<00:01:24.219> and<00:01:25.679> we<00:01:26.679> have<00:01:26.829> a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
so that's the h nine core and we have a

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.520 
so that's the h nine core and we have a
couple<00:01:27.670> new<00:01:27.789> other<00:01:28.119> cool<00:01:28.689> things<00:01:29.969> we<00:01:30.969> have<00:01:31.530> the
