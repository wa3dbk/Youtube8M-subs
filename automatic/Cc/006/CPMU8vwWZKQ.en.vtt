00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 that's the case anyway it's for example 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.450
 2000 gt and today we find ourselves for 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.040
 a little video tutorials and yes it's 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.450
 my first that I do if a dragon 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.309
 ball z ultimate tenkaichi so we go 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.990
 listen for iphone you are I see 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.400
 very well at what when you know very 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.680
 how good is this character 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.990
 yes it looks rather parmalat to 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.910
 comfortable even when skiing well it is 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.670
 unfairly seen from the video will carry on 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.660
 How to reproduce thales dragon ball 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.660
 z ultimate tenkaichi 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.110
 and here we go for risk and so 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.780
 I advise you to have finished 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.530
 finished avatar mode will be able to see after 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.640
 unlocking everything is the most convenient 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.350
 double no bah y'a not need to 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:51.329
 tutorials for that - you really are 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:54.120
 a jerk who are motivated so what 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.969
 take horses by doc so 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.440
 hair color a meet and where all the 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.460
 bars on the left possible 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.530
 I bet for giving them everything to 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.869
 left possible like that it makes you 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.860
 already the blue hair made the 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.850
 personal skin color so here is given 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.549
 then hue 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.630
 it's going to be pretty important so I 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.409
 tell you to me I'm conscious system 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.890
 of craon in fact I screen count 1 2 4 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.869
 5 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.430
 sometimes it goes to 2 the side but does not 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.960
 do not worry it's easy 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.500
 was counting that 5pour for the pie 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:34.020
 but not saturation 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:45.729
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 16 21 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:48.899
 and 25 years old and for 1-4 before 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.860
 backgrounds I will write you the data 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.450
 give now a little moment pushes 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:02.049
 besides ripening in shine and and 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:06.459
 given the size is number 1 it's 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:08.200
 important so then basic time 2 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.789
 here is the sporting basic color that 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.000
 it's for the black part 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.410
 yes to places well if part of these 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.840
 for style so that there too color 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.840
 basic part iii the appearance rappaz 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.150
 basic color so an example 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.960
 interesting then hue 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:29.660
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8 before the end 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:38.630
 this to 8 before the end 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:43.790
 saturation of 3,11 here we bring you 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.500
 this beginning here after what he may 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.480
 some people think that this hen is 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.580
 still a little bit worth so do not hesitate 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.070
 not to further lower the saturation and 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:58.670
 16th time is for the colors 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:03:00.100
 now the same shine there is 10 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.130
 m street 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.510
 that's it for half shoulders 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.850
 only is more or less that there is 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.620
 done and partly beats because for me the art 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.629
 that's very, very easy 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.030
 this is the trick to get back here are the courses of 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.400
 basis if we just miss a bit 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:21.709
 the hue to the real and you and the color 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.180
 does not change to aspirations must be 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.769
 or minimal for shine should be 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.680
 maximum of February 6 years and is at 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:30.890
 minimum to raid will be something that here 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:34.760
 so a brand logo that we have 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.870
 not about the sector because otherwise it 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.819
 is going to make you talent is without a detector 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.459
 is targeted the readers bet its chip 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:45.079
 a4 this is a moment of pause and 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:48.290
 normally it is given to the pot only by 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:56.019
 listen to me I'm going to write and the 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:56.019
 parties a part 2 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:03.370
 these parties three parts 4 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.850
 that's normally the data they have 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.020
 have been posted so after that is going 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.000
 frankly there was filled before 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.680
 practically nothing we are going the way to 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.750
 public media but after you can 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.200
 find a way she is getting closer to 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.200
 that of his goku 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.819
 I wanted it to be that way and that's it 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.430
 so here's how it was 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:41.000
 reproduce thales for positive work 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:45.169
 click here by the way I do not know what 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.940
 what to say what to say I do not know anymore 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.280
 what a complete local training 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:53.289
 ultimate technical ultimate attack of 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.819
 radditz burst of meteors and that's it 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.469
 for me that we knew you can 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:58.119
 to unlock it's already frankly 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:58.960
 I made a video to show all 

00:04:58.119 --> 00:05:00.520
 the ultimate attacks of the avatar 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.479
 standard so do not hesitate to throw a 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:08.399
 look and that's it makes me a little 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.399
 fall is rather nice to me 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.560
 here is 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.690
