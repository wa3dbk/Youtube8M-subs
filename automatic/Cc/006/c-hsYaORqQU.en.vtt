'Among Sunflower Seeds' 
Episode "The Good Ones"

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.830
The 'good ones

00:00:10.067 --> 00:00:11.467
The good ones?

00:00:11.528 --> 00:00:14.528
I don't think I'm following you...

00:00:14.946 --> 00:00:19.946
People you wish for on shitty days. Good people, that's all.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.350
People who are not complicated... Who don't complicate you. Nor judge you.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.910
People who don't stab you on the back when you least expect it. 

00:00:29.058 --> 00:00:33.058
People who are always there and don't want anything in return: People 100% Good.

00:00:34.058 --> 00:00:36.058
I don't believe 'they' exist

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.399
They do exist! The really do!

00:00:40.137 --> 00:00:42.137
It's all a hidden lie!

00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:45.092
We actually know who they are, but we don't want them really.

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:48.133
It's self-cheating...

00:00:49.067 --> 00:00:51.067
A flawed idealization...

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:53.233
What?

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.340
Alright... I take the bus every day, same stop.

00:00:57.417 --> 00:01:00.417
The other day, the bus driver was waiting outside, having a cigarette. 

00:01:00.617 --> 00:01:03.617
I asked him if I had enough time to 
 grab some things at the hardware store.

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:07.033
What were you doing at a hardware store?

00:01:07.808 --> 00:01:10.808
Who cares? Irrelevant data for this story. Let me finish.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.650
Sure.

00:01:11.683 --> 00:01:15.583
The driver says yes: I have enough time. But if 
 he had to leave he'd let me know

00:01:16.164 --> 00:01:16.964
How?

00:01:17.083 --> 00:01:18.383
What do you mean how?

00:01:18.773 --> 00:01:20.773
How would he let you know?

00:01:20.858 --> 00:01:23.858
I don't know. Beeping, I guess, but there was no need

00:01:23.957 --> 00:01:26.557
Anyway, I get on and he asks me if 
 I found what I was looking for

00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:29.675
I said I didn't; so he asks me what was 
 it was so he could help me find it.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.800
First thing I thought was: who the hell is this nosy guy?

00:01:36.884 --> 00:01:40.880
But something deep inside made me tell him...

00:01:42.272 --> 00:01:44.270
... And it felt great.

00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:47.010
Great then...

00:01:47.138 --> 00:01:51.140
No, that's the problem! The guy was absolutely good. 100% Good, like we said.

00:01:51.617 --> 00:01:52.420
And?

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:58.460
Two weeks later, he was waiting for me, same place, on his day off, to 
 tell me he found what I was looking for in another hardware store

00:01:58.492 --> 00:02:00.490
and he bought it for me!!

00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:03.420
Psycho...

00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:05.570
That's exactly what I thought! 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.150
Only because he was one of those '100% good people'

00:02:08.258 --> 00:02:10.360
But we see him as a psychopath.

00:02:10.742 --> 00:02:12.740
A psycho who fucked-up my bus route. 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:14.960
Why?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Because it freaks me out

00:02:19.842 --> 00:02:21.840
We don't want 'People 100% good'

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:28.670
We don't connect, because we see them as 
 psychos, freaks, annoying people that irritate us...

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
And if Goodness irritates you...

00:02:31.303 --> 00:02:32.700
And that's the case...

00:02:32.815 --> 00:02:34.820
Not good.

00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:40.020
The 'Good Ones' are to be desired, requested to God, but from the distance.

00:02:40.458 --> 00:02:42.460
We don't want '100% good people'

00:02:42.608 --> 00:02:46.610
We want people like us, who want to 
 be good... Who try to be good

00:02:49.967 --> 00:02:54.470
Do you reckon the 'good ones' are aware of our feelings towards them? 

00:02:56.317 --> 00:02:58.320
Or does Goodness blind them?

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.950
Shit... Good question.
