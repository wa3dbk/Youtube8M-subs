intel<00:00:27.759> has<00:00:28.060> integrated<00:00:28.989> the<00:00:29.140> graphics

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
intel has integrated the graphics

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.609 
intel has integrated the graphics
directly<00:00:29.919> onto<00:00:30.579> the<00:00:30.880> processor<00:00:31.149> itself<00:00:31.779> so

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
directly onto the processor itself so

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.320 
directly onto the processor itself so
what<00:00:32.739> we're<00:00:32.860> doing<00:00:32.890> here<00:00:33.160> is<00:00:33.489> is<00:00:33.850> really

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330 
what we're doing here is is really

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.500 
what we're doing here is is really
rendering<00:00:34.990> these<00:00:35.470> three-dimensional

graphics card required do what we're
doing<00:00:46.870> here<00:00:47.320> so<00:00:48.250> think<00:00:48.430> about<00:00:48.520> this<00:00:48.760> in<00:00:48.880> terms

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
doing here so think about this in terms

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000 
doing here so think about this in terms
of<00:00:49.180> your<00:00:49.270> left<00:00:49.540> brain<00:00:49.840> right<00:00:49.990> brain<00:00:50.170> functions

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
of your left brain right brain functions

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.770 
of your left brain right brain functions
like<00:00:51.400> you<00:00:51.820> know<00:00:51.880> how<00:00:52.060> did<00:00:52.210> you<00:00:52.240> guys<00:00:52.390> get<00:00:52.570> an<00:00:52.660> A

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
like you know how did you guys get an A

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.860 
like you know how did you guys get an A
in<00:00:52.930> math<00:00:53.580> right<00:00:54.580> great<00:00:55.330> functions<00:00:55.810> the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
in math right great functions the

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.220 
in math right great functions the
controls<00:00:56.290> are<00:00:56.470> happening<00:00:56.890> on<00:00:57.010> this<00:00:57.190> side<00:00:58.230> any

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
controls are happening on this side any

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
of you who got an A in art you'd want to

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.660 
of you who got an A in art you'd want to
hang<00:01:01.960> it<00:01:02.110> over<00:01:02.230> here<00:01:02.620> this<00:01:03.070> is<00:01:03.130> what<00:01:03.310> Eric<00:01:03.610> is

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
hang it over here this is what Eric is

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.130 
hang it over here this is what Eric is
doing<00:01:03.730> to<00:01:04.000> make<00:01:04.150> this<00:01:04.299> visually<00:01:04.780> appealing

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
doing to make this visually appealing

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.410 
doing to make this visually appealing
and<00:01:05.770> what<00:01:05.950> we've<00:01:06.100> done<00:01:06.280> for<00:01:06.550> you<00:01:06.640> here<00:01:06.909> at<00:01:07.030> CES

and what we've done for you here at CES

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.140 
and what we've done for you here at CES
has<00:01:07.900> given<00:01:08.470> you<00:01:08.620> this<00:01:08.800> hands-on<00:01:09.400> experience

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
has given you this hands-on experience

here<00:01:15.130> at<00:01:15.190> this<00:01:15.280> processor<00:01:15.820> what<00:01:16.570> I've<00:01:16.690> got

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
here at this processor what I've got

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.350 
here at this processor what I've got
here

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
here

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.480 
here
but<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> graphics<00:01:19.350> have<00:01:19.470> been<00:01:19.530> built<00:01:19.920> into<00:01:20.340> it

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
but the graphics have been built into it

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.380 
but the graphics have been built into it
that<00:01:20.790> little<00:01:21.510> section<00:01:21.720> there<00:01:22.460> is<00:01:23.460> where<00:01:24.270> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
that little section there is where the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.270 
that little section there is where the
visuals<00:01:24.840> are<00:01:25.700> right<00:01:26.700> over<00:01:26.940> here<00:01:27.979> we've<00:01:28.979> built

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
visuals are right over here we've built

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.190 
visuals are right over here we've built
that<00:01:29.370> into<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.820> chip<00:01:30.060> itself<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:31.050> is

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
that into the chip itself and that is

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.530 
that into the chip itself and that is
what's<00:01:31.410> powering<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:32.100> whole<00:01:32.369> display<00:01:32.820> so

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
what's powering this whole display so

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.150 
what's powering this whole display so
Eric<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.020> kind<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.229> taking<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.650> left<00:01:34.890> brain

right<00:01:35.310> brain<00:01:35.460> functions<00:01:36.360> much<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:37.080> we've

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
right brain functions much like we've

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.170 
right brain functions much like we've
done<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.740> chip<00:01:37.979> itself<00:01:38.160> to<00:01:38.820> show<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.060> what

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
done the chip itself to show you what

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.550 
done the chip itself to show you what
we've<00:01:39.270> got<00:01:39.450> going<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.720> if<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.140> take<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.380> look

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
we've got going on if you take a look

around if you look up if you look behind
the<00:01:43.770> walls<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:44.670> you're<00:01:45.270> seeing<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.720> color

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
the walls here you're seeing the color

happen here so on this side Eric you

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.809 
happen here so on this side Eric you
want<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.360> bring<00:02:12.540> in<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.690> numbers
