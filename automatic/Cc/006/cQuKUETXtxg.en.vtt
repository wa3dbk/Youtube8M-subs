00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
and whatnot however we have to look at

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.750 
and whatnot however we have to look at
the<00:02:25.960> big<00:02:26.140> picture<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:27.190> is<00:02:27.310> there<00:02:27.490> that<00:02:27.520> we

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
the big picture and it is there that we

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.670 
the big picture and it is there that we
find<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.180> accessibility<00:02:28.960> is<00:02:29.170> probably<00:02:29.530> one

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
find that accessibility is probably one

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.050 
find that accessibility is probably one
of<00:02:29.710> the<00:02:29.860> most<00:02:29.980> important<00:02:30.520> factors<00:02:30.820> when<00:02:30.850> it

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060
