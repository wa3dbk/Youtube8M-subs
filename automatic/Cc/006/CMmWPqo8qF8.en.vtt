00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.660
 there is a line of everything well 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.750
 I decided to make a special video for 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.720
 you just on the theme masking of 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.420
 painting that is masking 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.370
 paperwork as many draws is the 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.280
 simple fact of people isolating some 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.280
 areas that should not receive ink or 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.559
 compound that you are applying on that hood 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.210
 I will not work with any kind of 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.800
 and masking 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.320
 I think it's worth making a video there 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.730
 to give some quick tips for you 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.620
 about the subject 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.989
 first of all there is some difference 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.149
 do you use newspaper 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.059
 and that specific role to play 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.979
 masking in your home's garage in the 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.810
 your lobby service or even 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.660
 professional use of greenhouses 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.670
 drying mechanism will not you will not 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.490
 have trouble since you have in 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.190
 that the newspaper may present some 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.140
 always work with sheets 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.009
 duplicates of newspaper making the amendment 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.520
 correctly 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.149
 but usually that paper for 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.550
 masking it is a bit more 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.500
 tough and it's easier on you 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.490
 handle as well as you have different 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.610
 sizes too 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.100
 but the purpose of the video is not this self 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.130
 I believe you will work with the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.130
 newspaper or with any other mechanism take 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.069
 very careful with solvent action in 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.530
 any type of paper you are using 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:49.709
 use to make this masking 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.720
 so I know it works and that's what 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:54.599
 I recommend if you need to use 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.360
 This is hard good crepe tape person 

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:59.220
 try to use automotive crepe tape 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.190
 in different sizes and have different 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.399
 size and thickness settings. 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.069
 crepe tape and it's interesting that you 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.050
 always meet different sizes 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.800
 because eventually you needed 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.390
 some larger and smaller areas 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.390
 How does the first insulation work? 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.580
 normally pass a tape layer 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.130
 It is usually higher in the area I'm 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.460
 working and then in the lap a 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.210
 paper for masking with another tape 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.060
 smaller 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.730
 always making the splicing on a layer of 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.190
 tape crepe I never spliced straight paper 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.740
 on the surface unless it is 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.990
 black paint a well located service 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.970
 and you will not have as much trouble or 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.210
 ink temptation 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.990
 at that point we did deals with the 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:52.590
 masking cut other stitch 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:57.540
 fundamental for you you should not 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:00.180
 leave this masking until healing 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.700
 complete the ink half an hour later 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.580
 at the most you applied the last 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.180
 paint and the government has started 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.010
 Whatever you already composed 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.880
 masking is removed if it is a background 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.100
 t1 or even the first white frosted 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.680
 vinyl you can remove soon after 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.770
 application because such 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.960
 cecco very fast in the piece and if you 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.090
 let it dry very much if you invaded 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.950
 very much the area of the crepe tape 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.290
 she's going to be very rigid. 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.060
 Difficult for you to take, you may have 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.180
 problems dealt with on the surface 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.210
 Do you have that annoying thing after that? 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.430
 Our wedding takes you between 10 and 30 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.490
 minutes after application of the last coat 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.440
 with the paint or the compound you have 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.690
 in still fresh piece 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.860
 another important detail I need to do 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.120
 part outlines with masking 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.640
 How do you work this out? 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.220
 stylus very carefully you cut the 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.410
 masking tape makes the cut always with 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.260
 stiletto and I'll show you 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.060
 Here you are a stiletto game that can 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.680
 help you a lot in this service 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.010
 especially if you are 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.960
 modeler was the modeler makes some 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:17.520
 services with drugs 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:19.830
 This helps a lot. You work these 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.770
 seven of stilettos there staff will give you 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:25.650
 a huge range of work for you 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.660
 make any cut on the crepe tape to 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.220
 make any outline any type of 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.890
 in the paint of your car from a 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.180
 very cool way, very accurate enough 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:41.060
 you practice and practice just before 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:45.169
 the risk of eg causing 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:48.050
 some risk due to the use of the stylus in 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:52.039
 paint on the surface that you are then 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:56.150
 of stopping in a room and should be 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:58.160
 always as firm as possible, 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.100
 the minimum possible pressure on the 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.720
 stylus for you to cut gently and 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.419
 Tape crepe prevent surface damage 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.610
 that you are repairing basically the 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.800
 people divide the crepe tape into a tape 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.680
 and an automotive tape. 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.729
 there are five divisions on the crepe tape of 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.110
 automotive use and the main division 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.940
 of this type of tape is the fact that 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.840
 to withstand high temperature or not 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.240
 stand 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.759
 so if you use a greenhouse you 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.160
 need an appropriate crepe tape 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:30.680
 for use in the greenhouse and for temperatures 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.990
 high is not our case when the 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.300
 people are working from home and give 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.130
 tape crepe edit automotivo already vai te 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.009
 meet perfectly in the matter of 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.349
 isolation of this area that you do not want 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:45.320
 the paint contact of the compound in the 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:47.960
 low residue residue 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.150
 getting over the important painting if 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.449
 you have removed it at the appropriate time 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.370
 I already mentioned a third video to own 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:58.669
 temperature resistance and will not 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:01.490
 be raised and of course the good power of 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:03.740
 isolation of the unreacted area with 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:07.070
 little composite paint that we applied 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.720
 rodrigo got tape glue 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.780
 after marriage how can I 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.840
 solve this you can use find 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.449
 you need back you can 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.610
 leave the piece without problems 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.590
 you can use is also cley low 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.979
 have you already done any treatment in the 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:27.199
 moving painting to or of the genre 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:28.699
 the considerations on marriages are 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:30.650
 those are you people 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:31.759
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.860
 video
