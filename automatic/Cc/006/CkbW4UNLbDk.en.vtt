00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:07.700
 say Álvarez from a perspective 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.519
 social proposes the creation of chocolate 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.459
 for the company of the street a collective 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:17.580
 determined to fight for the people who 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:20.539
 society for their prejudices and fears 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.539
 they have been isolating 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.170
 chocolate to buy the street is a 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.330
 idea that around the national strike is 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.150
 and before higher education was 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.130
 the reform to law 30 was to show the 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.820
 another face that the students have and 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.530
 how your role is transformative within 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.420
 all societies was showed something 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.370
 different than against the means of 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.600
 television within the protests that 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.350
 could be carried out within the 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.300
 marches 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.860
 It was just getting to one of the 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.470
 most vulnerable sectors as was the 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.260
 street dweller inside the city or 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.820
 the sector of the fence was removed me 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.250
 initially what is the real objective 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.720
 of chocolate for the compa street 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.430
 the average of the possibilities that 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.649
 let's have when we are foundation 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.710
 We hope to do it around two 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.450
 months is to try to decrease the the 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.670
 impact of street dwellers that has 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.290
 medellin in what way then in the 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.450
 moments no approach with the 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.619
 activities that we are developing 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.970
 know the contexts with two of the 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.619
 three hours of the individuals that we 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.720
 know them good sir copying 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.580
 obviously when we have a confidence 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.430
 let's say that individuals 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.659
 has a capacity they have the will and 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.120
 so it will be 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.940
 somewhere to help rehabilitation 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.970
 academic education and that kind of thing 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.760
 after these invitations I am 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.700
 flying and in my country if there is also there 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.020
 people who live on the street only 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.020
 this people 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.390
 then the government help much more with 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.420
 these people I feel very happy 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.810
 that I hope to help here was being happy 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.770
 to be here with them together 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.850
 people who are doing what 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.900
 never 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.900
 no one does 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:28.250
 enrique santos discépolo compositor y 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.560
 Argentine filmmaker tells us that there is a 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.530
 man that is as big as the 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.100
 funk is the hunger for justice is the 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.100
 hunger for understanding because of this you have to 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.620
 return to the sense of the human 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.130
 to walk with the feet of others to 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.620
 share what we can and should 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.420
 because with a point of support you can 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.160
 move the world 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.160
 the girl is in a street situation 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.769
 an adult who is in street situation 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.719
 mostly it has been a choice 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.020
 own but I consider children and 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:06.270
 more than anything a baby 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.890
 that is already that age has to be in 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.130
 this context 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.319
 and it seems to me that it is not fair because 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.360
 children they are not deciding for themselves 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.130
 same be in this place the most beautiful 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.110
 that I had then in that experience to be 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.050
 the chocolate to buy the street has 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.080
 to know this this world the one of the 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:28.530
 street because it is not the same not to be 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.510
 outside and observe them in their day to day 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.700
 be completely working with them 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.310
 when you get to qatar so long these 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.980
 three years changed perspectives are 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.900
 they understand the contexts much better 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.720
 and why people come hither 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.220
 that each story is something particular and 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.080
 that you can not treat everyone by 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.330
 just as if they had all the same 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.000
 problems and see have come here from 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.319
 Equal way or because you want me 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.209
 I think that is doing this they did 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:00.060
 people who are low income is 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.560
 one hour because I was sent to share 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.390
 with other people 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.420
 give a mouth of eats to those who do not 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.760
 can have a diary and be with them 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.530
 sharing giving him happiness 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.530
 a smile 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:27.410
 for some the word hungry is the 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.630
 word that describes that feeling 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.930
 while the time elapses between a 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:37.010
 food and the other between breakfast and the 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:41.570
 lunch for others the significance is 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:43.270
 different hunger stops being word and 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.289
 becomes 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.670
 everydayness 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.230
 hunger 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.360
 It is the common factor 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.660
 that has social inequality in the 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.660
 world 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.380
 it is the fact 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:04.010
 of the inadequate distribution of 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.050
 riches 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.889
 in a country like Colombia that is 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.960
 agro producer 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.270
 there is hunger is very complex 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.629
 understanding hunger is like a sensation 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.939
 that really none would like to feel 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:19.770
 because it is something exasperating but that 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:21.990
 some then in some cycle of life 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.999
 they come to feel it and so too 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.249
 we will understand many people because he lives 

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:29.009
 on the street that what they feel how they 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:31.889
 they feel and why many do things 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:34.229
 bad for covering up their need and I think 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.180
 if hunger is something that takes you to 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.069
 limit I hope that all I bless you 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.439
 so the great campaign a very campaign 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:42.960
 linda a man was eating at that 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:44.069
 he needs it and the very rich supesta 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.600
 they did with love god bless them 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:48.680
 forever 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.919
 thank you share 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.940
 see the other as an individual as a 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.940
 human being more 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:01.490
 understand problems and not get away 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:04.010
 just understand those problems and 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:09.710
 enter into its context and develop 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:13.070
 other lessons because here one ended with 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:16.100
 many brothers more than 2000 years ago 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.600
 the son of god we gather his twelve 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.860
 friends 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:24.950
 he took the bread and gave thanks and broke it and 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:28.970
 he gave them saying this is my body 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:32.960
 that for you I have given do this in 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:36.169
 memory of mine in the same way after 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.169
 there was senado took the cup saying 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:42.099
 this cup is the new covenant of my 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:46.669
 alliance that for you is going to spill 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:49.580
 this pact is renewed daily is a 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:52.759
 world with a lot of people that we have 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.710
 we have to take care of it 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:57.949
 among all of us we have to make this 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:07:00.080
 world grow for us by the 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:03.340
 future generations 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.340
 transform the world 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.510
 make the goal of any for that 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:10.100
 so that something comes 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.880
 like the things that also having 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.880
 others 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.580
 the accelerated grace
