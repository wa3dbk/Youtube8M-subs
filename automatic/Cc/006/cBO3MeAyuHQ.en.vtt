in<00:02:44.819> golf<00:02:45.030> with<00:02:45.599> the<00:02:45.690> q-factor<00:02:46.049> it<00:02:46.230> just

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
in golf with the q-factor it just

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.289 
in golf with the q-factor it just
enables<00:02:46.799> your<00:02:47.370> average<00:02:47.700> player<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.150> play<00:02:48.269> a

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
better player and you get a reasonable

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.930 
better player and you get a reasonable
time<00:02:49.709> in<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:49.950> if<00:02:50.069> I'd<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.250> knocked<00:02:50.489> in<00:02:50.640> two<00:02:50.819> or

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
time in it if I'd a knocked in two or

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.460 
time in it if I'd a knocked in two or
three<00:02:50.970> Reds<00:02:51.360> made<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.019> a<00:02:52.049> bit<00:02:52.200> more<00:02:52.230> difficult

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
three Reds made it a bit more difficult

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.050 
three Reds made it a bit more difficult
then<00:02:53.160> he<00:02:53.280> would<00:02:53.430> have<00:02:53.519> been<00:02:53.579> struggling<00:02:53.849> I

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
then he would have been struggling I

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.610 
then he would have been struggling I
think<00:02:54.299> so<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.870> know<00:02:54.989> I<00:02:55.019> mean<00:02:55.290> it's<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.470> same

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
think so you know I mean it's the same

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.240 
think so you know I mean it's the same
in<00:02:55.680> golf<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:56.010> could<00:02:56.160> play<00:02:56.280> tiger<00:02:56.489> woods<00:02:56.760> well<00:02:58.250> no

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
in golf I could play tiger woods well no

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.619 
in golf I could play tiger woods well no
but<00:02:59.370> this<00:02:59.459> is<00:02:59.519> alyssa<00:02:59.910> given<00:03:00.150> anyone<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.569> chance

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
but this is alyssa given anyone a chance

but this is alyssa given anyone a chance
and<00:03:01.049> I<00:03:01.109> think<00:03:01.319> it's<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.500> really<00:03:01.650> good<00:03:01.739> idea<00:03:01.890> what

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
and I think it's a really good idea what

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.099 
and I think it's a really good idea what
I<00:03:02.640> think<00:03:03.030> should<00:03:03.209> catch<00:03:03.450> on<00:03:03.660> especially<00:03:03.900> in
