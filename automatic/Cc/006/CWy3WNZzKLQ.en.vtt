00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
one ponytail so what I did we just

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.740 
one ponytail so what I did we just
separate<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.140> into<00:00:52.350> two<00:00:52.469> different<00:00:52.680> ponytails

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
separate it into two different ponytails

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
separate it into two different ponytails
one<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.930> catches<00:00:55.079> all<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> hair<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
one that catches all the hair in the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.290 
one that catches all the hair in the
back<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.250> one<00:00:56.370> obviously<00:00:56.850> catches<00:00:57.180> all<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
back and one obviously catches all the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.220 
back and one obviously catches all the
hair<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.629> front<00:00:57.780> first<00:00:58.730> I<00:00:59.780> took<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.050> hair

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
hair in the front first I took the hair

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.599 
hair in the front first I took the hair
out<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:01.770> separated<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.489> into

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
out and I just separated it into

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.190 
out and I just separated it into
different<00:01:03.559> size<00:01:04.559> groups<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.630> twisted<00:01:07.110> it

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
different size groups and I twisted it

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.679 
different size groups and I twisted it
up<00:01:07.350> like<00:01:08.070> here's<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:10.490> here's<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.549> thin<00:01:11.909> one<00:01:12.180> twist

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
up like here's a here's a thin one twist

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.450 
up like here's a here's a thin one twist
I<00:01:12.810> didn't<00:01:13.049> cut<00:01:13.260> them<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.530> half<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.830> left<00:01:14.070> all<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
I didn't cut them in half I left all the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.490 
I didn't cut them in half I left all the
link<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.820> there<00:01:15.240> which<00:01:15.720> makes<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.110> easier<00:01:16.439> to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
link in there which makes it easier to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.170 
link in there which makes it easier to
wrap<00:01:16.770> around<00:01:17.450> there's<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.570> smaller<00:01:18.900> one<00:01:20.180> the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
wrap around there's a smaller one the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.149 
wrap around there's a smaller one the
medium-sized<00:01:21.810> one<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.380> think<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.860> one<00:01:23.040> is

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
medium-sized one I think this one is

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.570 
medium-sized one I think this one is
half<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.909> pack<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:25.530> also<00:01:25.770> did<00:01:26.130> like<00:01:26.159> one

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
half of the pack and I also did like one

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.649 
half of the pack and I also did like one
huge<00:01:26.970> braid<00:01:27.920> with<00:01:28.920> it

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
a small braid and all of these different

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.020 
a small braid and all of these different
size<00:01:34.470> braids<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.189> twists<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.640> add<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
size braids and twists to add to the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.850

texture<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.600> you're<00:01:36.720> going<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.930> see<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
texture that you're going to see in the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.140 
texture that you're going to see in the
