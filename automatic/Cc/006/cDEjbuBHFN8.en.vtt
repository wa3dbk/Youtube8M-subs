hey guys as berra look here just journey
the<00:00:22.350> day<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.680> thinkable<00:00:23.010> time<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.120> all

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:24.450 
the day is thinkable time this is all

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.050 
the day is thinkable time this is all
about<00:00:24.570> spawn<00:00:24.990> trapping<00:00:25.490> 16<00:00:26.490> minutes<00:00:26.760> into<00:00:26.940> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
about spawn trapping 16 minutes into the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.760 
about spawn trapping 16 minutes into the
game<00:00:27.090> I've<00:00:27.450> had<00:00:27.570> enough<00:00:27.690> of<00:00:27.990> birds<00:00:28.320> just

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
game I've had enough of birds just

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.260 
game I've had enough of birds just
trying<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> defend<00:00:29.340> objectives<00:00:29.820> I'm<00:00:30.000> trying

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
trying to defend objectives I'm trying

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.990 
trying to defend objectives I'm trying
something<00:00:30.510> different<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:31.369> this<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.550> this<00:00:32.850> is

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
something different and this is this is

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.729 
something different and this is this is
what<00:00:33.330> pays<00:00:33.540> off<00:00:33.720> using<00:00:34.050> my<00:00:34.320> knowledge<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
what pays off using my knowledge of the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.049 
what pays off using my knowledge of the
sports<00:00:35.030> so<00:00:37.160> to<00:00:38.160> get<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.340> spawn<00:00:38.640> trapped<00:00:38.910> nuke

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
sports so to get a spawn trapped nuke

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.790 
sports so to get a spawn trapped nuke
like<00:00:39.270> I'm<00:00:39.420> doing<00:00:39.660> now<00:00:39.780> which<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.650> most

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
like I'm doing now which is the most

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.710 
like I'm doing now which is the most
horrible<00:00:41.190> dirty<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.760> can<00:00:41.790> ever<00:00:42.180> imagine<00:00:42.270> I

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
horrible dirty you can ever imagine I

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.180 
horrible dirty you can ever imagine I
would<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:43.080> would<00:00:43.230> never<00:00:43.410> recommend<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:44.040> unless

form as well as it will be effective as

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.590 
form as well as it will be effective as
you<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.840> see<00:01:10.729> in<00:01:11.729> favela<00:01:12.150> there<00:01:12.420> are

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
you can see in favela there are

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.539 
you can see in favela there are
literally<00:01:13.260> only<00:01:13.590> four<00:01:13.979> places<00:01:14.250> they<00:01:14.490> could

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
literally only four places they could

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.010 
literally only four places they could
spawn<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.180> if<00:01:15.270> you're<00:01:15.390> looking<00:01:15.750> at<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:15.990> of

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
spawn and if you're looking at one of

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.140 
spawn and if you're looking at one of
the<00:01:16.140> spore<00:01:16.380> points<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:16.830> moment<00:01:17.610> they

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
the spore points like this moment they

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.580 
the spore points like this moment they
can<00:01:18.299> only<00:01:18.390> spawn<00:01:18.750> or<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.020> other<00:01:19.140> score<00:01:19.409> points

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
can only spawn or the other score points

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.889 
can only spawn or the other score points
so<00:01:20.159> you're<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:20.940> top<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.390> green<00:01:21.659> power

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
so you're on top of this green power

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.520 
so you're on top of this green power
here<00:01:22.789> you<00:01:23.789> can<00:01:24.030> effectively<00:01:24.509> run<00:01:24.930> between<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
here you can effectively run between the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.830 
here you can effectively run between the
two<00:01:26.250> mains<00:01:26.490> four<00:01:26.759> points<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.570> can<00:01:27.719> even

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
two mains four points and you can even

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.580 
two mains four points and you can even
look<00:01:28.140> at<00:01:28.320> look<00:01:28.469> out<00:01:28.649> for<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:31.020> tertiary

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
look at look out for the the tertiary

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.029 
look at look out for the the tertiary
and<00:01:32.430> secondary<00:01:32.880> spawn<00:01:33.180> point<00:01:33.710> on<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.799> far

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
and secondary spawn point on the far

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.740 
and secondary spawn point on the far
right<00:01:35.250> close<00:01:35.969> it<00:01:36.090> down<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.329> street<00:01:36.570> and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
right close it down the street and

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.300 
right close it down the street and
they're<00:01:36.899> more<00:01:37.109> likely<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.560> sport<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.950> now<00:01:38.189> at

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
they're more likely to sport that now at

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.529 
they're more likely to sport that now at
this<00:01:38.399> point<00:01:38.609> because<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:40.039> we<00:01:41.039> have<00:01:41.539> already

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
this point because I we have already

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:43.999 
this point because I we have already
destroyed<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:43.079> they've<00:01:43.590> already<00:01:43.740> matched

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
destroyed that they've already matched

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.620 
destroyed that they've already matched
to<00:01:44.189> destroy<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.640> area<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:44.969> map<00:01:47.630> even

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
to destroy that area of the map even

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.660 
to destroy that area of the map even
though<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:48.960> today's<00:01:49.350> for<00:01:49.859> Jake<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.250> actually

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
though this today's for Jake I actually

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.330 
though this today's for Jake I actually
do<00:01:51.539> care<00:01:51.719> about<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:52.079> win<00:01:52.259> let's<00:01:52.770> get<00:01:53.100> for<00:01:53.310> it

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
do care about the win let's get for it

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.330 
do care about the win let's get for it
so<00:01:54.210> i<00:01:54.240> put<00:01:54.450> my<00:01:54.570> harrier<00:01:54.929> over<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.859> bomb<00:01:56.039> sport

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
so i put my harrier over the bomb sport

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.590 
so i put my harrier over the bomb sport
to<00:01:56.460> try<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.700> help<00:01:56.759> my<00:01:56.939> teammates

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
to try and help my teammates

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.860 
to try and help my teammates
and<00:01:59.600> yet<00:02:00.790> yeah<00:02:01.790> it's<00:02:01.970> still<00:02:02.120> has<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.510> do<00:02:02.660> what

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
and yet yeah it's still has to do what

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.830 
and yet yeah it's still has to do what
needs<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.080> be<00:02:03.170> done<00:02:03.230> to<00:02:03.410> the<00:02:03.590> spore<00:02:03.860> trap<00:02:04.100> so

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
needs to be done to the spore trap so

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.260 
needs to be done to the spore trap so
have<00:02:05.840> it<00:02:06.020> we'd<00:02:06.800> run<00:02:07.310> into<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.610> other<00:02:07.760> side<00:02:08.000> I

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
have it we'd run into the other side I

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.639 
have it we'd run into the other side I
know<00:02:08.450> that<00:02:08.720> they're<00:02:09.080> going<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.290> sport<00:02:09.530> in<00:02:09.619> a

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
know that they're going to sport in a

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.410 
know that they're going to sport in a
