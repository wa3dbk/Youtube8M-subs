00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.640 
now because I'm working on the chamber
links<00:02:33.920> get<00:02:34.160> getting<00:02:34.640> them<00:02:34.760> D<00:02:34.880> anodized<00:02:35.620> but<00:02:36.620> I

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
links get getting them D anodized but I

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.090 
links get getting them D anodized but I
did<00:02:36.890> put<00:02:37.100> some<00:02:37.600> wire<00:02:38.600> mesh<00:02:38.630> on<00:02:39.230> on<00:02:39.590> these<00:02:39.769> wires

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
did put some wire mesh on on these wires

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.090 
did put some wire mesh on on these wires
so<00:02:40.519> I<00:02:40.550> thought<00:02:40.850> that<00:02:41.000> turned<00:02:41.269> out<00:02:41.390> pretty<00:02:41.420> good

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
so I thought that turned out pretty good

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.550 
so I thought that turned out pretty good
I'm<00:02:43.100> gonna<00:02:43.670> probably<00:02:43.970> do<00:02:44.660> that<00:02:44.840> for<00:02:44.900> this<00:02:45.320> car

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
I'm gonna probably do that for this car

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
I'm gonna probably do that for this car
