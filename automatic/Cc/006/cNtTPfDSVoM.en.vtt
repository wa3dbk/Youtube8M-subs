label it as game number three I have no
idea<00:00:15.000> if<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:16.170> was<00:00:16.260> actually<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.650> third<00:00:16.830> game

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
idea if it was actually the third game

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.730 
idea if it was actually the third game
me<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.369> him<00:00:17.550> ever<00:00:17.699> played<00:00:18.060> but<00:00:18.650> it's<00:00:19.650> just

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
me and him ever played but it's just

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.050 
me and him ever played but it's just
gonna<00:00:19.890> be<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.160> third<00:00:20.279> one<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.640> upload<00:00:21.000> I

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
gonna be the third one that I upload I

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.560 
gonna be the third one that I upload I
think<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.390> was<00:00:21.480> probably<00:00:21.750> not<00:00:21.960> because<00:00:23.449> it<00:00:24.449> was

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
think it was probably not because it was

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.939 
think it was probably not because it was
probably<00:00:24.720> one<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.080> earlier<00:00:25.859> games

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
probably one of the earlier games

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.650 
probably one of the earlier games
actually<00:00:26.580> because<00:00:26.910> he<00:00:27.090> still<00:00:27.359> hadn't<00:00:27.510> changed

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
actually because he still hadn't changed

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.390 
actually because he still hadn't changed
his<00:00:27.810> name<00:00:27.930> yet<00:00:28.140> or<00:00:28.230> anything<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:29.250> all

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
his name yet or anything but it's all

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.589 
his name yet or anything but it's all
good

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
good

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.459 
good
I<00:00:30.660> think<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.320> wouldn't<00:00:31.500> like<00:00:31.619> 22<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.630> 11<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.840> was

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
I think I wouldn't like 22 like 11 I was

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.930 
I think I wouldn't like 22 like 11 I was
actually<00:00:34.829> like<00:00:34.920> smacking<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.520> shit<00:00:35.760> out<00:00:35.910> of

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
actually like smacking the shit out of

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.970 
actually like smacking the shit out of
him<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.300> was<00:00:36.420> like<00:00:36.600> eight<00:00:37.200> zero<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> was

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
him it was like eight zero and I was

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.430 
him it was like eight zero and I was
like<00:00:38.070> 14<00:00:38.309> four<00:00:38.730> at<00:00:38.879> one<00:00:39.030> point<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.570> then<00:00:40.230> he

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
like 14 four at one point and then he

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.850 
like 14 four at one point and then he
brings<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.890> back<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.100> 15<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.059> 10<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.800> then<00:00:43.800> I

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
brings it back to 15 to 10 and then I

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.590 
brings it back to 15 to 10 and then I
pull<00:00:44.280> away<00:00:44.399> again<00:00:44.789> at<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> end<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.210> then<00:00:45.300> aver

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
pull away again at the end and then aver

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.760 
pull away again at the end and then aver
for<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.870> very<00:00:46.020> last<00:00:46.170> kill<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.350> got<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> kill

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
for the very last kill I got the kill

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.200 
for the very last kill I got the kill
with<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.010> hundred<00:00:47.280> killer<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.789> piss<00:00:48.030> him

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
with the hundred killer just to piss him

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.350 
with the hundred killer just to piss him
off<00:00:48.440> so<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:50.039> think<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.730> may<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:50.910> able<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.180> hear

off so I think you may be able to hear

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.049 
off so I think you may be able to hear
him<00:00:51.539> rage<00:00:52.309> towards<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.489> last<00:00:53.760> couple
