00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
blocks away from the sapling this does

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.000 
blocks away from the sapling this does
work<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.789> occasion<00:01:00.289> but<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.440> does<00:01:01.590> this<00:01:01.770> more

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
work on occasion but it does this more

often than it works so per a buddy's
instruction<00:01:06.119> he<00:01:06.240> tried<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:07.080> same<00:01:07.290> thing<00:01:08.150> with

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
instruction he tried the same thing with

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.590 
instruction he tried the same thing with
torches<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:10.670> and<00:01:11.670> place<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.060> sapling<00:01:12.450> two

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
torches on and place the sapling two

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.080 
torches on and place the sapling two
blocks<00:01:12.869> away<00:01:12.990> from<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.909> technically<00:01:14.909> this

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
blocks away from that technically this

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.710 
blocks away from that technically this
block<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.299> occupied<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:17.210> spam<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.509> you

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
block is occupied and spam it and you

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.350 
block is occupied and spam it and you
get<00:01:18.869> one<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.110> these<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.250> got<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.759> average

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
get one of these so you got to average

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.170 
get one of these so you got to average
oak<00:01:22.020> trees<00:01:22.470> with<00:01:22.710> basically<00:01:23.490> crap<00:01:23.850> growing

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
oak trees with basically crap growing

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.330 
oak trees with basically crap growing
into<00:01:24.360> them<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.290> thought<00:01:25.560> hey<00:01:25.770> not<00:01:26.009> long<00:01:26.159> ago

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
into them so I thought hey not long ago

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.800 
into them so I thought hey not long ago
they<00:01:26.549> made<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:26.970> could<00:01:27.090> play<00:01:27.119> string<00:01:27.689> on

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
they made it so you could play string on

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.080 
they made it so you could play string on
the<00:01:27.869> ground<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:29.000> counts<00:01:30.000> as<00:01:30.030> a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the ground and that counts as a

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.270 
the ground and that counts as a
transparent<00:01:30.689> block<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.079> we<00:01:31.200> have<00:01:31.320> one<00:01:32.040> here

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
transparent block so we have one here

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.359 
transparent block so we have one here
one<00:01:32.549> here<00:01:32.840> stack<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.140> that's<00:01:34.799> for<00:01:35.159> right

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
one here stack one that's for right

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.469 
one here stack one that's for right
there<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.619> strings<00:01:37.619> right<00:01:37.770> there<00:01:38.180> put<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.329> oak

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
there so strings right there put the oak

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.660 
there so strings right there put the oak
sapling<00:01:39.930> right<00:01:40.110> next<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.500> spam<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.640> crap

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
sapling right next to it spam the crap

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.179 
sapling right next to it spam the crap
out<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.390> boom<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.470> got<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.649> nice<00:01:43.860> big

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
out of it and boom you got a nice big

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.910 
out of it and boom you got a nice big
luscious<00:01:44.670> oak<00:01:44.850> tree<00:01:45.470> I've<00:01:46.470> done<00:01:46.770> this

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
luscious oak tree I've done this

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.480 
luscious oak tree I've done this
probably<00:01:47.630> between<00:01:48.630> 50<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.320> 60<00:01:49.740> times<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
probably between 50 and 60 times for the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.580 
probably between 50 and 60 times for the
sake<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.700> science<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.390> it's<00:01:51.930> only<00:01:52.170> not

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
sake of science and it's only not

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.280 
sake of science and it's only not
working<00:01:53.040> once<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.810> result<00:01:55.079> when<00:01:55.200> it

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
working once and the result when it

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.550 
working once and the result when it
doesn't<00:01:55.409> work<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.799> pretty<00:01:56.310> ugly<00:01:57.229> but<00:01:58.229> it's

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
doesn't work is pretty ugly but it's

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.990 
doesn't work is pretty ugly but it's
easy<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.950> clean<00:01:59.130> up<00:01:59.250> if<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.490> doesn't<00:01:59.729> work<00:01:59.850> as

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
easy to clean up if it doesn't work as

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.649 
easy to clean up if it doesn't work as
the<00:02:00.119> tree<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.390> really<00:02:00.630> short<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.670> given<00:02:03.630> that

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the tree is really short so given that

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.930 
the tree is really short so given that
this<00:02:03.869> works<00:02:04.140> aw<00:02:04.579> 49<00:02:05.579> out<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.790> 50<00:02:05.939> times<00:02:07.789> when<00:02:08.789> it

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
this works aw 49 out of 50 times when it

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.339 
this works aw 49 out of 50 times when it
works<00:02:09.300> at<00:02:09.509> all<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:09.750> is<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.959> first<00:02:10.170> one<00:02:10.289> that

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
works at all this is the first one that

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.080 
works at all this is the first one that
actually<00:02:10.500> hasn't<00:02:10.739> gone

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.059 

there<00:02:13.750> we<00:02:13.840> go<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:16.540> get<00:02:16.690> really<00:02:17.019> really<00:02:17.830> odd

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
there we go you get really really odd

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.390 
there we go you get really really odd
ones<00:02:18.370> when<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:18.670> doesn't<00:02:18.849> work<00:02:19.709> so<00:02:20.709> for<00:02:21.310> the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
ones when it doesn't work so for the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.619 
ones when it doesn't work so for the
sake<00:02:21.519> of<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.700> video<00:02:21.879> let's<00:02:22.060> give<00:02:22.239> this<00:02:22.330> one

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
sake of the video let's give this one

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.720 
sake of the video let's give this one
more<00:02:22.660> shot<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:23.890> doesn't<00:02:24.220> usually<00:02:24.310> take<00:02:24.489> as

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
more shot it doesn't usually take as

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.100 
more shot it doesn't usually take as
much<00:02:24.819> bone<00:02:25.120> meal<00:02:25.300> as<00:02:25.390> that<00:02:25.510> one<00:02:25.660> took<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.050> it

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
much bone meal as that one took and it

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.750 
much bone meal as that one took and it
rarely<00:02:26.500> looks<00:02:26.890> like<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.220> so<00:02:27.430> let's<00:02:27.610> try

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
rarely looks like that so let's try

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.339 
rarely looks like that so let's try
maybe<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.209> has<00:02:28.300> to<00:02:28.330> do<00:02:28.540> with<00:02:28.690> what<00:02:28.810> sign<00:02:29.140> we're

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
maybe it has to do with what sign we're

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.320 
maybe it has to do with what sign we're
placing<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.769> on<00:02:29.890> but<00:02:30.099> I<00:02:30.310> doubt<00:02:30.670> it<00:02:31.000> so<00:02:31.180> let's

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
placing it on but I doubt it so let's

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.699 
placing it on but I doubt it so let's
give<00:02:31.450> this<00:02:31.510> one<00:02:31.690> more<00:02:31.720> shot<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:34.410> see<00:02:35.410> what<00:02:35.590> we

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
give this one more shot and see what we

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.369 
give this one more shot and see what we
get<00:02:35.950> out<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:38.459> there<00:02:39.459> we<00:02:39.610> go<00:02:39.959> now<00:02:40.959> this<00:02:41.140> does

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
get out of it there we go now this does

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.990 
get out of it there we go now this does
take<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.650> lot<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:41.950> bone<00:02:42.220> meal<00:02:42.459> it<00:02:42.700> takes

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
take a lot of bone meal it takes

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.820 
take a lot of bone meal it takes
probably<00:02:43.840> more<00:02:44.049> than<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.290> cobblestone

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
probably more than the cobblestone

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.059 
probably more than the cobblestone
pillar<00:02:45.069> does<00:02:45.310> but<00:02:45.519> it<00:02:45.610> works<00:02:45.880> more<00:02:46.209> reliably

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
pillar does but it works more reliably

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.680 
pillar does but it works more reliably
so<00:02:48.069> this<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.370> probably<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:49.120> best<00:02:49.269> way<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.510> get

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
so this is probably the best way to get

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.670 
so this is probably the best way to get
a<00:02:49.750> good<00:02:49.930> tall<00:02:50.200> oak<00:02:50.440> tree<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:50.739> I<00:02:50.950> found<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:52.269> uh

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
a good tall oak tree that I found so uh

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.370 
a good tall oak tree that I found so uh
BdoubleO<00:02:53.680> hope<00:02:53.829> this<00:02:54.310> helps<00:02:54.579> you<00:02:54.640> out<00:02:54.730> and

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
tall oak trees thank you guys for

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.180 
tall oak trees thank you guys for
watching<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.519> have<00:03:00.549> a<00:03:00.700> wonderful<00:03:00.819> day
