00:00:02.299 --> 00:00:04.080 

my<00:00:03.299> name

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.090 
my name

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:33.650 
my name
I<00:00:04.150> mean

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.860 

scene<00:00:34.660> is<00:00:34.780> very<00:00:34.960> new<00:00:35.230> and<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:36.610> wrapped<00:00:37.239> here<00:00:37.540> and

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
scene is very new and I wrapped here and

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.750 
scene is very new and I wrapped here and
I<00:00:38.170> didn't<00:00:38.530> see<00:00:38.620> that<00:00:38.769> many<00:00:38.920> b-boys<00:00:39.280> and<00:00:39.640> I

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
I didn't see that many b-boys and I

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.610 
I didn't see that many b-boys and I
think<00:00:40.059> like<00:00:40.329> people<00:00:40.510> ET<00:00:40.930> told<00:00:41.170> me<00:00:41.260> that<00:00:41.440> now

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
think like people ET told me that now

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.860 
think like people ET told me that now
only<00:00:42.190> more<00:00:42.400> but<00:00:42.579> there<00:00:42.730> are<00:00:42.790> about<00:00:42.850> 80<00:00:43.210> crew<00:00:43.600> so

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
only more but there are about 80 crew so

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.509 
only more but there are about 80 crew so
I<00:00:44.110> think<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.559> scene<00:00:44.769> is<00:00:44.890> growing<00:00:45.370> growing

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
I think the scene is growing growing

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.299 
I think the scene is growing growing
very<00:00:45.850> fast<00:00:45.970> many<00:00:46.600> new<00:00:46.989> people<00:00:47.199> met<00:00:48.129> I<00:00:48.250> think

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
very fast many new people met I think

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.639 
very fast many new people met I think
with<00:00:49.269> India<00:00:49.720> that<00:00:49.870> is<00:00:49.930> 1<00:00:50.199> million<00:00:50.530> of

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
with India that is 1 million of

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.950 
with India that is 1 million of
inhabitants<00:00:50.800> so<00:00:51.699> I<00:00:52.059> think<00:00:52.329> there<00:00:52.659> are<00:00:52.750> many

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960
