pumping<00:00:58.809> them<00:00:58.930> out<00:00:59.489> it's<00:01:00.489> debatable<00:01:01.210> whether

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
pumping them out it's debatable whether

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.259 
pumping them out it's debatable whether
this<00:01:01.870> is<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:02.049> best<00:01:02.379> way<00:01:02.559> to<00:01:02.620> do<00:01:02.830> them<00:01:03.010> but<00:01:03.760> I<00:01:04.150> am

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
this is the best way to do them but I am

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.060 
this is the best way to do them but I am
here<00:01:04.479> to<00:01:04.570> experiment<00:01:05.170> I<00:01:05.290> want<00:01:05.530> to<00:01:05.619> see<00:01:05.799> what<00:01:05.950> my

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
here to experiment I want to see what my

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.820 
here to experiment I want to see what my
body<00:01:06.310> is<00:01:06.430> going<00:01:06.880> to<00:01:07.119> respond<00:01:07.659> to<00:01:07.960> so<00:01:08.770> I'm

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
body is going to respond to so I'm

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.469 
body is going to respond to so I'm
trying<00:01:08.979> to<00:01:09.130> build<00:01:09.220> sighs<00:01:09.549> and<00:01:10.500> here<00:01:11.500> I<00:01:11.650> believe

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
trying to build sighs and here I believe

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.880 
trying to build sighs and here I believe
pumping<00:01:13.479> them<00:01:13.630> out<00:01:13.720> in<00:01:13.960> this<00:01:14.080> manner<00:01:14.350> is<00:01:14.619> going

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
pumping them out in this manner is going

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.969 
pumping them out in this manner is going
to<00:01:15.040> build<00:01:15.280> some<00:01:16.119> good<00:01:16.330> size<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:17.740> quite

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
to build some good size not quite

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.279 
to build some good size not quite
hitting<00:01:18.250> parallel<00:01:18.729> not<00:01:19.570> extending<00:01:20.140> all<00:01:20.259> the

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
hitting parallel not extending all the

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.249 
hitting parallel not extending all the
way<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:21.490> not<00:01:21.670> a<00:01:21.729> bad<00:01:22.000> thing<00:01:22.270> going<00:01:23.200> to

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
way it's not a bad thing going to

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.469 
way it's not a bad thing going to
experiment<00:01:23.649> see<00:01:24.130> how<00:01:24.250> it<00:01:24.369> goes<00:01:24.549> for<00:01:24.759> me<00:01:24.909> maybe

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
glutes now i'm not doing that here i'm

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.249 
glutes now i'm not doing that here i'm
just<00:01:59.319> pumping<00:01:59.829> them<00:01:59.979> out<00:02:00.100> so<00:02:01.030> i<00:02:01.479> might<00:02:01.990> change

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
just pumping them out so i might change

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.080 
just pumping them out so i might change
it<00:02:02.409> up<00:02:02.499> in<00:02:02.679> the<00:02:02.740> next<00:02:02.770> couple<00:02:03.100> of<00:02:03.280> weeks<00:02:03.549> who

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
it up in the next couple of weeks who

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.609 
it up in the next couple of weeks who
knows<00:02:04.329> maybe<00:02:04.659> i'll<00:02:04.869> stick<00:02:05.079> to<00:02:05.109> this<00:02:05.319> for<00:02:05.590> a

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
knows maybe i'll stick to this for a

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.739 
knows maybe i'll stick to this for a
while<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:06.069> standard<00:02:06.429> way<00:02:06.549> of<00:02:06.579> doing<00:02:06.969> it<00:02:07.149> but<00:02:07.390> i

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:07.749 
while the standard way of doing it but i

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.580 
while the standard way of doing it but i
think<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.259> chi<00:02:08.470> greenway<00:02:09.039> is<00:02:09.630> a<00:02:10.630> great<00:02:11.319> way<00:02:11.530> to

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
think the chi greenway is a great way to

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.440 
think the chi greenway is a great way to
build<00:02:12.069> those<00:02:12.310> lights<00:02:12.550> up<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.000> i<00:02:13.060> think<00:02:13.330> i've

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
build those lights up and i think i've

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.480 
build those lights up and i think i've
noticed<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.870> lot<00:02:14.050> of<00:02:14.080> uh<00:02:14.260> i<00:02:14.710> have<00:02:15.220> noticed

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
noticed a lot of uh i have noticed

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.670 
noticed a lot of uh i have noticed
results<00:02:15.910> doing<00:02:16.300> it<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.569> way<00:02:16.600> so<00:02:17.050> i<00:02:17.080> might

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680

too<00:02:52.560> heavy<00:02:52.830> really<00:02:53.400> just<00:02:53.580> trying<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.820> get<00:02:53.910> a

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
too heavy really just trying to get a

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.010 
too heavy really just trying to get a
pump<00:02:55.100> like<00:02:56.100> I<00:02:56.190> did<00:02:56.340> 12<00:02:56.700> reps<00:02:57.090> each<00:02:57.270> leg<00:02:57.330> here

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
pump like I did 12 reps each leg here

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.210 
pump like I did 12 reps each leg here
and<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:59.130> see<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.370> do<00:02:59.460> the<00:02:59.670> same<00:02:59.940> thing<00:03:00.240> for

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
and you see I do the same thing for

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.640 
and you see I do the same thing for
standing<00:03:02.220> leg<00:03:02.490> curls<00:03:02.940> hammy<00:03:03.930> curls<00:03:04.320> snacks

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
standing leg curls hammy curls snacks

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.230 
standing leg curls hammy curls snacks
keep<00:03:05.010> calling<00:03:05.250> leg<00:03:05.430> curls<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:05.790> guess<00:03:05.940> they<00:03:06.090> are

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
keep calling leg curls I guess they are

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.740 
keep calling leg curls I guess they are
but<00:03:06.510> hammy<00:03:06.780> curls<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:07.740> I'm<00:03:08.730> things<00:03:09.240> like<00:03:09.480> this

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
but hammy curls so I'm things like this

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.380 
but hammy curls so I'm things like this
I'm<00:03:10.020> basically<00:03:10.680> done<00:03:11.070> you<00:03:11.790> know<00:03:11.940> I've<00:03:12.360> been

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
I'm basically done you know I've been

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.990 
I'm basically done you know I've been
there<00:03:12.600> for<00:03:12.900> maybe<00:03:13.080> 45<00:03:13.950> minutes<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.520> got<00:03:14.790> all

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
there for maybe 45 minutes I got all

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.600 
there for maybe 45 minutes I got all
those<00:03:15.330> exercises<00:03:15.960> in<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.530> now<00:03:17.010> I'm<00:03:17.190> pushing

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
those exercises in and now I'm pushing

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.400 
those exercises in and now I'm pushing
these<00:03:17.760> out<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.270> it<00:03:18.720> might<00:03:18.870> not<00:03:18.990> look<00:03:19.170> like<00:03:19.380> it

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
these out and it might not look like it

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.860 
these out and it might not look like it
but<00:03:19.590> this<00:03:19.800> is<00:03:20.010> really<00:03:20.400> hard<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:21.120> when<00:03:21.660> I<00:03:21.690> go

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
but this is really hard and when I go

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.140 
but this is really hard and when I go
into<00:03:22.020> the<00:03:22.140> hammy<00:03:22.410> curls<00:03:22.800> you<00:03:23.520> see<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:24.000> like

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
into the hammy curls you see that like

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.850 
into the hammy curls you see that like
my<00:03:24.300> body's<00:03:24.690> raising<00:03:25.080> up<00:03:25.200> quite<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.440> bit<00:03:25.710> and

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
my body's raising up quite a bit and

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.670 
my body's raising up quite a bit and
it's<00:03:26.100> not<00:03:26.250> a<00:03:26.280> lot<00:03:26.490> of<00:03:26.520> weight<00:03:26.790> now<00:03:27.390> my<00:03:27.960> legs<00:03:28.320> are

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
it's not a lot of weight now my legs are

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.070 
it's not a lot of weight now my legs are
just<00:03:29.130> about<00:03:29.370> done<00:03:29.430> at<00:03:29.880> this<00:03:30.000> point<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.900> is

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
just about done at this point this is

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.470 
just about done at this point this is
like<00:03:31.290> me<00:03:31.770> saying<00:03:32.070> okay<00:03:32.730> I<00:03:32.760> got<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.210> get<00:03:33.300> these

like me saying okay I got to get these

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.530 
like me saying okay I got to get these
in<00:03:33.750> this<00:03:34.080> probably<00:03:34.350> my<00:03:34.470> fourth<00:03:34.740> set<00:03:35.010> here<00:03:35.340> and

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
in this probably my fourth set here and

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.450 
in this probably my fourth set here and
I'm<00:03:36.540> really<00:03:37.110> just<00:03:37.440> trying<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.860> pump<00:03:38.160> them<00:03:38.370> out

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
I'm really just trying to pump them out

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.520 
I'm really just trying to pump them out
as<00:03:38.730> best<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:39.120> can<00:03:39.180> there<00:03:40.170> are<00:03:40.260> there<00:03:40.380> almost

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
as best I can there are there almost

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.440 
as best I can there are there almost
half<00:03:40.890> reps<00:03:41.220> I<00:03:41.400> can't<00:03:41.580> even<00:03:41.790> squeeze<00:03:42.120> all<00:03:42.420> the

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
half reps I can't even squeeze all the

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.440 
half reps I can't even squeeze all the
way<00:03:42.570> to<00:03:42.630> the<00:03:42.780> top<00:03:42.860> so<00:03:43.860> you<00:03:44.280> know<00:03:45.240> with<00:03:45.420> that

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
way to the top so you know with that

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.140 
way to the top so you know with that
this<00:03:46.320> is<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.620> purpose<00:03:47.100> of<00:03:47.250> hypertrophy<00:03:47.940> days

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
this is the purpose of hypertrophy days

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.030 
this is the purpose of hypertrophy days
you're<00:03:48.570> really<00:03:48.930> trying<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.470> make<00:03:49.620> those

muscles fatigued really trying to get

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.920 
muscles fatigued really trying to get
them<00:03:52.080> pumped<00:03:52.470> up<00:03:53.000> you<00:03:54.000> know<00:03:54.090> I'm<00:03:54.390> not<00:03:54.600> afraid

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
them pumped up you know I'm not afraid

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.140 
them pumped up you know I'm not afraid
to<00:03:55.290> do<00:03:55.440> half<00:03:55.680> reps<00:03:56.040> on<00:03:56.280> these<00:03:56.520> I'm<00:03:56.730> not<00:03:56.850> afraid

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
to do half reps on these I'm not afraid

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.440 
to do half reps on these I'm not afraid
to<00:03:57.300> have<00:03:57.720> somewhat<00:03:58.620> sloppy<00:03:58.980> form<00:03:59.490> on<00:03:59.790> some<00:04:00.300> of

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
these reps and some of these sets I'm

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.850 
these reps and some of these sets I'm
trying<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.570> experiment<00:04:03.990> trying<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.650> build
