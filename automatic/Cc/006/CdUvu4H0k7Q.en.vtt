00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.550 
train simulator and densha de go it's my
favorite<00:01:39.060> because<00:01:39.210> they<00:01:39.539> use<00:01:39.720> real<00:01:40.110> train

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
favorite because they use real train

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.130 
favorite because they use real train
lines<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.190> film<00:01:41.729> them<00:01:41.910> digitally<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.990> that

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
usually the densha de go series just

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.150 
usually the densha de go series just
uses<00:01:47.850> computer<00:01:48.420> graphics<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:49.170> almost<00:01:49.920> all<00:01:50.100> of

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
uses computer graphics and almost all of

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.310 
uses computer graphics and almost all of
the<00:01:50.460> console<00:01:50.940> versions<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> special

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
the console versions have a special

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.010 
the console versions have a special
controller<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.160> you<00:01:53.220> can<00:01:53.460> buy<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:54.630> really

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
controller that you can buy this really

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.719 
controller that you can buy this really
makes<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.350> controls<00:01:55.830> more<00:01:56.039> second<00:01:56.520> nature

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
makes the controls more second nature

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.480 
makes the controls more second nature
and<00:01:57.090> it's<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.600> more<00:01:57.780> fun<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.140> play<00:01:58.350> with<00:01:58.560> word

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
and it's just more fun to play with word

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.300 
and it's just more fun to play with word
of<00:01:59.670> warning<00:01:59.880> however<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.929> ps1<00:02:01.500> controllers

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
of warning however the ps1 controllers

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.999 
of warning however the ps1 controllers
do<00:02:02.520> not<00:02:02.819> work<00:02:03.119> with<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.509> ps2<00:02:03.840> system<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.950> you

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
do not work with the ps2 system so you

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.339 
do not work with the ps2 system so you
may<00:02:05.310> end<00:02:05.580> up<00:02:05.819> owning<00:02:06.119> several<00:02:06.630> controllers

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 
may end up owning several controllers

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:09.529 
may end up owning several controllers
for<00:02:07.590> several<00:02:08.009> different<00:02:08.130> systems<00:02:08.759> to

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
for several different systems to

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.600 
for several different systems to
decrease<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.170> traction<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:11.009> make<00:02:11.160> your<00:02:11.340> train

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
decrease the traction to make your train

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.630 
decrease the traction to make your train
go<00:02:11.790> forward<00:02:12.270> push<00:02:12.959> back<00:02:13.349> on<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.890> d-pad<00:02:14.400> or

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
go forward push back on the d-pad or

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.300 
go forward push back on the d-pad or
pull<00:02:15.180> back<00:02:15.420> on<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.930> special<00:02:16.349> controller<00:02:16.680> to

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
pull back on the special controller to

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.640 
pull back on the special controller to
increase<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.970> traction<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.569> slow<00:02:18.810> down<00:02:19.020> push

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
increase the traction to slow down push

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.890 
increase the traction to slow down push
