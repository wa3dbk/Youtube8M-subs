Christmas<00:02:11.910> time<00:02:11.940> called<00:02:12.330> bodybugg<00:02:12.810> where<00:02:13.080> he

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
Christmas time called bodybugg where he

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.340 
Christmas time called bodybugg where he
measured<00:02:14.760> all<00:02:14.880> his<00:02:15.060> calories<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.810> all<00:02:16.110> the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
measured all his calories and all the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.770 
measured all his calories and all the
calories<00:02:16.710> he<00:02:17.150> he<00:02:18.150> took<00:02:18.330> in<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.630> all<00:02:18.690> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
calories he he took in and all the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.780 
calories he he took in and all the
calories<00:02:18.960> he<00:02:19.230> burned<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:20.040> that<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.490> was<00:02:20.610> just

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
calories he burned so that it was just

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.340 
calories he burned so that it was just
simple<00:02:21.060> plus<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.420> minus<00:02:21.660> math<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.140> he

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
simple plus and minus math so that he

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.920 
simple plus and minus math so that he
could<00:02:22.500> lose<00:02:22.680> weight<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.330> then<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.510> think<00:02:24.750> it

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
could lose weight and then I think it

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.120 
could lose weight and then I think it
was<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.520> February<00:02:26.520> or<00:02:26.760> March<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:27.600> he

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
was in February or March that he

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.830 
was in February or March that he
received<00:02:29.130> maybe<00:02:29.790> was<00:02:29.940> April<00:02:30.270> that<00:02:30.720> he

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
received maybe was April that he

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.210 
received maybe was April that he
received<00:02:31.170> confirmation<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.740> he<00:02:31.890> was<00:02:32.010> going

received confirmation that he was going
to<00:02:32.340> Cancun<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.000> so<00:02:33.990> he<00:02:34.700> beefed<00:02:35.700> up<00:02:35.880> his

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060
