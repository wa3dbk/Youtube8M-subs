00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
twice more so source SRC videos /video

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:26.050 
twice more so source SRC videos /video
dot<00:03:17.220> web<00:03:17.970> M<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.980> type<00:03:20.690> is<00:03:22.400> video<00:03:23.400> /<00:03:23.959> web<00:03:24.959> M

source again SRC equals videos / OG v

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.920 
source again SRC equals videos / OG v
that's<00:03:37.830> kind<00:03:38.069> of<00:03:38.100> our<00:03:38.250> OGG<00:03:38.430> file<00:03:38.760> oops<00:03:39.299> videos

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
that's kind of our OGG file oops videos

OGG<00:03:51.620> so<00:03:52.620> it<00:03:52.920> sits<00:03:53.130> up<00:03:53.790> video<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:57.180> let's<00:03:57.209> test

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
OGG so it sits up video so let's test

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.350 
OGG so it sits up video so let's test
this<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:58.530> if<00:03:58.620> i<00:03:58.739> save<00:03:58.980> this<00:03:59.160> HTML<00:03:59.760> file<00:04:00.030> and

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
this so if i save this HTML file and

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.729 
this so if i save this HTML file and
open<00:04:00.780> up<00:04:01.620> google<00:04:01.980> chrome<00:04:02.250> refresh<00:04:02.880> this<00:04:03.739> you

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
open up google chrome refresh this you

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.250 
open up google chrome refresh this you
can<00:04:04.890> see<00:04:05.010> we've<00:04:05.130> got<00:04:05.220> this<00:04:05.310> giant<00:04:05.700> black<00:04:06.540> blob

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
can see we've got this giant black blob

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.140 
can see we've got this giant black blob
on<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.709> screen<00:04:08.040> and<00:04:08.220> this<00:04:08.579> is<00:04:08.880> to<00:04:09.030> be<00:04:09.120> expected

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
on the screen and this is to be expected

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.550 
on the screen and this is to be expected
because<00:04:09.799> we<00:04:10.799> haven't<00:04:11.130> given<00:04:11.609> many<00:04:12.060> sort<00:04:12.450> of<00:04:12.570> we

of<00:07:08.810> the<00:07:08.900> the<00:07:09.319> margin<00:07:09.800> and<00:07:09.949> the<00:07:10.009> padding<00:07:10.460> that

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:10.490 
of the the margin and the padding that

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.969 
of the the margin and the padding that
would<00:07:11.360> be<00:07:11.509> there<00:07:11.690> usually<00:07:13.090> so<00:07:14.090> I<00:07:14.539> think<00:07:15.469> that

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:15.979 
would be there usually so I think that

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:18.279 
would be there usually so I think that
will<00:07:16.130> do<00:07:16.430> for<00:07:16.880> this<00:07:17.029> this<00:07:17.900> part<00:07:18.139> of<00:07:18.229> the

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:18.289 
will do for this this part of the

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:21.670 
will do for this this part of the
tutorial<00:07:19.630> in<00:07:20.630> fact<00:07:20.899> what<00:07:21.020> we<00:07:21.110> can<00:07:21.259> probably<00:07:21.500> do

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 
tutorial in fact what we can probably do

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.230 
tutorial in fact what we can probably do
next<00:07:22.070> is<00:07:22.190> take<00:07:22.399> a<00:07:22.460> little<00:07:22.729> bit<00:07:22.880> more<00:07:23.060> of<00:07:23.120> an

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 
next is take a little bit more of an

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.010 
next is take a little bit more of an
in-depth<00:07:23.810> look<00:07:23.960> at<00:07:24.580> some<00:07:25.580> of<00:07:25.729> the<00:07:26.020> parameters

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:27.020 
in-depth look at some of the parameters

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:32.139 
in-depth look at some of the parameters
that<00:07:27.649> you<00:07:27.800> can<00:07:28.009> add<00:07:28.539> to<00:07:30.070> the<00:07:31.070> video<00:07:31.460> element

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:32.149 
that you can add to the video element

00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:34.089 
that you can add to the video element
and<00:07:32.630> I'm<00:07:32.779> going<00:07:32.990> to<00:07:33.050> discuss<00:07:33.409> these<00:07:33.649> in<00:07:33.889> detail

00:07:34.089 --> 00:07:34.099 
and I'm going to discuss these in detail

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:38.290 
and I'm going to discuss these in detail
tell<00:07:34.729> you<00:07:34.820> what<00:07:35.000> they<00:07:35.120> do<00:07:36.070> and<00:07:37.070> perhaps<00:07:38.029> give

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:38.300 
tell you what they do and perhaps give

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.029 
tell you what they do and perhaps give
you<00:07:38.389> a<00:07:38.419> little<00:07:38.509> bit<00:07:38.719> of<00:07:38.810> advice<00:07:39.050> on<00:07:39.349> what<00:07:39.979> to

00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:40.039 
you a little bit of advice on what to

00:07:40.039 --> 00:07:43.870 
you a little bit of advice on what to
use<00:07:40.490> and<00:07:40.699> perhaps<00:07:41.240> what<00:07:41.630> not<00:07:41.960> to<00:07:41.990> use<00:07:42.440> but<00:07:42.880> the

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:43.880 
use and perhaps what not to use but the

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.550 
use and perhaps what not to use but the
parameters<00:07:44.270> are<00:07:44.509> as<00:07:44.630> simple<00:07:44.990> as<00:07:45.050> adding<00:07:45.199> in

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:45.560 
parameters are as simple as adding in

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.560 
parameters are as simple as adding in
these<00:07:47.409> little<00:07:48.409> sort<00:07:48.589> of<00:07:48.740> you<00:07:49.070> know<00:07:49.449> in<00:07:50.449> this

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:50.570 
these little sort of you know in this

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.600 
these little sort of you know in this
case<00:07:50.750> controls<00:07:51.229> you<00:07:51.710> can<00:07:51.860> add<00:07:51.949> a<00:07:51.979> poster<00:07:52.460> image

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:52.610 
case controls you can add a poster image

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:54.999 
case controls you can add a poster image
that's<00:07:52.759> one<00:07:52.940> thing<00:07:53.089> we<00:07:53.210> are<00:07:53.330> going<00:07:53.360> to<00:07:53.570> do<00:07:54.009> you

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:55.009 
that's one thing we are going to do you

00:07:55.009 --> 00:07:56.800 
that's one thing we are going to do you
could<00:07:55.190> set<00:07:55.550> the<00:07:55.669> height<00:07:55.849> if<00:07:56.120> you<00:07:56.240> wanted<00:07:56.599> to

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:56.810 
could set the height if you wanted to

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.570 
could set the height if you wanted to
it's<00:07:57.409> not<00:07:57.620> necessary<00:07:58.039> to<00:07:58.099> set<00:07:58.310> the<00:07:58.399> height

00:07:58.570 --> 00:07:58.580 
it's not necessary to set the height

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.810 
it's not necessary to set the height
I'll<00:07:58.849> talk<00:07:59.599> more<00:07:59.659> about<00:07:59.870> that<00:07:59.990> later<00:08:00.110> but<00:08:00.820> for

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:01.820 
I'll talk more about that later but for

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.999 
I'll talk more about that later but for
now<00:08:01.880> you've<00:08:02.300> actually<00:08:02.539> got<00:08:02.839> your<00:08:02.990> video<00:08:03.110> more

00:08:03.999 --> 00:08:04.009 
now you've actually got your video more

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:05.950 
now you've actually got your video more
or<00:08:04.159> less<00:08:04.219> working<00:08:04.940> but<00:08:05.089> there's<00:08:05.330> a<00:08:05.360> little<00:08:05.779> bit

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:05.960 
or less working but there's a little bit

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.450 
or less working but there's a little bit
more<00:08:06.110> stuff<00:08:06.320> that<00:08:06.409> i<00:08:06.440> want<00:08:06.589> to<00:08:06.649> show<00:08:06.800> you<00:08:06.830> so<00:08:07.219> i
