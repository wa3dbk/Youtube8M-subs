had been put into it and it was
tremendous<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.439> think<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.009> dragon<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.610> is

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
tremendous I think the dragon is is

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.889 
tremendous I think the dragon is is
amazing<00:00:33.540> such<00:00:33.780> detail<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:35.149> fantastic<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.750> map

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
amazing such detail and fantastic to map

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.479 
amazing such detail and fantastic to map
it<00:00:37.050> out<00:00:37.170> what<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.469> do<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.829> use<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> big<00:00:38.280> length

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
it out what I do is I use a big length

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.660 
it out what I do is I use a big length
of<00:00:38.640> string<00:00:38.879> with<00:00:39.480> knots<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.640> I

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
of string with knots in it and and so I

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.060 
of string with knots in it and and so I
can<00:00:42.090> strike<00:00:42.329> arcs<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.960> bit<00:00:43.110> like<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.590> technical

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
can strike arcs a bit like a technical

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:52.750 
can strike arcs a bit like a technical
drawing<00:00:44.370> or<00:00:44.789> an<00:00:45.090> architect's<00:00:45.539> drawing

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
me about four hours just running and

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.820 
me about four hours just running and
having<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.450> think<00:01:33.660> as<00:01:33.930> well<00:01:34.110> at<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> same<00:01:34.410> time

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
having to think as well at the same time

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.730 
having to think as well at the same time
as<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.310> labor<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:36.270> really<00:01:36.869> quite<00:01:37.050> nice<00:01:37.200> and

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
then a bit trying to beat the tide and

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.120 
then a bit trying to beat the tide and
especially<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:40.410> time<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.650> year<00:01:40.740> trying<00:01:41.040> to

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
especially this time of year trying to

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.100

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
quite cloudy today I haven't had to do

quite cloudy today I haven't had to do
that<00:01:44.510> Simon<00:01:45.510> never<00:01:45.840> quite<00:01:46.200> knows<00:01:46.470> what<00:01:46.770> it's

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
that Simon never quite knows what it's

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.890 
that Simon never quite knows what it's
than<00:01:47.160> it<00:01:47.280> looked<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.670> until<00:01:48.119> he<00:01:48.300> goes<00:01:48.479> up<00:01:48.690> on

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
than it looked like until he goes up on

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.830 
than it looked like until he goes up on
the<00:01:48.990> cliff<00:01:49.200> when<00:01:49.410> it's<00:01:49.560> finished
