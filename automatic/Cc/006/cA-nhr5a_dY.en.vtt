00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.910
 we call two very good sportsmen and 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.010
 wonderful a historic couple of 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.530
 divers from the very rich medal collection 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.880
 five times gold medal for Europeans 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.160
 silver medal to the last 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.910
 barcelona world championships of 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.539
 2013 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.539
 they are tania cagnotto and francesca 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.539
 Dallapè 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:39.150
 and you got the ball there, the stairs 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:41.590
 pleasure that opens in split vi 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.809
 please forward 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.550
 Well, let's be late 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.000
 It seemed wiper of 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.860
 machine and therefore you always work 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.290
 together tufo always together 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.360
 but I was wondering here is precisely the 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:00.340
 stature must be more or less similar 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.780
 we are not two more economic giants 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.700
 whether or not to eat both the same 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.199
 things because if one eats the straw 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.360
 unknown rebel need when eating the 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.729
 adage first exact pajata will thank you 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.930
 a problem and therefore need to be more 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.270
 or less of the same height 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.410
 that is, they could not throw themselves kind 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.600
 platinette and fassino together 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:23.050
 they would arrive is otherwise very well 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.670
 then another question but instead of 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.320
 throw yourself from 10 meters for a medal 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:32.160
 do not make gold before you go to a 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.160
 goldsmith I thought not to remake this truth 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.399
 then it is a question but how to do it 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.710
 Dry the towel 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.570
 davide don't base these here that you 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.420
 dive then I have to have a bathrobe 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.929
 giant the beach towel holds dry 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.140
 with a layer of toilet paper like it 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.140
 same 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.740
 well then we have the result of 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.740
 televoting 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.840
 meanwhile let's move here in the dance tuft 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:10.479
 here you see we put the music of the 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:15.790
 shark that is very clever here you can 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:19.239
 come here allergies you the skyline 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.260
 begins to stretch his hands to the brakes e 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.260
 pedal pedal 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.189
 but what does it mean to unite the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.950
 fragile do not put punctuation 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.780
 make everything stuck together me 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.980
 I wondered why the honorable rockets didn't 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.079
 ago rapper I thought then we can give 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:52.280
 the result 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:52.280
 the final song is for the maras 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.310
 thank you 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:05.120
 thanks franca you can go call you 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.579
 goodbye you don't hear but how we have it 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.680
 even the flowers you can take them to must 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:12.319
 take me everywhere else in this 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.819
 they don't ask me how to become 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:19.719
 divers you have the pope that that between 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.489
 the other was also a piece of dumpling 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:24.319
 I remember but you will do that 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.700
 I felt like a star in the catch 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.409
 with riina but instead you your parents 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.419
 we started by chance doing a 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:35.060
 swimming course is my current one 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:38.239
 then she was my teacher 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.909
 being a very lively little girl looking 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.400
 become a game we always play 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.049
 then everyone from lia wrote a 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.699
 message to my parents and from there it is 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.209

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:50.569

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.430

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.829
 I can't even stara gala then if 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.269

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.060

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.449
