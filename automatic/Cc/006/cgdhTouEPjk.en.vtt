00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.250
 very well before you start working 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.250
 requires a work table because it is impossible 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.539
 ok now we have ordered the things that we are going to use for the generator 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:16.589
 wind 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:18.570
 then we have here 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.970
 a computer fan 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.909
 that we are going to use the propeller 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:27.399
 it seems the myths like this drill these voltage starmedia multimeter that 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:28.960
 let's generate 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.249
 a joker for welding 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.249
 we have a two screwdrivers a knife 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.340
 here we have a dynamo 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.190
 that yes it will generate the electric current 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.190
 we have given several screws we have several months 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.240
 tabárez 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.770
 this pedestal this last soldier a plate that we will use for 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.160
 put up with 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.580
 to the generator 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.140
 and this we will apply then on 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.970
 On this base 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.070
 we make some points in the tube where we are going to take a few pigs 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.910
 we are giving it 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.910
 hoa 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.640
 colima morelos viva workers voice 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.880
 now we are going again, it will help us to grow the legislator 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.760
 in an interview 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.760
 and that is legislating mons with this are men 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.119
 now we aim for the donor as if it were a horned races 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.340
 so that the first of this kind 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.300
 now let's drop these generator cables 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.200
 for which we are going to use 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.520
 this welding part seeing that we are facing you 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.260
 we are willing to talk to this year's hunger 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.420
 we have already been making all the effort 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.700
 this day is 0 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.800
 now we try to make the employer 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.790
 that we are going to use as the propeller of the wind generator we are going to adapt 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.059
 this the stec-ic 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:12.439
 this is a fan of 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.509
 this computer 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:19.059
 this moment we give them constraints coupled the propeller to the generator 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:22.059
 through this little piece of plastic tube 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:28.779
 now we are going to fix the generator to this base which is a wood 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.659
 we make holes for equipment of some screws 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.759
 we have placed some screws here 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:42.679
 and now we are adjusting with 

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:45.679
 screwdriver 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:51.309
 we make a true test that the helix can turn quietly now 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:54.379
 We are fixing the cables of the main support column 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.729
 with this ribbon 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:01.499
 humor we are preparing these little this yellow focus suffers 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:04.319
 to establish connections 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.509
 we're not going to stay with the three elevator levels 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:10.599
 to be able to learn a little weird yellow 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.689
 this plan can live 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.339
 let's use these connectors 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:18.419
 male and female 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.599
 we are connecting the cables now 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.599
 to this one by mere 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:26.989
 now we look for 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.639
 the terminals in this way so that all the cables he's doing 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.639
 can count 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:38.769
 now we have here and the assembled generator completely ready to 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.479
 do the first tests 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:44.239
 we already have the corpses placed that comes from scratch 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:49.299
 until this by mere commissions we will try 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.529
 the generation of the ex and AIDS of nextel touched him in this sea and I 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:58.359
 you came in white transparency 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.259
 let's first try the white light for which we connect then 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:05.569
 the two great objectives of this Monday, February 2 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.569
 let's use a blower a hair dryer 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.309
 to simulate the wind 

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:13.949
 about the turbine of the genus 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.949
 we turn on 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:33.529
 chávez 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.600
 we make of the change of conditions we have put a black danger 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.689
 in the cable that corresponds to him because 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:51.539
 if it is connected upside down lights are not lit for little promotion 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.189
 now we do the neighborhood committees to see 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:10.089
 the test with lt red color actors shock 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:13.409
 connect 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:16.409
 we have the sofa again 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:28.029
 this is the last massive ignition test we have placed some bridges 

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:33.159
 to distribute the electrical power that comes impeccably crazy and the cable 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:35.849
 black that comes from generator 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:38.849
 from the sidewalk we turn on the air 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:04.849
 besides these sources 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.479
 finally we will do a test to measure what matters that is generated 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.240
 in this link 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.339
 generator the goal and eat 

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.909
 we won
