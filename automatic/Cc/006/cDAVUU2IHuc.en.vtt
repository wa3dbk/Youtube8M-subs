00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420

that i picked up when i was watching
this<00:01:54.420> in<00:01:54.659> theater<00:01:54.960> mode<00:01:55.310> they<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.490> two

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
this in theater mode they have two

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.030 
this in theater mode they have two
trophy<00:01:57.119> systems<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.110> know<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.469> range<00:01:58.710> of

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
trophy systems and I know the range of

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.590 
trophy systems and I know the range of
protection<00:01:59.670> was<00:01:59.820> buff<00:02:00.000> with<00:02:00.210> those<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
protection was buff with those in the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.780 
protection was buff with those in the
most<00:02:00.750> recent<00:02:00.899> patch<00:02:01.229> but<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.130> kind<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.460> BS

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
most recent patch but this is kind of BS

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.450 
most recent patch but this is kind of BS
a<00:02:03.409> because<00:02:04.409> I<00:02:04.649> think<00:02:04.920> that's<00:02:05.070> still<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> little

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
a because I think that's still a little

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.419 
a because I think that's still a little
too<00:02:05.640> far<00:02:05.820> away<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.329> be<00:02:06.710> not<00:02:07.710> once<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.190> see<00:02:08.399> a

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
too far away and be not once you see a

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.130 
too far away and be not once you see a
projectile<00:02:09.000> come<00:02:09.420> out<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.720> trophy

system either one of them and destroy

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.940 
system either one of them and destroy
the<00:02:13.470> c4

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
the c4

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.729 
the c4
just<00:02:14.190> disappears<00:02:14.730> in<00:02:14.879> a<00:02:14.940> puff<00:02:14.970> of<00:02:15.120> smoke<00:02:15.739> it's

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.720 
seen I can't explain it but the whole
first<00:02:21.150> round<00:02:21.510> our<00:02:21.690> equipment<00:02:22.140> was<00:02:22.260> fine<00:02:22.730> but

first round our equipment was fine but
then<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.060> entire<00:02:24.180> second<00:02:24.959> round<00:02:25.140> we<00:02:25.440> couldn't

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
then the entire second round we couldn't

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.690 
then the entire second round we couldn't
do<00:02:25.739> shit<00:02:25.769> then<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.819> get<00:02:26.970> smoked<00:02:27.680> so<00:02:28.680> here<00:02:29.099> they

deal it happens but because our

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.280 
deal it happens but because our
launchers<00:02:35.069> are<00:02:35.310> now<00:02:35.550> incapable<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.810> firing

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
launchers are now incapable of firing

beyond a certain distance that lodestar

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.960 
beyond a certain distance that lodestar
is<00:02:40.140> invincible<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:41.459> i'm<00:02:41.640> going<00:02:41.760> to<00:02:41.819> show<00:02:41.940> you

four missiles to shoot down I forget
exactly<00:02:50.220> how<00:02:50.549> much<00:02:50.819> it's<00:02:51.060> pretty<00:02:51.330> powerful

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
exactly how much it's pretty powerful

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.050 
exactly how much it's pretty powerful
it's<00:02:51.959> got<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.140> lot<00:02:52.319> of<00:02:52.349> flares<00:02:52.670> but<00:02:53.670> as<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:53.940> can

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
it's got a lot of flares but as you can

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.809 
it's got a lot of flares but as you can
see<00:02:55.099> none<00:02:56.099> of<00:02:56.190> them<00:02:56.340> are<00:02:56.430> getting<00:02:56.640> through

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
see none of them are getting through

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.000 
see none of them are getting through
it's<00:02:57.030> like<00:02:57.239> I<00:02:57.480> don't<00:02:58.319> know<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.739> film

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
it's like I don't know that film

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.770 
it's like I don't know that film
independence<00:02:59.610> day<00:02:59.760> when<00:03:00.000> they<00:03:00.120> shot<00:03:00.360> missiles

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
independence day when they shot missiles

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.960 
independence day when they shot missiles
at<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.680> alien<00:03:02.010> ships<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.519> they<00:03:02.610> had<00:03:02.760> like

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
at the alien ships and they had like

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.670 
at the alien ships and they had like
this<00:03:03.150> shield<00:03:03.810> around<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.200> hall<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.560> they

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
this shield around the hall and they

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.080 
this shield around the hall and they
couldn't<00:03:04.890> get<00:03:05.069> any<00:03:05.220> missiles<00:03:05.519> through<00:03:05.730> this

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
couldn't get any missiles through this

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.750 
couldn't get any missiles through this
is<00:03:06.269> exactly<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.900> same<00:03:07.110> thing<00:03:07.349> our<00:03:08.010> missiles

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
is exactly the same thing our missiles

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.190 
is exactly the same thing our missiles
are<00:03:08.880> just<00:03:09.060> disappearing<00:03:09.630> in<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.810> puff<00:03:09.989> of<00:03:10.019> smoke

are just disappearing in a puff of smoke
that<00:03:10.500> lodestar<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.190> invincible<00:03:11.489> we<00:03:12.450> can't<00:03:12.690> do

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
that lodestar is invincible we can't do

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.740 
that lodestar is invincible we can't do
a<00:03:12.870> damn<00:03:13.140> thing<00:03:13.380> to<00:03:13.440> shoot<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.829> down<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.750> we

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
right above the tree there and that

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.520 
right above the tree there and that
lodestar<00:03:39.000> stayed<00:03:39.600> up<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.810> whole<00:03:39.840> time<00:03:40.200> so

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
lodestar stayed up the whole time so

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.000 
lodestar stayed up the whole time so
here's<00:03:41.489> another<00:03:41.700> example<00:03:41.900> throw<00:03:42.900> some<00:03:43.109> c4<00:03:43.319> did

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
here's another example throw some c4 did

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
this is pretty interesting the minute I

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.050 
this is pretty interesting the minute I
drop<00:04:16.109> this<00:04:16.289> tack<00:04:16.560> insert<00:04:16.919> it's<00:04:17.700> going<00:04:18.000> to

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
drop this tack insert it's going to

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.270 
drop this tack insert it's going to
vanish<00:04:18.660> it's<00:04:19.169> it<00:04:19.349> looks<00:04:19.590> like<00:04:19.769> I<00:04:19.859> just<00:04:19.919> took<00:04:20.190> a

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
vanish it's it looks like I just took a

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.469 
vanish it's it looks like I just took a
shit<00:04:20.489> on<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.700> ground<00:04:20.930> poof<00:04:21.930> I<00:04:22.430> farted<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:23.640> the

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
shit on the ground poof I farted and the

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.830 
shit on the ground poof I farted and the
tacking<00:04:24.750> starts<00:04:24.930> gone<00:04:25.250> so<00:04:26.250> show<00:04:26.550> to<00:04:26.610> you<00:04:26.820> again

and<00:04:27.960> I<00:04:28.050> decided<00:04:28.260> to<00:04:28.440> pause<00:04:28.650> it<00:04:28.680> here<00:04:29.010> because<00:04:29.130> I

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
and I decided to pause it here because I

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.520 
and I decided to pause it here because I
thought<00:04:29.340> well<00:04:30.210> maybe<00:04:30.240> you<00:04:30.600> got<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:30.990> black<00:04:31.260> hat

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
thought well maybe you got a black hat

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.180 
thought well maybe you got a black hat
that's<00:04:31.740> just<00:04:32.010> super<00:04:32.850> quick<00:04:33.150> or<00:04:33.330> something<00:04:34.190> so

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
that's just super quick or something so

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.580 
that's just super quick or something so
I'm<00:04:35.280> looking<00:04:35.400> around<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:36.199> I<00:04:37.199> noticed<00:04:37.500> these

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
I'm looking around and I noticed these

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.560 
I'm looking around and I noticed these
two<00:04:37.800> people<00:04:38.100> they<00:04:38.970> don't<00:04:39.150> look<00:04:39.240> like<00:04:39.300> they're

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
two people they don't look like they're

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.710 
two people they don't look like they're
any<00:04:39.810> any<00:04:40.229> sort<00:04:40.620> of<00:04:40.650> black<00:04:40.949> hat<00:04:41.190> animation<00:04:42.000> this

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
any any sort of black hat animation this

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.080 
any any sort of black hat animation this
guy<00:04:42.900> is<00:04:42.960> probably<00:04:43.139> too<00:04:43.440> far<00:04:43.680> away<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:44.160> then<00:04:45.030> I

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
guy is probably too far away and then I

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.110 
guy is probably too far away and then I
don't<00:04:45.270> see<00:04:45.419> anyone<00:04:45.600> else<00:04:46.370> so<00:04:47.370> that's<00:04:47.850> weird

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
and then after that I decided to just

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.600 
and then after that I decided to just
spawn<00:04:53.310> and<00:04:53.639> throw<00:04:53.910> my<00:04:54.060> c4<00:04:54.949> there's<00:04:55.949> no<00:04:56.220> trophy

systems around there's no enemy around I

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.280 
systems around there's no enemy around I
just<00:04:59.130> spawn<00:04:59.460> and<00:04:59.639> throw<00:04:59.820> it<00:04:59.940> and<00:05:00.120> I'm<00:05:01.110> going<00:05:01.229> to

just spawn and throw it and I'm going to

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.890 
just spawn and throw it and I'm going to

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
switch to this angle here so I can show

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.409 
switch to this angle here so I can show
