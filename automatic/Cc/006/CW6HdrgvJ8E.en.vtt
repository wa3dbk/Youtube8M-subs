00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.110
 two 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.470
 hello friends today we are going to make a mini 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.690
 set a channel talking about control of the 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.130
 new station you will remember that in some 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.040
 episodes any of the episodes 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.840
 We taught you how to synchronize the 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.500
 station with the receiver that carries a 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.610
 mini set to synchronize the new station 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:34.030
 x1 k and sf for mini z 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:37.000
 with a lot 6,007 round January 03 after 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.790
 from that video many of you 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.500
 you have sent doubts to do the 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.870
 same synchronization operation but with 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.390
 the new station is the basic point of 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.730
 manual learn to synchronize the car 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.440
 with the emission beam as process is 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.239
 practically the same changes a bit the 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.530
 nomenclature and change that instead of 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.540
 activate it in a mini electronics 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.070
 We will do it in a receiver 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.840
 4 channel car than those that have 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.300
 with the station or any other receiver 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.729
 CaO that ye may let's do it 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.400
 quick but you will see step by step how 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.619
 we do it for it I'll need for a 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.550
 side the station we have here in 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.550
 our briefcase 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.880
 of killer sniper with the pieces 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.930
 we have the station ready to ride 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.830
 we disassembled the modules that compose it 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.510
 we try to work correctly 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.409
 let's do it in a car durango 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.609
 here we have the car 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.980
 durango text 210 with receiver with group 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:53.770
 d 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.300
 four channels that is the one that comes with 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.160
 this central unit that is the unit 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.650
 central 2.4 gigahertz system f hs 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.960
 what we will need is to raise a little 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.460
 the car so that the rear wheels do not 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.210
 are in contact with the ground we 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.800
 we reassure ourselves with the bachÃ­n and that 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.680
 we can easily access the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.840
 receiver and the process I will repeat it 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.910
 step by step but it's the same one that happens 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.270
 that in this central mine in this unit 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.610
 master the name of the function for 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.110
 synchronize changes then for that there 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.520
 Some user who has not found the 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.570
 function 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.970
 start the station we will say 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.220
 to the smallest system that you have here 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.900
 down on the screen 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.500
 we will make a close-up so that what 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:47.040
 you see in a system we go inside and 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.040
 we have this difference from here 2.4 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.560
 in this function and here gives us to choose 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.960
 the type of operability with which 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:03.050
 the station works that would be either 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:05.660
 general or it puts easy brake 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.420
 these next you know makes reference 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.910
 that in France by legislation can not 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.730
 broadcast the stations intended for the use of 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.720
 radio control to the same power as in 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.340
 the rest of europe 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.260
 then if we were in France 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.240
 we would have to activate it with this 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.740
 This is also done by the 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.480
 old models of cape through 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.610
 module but this station would already take it 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.680
 in the minister, it is not necessary because 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.160
 emits at least power and that a 2.4 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.310
 normal 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.870
 we leave it in general mode we put 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.280
 on the start button and we press ok 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.230
 until the screen changes and as you see 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.750
 we already get the station with the little arrow 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.970
 towards the receiver now we have to 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.580
 operate in the car we connect the battery 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.190
 which is loaded clear 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.560
 receiver off and with the receiver 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.990
 off we will press the little button of the 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.800
 receiver while we launch the 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.120
 car 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.519
 we let go 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.129
 we let a few seconds let go the light it 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:09.980
 turn off when it is turned on again 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.980
 it is synchronized we turn off car 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.950
 we turn off good we do not turn off station in 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.620
 this case we give outgoing 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.440
 the station is ready the screen 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.950
 initial is ready to operate 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.950
 we start car 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.850
 the light and extractive is already synchronized 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.139
 you can see the injection how it acts 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.139
 perfectly and the gas 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:40.139
 as it also works well and the little light 

00:04:38.489 --> 00:04:42.509
 it has already been turned on now 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:45.059
 we have synchronized this receiver with 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:47.009
 this central unit if we had more 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:49.139
 receivers of more cars we can repeat 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.419
 this operation because what you want 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.789
 synchronized is precisely the receiver 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.549
 who is the one who keeps the information of a 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:58.109
 what station to ignore and there may be 

00:04:56.549 --> 00:04:59.520
 several synchronized with only one 

00:04:58.109 --> 00:05:02.390
 station 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:06.560
 we turn off the car 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:08.390
 we turn off the station and turn off the TV 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.550
 see you in the next video 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.250
 subscribe if you are not to a channel 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.930
 our youtube family 7 channel and 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.580
 do a like if you like this guy 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.889
 of tutorials this kind of videos that 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.900
 we make 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.639
 this one in particular and get us there 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.810
 your comments we'll see you too 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.810
