00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.290
 hello all welcome to the good channel 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.610
 today we are going to do this collection that you see 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:22.340
 there in the video above 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.940
 let's start making a partition 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:29.680
 front of semicircle and we 're going to 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.680
 split into two ends 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.129
 what we are going to do with the ends is 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:42.199
 twist them to the side and the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.199
 we roll to the other side 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.830
 once we have made the first crossing 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.750
 with the twisted ends 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.190
 We are going to add tufts of 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:57.260
 sides as we do in the root braid 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.570
 on one of the sides it will match 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.230
 rolled up so we put the lock together 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.320
 at the end down 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.770
 and on the other side we will put the hair 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.710
 at the end above while we are going 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.290
 putting them together we have to go twisting 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.900
 to one side and crossing to the other 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.210
 since if we twist the two towards the 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.460
 same side will be a type 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.190
 twisted will not stay with the shape 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.950
 cord 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.140
 so yes we are twisting the 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.360
 strands to the left the 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.690
 we will have to cross to the right and 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.690
 vice versa 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:43.140
 we will continue like this in the same way 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.120
 the strands at the end twisted in the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.370
 part of the left below and in the 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.740
 part of the right up to 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.740
 get to the end of the neck area 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.549
 query 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.660
 once down and we have no hair left 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.550
 the sides to join will continue 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.550
 doing it in the form of a cord 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.010
 and when we get down we will hold them 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.010
 with a small rubber 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:09.800
 then we will introduce the tip of the 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:11.570
 cord through the tufts above 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.670
 this does not really have an order 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.700
 you can continue getting specific 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.670
 as you like the purpose is that you 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.130
 it is bun type then we can go 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.630
 introducing the tip by the 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.300
 different holes that we 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.810
 we found between the sides of the 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.400
 laces 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.099
 and attach it as you like to each one 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.890
 once we have it coupled and we see that 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.590
 this is how we like it we will hold it with 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.209
 invisible hooks to hold well 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.420
 invisible hooks what we have to 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:48.090
 to do is to put them in the opposite direction 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.989
 turn them and press so they will stay 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.989
 more subjects 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:00.780
 this would be the finished result and 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.780
 now we are going to decorate it with a ribbon 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.409
 to decorate it with the loop what 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.660
 we have to do is with a hook 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:14.610
 invisible hold it in the area above 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.840
 we will introduce it by one of the 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.000
 holes at the top 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.560
 and with the help of the hook well for the part 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.230
 from the front or from the back 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:29.750
 we are pushing the loop 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.750
 and putting it between the ends 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.040
 this can also be done as 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.580
 more we like with the color tie that 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.580
 we want 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.190
 tucking go to everyone 's taste 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.190
 we will continue the same until we finish 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.640
 until the loop is gone 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:01.520
 and once we have finished we will hide 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.520
 the tip inside the bun 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.940
 and we will hold them with a hook 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:11.040
 invisible you can pierce the loop and 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.840
 then hold it inside for 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.840
 make sure we do not get loose 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.710
 you 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:41.110
 bye
