 ip 10 by david 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.989
 Are you in the chest with the projectile? 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.989
 and click on the project 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.879
 so people now for you to do animation you have to search where 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.879
 is the image that you have isolated 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.990
 betto media 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.760
 Now you're going to do the following. 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.940
 for the part where you go 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.940
 start levitating the thigh 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.620
 cut-off the animation initiator 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.120
 Now you're going to do the following. 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.390
 bain 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.720
 times live 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.530
 before stars 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.530
 add a split track 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.900
 will appear here 22 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.970
 now the next phase has lost the object 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.330
 take to the end of 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.400
 decrease of this mounts stay at the same rate 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.810
 put in place see 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.840
 now I do next 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.270
 click on the 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.080
 the object I also selected in the 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.470
 in the timeline 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.440
 go to meditate and sex look for one here 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.220
 cricket 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.800
 and acting critter 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.470
 Now you can have the object eat transparent size of you facts south 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.749
 let's make the world think that the skin is opaque again 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.149
 the following article 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:24.959
 go world 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.959
 here is a kintino reloginho by g1 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.999
 and I do if it's poor's 500 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:33.929
 Weather vain 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:35.839
 eva in the part that 

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:39.629
 to your hand you fiddle in the case here in a raised hand 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.769
 now clicking object 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.509
 I got up too 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:55.509
 in the direction of Tarsus took over 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.839
 here is an active principle 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:01.669
 a discontinuity this 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.329
 and now wife have inclined the 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.569
 the trajectory can 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.569
 do a parable 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:18.999
 when you finish the single effect 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:20.959
 cut the 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.539
 the image 

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:25.049
 who comes from time 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.049
 if you want to do more 

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:32.899
 for example on the hand / 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.549
 varna part bed box 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:47.829
 now again 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.049
 click here 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.469
 in object 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:54.549
 and below it also prolocal that I am very account 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.969
 You can also 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:02.969
 which tells the trajectory 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.199
 so it's going to look more or less like this 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.619
 here I'm not very perfect but the wing can do with more calm when it was 

00:04:19.619 --> 00:04:22.139
 test your video 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.139
 after effect click on me 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.870
 and who saves those who want 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.949
 and I chose where you want to export 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.860
 I hope you liked it, thanks for watching.
