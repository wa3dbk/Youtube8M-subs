 of today is a tag that I saw on the blog of 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.480
 Mincom instantly daniel scioli to you 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.349
 what male is called five languages 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.120
 you need to know where 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.220
 I'll do it, I'll point out five books 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.630
 which I really like and I 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.160
 I think most of you even know 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.760
 but that are among my favorites 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.010
 because you know I will then start 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.779
 begin with the book of paula 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.480
 I think everyone knows Apollo 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.759
 starts inside her making my movie 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.170
 This series that started for you is 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.760
 the first book in the series to premiere 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.100
 fanny is doing my movie is a book 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.540
 I do not know if he would be a young man 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.610
 adult 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.780
 I think so because it did not fit as 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.340
 juvenile child 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.110
 he tells the story of the family of 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.160
 girl she loves watching movies at 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.160
 life is based on is all based on 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.210
 movies that she gets excerpts from the note 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.670
 stretch of the movie and then I start 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.559
 she falls in love with her best friend and 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.700
 there will unfold the story is above 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.549
 this is one of my favorite series 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.920
 I love the writer Paula Pepper she is 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.049
 as if it were the Brazilian megot 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.100
 Even now I do not know if you've already 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.600
 they are knowing 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.840
 she goes there I was writing a book 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.130
 about 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:29.240
 along with aa macworld a laen kate 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.909
 and the patrician barbosa that if I 'm 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.600
 wrong you see here under the 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.560
 more and 164 and I think it will be well 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.929
 interesting 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.520
 so this is the first book canticle 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.619
 good second book is not in order of 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.630
 new people preference is in order of the 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:49.030
 skin that I separated the second book I 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.030
 Indico is from Juliana Jacobeia played 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.679
 fancy a book about angels and tells 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.539
 Alex's Story 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.729
 She's a girl with a slap in the face. 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:01.219
 college is living quiet until 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.369
 She knows a guy in the middle of nowhere. 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:06.619
 Hindu blonde face and the time she plays 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.950
 in it something very strange happens and 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.280
 she feels is totally attached to him and 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.650
 she will discover a number of things 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.150
 very interesting and she ends up 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.500
 falling in love with this guy who actually 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.959
 you are an angel 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.660
 so it 's very very very cool this 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.470
 book and already has a second book that is the 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.540
 errant and I highly recommend this 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.540
 book was leaving now with a new cover 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.310
 because it was revised and again it was 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.299
 great if you repeat a lot of mistakes 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.130
 of typing review that is more to 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.780
 very good story and despite the mistakes and 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.260
 now I have a new review is better 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.260
 still quite touched 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.480
 I think it's going to be a trilogy. 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.329
 It's good the next book that I indicate is 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.709
 law to recover it has no luck in case I 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.900
 I'm sending you the people do not have 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.239
 luck two think it's two books the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.150
 I do not have bad luck, there are 72 some. 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.209
 thing happens in my heart and 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.700
 get rid of the client layout law and account 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.030
 history of the navy in sheep that is a 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.150
 Futile girl that she only thinks of clothes 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.599
 shoes on the looks of the day that 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.640
 Well, that's a good thing, and she was engaged to a 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.709
 very rich guy but she is completely 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.750
 in love with him and she's around 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.359
 to prepare for this marriage is to be the 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.010
 party of the year that deserving thing 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.959
 and there are several other 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.680
 things a very fun level very 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:34.190
 cool 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.420
 loving is a butthead character but she is 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.510
 very funny, I quite liked it 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.650
 important is the two I prefer this 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.750
 on here 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.640
 the cob does not have 7 1 and 2 I prefer two 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.600
 Story of the two but one is very good 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.460
 also 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.380
 so I highly recommend hibooks 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.860
 mom the fourth book that I'm going to indicate is 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.810
 Vanessa's pocket is one of those I that I 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.330
 I like but there are only others of her that I 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.700
 I really like it too because there are several 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.280
 bag ended behind the other ne 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.070
 It's great and what I tell you now. 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:13.050
 It is the lord of tomorrow that is a good book. 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:14.640
 it's pretty dense well inscribed on some things 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.850
 Well , tell me about a new order. 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.610
 world a corporation that is dominating 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:24.000
 the world such things in that sense that the 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:26.100
 people are also being watched and everyone is 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.540
 they try example shopping in the area 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.700
 to discover and 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.130
 Vanessa's books I really like 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.220
 yes but also very fond of it and mental 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.690
 very deadly then the hair decides 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.610
 show this to you 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.620
 the cover is not giving to you to see 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.770
 but it turns out to be really cool 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:49.530
 she has is a person never accuses that they are 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.530
 the eyes and here behind the buildings is 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.470
 He also talks about the bombing. 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:59.650
 of September 11 in the United States is 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.840
 very cool serving very beautiful 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.700
 the last one will indicate my darling 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.680
 story is beyond measure if a person 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.620
 that I have a huge affection for her 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.340
 The book is very cool, I lost it from Karina. 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.050
 rice 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.090
 This book was launched by 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.090
 now Karina is going to publish a new 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:21.430
 her book by the verse that he launches this 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:23.440
 month a book tells the story of sofia 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.330
 sofia she is a totally person 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.570
 linked to technology can not live 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.970
 without the latest generation computer 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.410
 it is fully technological until 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.440
 An unforeseen event happens on his cell phone . 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.490
 He wants nothing to do here, I do not remember now. 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.420
 she enters a store to buy a 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.040
 new cell phone 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:43.930
 at the time she buys the new cell phone 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:51.670
 was transported to the 19th century and 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:55.660
 She goes with the clothes she has with her. 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:58.300
 You do not know that's the guy who gives it 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.580
 this is where she will have to live for 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.410
 a good time in this place because I just 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.590
 began to come home there's no way 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:08.920
 How did it get there? It 's one of mine. 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.810
 It's also very cool, and it's also cool 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.129
 like this 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.050
 just like most of them in books 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:17.330
 the tension has is something that looks like 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.629
 another is that several people say but it is 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:23.269
 one of the favorite books the romance aa 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:25.779
 Karina and if you have the gift of undoing 

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:28.189
 pomegranates is that novel that became a 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:28.849
 I sigh you hope so 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:31.639
 together 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:34.610
 besides being super super recommend 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:38.599
 recapitulating you need to know 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:42.199
 Lost karina and said the Lord 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:47.209
 tomorrow the poor vanessa luxury does not 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:50.360
 luck of the auctioneer is played by juliana 

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:53.300
 Jacobellis and making my movie 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.759
 My dearest paula clinic, and I'll do it. 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.319
 I think two issues of this tag for 

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:59.599
 show other books that also 

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:01.339
 which I also thoroughly enjoyed and 

00:06:59.599 --> 00:07:03.679
 coincidently this time they were all 

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:05.539
 but it's because I just read 

00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:08.629
 more books by national authors 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:11.239
 women not from prejudice any of this 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:13.009
 but it's what I finish is beautiful more 

00:07:11.239 --> 00:07:14.959
 event reviews that look cooler and 

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:16.309
 end up opting for them 

00:07:14.959 --> 00:07:18.379
 so this is what I hope you have 

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:20.449
 liked the video if you want to do 

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:24.019

 national books that you indicate 

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:33.829
 also that this is great for publicizing the 

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:35.929
 national literature as well. 

00:07:33.829 --> 00:07:38.539
