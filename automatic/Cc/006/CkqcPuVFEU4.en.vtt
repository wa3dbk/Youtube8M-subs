00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.660
 I see it in his eyes 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.660
 That he is in love 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.660
 I do not ask anything except 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.300
 That we are happy 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.660
 He has the gestures and the attentions 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.980
 When he hurts me, 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.180
 he asks me for forgiveness 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.380
 I can fall asleep in his arms 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.640
 And wake up in my sheets 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.100
 This morning, things have changed 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.060
 Nothing is the same 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.680
 I feel it distant 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.240
 Much less present 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.060
 I ask him what is wrong, bring me closer and want to take him in my arms 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.620
 But here I do not know, that I should not 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.120
 He pushes me away from him 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.700
 I have bleeding nose and heart too 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.200
 This time, I would not go there 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.180
 Believe me, I assure you he'll be fine 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.180
 Without me 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.000
 Because I do not want any more here 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.680
 I prefer to leave it like that 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.700
 Even if it's hard, I have to think about myself 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.160
 Everything arranged 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.980
 He apologized 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.300
 I believed it, I came back 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.300
 Full of poems and here again more beautiful 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.420
 That's it ! 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.680
 He is more and more violent 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.880
 His threats he puts them into execution 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.700
 Last night, it was restau 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.980
 Today I have some sores 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.000
 This morning he put me ko 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.500
 This time I will not put my feet back there 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.440
 Believe me I assure you he'll be fine 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.340
 Without me 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.340
 Because I do not want any more here 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.260
 I prefer to leave it like that 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.820
 Even if it's hard, I have to think about myself 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.720
 I am alone, here there is nobody with me 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.080
 I am alone, here who hears me and will save me? 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.600
 It's decided I'm leaving 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.600
 I leave it there 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.280
 I must think of myself 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.260
 Now that you know the lyrics, it's up to you to play 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.980
 On your marks 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.180
 loans 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.340
 Sing! 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.940
 He'll be fine
