saw it um at the MAC counter and
honestly<00:01:01.050> mostly<00:01:01.770> because<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.190> staying

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
honestly mostly because of the staying

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.050 
honestly mostly because of the staying
power<00:01:02.760> because<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:04.430> you<00:01:05.430> know<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.939> get

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
power because like you know you can get

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.899 
power because like you know you can get
a<00:01:06.090> blue<00:01:06.330> eyeliner<00:01:06.720> anywhere<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:08.250> because<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
a blue eyeliner anywhere but because the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.920 
a blue eyeliner anywhere but because the
consistency<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.250> because<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:12.720> staying

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
consistency and because of the staying

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.840 
consistency and because of the staying
power<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.439> awesome<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:13.950> water<00:01:14.310> line<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.610> I

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
power it's awesome for water line and I

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.460 
power it's awesome for water line and I
really<00:01:15.210> wanted<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.630> try<00:01:15.840> blue<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.320> water

really wanted to try blue on the water

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
really wanted to try blue on the water
lengths<00:01:16.860> i<00:01:16.950> think<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.189> would<00:01:17.340> look<00:01:17.369> really

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
lengths i think that would look really

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.850 
lengths i think that would look really
pretty<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:18.900> i<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.170> been<00:01:19.200> doing<00:01:19.380> my<00:01:19.590> makeup

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
pretty and i have been doing my makeup

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.530 
pretty and i have been doing my makeup
differently<00:01:20.280> lately<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.060> i<00:01:21.119> really<00:01:21.330> want<00:01:21.509> to

differently lately and i really want to

differently lately and i really want to
do<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> tutorial<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.979> how<00:01:23.040> I've<00:01:23.280> been<00:01:23.369> doing<00:01:23.670> it

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
do a tutorial on how I've been doing it

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.200 
do a tutorial on how I've been doing it
so<00:01:24.780> I've<00:01:24.840> kind<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.530> got<00:01:26.310> away<00:01:26.520> from<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.000> heavy

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
so I've kind of got away from the heavy

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.390 
so I've kind of got away from the heavy
eyeliner<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.930> heavy<00:01:28.080> foundation<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.250> all

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
eyeliner and heavy foundation and all

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.560 
eyeliner and heavy foundation and all
that<00:01:29.549> stuff<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.820> kind<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.119> tried<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.329> make<00:01:30.540> it

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
that stuff and kind of tried to make it

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.870 
that stuff and kind of tried to make it
look<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:31.170> little<00:01:31.439> bit<00:01:31.650> more<00:01:31.860> natural<00:01:32.340> this

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
look a little bit more natural this

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.789 
look a little bit more natural this
really<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> natural<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.200> think<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.650> might

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
really is a natural but I think it might

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.740 
really is a natural but I think it might
had<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> really<00:01:35.430> nice<00:01:35.640> hint<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.000> color<00:01:36.210> I'm

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.250 
eco I'd this is my favorite the middle
one<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:24.800> I<00:02:24.950> have<00:02:25.129> it<00:02:25.250> in<00:02:25.310> my<00:02:25.430> crease<00:02:25.700> right<00:02:25.940> now

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.130 
one and I have it in my crease right now
you<00:02:27.260> probably<00:02:27.290> can't<00:02:27.920> say<00:02:28.250> that<00:02:28.930> this<00:02:29.930> is<00:02:30.110> a

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
you probably can't say that this is a

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.259 
you probably can't say that this is a
really<00:02:30.410> pretty<00:02:30.680> peach<00:02:31.010> which<00:02:31.459> I<00:02:31.730> believe

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
really pretty peach which I believe

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.420 
really pretty peach which I believe
would<00:02:33.170> also<00:02:33.410> look<00:02:33.650> really<00:02:33.890> awesome<00:02:34.040> on<00:02:34.340> your

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.120 
would also look really awesome on your
cheeks<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:36.470> middle<00:02:36.739> one<00:02:36.860> is<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.069> only

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
cheeks and so the middle one is the only

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.860 
cheeks and so the middle one is the only
one<00:02:37.400> that's<00:02:37.580> kind<00:02:37.760> of<00:02:37.819> glittery<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.360> rest<00:02:38.599> are

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870
