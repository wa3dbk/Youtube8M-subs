prevent your torso from rolling when you
do<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.620> rowing<00:03:19.829> what<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:20.519> can<00:03:20.669> do<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.150> can

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
do the rowing what you can do is you can

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.670 
do the rowing what you can do is you can
increase<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.900> base<00:03:22.079> of<00:03:22.260> support<00:03:22.560> with<00:03:22.650> your

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
increase the base of support with your

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.770 
increase the base of support with your
feet<00:03:22.979> put<00:03:23.250> them<00:03:23.430> further<00:03:23.699> apart<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.419> that

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
feet put them further apart and that

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.960 
feet put them further apart and that
will<00:03:24.930> minimize<00:03:25.440> any<00:03:25.799> type<00:03:26.340> of<00:03:26.370> rocking<00:03:26.819> and

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
will minimize any type of rocking and

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.449 
will minimize any type of rocking and
rolling<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.419> also<00:03:27.810> use<00:03:28.109> hex<00:03:28.440> dumbbells<00:03:28.979> so<00:03:29.310> the

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
rolling I also use hex dumbbells so the

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.580 
rolling I also use hex dumbbells so the
dumbbells<00:03:29.819> won't<00:03:30.030> roll<00:03:30.269> all<00:03:30.540> over<00:03:30.599> the<00:03:31.199> floor

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
dumbbells won't roll all over the floor

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.399 
dumbbells won't roll all over the floor
I<00:03:31.859> love<00:03:32.609> compound<00:03:33.120> exercises<00:03:33.629> because<00:03:33.989> we<00:03:34.229> can

I love compound exercises because we can

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.589 
I love compound exercises because we can
target<00:03:34.829> multiple<00:03:35.010> muscle<00:03:35.790> groups<00:03:35.819> in<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.359> time

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
target multiple muscle groups in a time

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.330 
target multiple muscle groups in a time
efficient<00:03:37.139> manner<00:03:37.349> you<00:03:37.799> can<00:03:37.949> see<00:03:38.099> we<00:03:38.220> get

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
efficient manner you can see we get

00:03:38.340 --> 00:04:59.469 
efficient manner you can see we get

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
you're doing the side raise make sure

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.010 
you're doing the side raise make sure
your<00:05:29.070> elbows<00:05:29.490> stay<00:05:29.789> higher<00:05:30.150> than<00:05:30.449> your<00:05:30.599> wrists

your elbows stay higher than your wrists

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.860 
your elbows stay higher than your wrists
because<00:05:31.620> that<00:05:32.160> way<00:05:32.370> you<00:05:32.430> will<00:05:32.910> target<00:05:33.510> the

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
because that way you will target the

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.140 
because that way you will target the
side<00:05:34.080> deltoid<00:05:34.680> pretend<00:05:35.669> you're<00:05:35.880> pouring

water out of a jug as you raise the arms
to<00:05:39.060> your<00:05:39.090> sides<00:05:39.539> and<00:05:39.900> that<00:05:40.169> will<00:05:40.229> keep<00:05:40.530> your
