I'm just adding different stamped layers

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.360 
I'm just adding different stamped layers
to<00:03:11.530> these<00:03:11.709> pieces<00:03:13.859> so<00:03:14.859> there's<00:03:15.010> my<00:03:15.190> little

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
to these pieces so there's my little

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.619 
to these pieces so there's my little
label<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:15.910> says<00:03:16.090> spooky<00:03:16.810> sweets<00:03:18.569> there's<00:03:19.569> a

whole bunch of different ones you can

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.770 
whole bunch of different ones you can
use<00:03:21.280> so<00:03:21.669> that's<00:03:21.849> how<00:03:22.000> it's<00:03:22.150> going<00:03:22.299> to<00:03:22.359> look<00:03:22.419> all

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
use so that's how it's going to look all

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.670 
use so that's how it's going to look all
put<00:03:22.989> together<00:03:23.169> there<00:03:23.650> on<00:03:23.859> my<00:03:24.519> jar<00:03:25.500> I'm<00:03:26.500> going

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
put together there on my jar I'm going

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.740 
put together there on my jar I'm going
to<00:03:26.769> take<00:03:26.950> that<00:03:27.190> little<00:03:27.549> triangle<00:03:28.030> scallop

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
to take that little triangle scallop

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.780 
to take that little triangle scallop
there<00:03:28.989> alright<00:03:29.620> I<00:03:29.680> guess<00:03:29.859> not<00:03:30.010> rly<00:03:30.280> a<00:03:30.310> scallop

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
there alright I guess not rly a scallop

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.530 
there alright I guess not rly a scallop
little<00:03:31.680> piece<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:33.090> there<00:03:34.090> are<00:03:34.299> a<00:03:34.329> couple

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
little piece and there are a couple

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.470 
little piece and there are a couple
different<00:03:34.840> choices<00:03:35.440> there's<00:03:36.130> a<00:03:36.370> solid<00:03:36.760> stamp

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
different choices there's a solid stamp

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.569 
different choices there's a solid stamp
choice<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:38.260> I'm<00:03:38.709> going<00:03:38.859> to<00:03:38.889> use<00:03:39.069> it<00:03:39.280> first

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
choice and I'm going to use it first

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.979 
choice and I'm going to use it first
with<00:03:40.030> some<00:03:41.099> purple<00:03:42.120> purple<00:03:43.120> ink<00:03:43.480> I<00:03:43.690> think<00:03:43.870> this

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
with some purple purple ink I think this

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.659 
with some purple purple ink I think this
is<00:03:44.049> a<00:03:44.310> shadow<00:03:45.310> ink<00:03:45.609> from<00:03:45.790> hero<00:03:45.880> arts<00:03:47.669> stamp

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669 
is a shadow ink from hero arts stamp

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.120 
is a shadow ink from hero arts stamp
that<00:03:48.849> on<00:03:49.000> there<00:03:49.209> and<00:03:49.359> the<00:03:49.870> shadow<00:03:50.139> or<00:03:50.440> yeah<00:03:50.950> the

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
that on there and the shadow or yeah the

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.099 
that on there and the shadow or yeah the
shadow<00:03:51.280> inks<00:03:51.730> look<00:03:51.970> a<00:03:52.060> little<00:03:52.209> blotchy<00:03:52.569> until

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
shadow inks look a little blotchy until

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.830 
shadow inks look a little blotchy until
they<00:03:53.230> dry<00:03:53.500> so<00:03:54.040> they<00:03:54.730> look<00:03:54.940> nicer<00:03:55.419> ones<00:03:55.630> they've

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
they dry so they look nicer ones they've

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.530 
they dry so they look nicer ones they've
dried<00:03:56.250> then<00:03:57.250> there's<00:03:57.760> also<00:03:57.940> another<00:03:58.150> one

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
dried then there's also another one

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.000 
dried then there's also another one
that's<00:03:58.750> more<00:03:58.959> of<00:03:59.079> a<00:03:59.139> little<00:03:59.380> outline<00:03:59.769> design

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
that's more of a little outline design

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.920 
that's more of a little outline design
so<00:04:00.549> I'm<00:04:00.609> going<00:04:00.730> to<00:04:00.760> just<00:04:00.940> take<00:04:01.090> some<00:04:01.329> black<00:04:01.569> ink

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
so I'm going to just take some black ink

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.369 
so I'm going to just take some black ink
and<00:04:02.200> stamp<00:04:02.349> that<00:04:02.709> right<00:04:03.129> over<00:04:03.629> the<00:04:04.629> more<00:04:04.900> solid

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
and stamp that right over the more solid

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.069 
and stamp that right over the more solid
one<00:04:05.590> and<00:04:05.980> not<00:04:06.700> that<00:04:06.940> really<00:04:07.359> adds<00:04:07.540> a<00:04:07.780> lot<00:04:07.930> of

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
one and not that really adds a lot of

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.470 
one and not that really adds a lot of
dimension<00:04:08.349> I<00:04:08.739> think<00:04:09.250> that<00:04:09.430> looks<00:04:10.150> a<00:04:10.269> lot<00:04:10.419> nicer

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
dimension I think that looks a lot nicer

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.869 
dimension I think that looks a lot nicer
than<00:04:10.870> just<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.379> solid<00:04:11.769> particularly<00:04:12.669> for

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
than just the solid particularly for

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.050 
than just the solid particularly for
this<00:04:13.230> for<00:04:14.230> this<00:04:14.260> design<00:04:14.709> and<00:04:15.010> then<00:04:15.489> I<00:04:15.519> die<00:04:15.639> cut

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
this for this design and then I die cut

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.080 
this for this design and then I die cut
the<00:04:16.209> top<00:04:16.419> of<00:04:16.630> my<00:04:16.840> jar<00:04:17.380> from<00:04:17.829> a<00:04:18.310> little<00:04:18.760> scrap

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
the top of my jar from a little scrap

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.270 
the top of my jar from a little scrap
piece<00:04:19.299> of<00:04:19.419> paper<00:04:19.630> from<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.320> rest<00:04:20.859> of<00:04:21.099> the

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
piece of paper from the rest of the

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.360 
piece of paper from the rest of the
design<00:04:21.519> or<00:04:22.000> from<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:22.750> box<00:04:23.050> and<00:04:23.620> I<00:04:23.860> stamped<00:04:24.250> my

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
design or from the box and I stamped my

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.490 
design or from the box and I stamped my
lid<00:04:24.669> on<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:25.030> top<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.479> then<00:04:25.840> I<00:04:25.900> simply<00:04:26.320> just
