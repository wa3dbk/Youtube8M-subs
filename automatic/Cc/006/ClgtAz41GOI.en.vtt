well<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:50.850> me<00:00:50.940> its<00:00:51.090> fundamental<00:00:51.750> Anna<00:00:52.140> may<00:00:52.469> be

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
well for me its fundamental Anna may be

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.650 
well for me its fundamental Anna may be
biased<00:00:52.860> but<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.550> mean<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.969> reason<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.390> got

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
biased but that I mean the reason I got

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.510 
biased but that I mean the reason I got
there<00:00:54.930> was<00:00:55.110> because<00:00:55.410> as<00:00:55.590> an<00:00:55.920> accredited

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
there was because as an accredited

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.939 
there was because as an accredited
practicing<00:00:57.109> nutritionist<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.289> physiologist

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
practicing nutritionist and physiologist

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.400 
practicing nutritionist and physiologist
i<00:00:59.039> realized<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.609> i<00:00:59.850> could<00:00:59.910> give<00:01:00.420> people<00:01:00.899> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
i realized that i could give people the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.399 
i realized that i could give people the
best<00:01:01.800> program<00:01:02.510> that<00:01:03.510> was<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:03.840> there<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.260> i

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
best program that was like there and i

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.440 
best program that was like there and i
would<00:01:04.680> give<00:01:04.860> them<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.189> nutrition<00:01:05.820> program<00:01:06.210> with

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
would give them a nutrition program with

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.480 
would give them a nutrition program with
her<00:01:06.659> i<00:01:06.869> would<00:01:07.290> talk<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.619> them<00:01:07.920> about<00:01:08.010> stress

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
her i would talk to them about stress

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.240 
her i would talk to them about stress
management<00:01:08.880> all<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.689> stuff<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.260> still

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
management all of that stuff and still

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.289 
management all of that stuff and still
it<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.720> some<00:01:13.080> with<00:01:13.320> quite<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.100> few<00:01:14.189> people<00:01:14.670> they

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
it in some with quite a few people they

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.289 
it in some with quite a few people they
didn't<00:01:15.600> succeed<00:01:16.130> wait<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.220> second<00:01:17.580> hold<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.119> now

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
didn't succeed wait a second hold on now

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.469 
didn't succeed wait a second hold on now
so<00:01:19.049> as<00:01:19.320> trainers<00:01:20.130> our<00:01:20.369> job<00:01:20.580> fundamentally<00:01:21.330> is

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
so as trainers our job fundamentally is

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.070 
so as trainers our job fundamentally is
to<00:01:22.439> identify<00:01:23.310> information<00:01:24.030> do<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.840> proper

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
to identify information do the proper

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.289 
to identify information do the proper
assessment<00:01:25.409> design<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.369> program<00:01:26.610> implement

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
assessment design a program implement

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.390 
assessment design a program implement
that<00:01:27.390> program<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:27.990> somebody<00:01:28.740> doesn't<00:01:29.100> take

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
that program if somebody doesn't take

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.190 
that program if somebody doesn't take
the<00:01:29.490> tools<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:29.939> give<00:01:30.299> them<00:01:30.479> they<00:01:31.170> just

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the tools that we give them they just

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.289 
the tools that we give them they just
simply<00:01:31.500> lack<00:01:31.829> discipline<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.150> there<00:01:33.270> I

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
simply lack discipline is it there I

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.940 
simply lack discipline is it there I
mean<00:01:33.930> there's<00:01:34.259> nothing<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:34.740> do<00:01:34.829> about

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
mean there's nothing we can do about

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.980 
mean there's nothing we can do about
that<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.250> there<00:01:35.430> there's<00:01:36.270> lots<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.840> do

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
that is there there's lots of we can do

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.469 
that is there there's lots of we can do
about<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.439> think<00:01:37.740> our<00:01:37.950> job<00:01:38.280> is<00:01:38.490> trainers<00:01:38.970> is

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
about it I think our job is trainers is

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.539 
about it I think our job is trainers is
more<00:01:40.110> global<00:01:40.560> than<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.829> our<00:01:41.100> job<00:01:41.400> as

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
more global than that our job as

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.770 
more global than that our job as
trainers<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.119> help<00:01:42.360> people<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.930> achieve

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
trainers is to help people to achieve

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.289 
trainers is to help people to achieve
that<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.770> industry<00:01:45.100> is<00:01:45.280> changing<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.909> dais

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
that the industry is changing the dais

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.390 
that the industry is changing the dais
