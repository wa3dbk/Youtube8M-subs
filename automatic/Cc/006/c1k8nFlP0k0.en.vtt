00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
basically I said let's try this other

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.069 
basically I said let's try this other
procedure<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.820> very<00:00:57.059> simple<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.690> just<00:00:57.719> go

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
procedure that is very simple I just go

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.189 
procedure that is very simple I just go
in<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.469> shape<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.980> bone<00:00:59.160> spurs<00:00:59.609> off<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.390> you

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
in and shape the bone spurs off and you

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.680 
in and shape the bone spurs off and you
walk<00:01:01.440> right<00:01:01.649> out<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.430> yes<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.180> have<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.329> chance

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
walk right out and yes you have a chance

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.460 
walk right out and yes you have a chance
of<00:01:03.960> recurrence<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.309> two<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.450> five<00:01:06.689> years<00:01:06.720> but

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
of recurrence and two to five years but

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.679 
of recurrence and two to five years but
at<00:01:08.040> least<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.610> continue<00:01:09.240> walking<00:01:09.420> and

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
at least you can continue walking and

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.450 
at least you can continue walking and
see<00:01:09.930> if<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.140> will<00:01:10.290> take<00:01:10.320> care<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.890> pain<00:01:11.130> if

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
see if it will take care of the pain if

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.950 
see if it will take care of the pain if
that's<00:01:11.760> what<00:01:11.909> hurt<00:01:12.180> anymore

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
that's what hurt anymore

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.050 
that's what hurt anymore
so<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.530> does<00:01:13.650> not<00:01:13.770> hurt<00:01:13.979> at<00:01:14.130> all<00:01:14.220> not<00:01:14.729> at<00:01:14.880> all

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
so it does not hurt at all not at all

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.990 
so it does not hurt at all not at all
okay<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.560> comparison<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.310> mean<00:01:17.460> your<00:01:17.580> pain<00:01:17.790> was
