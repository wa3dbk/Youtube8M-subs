00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
to use set attack proxy to spider a

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.209 
to use set attack proxy to spider a
website<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:07.730> perhaps<00:00:08.730> find<00:00:09.330> URLs<00:00:09.990> or<00:00:10.349> file

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
locations within that website that you

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.870 
locations within that website that you
weren't<00:00:13.380> aware<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.009> because<00:00:14.580> they<00:00:14.730> weren't

and<00:01:07.650> what<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.010> does<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.490> goes<00:01:08.610> out<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.030> it

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
and what that does is it goes out and it

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.730 
and what that does is it goes out and it
follows<00:01:09.570> all<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.080> links<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.619> can

hand<00:01:29.189> side<00:01:29.509> you'll<00:01:30.509> notice<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:31.079> one<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.590> the

application<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.400> do<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.479> follow<00:01:43.110> links<00:01:43.680> out

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
application to do is to follow links out

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.910 
application to do is to follow links out
through<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.340> many<00:01:44.640> pages<00:01:45.290> so<00:01:46.290> be<00:01:46.500> careful

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
through this many pages so be careful

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.350 
through this many pages so be careful
setting<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.430> up<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> higher<00:01:48.149> number

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
setting this up to a higher number

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.870 
setting this up to a higher number
because<00:01:48.899> for<00:01:49.530> example<00:01:49.619> if<00:01:50.130> your<00:01:50.280> site<00:01:50.310> links

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
because for example if your site links

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.200 
because for example if your site links
to<00:01:51.119> Google<00:01:51.360> all<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.380> sudden<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.340> spider<00:01:53.970> is

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
to Google all the sudden the spider is

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.030 
to Google all the sudden the spider is
going<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.479> be<00:01:54.570> crawling<00:01:54.840> all<00:01:55.170> sorts<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.619> pages

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
going to be crawling all sorts of pages

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.969 
going to be crawling all sorts of pages
on<00:01:56.219> Google<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.869> if<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.350> keep<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.649> down<00:01:58.710> at

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
on Google so if you just keep it down at

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.770 
on Google so if you just keep it down at
a<00:01:59.040> lower<00:01:59.189> number<00:01:59.399> around<00:01:59.729> 5<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.360> usually<00:02:00.750> a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
a lower number around 5 is usually a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.209 
a lower number around 5 is usually a
good<00:02:00.960> number<00:02:01.170> if<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.590> notice<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.040> there's

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
good number if you notice that there's

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.399 
good number if you notice that there's
extra<00:02:02.670> sites<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.149> or<00:02:03.600> extra<00:02:03.899> pages<00:02:04.110> that

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
extra sites that or extra pages that

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.749 
extra sites that or extra pages that
you'd<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.740> find<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.310> haven't<00:02:05.610> been

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
you'd like to find that haven't been

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.760 
you'd like to find that haven't been
explored<00:02:06.060> fully<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:07.229> increase<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
explored fully and you can increase the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.830 
explored fully and you can increase the
number<00:02:07.799> from<00:02:08.190> there<00:02:08.369> but<00:02:09.119> for<00:02:09.330> now<00:02:09.420> I'd<00:02:09.629> leave

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
number from there but for now I'd leave

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.809 
number from there but for now I'd leave
it<00:02:09.869> at<00:02:10.050> five<00:02:10.259> or<00:02:10.890> maybe<00:02:11.160> even<00:02:11.310> six<00:02:11.599> so<00:02:12.599> then

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
it at five or maybe even six so then

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.440 
it at five or maybe even six so then
okay<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.390> then<00:02:13.810> you<00:02:13.930> can<00:02:13.959> begin<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.739> spider

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
okay and then you can begin to spider

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.699 
okay and then you can begin to spider
and<00:02:16.450> you'll<00:02:16.599> notice<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:17.049> this<00:02:17.170> will<00:02:17.349> go<00:02:17.469> out

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
and you'll notice that this will go out

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.319 
and you'll notice that this will go out
and<00:02:17.859> it'll<00:02:18.010> try<00:02:18.249> to<00:02:18.280> find<00:02:18.609> as<00:02:18.790> many<00:02:18.939> different
