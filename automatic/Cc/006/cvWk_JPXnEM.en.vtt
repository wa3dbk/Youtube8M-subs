this is the the first model we think the

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.939

games<00:05:44.490> that<00:05:44.669> I've<00:05:44.759> got<00:05:44.909> loaded<00:05:45.240> up<00:05:45.330> here<00:05:45.479> so

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
games that I've got loaded up here so

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.010 
games that I've got loaded up here so
you've<00:05:45.900> got<00:05:46.050> to<00:05:46.169> add<00:05:46.259> coins<00:05:46.639> like<00:05:47.639> button<00:05:48.020> adds

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
you've got to add coins like button adds

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.920 
you've got to add coins like button adds
points<00:05:49.409> whereas<00:05:50.370> this<00:05:50.580> I<00:05:50.940> think<00:05:51.419> there<00:05:51.599> are<00:05:51.630> a

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
points whereas this I think there are a

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.520 
points whereas this I think there are a
s<00:05:52.400> conversions<00:05:53.400> or<00:05:53.690> hey<00:05:54.690> it's<00:05:54.930> got<00:05:55.110> credit<00:05:55.500> for

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
s conversions or hey it's got credit for

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.469 
s conversions or hey it's got credit for
but<00:05:56.009> then<00:05:56.220> you<00:05:56.610> don't<00:05:56.759> have<00:05:56.819> to<00:05:56.880> add<00:05:57.030> credits

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
but then you don't have to add credits

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.409 
but then you don't have to add credits
to<00:05:57.599> the<00:05:57.690> game<00:05:58.069> so<00:05:59.069> I'm<00:05:59.580> not<00:05:59.880> sure<00:06:00.120> that<00:06:00.150> we're

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:00.419 
to the game so I'm not sure that we're

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:01.570 
to the game so I'm not sure that we're
using<00:06:00.449> them

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
using them

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.950 
using them
yeah<00:06:02.580> I<00:06:02.759> mean<00:06:02.880> both<00:06:03.060> of<00:06:03.180> them<00:06:03.270> are<00:06:03.360> emulators

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
yeah I mean both of them are emulators

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.670 
yeah I mean both of them are emulators
but<00:06:04.919> I<00:06:05.190> think<00:06:05.460> the<00:06:05.970> PSP<00:06:06.389> does<00:06:06.599> a<00:06:06.630> better<00:06:07.139> job<00:06:07.289> at

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
but I think the PSP does a better job at

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.969 
but I think the PSP does a better job at
emulating<00:06:08.310> than<00:06:09.150> the<00:06:09.509> actual<00:06:10.169> product<00:06:10.590> even

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 
emulating than the actual product even

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:13.180 
emulating than the actual product even
though<00:06:11.069> it's<00:06:11.219> not<00:06:11.340> made<00:06:11.580> by<00:06:11.759> a<00:06:11.789> SNK<00:06:12.509> at<00:06:12.780> some
