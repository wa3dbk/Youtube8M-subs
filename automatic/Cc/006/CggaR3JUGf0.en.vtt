00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.250 

we<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.850> 50<00:01:44.850> mil<00:01:45.090> copper<00:01:45.930> water<00:01:46.290> line<00:01:48.260> which

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
we have a 50 mil copper water line which

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.960 
we have a 50 mil copper water line which
we<00:01:49.500> dug<00:01:50.190> up<00:01:50.480> previous<00:01:51.480> day<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.580> installed<00:01:53.580> a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
we dug up previous day and installed a

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.690 
we dug up previous day and installed a
clamp<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:56.630> we<00:01:57.630> have<00:01:57.750> now<00:01:58.020> cut<00:01:59.010> out<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.430> old

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
clamp and we have now cut out this old

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.550 
clamp and we have now cut out this old
section<00:02:00.480> of<00:02:00.600> line<00:02:01.070> and<00:02:02.450> as<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.660> can<00:02:03.840> see<00:02:03.870> on

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
section of line and as you can see on

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
section of line and as you can see on
the<00:02:04.890> left<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:06.120> the<00:02:06.360> screen<00:02:07.310> pipe<00:02:08.310> is

continually dribbling out of the end in
this<00:02:15.360> situation<00:02:15.720> we<00:02:16.200> will<00:02:16.380> use<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.650> flow

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
this situation we will use the flow

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.040 
this situation we will use the flow
stopper<00:02:18.590> through<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:20.190> TPS<00:02:21.150> opening<00:02:21.630> in<00:02:21.840> the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
new section of pipe we have made up and

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.600 
new section of pipe we have made up and
we'll<00:02:27.240> be<00:02:27.390> inserting<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:28.080> into<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:29.130> left-hand

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
we'll be inserting it into the left-hand

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.570 
we'll be inserting it into the left-hand
side<00:02:29.730> of<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.390> line
