00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
planting the first thing I want to try

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.660 
planting the first thing I want to try
and<00:01:51.700> achieve<00:01:51.760> in<00:01:52.030> here<00:01:52.180> is<00:01:52.270> some<00:01:52.450> height<00:01:52.720> so<00:01:53.670> in

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
close to the pond we're going to get

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.660 
close to the pond we're going to get
some<00:01:58.600> standard<00:01:59.200> fruit<00:01:59.680> trees<00:02:00.009> some<00:02:00.280> taller

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
some standard fruit trees some taller

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.690 
some standard fruit trees some taller
growing<00:02:01.060> fruit<00:02:01.420> trees<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.950> as<00:02:03.070> well<00:02:03.280> as<00:02:03.310> that

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
growing fruit trees but as well as that

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.999 
growing fruit trees but as well as that
the<00:02:04.330> fruit<00:02:04.659> that's<00:02:04.840> incorporated<00:02:05.200> in<00:02:05.740> here

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
the fruit that's incorporated in here

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.530 
the fruit that's incorporated in here
the<00:02:06.220> actual<00:02:06.520> fruit<00:02:06.759> trees<00:02:07.030> some<00:02:07.330> of<00:02:07.479> the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
the actual fruit trees some of the

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.119 
the actual fruit trees some of the
growing<00:02:07.750> standards<00:02:08.349> some<00:02:08.530> will<00:02:08.649> be<00:02:08.769> trained

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
growing standards some will be trained

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.250 
growing standards some will be trained
and<00:02:09.429> my<00:02:09.519> train<00:02:09.819> for<00:02:10.060> it<00:02:10.149> I<00:02:10.299> mean<00:02:10.479> you<00:02:10.869> can<00:02:10.899> train

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
and my train for it I mean you can train

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.539 
and my train for it I mean you can train
fruit<00:02:11.529> in<00:02:11.680> two<00:02:11.799> different<00:02:11.919> shapes<00:02:12.129> to

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
fruit in two different shapes to

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.610 
fruit in two different shapes to
encourage<00:02:12.969> it<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.389> fruit<00:02:13.719> better<00:02:13.989> or<00:02:14.409> to

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
encourage it to fruit better or to

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.869 
encourage it to fruit better or to
actually<00:02:14.889> take<00:02:15.129> up<00:02:15.279> a<00:02:15.400> space<00:02:15.700> that

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
actually take up a space that

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.610 
actually take up a space that
isn't<00:02:17.390> being<00:02:17.510> used<00:02:17.599> for<00:02:17.840> anything<00:02:17.959> else<00:02:18.379> and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
isn't being used for anything else and

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.009 
isn't being used for anything else and
we'll<00:02:18.739> be<00:02:18.860> using<00:02:19.040> fans<00:02:19.610> which<00:02:19.969> as<00:02:20.329> it<00:02:20.569> sounds

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
we'll be using fans which as it sounds

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.289 
we'll be using fans which as it sounds
like<00:02:21.170> is<00:02:21.349> like<00:02:21.469> a<00:02:21.530> classic<00:02:21.859> fan<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.579> dispaly

throw about this high and you'll be able

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.509 
throw about this high and you'll be able
to<00:02:40.069> step<00:02:40.579> over<00:02:40.790> them<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.920> other<00:02:43.129> thing<00:02:43.400> we're

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
to step over them the other thing we're

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.729 
to step over them the other thing we're
going<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:43.790> do<00:02:43.970> in<00:02:44.180> these<00:02:44.659> two<00:02:44.720> beds<00:02:45.200> here<00:02:45.500> we're

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
going to do in these two beds here we're

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.199 
going to do in these two beds here we're
going<00:02:45.889> to<00:02:45.950> have<00:02:46.189> some<00:02:46.459> of<00:02:46.579> our<00:02:46.670> came<00:02:46.939> through

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
going to have some of our came through

going to have some of our came through
raspberries<00:02:48.040> loganberries<00:02:49.040> things<00:02:49.340> like

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
raspberries loganberries things like

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.270 
raspberries loganberries things like
that<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:50.290> I'll<00:02:51.290> be<00:02:51.439> filling<00:02:51.620> up<00:02:51.799> a<00:02:51.859> short<00:02:52.099> film

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
that so I'll be filling up a short film

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.690 
that so I'll be filling up a short film
about<00:02:52.370> how<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:52.819> construct<00:02:53.659> an<00:02:53.959> actual<00:02:54.829> frame

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
about how to construct an actual frame

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.899 
about how to construct an actual frame
for<00:02:56.359> raspberries<00:02:56.840> it's<00:02:57.019> not<00:02:57.169> hard<00:02:57.700> but<00:02:58.700> with

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
for raspberries it's not hard but with

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.640 
for raspberries it's not hard but with
raspberries<00:02:59.419> you<00:02:59.659> have<00:02:59.870> to<00:03:00.019> have<00:03:00.169> a<00:03:00.200> frame<00:03:00.470> for

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
raspberries you have to have a frame for

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.190 
raspberries you have to have a frame for
summer<00:03:00.919> raspberries<00:03:01.400> because<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:02.540> way<00:03:02.989> they

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
summer raspberries because the way they

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.129 
summer raspberries because the way they
grow<00:03:03.669> and<00:03:04.669> before<00:03:05.329> we<00:03:05.389> go<00:03:05.510> any<00:03:05.629> further<00:03:05.780> what<00:03:06.079> I

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.139 
grow and before we go any further what I

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:08.129 
grow and before we go any further what I
want<00:03:06.349> to<00:03:06.439> talk<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.769> you<00:03:06.859> about<00:03:06.919> are<00:03:07.519> actual

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
want to talk to you about are actual

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.839 
want to talk to you about are actual
what<00:03:09.139> I<00:03:09.169> refer<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.530> as<00:03:09.739> rootstocks<00:03:10.579> it's

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
what I refer to as rootstocks it's

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.250 
what I refer to as rootstocks it's
something<00:03:11.180> when<00:03:11.299> you<00:03:11.389> first<00:03:11.599> get<00:03:11.780> into<00:03:12.049> fruit

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
something when you first get into fruit

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.349 
something when you first get into fruit
you'll<00:03:12.470> think<00:03:12.739> what<00:03:13.189> is<00:03:13.310> a<00:03:13.340> rootstock<00:03:13.669> and<00:03:14.180> how

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
you'll think what is a rootstock and how

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.869 
you'll think what is a rootstock and how
does<00:03:14.419> it<00:03:14.569> affect<00:03:14.780> what<00:03:15.530> I'm<00:03:15.650> gonna<00:03:15.799> do<00:03:16.129> and<00:03:16.340> how

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
does it affect what I'm gonna do and how

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.849 
does it affect what I'm gonna do and how
do<00:03:16.939> I<00:03:17.120> make<00:03:17.150> my<00:03:17.540> decision<00:03:18.049> on<00:03:18.139> which<00:03:18.319> one<00:03:18.620> I

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
do I make my decision on which one I

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:25.059 
do I make my decision on which one I
need<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:23.120> understand<00:03:23.919> rootstocks

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
need to understand rootstocks

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.369 
need to understand rootstocks
the<00:03:25.459> simplest<00:03:25.879> way<00:03:26.419> to<00:03:26.449> think<00:03:26.690> about<00:03:26.959> it<00:03:27.229> is

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
the simplest way to think about it is

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.000 
the simplest way to think about it is
you<00:03:27.560> don't<00:03:28.370> grow<00:03:28.909> fruit<00:03:29.419> from<00:03:30.199> its<00:03:30.379> seeds<00:03:30.769> or

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
you don't grow fruit from its seeds or

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.309 
you don't grow fruit from its seeds or
its<00:03:31.159> pips<00:03:31.430> I<00:03:31.669> mean<00:03:31.909> obviously<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:32.419> can<00:03:32.720> but

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
its pips I mean obviously you can but

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.020 
its pips I mean obviously you can but
for<00:03:33.560> instance<00:03:33.680> if<00:03:34.069> you<00:03:34.190> were<00:03:34.280> to<00:03:34.430> plant<00:03:34.669> pear

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
for instance if you were to plant pear

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.009 
for instance if you were to plant pear
pips<00:03:35.959> or<00:03:36.319> seeds<00:03:37.220> you<00:03:37.909> could<00:03:38.060> be<00:03:38.239> dead<00:03:38.659> and<00:03:38.900> in

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
pips or seeds you could be dead and in

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.719 
pips or seeds you could be dead and in
the<00:03:39.049> ground<00:03:39.139> long<00:03:39.739> before<00:03:40.099> that<00:03:40.250> pear<00:03:40.549> was

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:40.729 
the ground long before that pear was

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:43.180 
the ground long before that pear was
producing<00:03:41.359> any<00:03:41.540> fruit<00:03:41.659> and<00:03:42.620> apples<00:03:42.979> could

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
producing any fruit and apples could

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.039 
producing any fruit and apples could
take<00:03:43.370> 25<00:03:43.819> years<00:03:44.060> before<00:03:44.419> they<00:03:44.510> wanted<00:03:44.959> to

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
take 25 years before they wanted to

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.619 
take 25 years before they wanted to
produce<00:03:45.169> fruit<00:03:45.650> so<00:03:46.370> what's<00:03:47.060> happened<00:03:47.449> for<00:03:47.479> a

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
produce fruit so what's happened for a

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.289 
produce fruit so what's happened for a
long<00:03:47.780> time<00:03:48.019> now<00:03:48.229> is<00:03:48.470> that<00:03:48.709> we<00:03:48.889> take<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.940> apple

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
long time now is that we take the apple

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.330 
long time now is that we take the apple
variety<00:03:50.690> we<00:03:50.780> want<00:03:50.989> we<00:03:51.199> graft<00:03:51.560> it<00:03:51.739> onto<00:03:51.889> a<00:03:52.010> root

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
variety we want we graft it onto a root

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.580 
variety we want we graft it onto a root
stock<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:53.000> all<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.209> root<00:03:53.419> stock<00:03:53.720> is<00:03:53.930> is<00:03:54.319> what

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
stock and all the root stock is is what

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.039 
stock and all the root stock is is what
it<00:03:54.769> says<00:03:54.979> they're<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.370> roots<00:03:55.699> so<00:03:56.629> you<00:03:56.659> take<00:03:57.019> a

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
it says they're the roots so you take a

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.520 
it says they're the roots so you take a
piece<00:03:57.349> of<00:03:58.209> whatever<00:03:59.209> your<00:03:59.449> food<00:04:00.109> varieties

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
piece of whatever your food varieties

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.250 
piece of whatever your food varieties
and<00:04:00.889> you<00:04:01.040> can<00:04:01.189> grass<00:04:01.489> graft<00:04:02.209> that<00:04:02.750> onto<00:04:03.169> a

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
and you can grass graft that onto a

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.229 
and you can grass graft that onto a
variety<00:04:03.680> of<00:04:03.979> root<00:04:04.310> stocks<00:04:04.639> to<00:04:04.849> give<00:04:05.060> you

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
variety of root stocks to give you

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.210 
variety of root stocks to give you
different<00:04:05.419> effects<00:04:05.959> and<00:04:06.169> the<00:04:06.949> main

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
different effects and the main

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.809 
different effects and the main
difference<00:04:07.760> is<00:04:08.090> how<00:04:08.919> vigorously<00:04:09.919> they<00:04:10.579> will

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
difference is how vigorously they will

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.780 
difference is how vigorously they will
grow<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:11.389> how<00:04:12.319> quickly<00:04:12.680> they<00:04:13.069> will<00:04:13.220> fruit<00:04:13.609> a

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
grow and how quickly they will fruit a

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.129 
grow and how quickly they will fruit a
lot<00:04:13.909> of<00:04:13.970> this<00:04:14.209> research<00:04:14.629> was<00:04:14.659> done<00:04:14.900> obviously

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:15.139 
lot of this research was done obviously

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.490 
lot of this research was done obviously
for<00:04:15.560> commercial<00:04:16.099> horticulture<00:04:17.139> and<00:04:18.139> what<00:04:18.349> I'm

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
for commercial horticulture and what I'm

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.199 
for commercial horticulture and what I'm
doing<00:04:18.769> that<00:04:18.919> if<00:04:19.039> I'm<00:04:19.159> standing<00:04:19.400> between<00:04:19.729> two

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
doing that if I'm standing between two

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.499 
doing that if I'm standing between two
apple<00:04:20.509> trees<00:04:20.750> that<00:04:20.930> were<00:04:20.989> planted<00:04:21.169> about<00:04:22.509> 1213

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:23.509 
apple trees that were planted about 1213

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:25.899 
apple trees that were planted about 1213
years<00:04:23.750> ago<00:04:23.960> and<00:04:24.279> they're<00:04:25.279> both<00:04:25.400> in<00:04:25.610> need<00:04:25.760> of

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:25.909 
years ago and they're both in need of

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:27.640 
years ago and they're both in need of
their<00:04:26.090> winter<00:04:26.810> pruning<00:04:27.020> which<00:04:27.349> is<00:04:27.469> going<00:04:27.590> to

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
their winter pruning which is going to

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.050 
their winter pruning which is going to
be<00:04:27.770> done<00:04:27.919> this<00:04:28.039> weekend<00:04:28.490> but<00:04:28.639> what<00:04:28.760> I<00:04:28.789> want<00:04:28.969> to

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
be done this weekend but what I want to

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.290 
be done this weekend but what I want to
show<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:29.330> is<00:04:29.479> if<00:04:29.599> we<00:04:29.750> pan<00:04:29.990> out

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
show you is if we pan out

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.469 
show you is if we pan out
the<00:04:30.419> one<00:04:30.659> on<00:04:30.870> your<00:04:31.590> left<00:04:31.800> is<00:04:32.210> planted<00:04:33.210> on<00:04:33.300> an

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
the one on your left is planted on an

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.339 
the one on your left is planted on an
apple<00:04:33.870> root<00:04:34.050> stock<00:04:34.349> called<00:04:35.300> m26<00:04:36.300> this<00:04:37.110> means

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
apple root stock called m26 this means

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:39.860 
apple root stock called m26 this means
it<00:04:37.470> will<00:04:37.500> give<00:04:37.740> you<00:04:37.830> a<00:04:37.860> finished<00:04:38.340> tree<00:04:38.870> that's

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
it will give you a finished tree that's

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.629 
it will give you a finished tree that's
about<00:04:41.599> three<00:04:42.599> and<00:04:42.690> a<00:04:42.750> half<00:04:42.780> to<00:04:43.319> sort<00:04:43.530> of<00:04:43.639> four

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
about three and a half to sort of four

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.460 
about three and a half to sort of four
and<00:04:44.699> a<00:04:44.759> half<00:04:44.789> five<00:04:45.210> meters<00:04:45.659> tall<00:04:46.639> whereas<00:04:47.639> the

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
and a half five meters tall whereas the

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.249 
and a half five meters tall whereas the
Apple<00:04:49.470> on<00:04:49.650> your<00:04:50.460> right<00:04:50.819> is<00:04:51.449> actually<00:04:51.840> planted

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
Apple on your right is actually planted

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:53.809 
Apple on your right is actually planted
on<00:04:52.610> m106

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:53.819 
on m106

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:55.610 
on m106
and<00:04:54.000> that<00:04:54.389> will<00:04:54.539> give<00:04:54.690> you<00:04:54.810> a<00:04:54.870> tree<00:04:55.319> that<00:04:55.530> as

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
and that will give you a tree that as

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.070 
and that will give you a tree that as
you<00:04:55.770> can<00:04:55.889> see<00:04:56.159> is<00:04:56.370> four<00:04:56.849> to<00:04:57.030> five<00:04:57.270> meters<00:04:57.569> tall

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
you can see is four to five meters tall

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.800 
you can see is four to five meters tall
they're<00:04:58.770> the<00:04:58.889> same<00:04:59.220> variety<00:04:59.610> of<00:05:00.090> apple<00:05:00.569> and

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
they're the same variety of apple and

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.230 
they're the same variety of apple and
that's<00:05:01.289> the<00:05:01.620> difference<00:05:02.039> the<00:05:02.250> root<00:05:02.460> stock<00:05:02.819> can

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
that's the difference the root stock can

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.510 
that's the difference the root stock can
make<00:05:03.500> now<00:05:04.500> there<00:05:04.680> are<00:05:04.770> awful<00:05:05.159> lot<00:05:05.280> of<00:05:05.400> root

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
make now there are awful lot of root

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.450 
make now there are awful lot of root
stocks<00:05:05.849> out<00:05:06.090> there<00:05:06.120> but<00:05:06.960> for<00:05:07.620> most<00:05:07.889> sort<00:05:08.310> of

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
stocks out there but for most sort of

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.129 
stocks out there but for most sort of
things<00:05:08.699> with<00:05:08.940> apples<00:05:09.330> there<00:05:09.539> are<00:05:09.690> three<00:05:09.930> you

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
things with apples there are three you

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.740 
things with apples there are three you
want<00:05:10.259> to<00:05:10.409> be<00:05:10.500> thinking<00:05:10.830> about<00:05:11.360> m26<00:05:12.360> for<00:05:12.629> what

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
want to be thinking about m26 for what

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.330 
want to be thinking about m26 for what
are<00:05:12.840> called<00:05:12.870> dwarf<00:05:13.229> permits<00:05:13.830> or<00:05:14.009> the

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
are called dwarf permits or the

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.980 
are called dwarf permits or the
average-sized<00:05:14.879> garden<00:05:15.300> which<00:05:15.419> is<00:05:15.449> the<00:05:15.690> one<00:05:15.840> on

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
average-sized garden which is the one on

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.770 
average-sized garden which is the one on
your<00:05:16.020> left<00:05:16.349> and<00:05:17.000> 1:06<00:05:18.000> if<00:05:18.210> you've<00:05:18.360> got<00:05:18.509> poor

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
your left and 1:06 if you've got poor

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.770 
your left and 1:06 if you've got poor
soil<00:05:19.139> or<00:05:19.349> you've<00:05:19.500> got<00:05:19.710> more<00:05:19.889> space<00:05:20.280> and

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
soil or you've got more space and

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.050 
soil or you've got more space and
there's<00:05:21.780> another<00:05:22.050> one<00:05:22.259> called<00:05:22.379> m27<00:05:23.280> and<00:05:23.610> that

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
there's another one called m27 and that

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.459 
there's another one called m27 and that
really<00:05:24.599> is<00:05:24.690> for<00:05:24.840> what<00:05:24.990> we're<00:05:25.139> talking<00:05:25.440> about

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 
really is for what we're talking about

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:26.920 
really is for what we're talking about
when<00:05:25.710> we're<00:05:25.800> talking<00:05:25.830> about<00:05:26.009> those<00:05:26.280> dwarf

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
step-over apples it's one of the reasons

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.180 
step-over apples it's one of the reasons
you<00:05:30.569> are<00:05:30.719> better<00:05:31.050> using<00:05:31.560> a<00:05:31.650> specialist<00:05:32.129> like

which ones will be right for you and

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.999 
which ones will be right for you and

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
they have most of their apple varieties

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.399 
they have most of their apple varieties
on<00:05:38.159> most<00:05:38.520> of<00:05:38.669> their<00:05:38.849> root<00:05:39.060> stocks<00:05:39.389> and<00:05:40.080> it's

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409 
on most of their root stocks and it's

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:42.019 
on most of their root stocks and it's
exactly<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:40.979> same<00:05:41.159> one<00:05:41.340> we<00:05:41.460> come<00:05:41.669> to<00:05:41.759> thinking

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:42.029 
exactly the same one we come to thinking

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:45.080 
exactly the same one we come to thinking
about<00:05:42.150> pairs<00:05:42.659> or<00:05:43.199> plums<00:05:43.830> or<00:05:44.190> cherries<00:05:44.699> the

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.090 
about pairs or plums or cherries the

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.510 
about pairs or plums or cherries the
root<00:05:45.360> stock<00:05:45.779> can<00:05:46.469> make<00:05:46.680> a<00:05:46.710> massive<00:05:47.159> difference

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
root stock can make a massive difference

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.360 
root stock can make a massive difference
to<00:05:47.789> how<00:05:48.120> quickly<00:05:48.539> that<00:05:49.529> comes<00:05:49.800> into<00:05:49.979> fruit

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
to how quickly that comes into fruit

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.240 
to how quickly that comes into fruit
whatever<00:05:51.060> the<00:05:51.240> fruit<00:05:51.479> is<00:05:51.690> and<00:05:51.930> how<00:05:52.529> big<00:05:52.949> it<00:05:53.099> is

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
whatever the fruit is and how big it is

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.939 
whatever the fruit is and how big it is
which<00:05:53.460> is<00:05:53.490> why<00:05:53.849> when<00:05:54.090> I<00:05:54.180> say<00:05:54.389> there<00:05:54.630> is<00:05:54.779> a

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
which is why when I say there is a

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.950 
which is why when I say there is a
perfect<00:05:55.949> fruit<00:05:56.190> tree<00:05:56.460> for<00:05:56.940> your<00:05:57.210> garden<00:05:57.659> no

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
perfect fruit tree for your garden no

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.860 
perfect fruit tree for your garden no
matter<00:05:58.169> how<00:05:58.380> big<00:05:58.710> or<00:05:58.830> small<00:05:58.889> that<00:05:59.639> is<00:05:59.870> there

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
matter how big or small that is there

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.040 
matter how big or small that is there
certainly<00:06:01.349> is<00:06:01.560> so<00:06:02.039> you<00:06:02.699> know<00:06:02.819> that's<00:06:03.569> the

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
certainly is so you know that's the

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:08.089 
certainly is so you know that's the
basic<00:06:04.650> rule<00:06:04.830> of<00:06:04.860> thumb<00:06:05.009> I<00:06:05.340> tend<00:06:05.819> to<00:06:05.879> use<00:06:07.099> m106

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
basic rule of thumb I tend to use m106

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:10.640 
basic rule of thumb I tend to use m106
or<00:06:08.340> m26<00:06:08.969> for<00:06:09.240> the<00:06:09.330> majority<00:06:09.690> of<00:06:09.960> my<00:06:10.139> planting

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
or m26 for the majority of my planting

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.890 
or m26 for the majority of my planting
and<00:06:11.520> when<00:06:11.699> we<00:06:11.819> come<00:06:11.969> onto<00:06:12.120> that<00:06:12.419> are<00:06:12.509> planting

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
and when we come onto that are planting

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.790 
and when we come onto that are planting
our<00:06:13.020> pears<00:06:13.319> our<00:06:13.740> quince<00:06:15.080> and<00:06:16.080> our<00:06:16.259> plums<00:06:16.560> I'll

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
our pears our quince and our plums I'll

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.189 
our pears our quince and our plums I'll
explain<00:06:17.520> what<00:06:17.909> root<00:06:18.120> stock<00:06:18.389> I've<00:06:18.539> chosen<00:06:18.840> and

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 
explain what root stock I've chosen and

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:22.309 
explain what root stock I've chosen and
why<00:06:19.819> so<00:06:20.819> that's<00:06:21.000> just<00:06:21.150> a<00:06:21.300> very<00:06:21.330> quick<00:06:21.779> what

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 
why so that's just a very quick what

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:24.439 
why so that's just a very quick what
root<00:06:22.529> stocks<00:06:22.889> do<00:06:23.219> and<00:06:23.699> why<00:06:23.940> we<00:06:24.120> should<00:06:24.150> be

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449 
root stocks do and why we should be

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:25.909 
root stocks do and why we should be
using<00:06:24.629> a<00:06:24.900> specialist<00:06:25.319> like<00:06:25.379> blackboard
