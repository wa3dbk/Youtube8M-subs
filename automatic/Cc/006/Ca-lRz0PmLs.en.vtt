00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.130
 It seems that 's what I feel 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.280
 genius is a kind of last taboo 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:19.880
 so it is not a taboo greater than that 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:23.310
 sexual orientation the champion even though 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.789
 generality involves people who are not 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.949
 homosexuals and people who are very fond 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.140
 and if expressed within the context 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.660
 women's cultural rights but are not 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.620
 homosexuals and then pear head of both the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.620
 Basque like you 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.489
 I have biological sex sex that is male or 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.960
 female or intersex 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.909
 the gender identity that is the 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.649
 identity that the person has with 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:54.260
 cultural male construction 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.839
 female or both and has the 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.070
 sexual orientation that is where the desire 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.379
 of the person who is for man and woman 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.580
 both or none were things that come 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:07.909
 noting the two- year 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:12.470
 confused and scattered way to do 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:15.649
 long time I denied and repressed it 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.940
 I focused as much as I could the part of my 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.759
 with regard to the 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.740
 homosexuality to the identity of 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.560
 genre was once more a thing later 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.340
 when I discovered a group of people who 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.619
 are transgenic and give no 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.920
 express their trajectory old 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:38.659
 I felt at home I felt I discovered 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.899
 a space a new and real space like 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.630
 discover reality through contact 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.780
 with a collective with people who enter 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.490
 on this boat too for me 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.969
 taught another form of militancy 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.579
 as well as a few years ago I 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.400
 I was a communist and I participated in a project 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:59.760
 in 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.050
 the construction of socialism as I do today 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:08.880
 I am involved in a process that is 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:12.690
 also of transformation in many things 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.790
 What upsets me is checking the same body. 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.520
 Which way do I go to what? 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.760
 I'll go as it goes, I can give 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.060
 and what's up, I feel good then 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.350
 woman I want to be like the woman between 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.300
 quotes 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.650
 the conversations, but in interviews 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.250
 where I go 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.350
 most of them around the theme 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.350
 tranquility and does not have a history 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.530
 comics that was my resume 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.660
 previous to mine I sometimes have 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.240
 I wonder if it bothers me, not me. 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.590
 I was not surprised by a 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.660
 I look in the mirror and I see myself so I do not like 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.790
 woman mother as man but not as 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.190
 managed to render the same I express myself 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.640
 This way I love it, I found it. 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.940
 I do not want this kind of representation. 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.760
 wear a replica when I know 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.540
 I want to represent some form of idea or 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.790
 of a certain model that with fable 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.260
 with my search also for the expression of the 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.900
 freedom of expression 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:18.959
 I know I think humanity should 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.750
 to walk to one moment or another an 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:25.030
 stage in which the expression of gender 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:29.150
 it was the genre you 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.950
 completely free there right from these peoples 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.590
 our famous things of the law 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.830
 No one is kidding, I 'm not. 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.260
 to fantasize 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.260
 No, it's not carnival, it's doubt.
