aliens<00:02:20.870> are<00:02:20.959> coming<00:02:21.080> in<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.349> same<00:02:21.500> way<00:02:21.620> they

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
aliens are coming in the same way they

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.740 
aliens are coming in the same way they
were<00:02:21.920> before<00:02:22.099> but<00:02:22.849> you<00:02:23.000> have<00:02:23.180> your<00:02:23.480> main

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
were before but you have your main

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.089 
were before but you have your main
objective<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:24.349> to<00:02:24.500> make<00:02:24.650> sure<00:02:24.680> that<00:02:24.980> the

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
objective is to make sure that the

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.860 
objective is to make sure that the
building<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.489> has<00:02:25.670> this<00:02:25.819> icon<00:02:26.209> on<00:02:26.330> it<00:02:26.450> stays

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
building that has this icon on it stays

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.900 
building that has this icon on it stays
up<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:27.830> now<00:02:28.040> you're<00:02:28.190> killing<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.580> enemies<00:02:28.819> to

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
up so now you're killing the enemies to

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.309 
up so now you're killing the enemies to
keep<00:02:29.060> them<00:02:29.209> away<00:02:29.420> but<00:02:29.480> you<00:02:29.750> additionally<00:02:30.200> have

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
keep them away but you additionally have

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.290 
keep them away but you additionally have
the<00:02:30.440> option<00:02:30.680> of<00:02:30.739> using<00:02:30.800> repair<00:02:31.400> to<00:02:31.940> keep<00:02:32.150> the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
the option of using repair to keep the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.030 
the option of using repair to keep the
building<00:02:32.569> up<00:02:32.690> right<00:02:32.900> as<00:02:33.019> well<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:33.739> let's<00:02:33.950> talk

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
building up right as well so let's talk

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.770 
building up right as well so let's talk
about<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.610> GMO<00:02:34.909> technology<00:02:34.940> because<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:35.720> think

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
about the GMO technology because I think

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.780 
about the GMO technology because I think
that<00:02:35.930> adds<00:02:36.170> another<00:02:36.379> interesting<00:02:36.830> twist<00:02:37.190> to

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
that adds another interesting twist to

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.509 
that adds another interesting twist to
this<00:02:38.629> this<00:02:38.900> cooperative<00:02:39.590> mode<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.310> way<00:02:40.370> G

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
this this cooperative mode the way G

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.040

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
that's man-made is destructible so you

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.570 
that's man-made is destructible so you
can<00:02:44.269> take<00:02:44.420> this<00:02:44.569> sheer<00:02:45.200> down<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.710> cave<00:02:46.280> walls
