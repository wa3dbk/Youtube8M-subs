00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
can we get the good fats because that's

our<00:03:01.500> dad<00:03:01.650> okay<00:03:02.280> well<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.240> recommendation<00:03:03.900> for

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
our dad okay well the recommendation for

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.410 
our dad okay well the recommendation for
the<00:03:04.110> omega-3s<00:03:04.740> in<00:03:05.010> particular<00:03:05.550> that<00:03:05.700> DHA

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
the omega-3s in particular that DHA

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.480 
the omega-3s in particular that DHA
which<00:03:06.630> is<00:03:06.780> really<00:03:07.020> important<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:08.040> we<00:03:08.340> get

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
which is really important is that we get

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.370 
which is really important is that we get
at<00:03:08.610> least<00:03:08.640> two<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.150> three<00:03:09.180> servings<00:03:09.570> of<00:03:09.870> fish

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
at least two to three servings of fish

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.830 
at least two to three servings of fish
every<00:03:10.890> week<00:03:11.100> into<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.090> into<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.450> diet<00:03:12.630> to

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
every week into the into the diet to

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.650 
every week into the into the diet to
lower<00:03:12.990> heart<00:03:13.260> disease<00:03:13.560> risk<00:03:13.850> or<00:03:14.850> that<00:03:15.420> equates

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
lower heart disease risk or that equates

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.650 
lower heart disease risk or that equates
to<00:03:15.900> about<00:03:16.110> 200<00:03:16.800> to<00:03:16.830> 300<00:03:17.340> milligrams<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:18.060> DHA

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
to about 200 to 300 milligrams of DHA

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.690 
to about 200 to 300 milligrams of DHA
the<00:03:19.260> problem<00:03:19.770> with<00:03:19.920> fish<00:03:20.160> though<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.670> that

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
the problem with fish though is that

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.490 
the problem with fish though is that
