00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.610 
I get ready but I have to bleach it
every<00:00:54.539> 10<00:00:54.750> days<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.620> about<00:00:56.480> shoe<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:58.469> is

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
every 10 days this is about shoe this is

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.569 
every 10 days this is about shoe this is
at<00:00:58.710> least<00:00:58.890> two<00:00:59.190> weeks<00:00:59.780> maybe<00:01:00.780> more<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.620> growth

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
at least two weeks maybe more of growth

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.329 
at least two weeks maybe more of growth
that's<00:01:02.850> why<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.000> had<00:01:03.180> so<00:01:03.449> much<00:01:03.629> black<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.339> so

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
that's why I had so much black in it so

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.000 
that's why I had so much black in it so
it<00:01:05.400> was<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.700> little<00:01:05.939> expensive<00:01:06.420> look<00:01:06.990> pricey<00:01:07.290> to

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
it was a little expensive look pricey to

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.179 
it was a little expensive look pricey to
try<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.310> pay<00:01:08.549> somebody<00:01:08.820> every<00:01:09.390> 10<00:01:09.630> days<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:10.950> do

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
try to pay somebody every 10 days to do

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.000 
try to pay somebody every 10 days to do
it<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.360> chose<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:13.020> figure<00:01:13.290> out<00:01:13.439> how<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.650> do<00:01:13.830> it

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
it so I chose to figure out how to do it

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.990 
it so I chose to figure out how to do it
on<00:01:14.130> my<00:01:14.189> own<00:01:14.509> so<00:01:15.619> typically<00:01:16.640> what<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.670> do<00:01:17.759> I'll

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
on my own so typically what I do I'll

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.460 
on my own so typically what I do I'll
give<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.540> information<00:01:18.750> about<00:01:18.990> products

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
one of the things that I've started to

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.789 
one of the things that I've started to
use<00:01:21.750> because<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.140> used<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.530> kind<00:01:22.710> of

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
use because I used to just kind of

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.160 
use because I used to just kind of
eyeball<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.340> go<00:01:23.430> by<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.580> clock<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.420> use

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.660 

typically<00:01:46.930> I<00:01:47.020> can<00:01:47.290> get<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:48.130> blonde<00:01:48.400> that<00:01:48.549> I

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
typically I can get the blonde that I

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.039 
typically I can get the blonde that I
want<00:01:48.970> it<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.180> first<00:01:49.420> time<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:50.740> I<00:01:51.159> sometimes

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
have to do it twice so on the first

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.170 
have to do it twice so on the first
go-round<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.470> maximum<00:01:57.100> I'd<00:01:57.280> do<00:01:57.520> it<00:01:57.670> is<00:01:57.820> 40

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
go-round the maximum I'd do it is 40

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.640 
go-round the maximum I'd do it is 40
minutes<00:01:58.479> so<00:01:58.840> let<00:01:58.960> me<00:01:59.049> tell<00:01:59.200> you<00:01:59.259> what<00:01:59.409> you<00:01:59.500> need

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
I live on the edge a little bit and I

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.600 
I live on the edge a little bit and I
can<00:02:34.120> do<00:02:34.569> it<00:02:34.720> because<00:02:35.080> I'm<00:02:35.709> not<00:02:35.920> afraid<00:02:36.190> to

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
can do it because I'm not afraid to

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.759 
can do it because I'm not afraid to
shave<00:02:37.239> my<00:02:37.480> head<00:02:37.690> essentially<00:02:38.170> so<00:02:38.350> if<00:02:38.470> it<00:02:38.620> just

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
shave my head essentially so if it just

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.740 
shave my head essentially so if it just
goes<00:02:38.950> super<00:02:39.700> bad<00:02:39.850> I<00:02:40.090> can<00:02:40.209> just<00:02:40.390> cut<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.630> off<00:02:40.720> and

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
goes super bad I can just cut it off and

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:41.729 
goes super bad I can just cut it off and
start<00:02:41.170> all<00:02:41.230> over

start all over

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.610 
start all over
it's<00:02:42.130> probably<00:02:42.370> not<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.550> best<00:02:43.350> process<00:02:44.350> but

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
it's probably not the best process but

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.410 
it's probably not the best process but
just<00:02:44.970> giving<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.030> truth

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420
