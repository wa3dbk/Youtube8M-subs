00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
lot of a kind unique taste for every

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.420 
lot of a kind unique taste for every

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
have three screws and I'm each part

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.399 
have three screws and I'm each part
which<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.399> kind<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.880> drag<00:02:06.149> but<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.659> can<00:02:07.290> get

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
which is kind of a drag but I can get

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.020 
which is kind of a drag but I can get
past<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.979> um

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.089 

the<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.480> don't<00:02:12.900> know<00:02:12.989> it's<00:02:13.379> just<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.859> really

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
the I don't know it's just a really

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.899 
the I don't know it's just a really
really<00:02:14.760> good<00:02:15.239> board<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:17.430> only<00:02:17.609> thing<00:02:17.760> out

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
really good board the only thing out

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.410 
really good board the only thing out
like<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.420> its<00:02:19.260> widest<00:02:19.650> point<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:20.010> 9<00:02:20.400> inches<00:02:20.640> so

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
like is its widest point is 9 inches so

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.630 
like is its widest point is 9 inches so
you<00:02:21.540> can't<00:02:21.780> really<00:02:22.010> get<00:02:23.010> really<00:02:23.280> big<00:02:23.489> and

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
you can't really get really big and

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.780 
you can't really get really big and
