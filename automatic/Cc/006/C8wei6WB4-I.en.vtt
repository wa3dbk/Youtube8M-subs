you're looking for revolving or relating
I<00:01:11.400> mean<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.939> Bethesda<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.600> not<00:01:13.049> there<00:01:13.260> now<00:01:13.590> it

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
I mean to Bethesda is not there now it

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:14.870 
I mean to Bethesda is not there now it
is<00:01:13.890> worth<00:01:14.040> mentioning<00:01:14.070> as<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:14.729> see<00:01:14.850> i

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
is worth mentioning as you can see i

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.820 
is worth mentioning as you can see i
highlighted<00:01:15.330> down<00:01:15.570> there<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:15.960> lots<00:01:16.710> more

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
highlighted down there and lots more

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.469 
highlighted down there and lots more
there<00:01:17.310> are<00:01:17.460> other<00:01:17.640> companies<00:01:17.880> there<00:01:18.299> but

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
there are other companies there but

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.390 
there are other companies there but
assuming<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.200> Bethesda<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.830> huge<00:01:20.159> name

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
assuming that Bethesda is a huge name

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.999 
assuming that Bethesda is a huge name
I'm<00:01:20.640> guessing<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.810> would<00:01:22.049> be<00:01:22.290> somewhere

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
I'm guessing that it would be somewhere

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.530 
I'm guessing that it would be somewhere
on<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.280> list<00:01:23.759> if<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.240> were<00:01:24.299> actually

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
on that list if they were actually

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.539 
on that list if they were actually
attending<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.680> naturally<00:01:26.189> they're<00:01:26.400> not

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
attending so naturally they're not

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.280 
attending so naturally they're not

attending that's kind of enough to go

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.840 
attending that's kind of enough to go
ahead<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.680> close<00:01:28.890> away<00:01:29.070> any<00:01:29.369> potential

the truth about one hundred percent sure

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.620 
the truth about one hundred percent sure
really<00:01:50.430> what<00:01:50.549> was<00:01:50.700> going<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.090> there<00:01:51.329> i<00:01:51.360> think

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
really what was going on there i think

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.139 
really what was going on there i think
it<00:01:51.689> was<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.840> dlc<00:01:52.770> was<00:01:52.920> really<00:01:53.340> late<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:53.970> I

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
it was a dlc was really late and like I

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.660 
it was a dlc was really late and like I
think<00:01:54.390> xbox<00:01:55.170> had<00:01:55.350> two<00:01:55.530> pieces<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.920> DLC<00:01:56.369> before

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
think xbox had two pieces of DLC before

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.700 
think xbox had two pieces of DLC before
PlayStation<00:01:57.540> even<00:01:57.780> got<00:01:57.930> one<00:01:58.140> or<00:01:58.350> something

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
PlayStation even got one or something

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.160 
PlayStation even got one or something
like<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:58.890> way<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.250> was<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.430> huge<00:01:59.729> delay

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
like that way it was a huge delay

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.420 
like that way it was a huge delay
apparently<00:02:01.170> Bethesda<00:02:01.590> showed<00:02:01.740> little<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.250> no

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
apparently Bethesda showed little to no

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.880 
apparently Bethesda showed little to no
care<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.909> play<00:02:03.060> station<00:02:03.450> at<00:02:03.570> all<00:02:03.780> um<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.649> was<00:02:04.770> an

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
care to play station at all um it was an

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.440 
care to play station at all um it was an
issue<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.189> wasn't<00:02:05.670> too<00:02:05.759> hard<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.000> fix<00:02:06.210> but

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
issue that wasn't too hard to fix but

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.300 
issue that wasn't too hard to fix but
they<00:02:06.600> didn't<00:02:07.049> really<00:02:07.320> do<00:02:07.469> much<00:02:07.649> about<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:08.009> I

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
they didn't really do much about it I

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.699 
they didn't really do much about it I
think<00:02:08.369> that's<00:02:08.910> how<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.149> went<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:10.259> don't

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
think that's how it went and I don't

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.869 
think that's how it went and I don't
think<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.039> test<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.550> close<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
think the test is that close the

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.380 
think the test is that close the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
bethesda there it's also worth

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.120 
bethesda there it's also worth

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
mentioning that Bethesda's relationship

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.890 
mentioning that Bethesda's relationship
with<00:02:30.280> Microsoft<00:02:30.790> is<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:30.940> lot<00:02:31.150> closer<00:02:31.540> and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
with Microsoft is a lot closer and

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.960 
with Microsoft is a lot closer and
that's<00:02:32.830> because<00:02:33.070> they<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.520> know<00:02:33.550> they<00:02:33.670> get

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
that's because they you know they get

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.600 
that's because they you know they get
they<00:02:34.120> used<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.390> get<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.690> dlc<00:02:35.290> first<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:35.980> think

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610
