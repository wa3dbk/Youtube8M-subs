00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
dns code and i realized that i already

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.979 
dns code and i realized that i already
had<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.160> typed<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.390> once<00:00:42.660> you've<00:00:42.809> got<00:00:42.960> it

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
start this mission up and I'm not sure

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.810 
start this mission up and I'm not sure
if<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.230> different<00:00:55.649> because<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> DNS

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
if this is different because of the DNS

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.400 
if this is different because of the DNS
code<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.300> don't<00:00:57.690> know<00:00:57.840> if<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.199> actual

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
code I don't know if this is the actual

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.139 
code I don't know if this is the actual
mission<00:00:58.859> because<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.670> this<00:00:59.730> just<00:00:59.969> piss

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
mission because it is and this just piss

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.380 
mission because it is and this just piss
easy<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:01.170> with<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.770> DNS<00:01:02.160> code<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.670> get<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.120> lot

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
easy but with the DNS code you get a lot

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.600 
easy but with the DNS code you get a lot
more<00:01:03.420> money<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.080> lot<00:01:04.229> more<00:01:04.409> RP<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.339> I

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
more money in a lot more RP so I

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.490 
more money in a lot more RP so I
recommend<00:01:05.939> changing<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> difficulty<00:01:07.290> too

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
recommend changing the difficulty too

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.920 
recommend changing the difficulty too
hard<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.250> maximize<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.909> RP<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.780> get

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
hard just to maximize the RP is you get

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.320 
hard just to maximize the RP is you get
one<00:01:10.110> point<00:01:10.140> five<00:01:10.619> extra<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.700> makes<00:01:11.939> sense<00:01:12.119> so

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
one point five extra that makes sense so

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.179 
one point five extra that makes sense so
put<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.110> closed<00:01:13.439> or<00:01:13.710> if<00:01:13.830> you've<00:01:13.979> got

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
put it on closed or if you've got

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.130 
put it on closed or if you've got
