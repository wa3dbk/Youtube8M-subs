things I'll cover in another video about

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.530 
things I'll cover in another video about
angling<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.519> positioning<00:00:08.970> like<00:00:09.150> I'm<00:00:09.300> doing

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
angling and positioning like I'm doing

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.419

not perfect but try to pay attention to

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.910 
not perfect but try to pay attention to
the<00:00:18.300> horizontal<00:00:18.840> bars<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.289> your<00:00:19.380> crosshair

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
the horizontal bars in your crosshair

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.859 
the horizontal bars in your crosshair
these<00:00:20.609> will<00:00:20.789> serve<00:00:21.000> as<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> great<00:00:21.390> reference

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
these will serve as a great reference

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.529 
these will serve as a great reference
point<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.260> line<00:00:22.500> up<00:00:22.650> your<00:00:22.769> shots<00:00:23.070> now<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.180> prefer

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
point to line up your shots now I prefer

the<00:00:24.779> Sabo<00:00:25.080> shell<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:25.769> let's<00:00:25.920> take<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> look<00:00:26.340> at

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
the Sabo shell but let's take a look at

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.830 
the Sabo shell but let's take a look at
the<00:00:26.550> reference<00:00:26.849> point<00:00:27.090> for<00:00:27.269> helicopters

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
the reference point for helicopters

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.890 
the reference point for helicopters
while<00:00:27.960> using<00:00:28.170> ap<00:00:28.849> when<00:00:29.849> zoomed<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.599> want<00:00:30.779> to

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
while using ap when zoomed you want to

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.749 
while using ap when zoomed you want to
use<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.199> tip<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.679> outermost<00:00:32.070> hash<00:00:32.460> mark

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
use the tip of the outermost hash mark

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.520 
use the tip of the outermost hash mark
as<00:00:32.910> your<00:00:33.120> horizontal<00:00:33.420> reference<00:00:34.079> point<00:00:34.350> for

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
as your horizontal reference point for

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.040 
as your horizontal reference point for
when<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> helicopter<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.370> going<00:00:35.579> full<00:00:35.820> speed

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
when the helicopter is going full speed

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.869 
when the helicopter is going full speed
the<00:00:37.050> helicopter<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> large<00:00:38.070> target<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.820> you

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
the helicopter is a large target so you

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.240 
the helicopter is a large target so you
have<00:00:39.059> some<00:00:39.239> room<00:00:39.390> for<00:00:39.570> air<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:39.989> also<00:00:40.890> have<00:00:41.160> to

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
have some room for air you also have to

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.770 
have some room for air you also have to
adjust<00:00:41.370> for<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> vertical<00:00:42.180> height<00:00:42.390> but

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
adjust for the vertical height but

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.880 
adjust for the vertical height but
somewhere<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> middle<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.770> lower

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
somewhere in the middle of the lower

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.180 
somewhere in the middle of the lower
hash<00:00:44.190> mark<00:00:44.460> will<00:00:44.610> get<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.879> started<00:00:49.190> Sabo

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
hash mark will get you started Sabo

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.069 
hash mark will get you started Sabo
shell<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.579> considerably<00:00:51.149> easier<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
shell is considerably easier the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.660 
shell is considerably easier the
reference<00:00:52.410> point<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.770> use<00:00:52.920> for<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.460> in

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
reference point I use for it is in

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.580 
reference point I use for it is in
between<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.090> outer<00:00:54.239> hash<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.140> double

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
between the outer hash and the double

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.189 
between the outer hash and the double
stacked<00:00:56.010> hashes<00:00:56.579> again<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.109> adjust

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
stacked hashes again you have to adjust

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.110 
stacked hashes again you have to adjust
for<00:00:58.500> height<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.430> course<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.760> depends<00:01:00.030> on

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
for height and of course it depends on

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.060 
for height and of course it depends on
the<00:01:00.270> distance<00:01:00.629> but<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> good<00:01:01.320> medium<00:01:01.500> distance

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the distance but a good medium distance

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.100 
the distance but a good medium distance
like<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.489> would<00:01:02.760> be<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:03.300> below<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.899> circle

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
like this would be just below the circle

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.219 
like this would be just below the circle
in<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.559> center<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.220> screen<00:01:05.810> now<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.020> will

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
in the center of the screen now I will

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.630 
in the center of the screen now I will
be<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.439> first<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.860> tell<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.520> don't

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
be the first to tell you that you don't

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.399 
be the first to tell you that you don't
always<00:01:08.909> find<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.390> helicopter<00:01:09.869> flying<00:01:10.110> across

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
always find a helicopter flying across

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.320 
always find a helicopter flying across
your<00:01:10.590> screen<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.939> obviously

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
your screen like this this is obviously

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.840 
your screen like this this is obviously
staged<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:13.590> if<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.799> start<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.220> practice<00:01:14.640> and

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
staged but if you start to practice and

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.310 
staged but if you start to practice and
start<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.119> get<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> feel<00:01:15.330> for<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.840> helicopter

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
start to get a feel for the helicopter

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.289 
start to get a feel for the helicopter
speeds<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.250> adjust<00:01:17.610> your<00:01:17.670> aiming<00:01:17.939> point

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
speeds you can adjust your aiming point

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.810 
speeds you can adjust your aiming point
accordingly<00:01:18.900> here<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> couple<00:01:20.220> real-world

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
accordingly here a couple real-world

and<00:01:32.260> these<00:01:33.010> aren't<00:01:33.250> anything<00:01:33.640> special<00:01:34.120> I

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
and these aren't anything special I

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.149 
and these aren't anything special I
regularly<00:01:34.659> land<00:01:35.170> these<00:01:35.350> shots<00:01:35.680> using<00:01:36.070> this

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
regularly land these shots using this

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:43.109 
regularly land these shots using this
method

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119

in this next clip I'm actively judging
and<00:01:45.850> aiming<00:01:46.179> using<00:01:46.479> my<00:01:46.600> HUD<00:01:46.840> I<00:01:47.079> haven't<00:01:47.770> found

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
and aiming using my HUD I haven't found

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.770 
and aiming using my HUD I haven't found
anything<00:01:48.189> teachable<00:01:48.729> yet<00:01:48.939> but<00:01:49.179> if<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.390> do<00:01:49.450> I'll

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
anything teachable yet but if I do I'll

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.559 
anything teachable yet but if I do I'll
definitely<00:01:50.619> make<00:01:50.770> a<00:01:50.799> new<00:01:50.979> video<00:01:51.270> again<00:01:52.270> this

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.539 
definitely make a new video again this
is<00:01:52.719> a<00:01:52.750> great<00:01:53.079> starting<00:01:53.500> point<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:53.950> you<00:01:54.399> can

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
is a great starting point and you can

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.429 
is a great starting point and you can
start<00:01:54.789> to<00:01:54.969> use<00:01:55.149> other<00:01:55.420> HUD<00:01:55.689> references<00:01:56.200> based

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
start to use other HUD references based

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.380 
start to use other HUD references based
on<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.710> helicopter<00:01:57.219> speed<00:01:57.520> as<00:01:57.729> you<00:01:57.789> get<00:01:58.270> more

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
on the helicopter speed as you get more

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:07.969 
on the helicopter speed as you get more
comfortable

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.460 

helicopters<00:02:08.940> are<00:02:09.090> cool<00:02:09.270> but<00:02:09.569> what<00:02:09.899> about<00:02:10.110> jets

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
helicopters are cool but what about jets

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.850 
helicopters are cool but what about jets
if<00:02:11.190> Jets<00:02:11.670> are<00:02:11.819> much<00:02:11.970> trickier<00:02:12.379> if<00:02:13.379> a<00:02:13.530> jet<00:02:13.739> is

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
if Jets are much trickier if a jet is

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.040 
if Jets are much trickier if a jet is
flying<00:02:14.099> at<00:02:14.250> normal<00:02:14.640> maximum<00:02:15.150> speed<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.870> is

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
flying at normal maximum speed that is

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.229 
flying at normal maximum speed that is
without<00:02:16.260> afterburner<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.640> can<00:02:17.790> use<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.090> area

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
without afterburner you can use the area

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.000 
without afterburner you can use the area
in<00:02:18.540> between<00:02:18.660> either<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.349> text<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.830> says

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
in between either the text it says

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.520 
in between either the text it says
