00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
know that vodka was launched in a very

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.500 
know that vodka was launched in a very
competitive<00:01:14.510> segment<00:01:15.200> we<00:01:16.150> improved<00:01:17.150> a<00:01:17.330> lot

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
competitive segment we improved a lot

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.570 
competitive segment we improved a lot
compared<00:01:18.110> to<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.350> previous<00:01:18.710> version<00:01:18.770> that<00:01:19.280> we

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
compared to the previous version that we

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.450 
compared to the previous version that we
did<00:01:19.760> some<00:01:20.090> very<00:01:20.120> radical<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.770> innovative

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
did some very radical and innovative

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.850 
did some very radical and innovative
solutions<00:01:22.910> like<00:01:23.479> for<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:23.870> interior<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:24.770> I

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
solutions like for the interior and I

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.040 
solutions like for the interior and I
think<00:01:25.130> that<00:01:25.280> most<00:01:25.610> of<00:01:25.790> them<00:01:26.000> make<00:01:26.720> us<00:01:26.900> who

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
think that most of them make us who

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.499 
think that most of them make us who
deserves<00:01:27.410> a<00:01:27.500> prize<00:01:27.740> I<00:01:28.340> would<00:01:28.640> say<00:01:28.790> first<00:01:29.420> of

the journalist enjoys a design but

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.249 
the journalist enjoys a design but
clearly<00:01:37.820> see<00:01:37.880> improvement<00:01:38.540> in<00:01:38.690> term<00:01:39.229> of

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.889 
road and that's all this very
specificity<00:02:07.640> of<00:02:07.670> that<00:02:07.760> car<00:02:08.119> that<00:02:08.420> was<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.750> win

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.020 
specificity of that car that was to win
the<00:02:09.019> prize<00:02:09.229> I<00:02:09.619> think<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.130> jury<00:02:10.399> acknowledged

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
the prize I think the jury acknowledged

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.870 
the prize I think the jury acknowledged
that<00:02:11.480> is<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.690> lot<00:02:12.019> of<00:02:12.290> improvement<00:02:12.860> still<00:02:13.519> to<00:02:13.790> be

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
that is a lot of improvement still to be

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.300 
that is a lot of improvement still to be
done<00:02:14.030> with<00:02:14.239> conventional<00:02:14.870> technology<00:02:15.440> the

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
done with conventional technology the

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.600 
done with conventional technology the
car<00:02:16.580> is<00:02:16.959> significant<00:02:17.959> weight<00:02:18.170> reduction<00:02:18.709> 140

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
car is significant weight reduction 140

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.050 
car is significant weight reduction 140
it<00:02:20.120> has<00:02:20.330> very<00:02:20.600> modern<00:02:21.080> very<00:02:21.230> lean<00:02:21.740> engines<00:02:22.400> so

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
it has very modern very lean engines so

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.340 
it has very modern very lean engines so
a<00:02:23.090> lot<00:02:23.510> can<00:02:23.720> be<00:02:23.780> done<00:02:24.020> without<00:02:24.170> the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
a lot can be done without the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.860 
a lot can be done without the
electrification<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:25.550> of<00:02:25.670> course<00:02:25.940> as<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.330> bonus

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
electrification and of course as a bonus

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.190 
electrification and of course as a bonus
it<00:02:27.020> has<00:02:27.170> this<00:02:28.330> future-oriented<00:02:29.330> interior

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
it has this future-oriented interior

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.510 
it has this future-oriented interior
with<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.470> screen<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:30.860> think<00:02:31.220> we're<00:02:31.340> going<00:02:31.460> to

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
with the screen I think we're going to

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.050 
with the screen I think we're going to
see<00:02:31.640> in<00:02:31.730> all<00:02:31.850> cars<00:02:32.090> very<00:02:32.360> soon<00:02:32.630> so<00:02:33.380> I<00:02:34.010> think<00:02:34.820> the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
see in all cars very soon so I think the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.240 
see in all cars very soon so I think the
jury<00:02:35.410> stayed<00:02:36.410> a<00:02:36.680> little<00:02:36.800> bit<00:02:36.950> with<00:02:37.190> the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
jury stayed a little bit with the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.920 
jury stayed a little bit with the
conventional<00:02:37.700> technology<00:02:38.300> because<00:02:38.690> the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
conventional technology because the

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.720 
conventional technology because the
electric<00:02:39.320> isn't<00:02:39.590> still<00:02:39.830> really<00:02:40.070> really

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
electric isn't still really really

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.000 
electric isn't still really really
proven<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.020> electric<00:02:42.380> technology<00:02:42.530> is

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
proven and the electric technology is

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.520 
proven and the electric technology is
also<00:02:43.310> very<00:02:43.460> expensive<00:02:44.030> this<00:02:44.600> is<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.810> car<00:02:45.260> that

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
also very expensive this is a car that

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.580 
also very expensive this is a car that
