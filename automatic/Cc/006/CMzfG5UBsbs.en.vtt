pretty<00:01:57.990> good<00:01:58.259> but<00:01:58.619> depends<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.130> what<00:01:59.399> type<00:01:59.640> of

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
pretty good but depends on what type of

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.760 
pretty good but depends on what type of
the<00:01:59.939> Randell<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.479> get<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:01.320> I'm<00:02:01.469> gonna

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
the Randell I get but I'm gonna

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.260 
the Randell I get but I'm gonna
concentrate<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.460> later<00:02:02.700> because<00:02:03.119> this

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
concentrate on that later because this

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.289 
concentrate on that later because this
is<00:02:03.420> very<00:02:03.780> costly<00:02:04.250> to<00:02:05.250> do<00:02:05.610> all<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:05.939> especially

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
is very costly to do all this especially

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.479 
is very costly to do all this especially
if<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.659> fail<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> few<00:02:07.170> times<00:02:07.350> that's<00:02:08.069> really

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
if you fail a few times that's really

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.050 
if you fail a few times that's really
cost

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
cost

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.890 
cost
it<00:02:09.209> really<00:02:09.780> really<00:02:10.110> sucks<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.480> pretty<00:02:12.480> much<00:02:12.569> I

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
it really really sucks so pretty much I

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.620 
it really really sucks so pretty much I
have<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.319> item<00:02:13.650> that<00:02:13.770> I<00:02:13.890> want<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.250> get<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:15.180> see

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
right here I got this version I had the

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.990 
right here I got this version I had the
arm<00:02:19.260> level<00:02:19.530> 20<00:02:20.010> version<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.910> I'm

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
actually used out of a 20 version to

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.030 
actually used out of a 20 version to
feed<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.420> new<00:02:24.630> version<00:02:25.050> which<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:25.290> level<00:02:25.440> 26

feed the new version which is level 26

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.280 
feed the new version which is level 26
so<00:02:26.640> I'm<00:02:26.730> going<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:26.970> scroll<00:02:27.239> down<00:02:27.300> as<00:02:28.019> you<00:02:28.170> can

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
so I'm going to scroll down as you can

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.650 
so I'm going to scroll down as you can
see<00:02:28.500> here<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.099> there's<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.760> little<00:02:30.030> 20<00:02:30.150> version

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
see here and there's a little 20 version

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.780 
see here and there's a little 20 version
I<00:02:30.780> had<00:02:30.989> so<00:02:31.830> I'll<00:02:31.920> make<00:02:32.099> sure<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.310> it's<00:02:32.610> going

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
I had so I'll make sure that it's going

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.550 
I had so I'll make sure that it's going
into<00:02:33.000> materials<00:02:33.660> because<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.200> don't<00:02:34.349> want<00:02:34.470> to

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
into materials because I don't want to

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.400 
into materials because I don't want to
go<00:02:34.680> over<00:02:34.980> it<00:02:35.130> there<00:02:35.519> you<00:02:35.640> go

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
go over it there you go

just you know eliminate stuff so I

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.930 
just you know eliminate stuff so I

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
unchecked basically everything except

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.420 
unchecked basically everything except

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.509 
for the old dachi which is a two-handed
katana<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.390> now<00:03:22.109> I<00:03:22.140> had<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.530> Excalibur<00:03:23.430> right

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.520 
katana and now I had the Excalibur right
there<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:24.030> now<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:24.239> have<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.540> whole<00:03:24.810> bunch<00:03:24.989> Xcover

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
there so now I have a whole bunch Xcover

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.860 
there so now I have a whole bunch Xcover
that<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:25.980> got<00:03:26.190> from<00:03:26.370> farming<00:03:26.970> as<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.569> can<00:03:27.720> see

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
that I got from farming as you can see

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.319 
that I got from farming as you can see
right<00:03:28.019> there<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:28.530> it's<00:03:29.190> 84<00:03:29.640> percent<00:03:30.060> chance

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
right there and it's 84 percent chance

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.680 
right there and it's 84 percent chance
that<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.720> actually<00:03:30.959> do<00:03:31.350> it<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.829> take<00:03:32.310> that<00:03:32.690> now

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
that I actually do it so I take that now

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.930 
that I actually do it so I take that now
I<00:03:33.720> take<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.170> chance<00:03:34.440> on<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.920> first<00:03:35.160> one<00:03:35.340> is<00:03:35.459> 84

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
I take the chance on the first one is 84

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.460 
I take the chance on the first one is 84
percent<00:03:35.970> that's<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.569> pretty<00:03:36.750> good<00:03:36.959> shot<00:03:37.200> and

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
percent that's a pretty good shot and

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.770 
percent that's a pretty good shot and
it's<00:03:38.160> gonna<00:03:38.340> work<00:03:38.489> because<00:03:39.049> 84%<00:03:40.579> damn<00:03:41.630> so<00:03:42.630> I'm

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
it's gonna work because 84% damn so I'm

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.270 
it's gonna work because 84% damn so I'm
not<00:03:42.930> going<00:03:43.079> to<00:03:43.170> show<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:43.350> all<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:44.130> way
