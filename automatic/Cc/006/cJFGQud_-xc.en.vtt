00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
soul-g honestly this show is too big for

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.360 
soul-g honestly this show is too big for
us<00:00:40.670> our<00:00:41.360> tech<00:00:41.690> schedule<00:00:42.230> was<00:00:42.530> way<00:00:42.800> too<00:00:42.860> short

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
us our tech schedule was way too short

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.090 
us our tech schedule was way too short
but<00:00:43.970> we<00:00:44.090> did<00:00:44.270> it<00:00:44.390> anyway

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
but we did it anyway

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.670 
but we did it anyway
biggest<00:00:46.100> challenge<00:00:46.550> was<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:46.910> helicopters

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
biggest challenge was the helicopters

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.830 
biggest challenge was the helicopters
hover<00:00:48.680> over<00:00:49.100> us<00:00:49.220> they<00:00:49.490> had<00:00:49.580> to<00:00:49.670> fly<00:00:49.880> by<00:00:50.210> us<00:00:50.240> and

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
hover over us they had to fly by us and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.420 
hover over us they had to fly by us and
of<00:00:50.930> course<00:00:50.960> there's<00:00:51.530> the<00:00:51.740> shows<00:00:51.950> big

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
of course there's the shows big

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.790 
of course there's the shows big
signature<00:00:52.910> moment<00:00:53.420> one<00:00:53.840> had<00:00:54.080> to<00:00:54.230> land<00:00:54.440> on<00:00:54.680> the

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
signature moment one had to land on the

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.970 
signature moment one had to land on the
stage<00:00:55.660> of<00:00:56.660> course<00:00:56.900> we<00:00:57.170> couldn't<00:00:57.440> build<00:00:57.710> a

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
stage of course we couldn't build a

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.240 
stage of course we couldn't build a
full-scale<00:00:58.430> prop<00:00:59.240> helicopter<00:01:00.050> so<00:01:00.380> I<00:01:00.410> built<00:01:01.040> a

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
full-scale prop helicopter so I built a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.100 
full-scale prop helicopter so I built a
sound<00:01:01.610> helicopter<00:01:02.450> that<00:01:02.600> had<00:01:02.810> to<00:01:02.960> have

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
sound helicopter that had to have

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.830 
sound helicopter that had to have
everything<00:01:03.670> except<00:01:04.670> it<00:01:04.970> couldn't<00:01:05.540> have

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
everything except it couldn't have

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.470 
everything except it couldn't have
helicopter<00:01:06.710> wind<00:01:06.980> sounds<00:01:07.520> because<00:01:08.000> the<00:01:08.210> sound

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
helicopter wind sounds because the sound

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.109 
helicopter wind sounds because the sound
of<00:01:08.690> wind<00:01:08.930> would<00:01:09.680> mask<00:01:10.010> the<00:01:10.160> music<00:01:10.640> and<00:01:10.820> the

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
of wind would mask the music and the

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.600 
of wind would mask the music and the
voices<00:01:11.770> but<00:01:12.770> it<00:01:12.920> had<00:01:13.130> rotors<00:01:14.680> which<00:01:15.680> we<00:01:16.400> could

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
voices but it had rotors which we could

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.520 
voices but it had rotors which we could
hear<00:01:16.880> even<00:01:17.180> when<00:01:17.330> it<00:01:17.450> was<00:01:17.600> far<00:01:17.900> away

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
hear even when it was far away

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.820 
hear even when it was far away
it<00:01:19.130> had<00:01:19.430> boomy<00:01:19.970> base<00:01:20.210> that<00:01:20.630> got<00:01:20.810> louder<00:01:21.619> and

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
it had boomy base that got louder and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.170 
it had boomy base that got louder and
louder<00:01:22.070> as<00:01:22.340> it<00:01:22.490> got<00:01:22.610> closer<00:01:22.910> and<00:01:23.119> closer<00:01:23.479> it

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
louder as it got closer and closer it

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.719 
louder as it got closer and closer it
had<00:01:26.180> a<00:01:26.210> fuzzy<00:01:26.750> motor<00:01:27.200> and<00:01:27.920> they<00:01:28.070> came<00:01:28.310> over<00:01:28.340> the

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
had a fuzzy motor and they came over the

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.999 
had a fuzzy motor and they came over the
roof<00:01:28.910> of<00:01:29.150> the<00:01:29.240> US<00:01:29.479> embassy<00:01:32.290> and<00:01:33.290> had<00:01:33.530> whistling

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009

latencies and coverage nearby and all of
these<00:01:40.340> different<00:01:40.580> elements<00:01:41.390> had<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.170> speed<00:01:42.500> up

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:42.679 
these different elements had to speed up

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.800 
these different elements had to speed up
or<00:01:42.890> slow<00:01:42.950> down<00:01:43.520> together<00:01:43.940> depending<00:01:44.690> on

or slow down together depending on

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.300 
or slow down together depending on
whether<00:01:45.050> the<00:01:45.229> helicopter<00:01:45.770> keeps<00:01:45.920> going<00:01:46.160> too

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
whether the helicopter keeps going too

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:55.419

fast you're covering the prize wait if I

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.760 
fast you're covering the prize wait if I
can<00:01:55.729> change<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.479> speed<00:01:56.780> of<00:01:57.050> the<00:01:57.110> rotors<00:01:57.500> what

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
can change the speed of the rotors what

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.590 
can change the speed of the rotors what
happens<00:01:58.190> if<00:01:58.340> I<00:01:58.460> change<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:59.030> speed<00:01:59.330> of<00:01:59.509> the

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
happens if I change the speed of the

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.710 
happens if I change the speed of the
rotors<00:01:59.960> a<00:01:59.990> lot<00:02:00.649> what<00:02:01.640> if<00:02:01.789> right<00:02:02.090> at<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:02.390> moment
