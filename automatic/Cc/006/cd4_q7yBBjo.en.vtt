00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.710
 caravans with a tent allow you to travel without worrying about 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.850
 book what needs is there of hotels when you can park 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.519
 everywhere and in a moment and then in the hotel they will not give you some pure air and bonfires 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.059
 camping caravans have been around since the early 1900s 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.439
 and have had immediate success 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.599
 brand new 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.449
 with a caravan at each stop you can enjoy all the modern comforts of six 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.509
 great freedom 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.559
 production begins by welding together tubular steel components which 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.559
 will form the robust horse frame 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.120
 once the suppliers of the hydraulic system have been partially painted 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.570
 electric wrinkles are now installed 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.880
 the water tank and the next joint 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.030
 therefore steel cables similar to those of the airplanes from the are mounted 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.030
 uprights at the corners up to the central bar 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.660
 this is called a sling 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.570
 once the parasite is activated, the cables lift the uprights, once 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.570
 they will raise the cover of the squid 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.620
 now the frame has taken the next location where the floor is covered 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.620
 of vinyl is laid 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.250
 and then inhabited with care 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.680
 then electrical wires are connected to those already installed in the chassis for the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.830
 operation of appliances and stereo system 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.640
 then the steel and aluminum bulkheads are nailed to the inner front wall 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.770
 frame the children are passed inside until the side lights of the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.770
 caravan finally the external panel is mounted 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.020
 so the front panel is slipped on the left uprights is 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.770
 fixed 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.230
 the external side panel is composed of two parts so as to leave the space 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:58.930
 for strength 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.930
 to complete together they are assembled 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.350
 Poraccio is passed inside where the frame for the seats will be installed 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.019
 therefore lower kitchen cabinets that are fixed to the upper ones 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.119
 through a long metal pin that will accompany the movements of the caravaggio 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:23.359
 therefore between the lower cabinets a mini fridge is installed together with a 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:26.359
 kitchenette for future ip lunch 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:32.309
 here is the extractable platform for one of the mattresses these slip on 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:36.260
 grooves in the external walls but there is still a lot of work to do before 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.260
 take a Nap 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:44.299
 pieces of waterproof fabric are glued together to make up the 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.769
 catania's marquee cover the five sections separately 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.929
 it will join together in the control post 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.459
 holly scrupulously controlled joints are not allowed cracks 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:07.779
 once the control has been passed the curtain is fixed on the caravan a section 

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:10.689
 at a time 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:13.689
 therefore the vehicle is ready to receive the roof 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:19.939
 to build it, various materials are superimposed, which requires large ones 

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.260
 quantity of industrial adhesive distributed on these slats of 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:26.609
 plywood 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:32.059
 these foam insulating panels will provide excellent coverage 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:36.079
 glue impregnated foam placed on the outer covering of the fiber xiv 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:36.790
 glass 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.440
 then the wooden rods are arranged along the perimeter and there is 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.440
 they add metal bands for further reinforcement 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:48.559
 final records are in vinyl-covered plywood will be the ceiling 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:49.349
 of the caravan 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.349
 a large zero compress the various layers 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:01.629
 once the grooves of the notches are formed on the roof there is 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.729
 insert the electric wires and proceed with the installation of a 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:07.519
 12 volt light system 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.090
 then and the finishes are added on the edges of the roof of the gaskets 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.090
 make it impenetrable by water 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.090
 the edges are removed with a yoox pitch arrangement of the corners 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.490
 encapsulated now everything is ready to lift the roof install the tent 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.030
 which is inserted in the incisions made in the ceiling of the caravan 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.030
 using a jackhammer 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.449
 our dear walter ready to be parked where you want you can 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:44.680
 to seize a small and well-equipped family to put it at the table either 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.139
 outside than inside 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.599
 also equipped with a casket door because you never know when 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:53.279
 the adventure will come knocking
