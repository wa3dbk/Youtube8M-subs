00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.760 

I'm<00:03:01.420> switching<00:03:01.840> back<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:01.990> forth<00:03:02.140> between<00:03:02.380> the

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
I'm switching back and forth between the

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.590 
I'm switching back and forth between the
ecotools<00:03:03.370> blending<00:03:03.580> brush<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.240> DZ<00:03:04.570> a

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
ecotools blending brush and the DZ a

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.970 
ecotools blending brush and the DZ a
blending<00:03:04.990> brush<00:03:05.020> because<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:05.530> Eagles<00:03:05.830> whose

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
blending brush because the Eagles whose

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.620 
blending brush because the Eagles whose
one<00:03:06.220> I'm<00:03:06.340> using<00:03:06.490> that<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:06.910> build<00:03:06.940> up<00:03:07.450> the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
one I'm using that to build up the

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.060 
one I'm using that to build up the
orange<00:03:08.020> a<00:03:08.110> bit<00:03:08.260> more<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:08.650> then<00:03:08.740> I'm<00:03:08.830> blending

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
orange a bit more and then I'm blending

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.910 
orange a bit more and then I'm blending
it<00:03:09.400> out<00:03:09.610> because<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:10.150> DVA<00:03:11.080> one<00:03:11.350> is<00:03:11.470> a<00:03:11.620> bit

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
it out because the DVA one is a bit

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.950 
it out because the DVA one is a bit
stiffer<00:03:12.790> so<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:13.180> blends<00:03:13.420> out<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.690> color<00:03:13.870> a

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
stiffer so it blends out the color a

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.660 
stiffer so it blends out the color a
little<00:03:14.080> bit<00:03:14.200> better<00:03:14.380> so<00:03:14.710> that's<00:03:15.340> why<00:03:15.550> I'm

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
little bit better so that's why I'm

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.960 
little bit better so that's why I'm
switching<00:03:15.910> between<00:03:16.270> them<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:18.730> then<00:03:18.880> I'm

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
switching between them and then I'm

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.550 
switching between them and then I'm
going<00:03:19.150> into<00:03:19.300> my<00:03:19.420> Laura<00:03:19.840> Braille<00:03:20.350> and<00:03:20.500> I'm
