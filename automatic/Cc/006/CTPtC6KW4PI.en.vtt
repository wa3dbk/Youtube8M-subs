00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
tighten it up and there you go

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.380 
tighten it up and there you go
now<00:02:47.040> got<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.370> good<00:02:47.610> seal<00:02:50.000> once<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.120> have<00:02:51.239> the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
now got a good seal once you have the

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.270 
now got a good seal once you have the
bulkhead<00:02:51.840> fitting<00:02:52.260> installed<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.860> next<00:02:53.130> step

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
bulkhead fitting installed the next step

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.780 
bulkhead fitting installed the next step
is<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.550> create<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:54.750> manifold<00:02:55.349> for<00:02:56.160> inside<00:02:56.640> the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
is to create the manifold for inside the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.199 
is to create the manifold for inside the
cooler<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.890> wort<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:59.099> going<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.640> drain

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
cooler that the wort is going to drain

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.860 
cooler that the wort is going to drain
through<00:03:00.450> so<00:03:00.930> this<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.440> just<00:03:01.620> C<00:03:01.830> PVC<00:03:02.370> pipe<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:02.910> a

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
through so this is just C PVC pipe and a

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.240 
through so this is just C PVC pipe and a
couple<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.260> different<00:03:04.500> fittings<00:03:04.709> it's<00:03:05.100> all

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
couple of different fittings it's all

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.190 
couple of different fittings it's all
half-inch<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:08.519> only<00:03:08.730> thing<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:08.940> lie<00:03:09.150> used<00:03:09.600> for

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
half-inch the only thing to lie used for

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.470 
half-inch the only thing to lie used for
cutting<00:03:10.709> this<00:03:10.860> was<00:03:11.220> one<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.150> those<00:03:12.239> scissors

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
cutting this was one of those scissors

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.660 
cutting this was one of those scissors
style<00:03:13.010> PVC<00:03:14.010> pipe<00:03:14.340> cutters<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:16.560> what<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.430> have

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
style PVC pipe cutters and what I have

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:25.100 
style PVC pipe cutters and what I have
here<00:03:18.000> is<00:03:18.269> a<00:03:20.690> 45-degree<00:03:21.690> elbow<00:03:23.900> at2<00:03:24.900> join

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
here is a 45-degree elbow at2 join

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.490 
here is a 45-degree elbow at2 join
together<00:03:25.260> with<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.620> small<00:03:26.040> piece<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.310> see<00:03:26.640> PVC

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
together with a small piece of see PVC

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.940 
together with a small piece of see PVC
then<00:03:28.500> I<00:03:28.590> have<00:03:28.790> four<00:03:29.790> elbows<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.709> all<00:03:31.709> that

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
then I have four elbows and all that

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.849 
then I have four elbows and all that
comes<00:03:32.220> together<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:34.079> hardest<00:03:34.440> part<00:03:34.680> really

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
comes together the hardest part really

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.259 
comes together the hardest part really
for<00:03:35.280> this<00:03:35.459> was<00:03:36.200> cutting<00:03:37.200> slits<00:03:37.769> into<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.370> into

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
for this was cutting slits into the into

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.440 
for this was cutting slits into the into
the<00:03:39.359> pipe<00:03:39.540> itself<00:03:39.930> used<00:03:40.680> a<00:03:40.739> hacksaw<00:03:41.209> this<00:03:42.209> part

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
the pipe itself used a hacksaw this part

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.800 
the pipe itself used a hacksaw this part
actually<00:03:43.489> was<00:03:44.489> was<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.090> longest<00:03:45.480> part<00:03:45.660> of<00:03:45.750> the

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
actually was was the longest part of the

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.660 
actually was was the longest part of the
process<00:03:46.170> as<00:03:46.319> well<00:03:46.350> just<00:03:46.980> cutting<00:03:47.400> all<00:03:47.489> these

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
process as well just cutting all these

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.039 
process as well just cutting all these
different<00:03:48.090> little<00:03:48.359> slots<00:03:49.220> it's<00:03:50.220> nothing<00:03:50.579> too

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
different little slots it's nothing too

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:56.000 
different little slots it's nothing too
complicated<00:03:52.049> about<00:03:52.350> it<00:03:54.530> once<00:03:55.530> you<00:03:55.650> have<00:03:55.680> all

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
complicated about it once you have all

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.620 
complicated about it once you have all
that<00:03:56.190> together<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:58.200> just<00:03:58.350> go<00:03:58.470> ahead<00:03:58.590> and

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
that together you just go ahead and

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.840 
that together you just go ahead and
attach<00:04:00.630> it<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.109> inside<00:04:01.470> fitting<00:04:02.250> and

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
attach it to the inside fitting and

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.020 
attach it to the inside fitting and
there<00:04:03.239> you<00:04:03.359> go<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:04.160> cooler<00:04:05.160> with<00:04:05.370> a<00:04:05.400> manifold<00:04:05.910> in

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
there you go a cooler with a manifold in

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.960 
there you go a cooler with a manifold in
it<00:04:06.150> I<00:04:06.959> didn't<00:04:07.650> take<00:04:07.799> any<00:04:08.010> measurements<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.760> cut

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
it I didn't take any measurements to cut

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.120 
it I didn't take any measurements to cut
this<00:04:09.180> pipe<00:04:09.450> I<00:04:09.720> did<00:04:09.900> it<00:04:09.989> all<00:04:10.139> by<00:04:10.170> eye<00:04:10.380> and<00:04:10.620> my

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
this pipe I did it all by eye and my

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.910 
this pipe I did it all by eye and my
hand<00:04:11.370> use<00:04:11.519> my<00:04:11.730> hand<00:04:12.000> obviously<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:13.470> could<00:04:13.650> you

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
hand use my hand obviously you could you

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.500 
hand use my hand obviously you could you
can<00:04:14.100> go<00:04:14.280> ahead<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:14.549> get<00:04:14.639> a<00:04:14.670> ruler<00:04:14.910> if<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.269> want

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
can go ahead and get a ruler if you want

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.870 
can go ahead and get a ruler if you want
to<00:04:16.010> but<00:04:17.010> really<00:04:17.280> it's<00:04:17.400> not<00:04:17.430> that<00:04:17.519> difficult

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
to but really it's not that difficult

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.229 
to but really it's not that difficult
and<00:04:18.600> now<00:04:18.780> we<00:04:18.840> have<00:04:19.019> a<00:04:19.049> mesh<00:04:19.260> tongue<00:04:19.850> so<00:04:20.850> once<00:04:21.120> I

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
and now we have a mesh tongue so once I

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.350 
and now we have a mesh tongue so once I
got<00:04:21.419> the<00:04:21.539> manifold<00:04:22.320> installed<00:04:22.770> I<00:04:23.010> just

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
got the manifold installed I just

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.260 
got the manifold installed I just
attached<00:04:24.360> another<00:04:25.669> CPVC<00:04:26.669> fitting<00:04:27.180> this

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
attached another CPVC fitting this

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.740 
attached another CPVC fitting this
here's<00:04:27.539> just<00:04:27.600> a<00:04:28.169> valve<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:29.660> another

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.700 

threaded<00:04:33.680> mail<00:04:33.920> fitting<00:04:34.510> and<00:04:35.510> then<00:04:35.750> just<00:04:36.620> a

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
threaded mail fitting and then just a

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.450 
threaded mail fitting and then just a
barbed<00:04:37.930> hose<00:04:38.930> fitting<00:04:39.440> and<00:04:39.710> all<00:04:39.920> that's<00:04:40.190> going

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
barbed hose fitting and all that's going

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.740 
barbed hose fitting and all that's going
to<00:04:40.580> allow<00:04:41.360> me<00:04:41.570> to<00:04:41.750> run<00:04:41.930> a<00:04:41.990> hose<00:04:42.260> down<00:04:42.530> into<00:04:42.980> the

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
to allow me to run a hose down into the

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.220 
to allow me to run a hose down into the
brew<00:04:44.750> kettle<00:04:45.220> okay<00:04:46.220> so<00:04:46.280> I<00:04:46.900> fill<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:48.080> cooler

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
brew kettle okay so I fill the cooler

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.130 
brew kettle okay so I fill the cooler
with<00:04:48.560> water<00:04:48.800> and<00:04:49.160> the<00:04:50.030> reason<00:04:50.180> I<00:04:50.360> use<00:04:50.990> this

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
with water and the reason I use this

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.170 
with water and the reason I use this
valve<00:04:51.410> is<00:04:51.590> because<00:04:51.980> I<00:04:52.010> have<00:04:52.310> a<00:04:52.340> really<00:04:53.030> good

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
valve is because I have a really good

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.580 
valve is because I have a really good
control<00:04:53.600> over<00:04:53.630> flow<00:04:54.340> so<00:04:55.340> we<00:04:55.370> can<00:04:55.670> go<00:04:56.530> open<00:04:57.530> it

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
control over flow so we can go open it

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.360 
control over flow so we can go open it
all<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:57.890> way<00:04:58.010> up<00:04:58.600> and<00:04:59.600> we<00:05:00.260> can<00:05:00.410> also<00:05:00.620> have<00:05:01.130> it

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
all the way up and we can also have it

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.679 
all the way up and we can also have it
at<00:05:02.210> just<00:05:02.630> a<00:05:02.810> trickle

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:06.689 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:11.510 

really<00:05:07.689> good<00:05:07.900> control

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.300 

and<00:05:12.000> that's<00:05:12.120> it
