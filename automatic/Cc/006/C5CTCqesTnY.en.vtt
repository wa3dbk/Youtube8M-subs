00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.900
 coki friends in that delivery cremona another account in one of the servers 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.640
 free percent in the old tutorial of the had delivered 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:20.150
 a list about the servers that are in capital so there is no need to 

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:21.269
 cancel anything 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.360
 and this 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.580
 stop did not explode trial let's create an account in the rollover sprint 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.070
 3rd rollover dotcom 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.100
 so the first thing we're going to do is type this address 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.100
 and once they load us to pages here we can see the services already 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.610
 that offers this eco-friendly 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.080
 we see that he offers us 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.440
 a storage capacity of 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.230
 one and a half 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.210
 and we see how lifeless traffic so this is more than enough to 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.500
 our little project 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.330
 own inma php support and that is also strained 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.670
 has the 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.580
 functionality of light beam power before a program that you prepare can of 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.400
 the files 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.540
 r mind 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.100
 and well let's create our account on this server 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.100
 and to create an account the first thing you will do is 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.590
 movie that has this button 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.290
 they do not know until window 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.700
 and what he owes most is 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.640
 write the address of our dominica I have already explained that they would try 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.649
 of hunton domain because here we have that the server 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.110
 this apparent the suffixes made are fixed 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.799
 on the other hand I do not know why this server changes 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.070
 nor does he regularly subdomains but hey 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.860
 we are going to write 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.980
 on behalf of our site 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.980
 for my case he calls it from my first is 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.479
 attitude should describe the choice of crime altitude as they are 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.490
 you want it to be called 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.110
 so who else write 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.110
 on behalf of the user 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.240
 the email 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:13.399
 let's write a password 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.179
 advisable wrote a long password 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:18.889
 and that must be totally private for you 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:22.719
 clearly recommended that you write well the combination of numbers and letters 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.329
 and let's write a password 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.709
 let's repeat it 

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:36.909
 and finally, I have to write this message that appears here 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:47.379
 let's click on this button 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.379
 create my account 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:57.189
 once we have created the account the server does not look at a message to the 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.579
 email address that we have entered 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.269
 and we are going to open that message 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.930
 and we are going to electric ampas to activate that account by clicking on this link 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.829
 and to communicate with a server 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.829
 again the trimo the address of our email 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.079
 and the password that we have entered 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.189
 and we are going to write the text 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:22.189
 that appears in this image 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.629
 the following window will appear and as we can see in trieste 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:31.170
 here something happens 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.580
 I before creating that torean had already created a different account we see that 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.930
 appear eleven fixed 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.630
 and in front of the account that had created before this one a new 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.610
 account that I had created days earlier because because this server regularly 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.769
 so much between one or three days 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.549
 approve these accounts and you must be patient in the toyota car here 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.869
 will appear in status status 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:57.709
 na asp seems the option in progress 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:58.960
 once 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.769
 I'm still certain this is testing order 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.019
 I'm fine 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.589
 you count and you must be aware during the course of studies 

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:10.289
 I do not know why they are so bad is to be so 

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:13.109
 this three days a month in two sometimes bonus 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.109
 in approached ace is the system of three servers 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.509
 this issue on which everyone should be aware 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:23.180
 and this to activate your account and as we can see already 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.170
 in states that the little one had waited before 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.129
 mod we see from piÃ±era do not count are fully active ready so you can 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:32.949
 manage website 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.209
 to communicate with a server either directly in entel from the panel 

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:40.809
 bahman explain this button to him to the administration panel 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.740
 and as we have in day we are already inside the administration panel 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.860

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.860
 our content of our site very 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.740
 and nine in that state 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.419

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:09.059
 he had to create an account before iniesta is using it because 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:11.159
 go inventing can wait 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:12.490
 three days for 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.539

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:52.069
 esteban joaquin bonet who does not allow advertising 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:54.850
 this is a great advantage since in 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.840
 in what we see on our site in what we have truly designed 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.500
 and we do not see things there 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.850
 Spain like a banned advertising keep these belong to the 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:05.990
 third zoque
