00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800
 a hello welcome on the priority v 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.590
 syria the brands live from mÃ©ribel 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.599
 for a frame test this time the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.070
 shred it or 102 which comes to replace the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.260
 kung-fu jazz in the in the range 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.600
 maybe it was time for a case 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.609
 to change on skis because you have to evolve 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.410
 all the same, but hey who finds called 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.980
 outline of the rooster red as 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.960
 with rocker on the front and rocker on 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.809
 the rear okay but a ski that keeps 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.790
 still support from the support 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.070
 really under foot 1 what they're going 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.540
 see in the mind I find that it 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.969
 is still skiing is not big 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.530
 great changes tells us with 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.649
 some evolutions of sugar and eat 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.750
 not well remembered the difference me that 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.850
 remains a very pleasant ski on the track 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.199
 who spreads pretty good but who when 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.910
 even in a freestyle program 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.350
 freeride engaged 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.360
 we are on the blood of skates so 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.620
 it's still a ski with 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.940
 which we will have fun in powder 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.110
 but it's a ski with which we 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.700
 several also on the track that 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.780
 could be inscribed to which every 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.620
 days now if it's to take 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.970
 in a park 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.500
 it may be a little bulky a 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.550
 not wide for rotations and all that 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.680
 it'll be written a little bit more 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.900
 heavy for sure against by a program 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.700
 a little chilly freeride it stays a 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.320
 super skis that can make a slip 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.720
 that's what you found michael 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.380
 skibbe a month a lot of police from pau 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.290
 parish violence which is me but for 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.440
 me still quite demanding so he 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.570
 you have to ski what you have to do not wrong 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.190
 it's not the cushy ski you put on way 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.840
 maybe a bit more technical for 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.820
 enter the curve maybe a hair 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.160
 more finish ahead of gold 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.080
 I'm talking about it, we're going to test the future after 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.810
 will be able to consult on our site on 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.100
 Africa tv there we have the secret of the torso 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.789
 in two we also tested the 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.890
 creditor 112 who oddly enough in 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:52.930
 carling was better then 512 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.190
 here we talk about it 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.630
 look at the story thread test without 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.310
 probably if you are interested in what 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.110
 is a little more fat for the conditions 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.560
 practices or freeride strengths six 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.560
