 beautiful and rather fresh zucchini 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.950
 large the batter is made with 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.039
 beer to make the fry even more 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:45.129
 soft and tasty and the beer must be 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:47.649
 well fresh fridge quantities are 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.620
 variable depending on how many flowers 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.780
 intend to fry as the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.190
 batter finishes if he prepares 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:00.629

 00 flour a little salt and beer 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.880
 mix well with a fork until

 get a homogeneous foamy mixture is 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:14.320
 very dense we add more beer or 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.860
 more flour until you get the right one 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.860
 density 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.409
 in the meantime let's warm up in one 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.860
 fry the olive oil covering the bottom 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.820
 of the pan for about one centimeter 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.790
 let's check when it's ready 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.829
 dipping a toothpick when you do 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:38.350
 will form bubbles around the 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:41.409
 stellino means that ready we immerse 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.159
 the first pumpkin flower in the batter e 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.689
 let's make it soak in the mixture 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.390
 we turn it so that it covers itself with 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.490
 batter on both sides 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:57.100
 then we immerse it immediately in the oil 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:00.689
 and let's fry it let's continue to the 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.689
 same way with other flowers 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.270
 when the pan is full we start a 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.640
 turn the first immersed flowers we leave 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:15.970
 cook until they become golden brown 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.970
 turning them several times, always on a high heat 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.440
 we place the flowers on a covered plate 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.950
 of absorbent paper so that the oil 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.080
 in excess it is absorbed we start again 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.300
 then the starry flowers and other flowers 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:34.870
 we proceed in the same way up to 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:37.910
 finish the flowers with this recipe 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.890
 we get a delicious and tasty dish 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.340
 so much better as more fresh and 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.890
 the flowers will be tasty 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.019
 excellent as an appetizer as stuffing 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.540
 of a sandwich or as a second has eaten 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.459
 in quantity a possible variant e 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.860
 use instead of beer 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.220
 of fresh sparkling mineral water of 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.220
