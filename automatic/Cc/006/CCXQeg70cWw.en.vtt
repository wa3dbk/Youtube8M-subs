very compact and easy to store this is

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.440 
very compact and easy to store this is
the<00:02:40.770> reason<00:02:40.920> why<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.340> futures<00:02:41.730> premiums<00:02:42.240> are

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
the reason why the futures premiums are

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.690 
the reason why the futures premiums are
fairly<00:02:42.750> low<00:02:43.110> relative<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.800> spot<00:02:44.040> pricing<00:02:44.520> if

fairly low relative to spot pricing if

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.030 
fairly low relative to spot pricing if
you<00:02:45.480> look<00:02:45.630> at<00:02:45.780> other<00:02:45.990> commodities<00:02:46.590> such<00:02:47.010> as

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
you look at other commodities such as

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.240 
you look at other commodities such as
nickel<00:02:47.520> copper<00:02:47.880> oil<00:02:48.390> or<00:02:48.900> whatnot<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:50.100> will

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
nickel copper oil or whatnot you will

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.980 
nickel copper oil or whatnot you will
notice<00:02:50.460> that<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.820> premium<00:02:51.300> paid<00:02:51.570> for<00:02:51.930> the

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
notice that the premium paid for the

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.650 
notice that the premium paid for the
future<00:02:52.320> is<00:02:52.500> higher<00:02:53.400> on<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.730> percentage<00:02:54.060> basis

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
future is higher on a percentage basis

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.100 
future is higher on a percentage basis
and<00:02:54.870> as<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:56.070> reflects<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.760> increased<00:02:57.600> cost<00:02:57.870> of

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
and as it reflects the increased cost of

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.800 
and as it reflects the increased cost of
storage<00:02:58.820> this<00:02:59.820> is<00:02:59.970> what<00:03:00.150> makes<00:03:00.330> gold<00:03:00.630> and

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
storage this is what makes gold and

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.990 
storage this is what makes gold and

silver very special they are very

there is a slight motivation for gold to

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
vaulted gold so again we can envision

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.050 
means of offsetting the cost of storage
there<00:05:31.139> is<00:05:31.289> no<00:05:31.470> real<00:05:31.680> profit<00:05:32.160> motive<00:05:32.490> available

there is no real profit motive available

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.420 
there is no real profit motive available

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
and so gold is only reluctantly bidding

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.779 
and so gold is only reluctantly bidding
