00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.120 

let<00:00:02.510> me<00:00:02.600> start<00:00:02.929> off<00:00:03.080> by<00:00:03.110> saying<00:00:03.290> that<00:00:03.679> meiosis

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:04.130 
let me start off by saying that meiosis

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.960 
let me start off by saying that meiosis
and<00:00:04.460> mitosis<00:00:05.049> always<00:00:06.049> trips<00:00:06.649> people<00:00:06.859> up<00:00:07.129> so

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
and mitosis always trips people up so

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.940 
and mitosis always trips people up so
what<00:00:08.180> I<00:00:08.210> always<00:00:08.510> do<00:00:08.870> is<00:00:09.110> try<00:00:09.410> and<00:00:09.440> do<00:00:09.740> a

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
what I always do is try and do a

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.340 
what I always do is try and do a
demonstration<00:00:10.700> that<00:00:11.090> you<00:00:11.420> can<00:00:11.600> actually<00:00:11.930> do

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:12.350 
demonstration that you can actually do

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.220 
demonstration that you can actually do
for<00:00:12.560> yourself<00:00:13.100> at<00:00:13.460> home<00:00:13.750> and<00:00:14.750> that's<00:00:14.960> the

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
for yourself at home and that's the

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.610 
for yourself at home and that's the
fingertip<00:00:16.189> demonstration<00:00:17.029> so<00:00:17.330> I'm<00:00:18.260> gonna<00:00:18.440> ask

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:18.620 
fingertip demonstration so I'm gonna ask

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.550 
fingertip demonstration so I'm gonna ask
you<00:00:18.770> guys<00:00:18.830> sister<00:00:19.430> I<00:00:19.840> know<00:00:20.840> you<00:00:21.050> might<00:00:21.289> feel

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
you guys sister I know you might feel

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.320 
you guys sister I know you might feel
that<00:00:21.590> it's<00:00:21.830> kind<00:00:22.039> of<00:00:22.100> childish<00:00:22.340> but<00:00:22.760> go<00:00:23.060> along

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
that it's kind of childish but go along

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.740 
that it's kind of childish but go along
with<00:00:23.570> me<00:00:23.690> okay<00:00:24.170> all<00:00:25.160> right<00:00:25.520> so<00:00:25.820> you<00:00:26.180> start<00:00:26.240> off

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
with me okay all right so you start off

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:34.029 
with me okay all right so you start off
with<00:00:28.960> one<00:00:29.960> chromosome<00:00:30.470> okay<00:00:31.750> okay<00:00:32.750> so<00:00:33.589> this<00:00:33.859> is

00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:34.039 
with one chromosome okay okay so this is

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:34.840 
with one chromosome okay okay so this is
from<00:00:34.219> dad

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
from dad

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.770 
from dad
you<00:00:35.210> have<00:00:35.359> the<00:00:35.510> homologous<00:00:35.929> patch<00:00:36.399> from<00:00:37.399> mom

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
you have the homologous patch from mom

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.520 
you have the homologous patch from mom
now<00:00:38.780> let's<00:00:38.989> do<00:00:39.170> mitosis<00:00:39.859> in<00:00:40.280> mitosis<00:00:41.350> okay<00:00:42.350> in

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
now let's do mitosis in mitosis okay in

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.939 
now let's do mitosis in mitosis okay in
g1<00:00:42.940> nothing<00:00:43.940> happens<00:00:44.390> right<00:00:44.829> because<00:00:45.829> you

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
g1 nothing happens right because you

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.059 
g1 nothing happens right because you
only<00:00:46.129> synthesize<00:00:46.789> the<00:00:46.969> DNA<00:00:47.120> in<00:00:47.569> S<00:00:47.780> state<00:00:48.079> in<00:00:48.440> S

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:49.069 
only synthesize the DNA in S state in S

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:51.579 
only synthesize the DNA in S state in S
phase<00:00:49.399> you're<00:00:49.940> going<00:00:49.969> to<00:00:50.300> replicate<00:00:50.569> each<00:00:51.260> one

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
phase you're going to replicate each one

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.660 
phase you're going to replicate each one
of<00:00:51.710> these<00:00:52.149> okay<00:00:53.379> okay<00:00:54.409> two<00:00:54.620> sister<00:00:54.979> chromatids

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
of these okay okay two sister chromatids

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.610 
of these okay okay two sister chromatids
it's<00:00:56.629> mitosis<00:00:58.510> dad's<00:00:59.510> chromosomes<00:00:59.989> and<00:01:00.379> mom's

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
it's mitosis dad's chromosomes and mom's

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.529 
it's mitosis dad's chromosomes and mom's
chromosomes<00:01:01.159> don't<00:01:01.370> care<00:01:01.729> what<00:01:02.120> happens<00:01:02.479> to

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
chromosomes don't care what happens to

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:04.990 
chromosomes don't care what happens to
each<00:01:02.690> other<00:01:02.899> they<00:01:03.559> move<00:01:03.889> to<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.159> mitotic<00:01:04.549> to

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
each other they move to the mitotic to

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.060 
each other they move to the mitotic to
the<00:01:05.089> metaphase<00:01:05.479> plate<00:01:05.860> independent<00:01:06.860> of<00:01:06.979> each

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
the metaphase plate independent of each

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.160 
the metaphase plate independent of each
other<00:01:07.280> and<00:01:07.670> this<00:01:08.180> is<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.360> real<00:01:08.600> challenging

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
other and this is the real challenging

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.200 
other and this is the real challenging
part<00:01:09.439> why<00:01:09.979> we<00:01:10.130> have<00:01:10.280> to<00:01:10.430> move<00:01:10.909> them<00:01:11.119> to

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
part why we have to move them to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.609 
part why we have to move them to
opposite<00:01:11.630> poles

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
opposite poles

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.310 
opposite poles
okay<00:01:14.399> so<00:01:14.700> that's<00:01:14.820> mitosis<00:01:15.719> that's<00:01:16.020> pretty

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
okay so that's mitosis that's pretty

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.870 
okay so that's mitosis that's pretty
straightforward<00:01:16.619> okay

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
straightforward okay

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.559 
straightforward okay
meiosis<00:01:18.799> first<00:01:19.969> start<00:01:20.969> off<00:01:21.119> exactly<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.929> same

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
meiosis first start off exactly the same

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.340 
meiosis first start off exactly the same
exactly<00:01:24.569> the<00:01:24.780> same

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
exactly the same

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.440 
exactly the same
you've<00:01:25.679> replicated<00:01:26.399> got<00:01:26.579> sister<00:01:26.939> chromatids

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
you've replicated got sister chromatids

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.529 
you've replicated got sister chromatids
but<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.200> time<00:01:28.530> these<00:01:29.280> homologous<00:01:29.819> sets<00:01:30.360> of

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
but this time these homologous sets of

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:32.510 
but this time these homologous sets of
chromosomes<00:01:30.899> actually<00:01:31.740> care<00:01:32.159> about<00:01:32.340> each

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
chromosomes actually care about each

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.330 
chromosomes actually care about each
other<00:01:33.170> they<00:01:34.170> care<00:01:34.469> what's<00:01:34.709> happening<00:01:35.159> and

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
other they care what's happening and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.090 
other they care what's happening and
they<00:01:35.850> match<00:01:36.450> up<00:01:36.719> with<00:01:37.109> each<00:01:37.170> other<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:38.039> is

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
they match up with each other this is

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.580 
they match up with each other this is
the<00:01:38.340> process<00:01:38.819> of<00:01:38.939> sine<00:01:39.209> abscess<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.200> takes

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
the process of sine abscess it takes

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.240 
the process of sine abscess it takes
place<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.189> prophase<00:01:42.060> one<00:01:43.159> during<00:01:44.159> this

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
place in prophase one during this

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.609 
place in prophase one during this
process<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.390> chiasmata<00:01:45.959> little

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
process you have the chiasmata little

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.460 
process you have the chiasmata little
axis<00:01:47.099> you<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.670> breakage<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.509> rejoining<00:01:49.140> and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
axis you have breakage and rejoining and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.510 
axis you have breakage and rejoining and
then<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.310> separate<00:01:50.849> these<00:01:52.520> recombined

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
then you separate these recombined

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.839 
then you separate these recombined
chromosomes<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.450> opposite<00:01:54.929> poles<00:01:55.849> during

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:56.849 
chromosomes to opposite poles during

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:01.580 
chromosomes to opposite poles during
telophase<00:01:57.209> of<00:01:57.689> meiosis<00:01:58.409> one<00:01:59.329> any-<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.509> two<00:02:00.840> you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
telophase of meiosis one any- is two you

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.609 
telophase of meiosis one any- is two you
take<00:02:01.829> this<00:02:02.459> set<00:02:02.819> of<00:02:03.390> sister<00:02:03.810> chromatids<00:02:03.959> which

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
take this set of sister chromatids which

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.529 
take this set of sister chromatids which
will<00:02:05.099> now<00:02:05.250> line<00:02:05.579> up<00:02:05.819> on<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.090> metaphase<00:02:06.119> plate

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:06.539 
will now line up on the metaphase plate

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.900 
will now line up on the metaphase plate
and<00:02:07.140> these<00:02:07.709> two<00:02:07.979> will<00:02:08.220> separate<00:02:08.670> from<00:02:08.700> each

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
and these two will separate from each

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.210 
and these two will separate from each
other<00:02:09.269> so<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.079> daughter<00:02:10.289> cell<00:02:10.619> delete<00:02:10.979> again

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
other so the daughter cell delete again

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:27.460 
other so the daughter cell delete again
this<00:02:11.459> one<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:17.790> was<00:02:18.000> not<00:02:18.209> planned

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.830 

okay
