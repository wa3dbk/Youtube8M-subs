00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.910
 Awesome 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.040
 this is the word that best describes 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.919
 the image that the group projects to Rome 

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:11.219
 with its 14 elements 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.820
 all professionals 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.730
 the musicians are days 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.790
 the four remaining faces belong agencies of fact female front of the 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.360
 only mixed group 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.250
 that has managed to build a moved air bridge between the south and the north to 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.779
 across the continent 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.840
 thanks to the contagious cadence of those cumbia 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:34.650
 is still trying something that had been said many times 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.780
 the music I do not think concrete 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.080
 they therefore an excellent form of communication 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.920
 alone 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.310
 rhythm melody 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.440
 and the 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.510
 for the other 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.330
 beauty and dance 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.410
 many are its tasty ingredients 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.190
 this is something that everyone knows 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.280
 says it and I repeat it 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.160
 but there are very few who put it into practice as effectively as 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.270
 the group as Rome does 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.590
 a Latin experience of multinational origin 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.970

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.990
 we are headed towards women stresses 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.380

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.690
