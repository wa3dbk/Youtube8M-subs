00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:38.910
 nice enthusiasm and asked a question won 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.710
 asked in the comments to write people like 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.710
 these real life goals they 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:53.739
 the only person nice 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:56.739
 ready to survive even promised to write a review 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.739
 often 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:04.720
 I very much too all the time thinking 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:09.730
 for what can anyone use at all 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:12.490
 can be useful and the delicacy of dogs 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.860
 so no man comes up with a telescope no 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.520
 any changes except deuce on 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.520
 flat at all 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:26.020
 here everyone knows what I will not 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.240
 explain a small file a small 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.220
 spoons 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.220
 no matter what chinese brand 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.899
 always who use them I understand 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.820
 I never used them anyway 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:46.400
 it's like an additional tool to 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.280
 mostly here 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.260
 but the main tool to do with yourself 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.260
 homemade backpack for example 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.189
 collects in the forest, I always have a knife 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:04.880
 like any normal self-respecting 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:07.789
 human size is normal 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.950
 are you ready little somebody big even 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:17.989
 didn't ask me that's not atropine and number 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:21.830
 ten smaller number 8 in solution 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.890
 everyday tasks immediately here you can 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.250
 do you compared to a knife which 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.790
 there is 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.950
 Or I think it will be more convenient 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:36.910
 enjoy there each each for 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:39.650
 themselves here itself chooses a knife brush 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.110
 to solve some more serious 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.930
 tasks 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.790
 proceed already pressed from the multitool 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.700
 such as firewood not for us not to hack to death not 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.000
 you make it clear to solve more 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.069
 I have serious tasks and I look 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:00.120
 I use Masha and bears 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.569
 this is my usual set for that 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.569
 farther 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.790
 any self-respecting normal person 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.190
 takes an ax 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:15.380
 either layouts in my case i use 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:20.050
 father, too, is already clear files 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.050
 it is not only worn 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.200
 Well 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.540
 The file is small 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.090
 bought present do not need to cut 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.710
 only so well it is so thin twig 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.880
 which is possible in principle and the hand is not 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:37.400
 break well and again someone uses 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.150
 bacha saws spout someone fiskars 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.960
 folding 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.950
 I have this Chinese palisade of you 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:49.269
 always 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:52.810
 full size garden saw 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:55.950
 ready cool suitable understood that 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.950
 cuticle dravania 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.090
 drives on and what's up today 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.840
 yesterday I had with him was 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.670
 the fact that they can be distinguished 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.670
 used for colds 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:17.100
 so it turns out that this is the motives 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.100
 really 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.669
 get appeared 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:48.580
 simply 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.680
 size to have of course just add 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:56.560
 blue fence 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:57.790
 already because there are knives once 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.700
 further 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.500
 normal healthy fat be 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:05.110
 reserve handles nato happen and 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.320
 somewhere in the forest candy gets a wire 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.320
 under stress 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.300
 here 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:21.140
 we can add elementary multiple 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:24.320
 throw out because well how am i if u have 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:27.290
 you any movement on food you know 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.950
 some other use I managed 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.640
 interesting will take note 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.200
 to myself 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:43.090
 It was while I think it is much cheaper 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:43.090
 their tenge from the barracks she even budget 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.270
 unusual designs and positive 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:58.599
 the rest of the equipment 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:00.940
 we so then have not bought there 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:04.300
 rejected it i think thats the same 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:10.440
 no problem no bite now 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.440
 sold fuck sizes and listen 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:17.000
 there is even a commonwealth pill landings 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.000
 which is much yourself 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.480
 add 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.190
 that's all flooded 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:41.080
 P.S. 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.110
 Of course the multitool this thing is so harsh 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.660
 and survived to have a multitool it 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:49.750
 so stern put logically but 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:52.690
 real use for it other than 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:55.840
 Well, as I said above, I personally more 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:58.000
 not found of course having a multitool can 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.290
 speak as a stern survivor 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.580
 currently there for me there full-grown 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:09.100
 multitools for 5 thousand this money well 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:11.590
 real use do not think that Ponte 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:16.210
 such in the forest there before you bears 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:18.520
 turn over was so but in the end it's 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:21.010
 my opinion I do not insist on anything 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.660
 everyone decides for themselves want laser man 

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:27.300
 please i will get by 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.300
