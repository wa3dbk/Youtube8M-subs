00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hey here is norms I want 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.200
 Have a delicious and healthy recipe 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.259
 Imagine having fun while copying like that 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.040
 for this recipe the cheap first 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.410
 Red cabbage 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.230
 that works best with the tenant mix 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.519
 I think the red cabbage is about as big 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.210
 cut small pieces then with 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:34.140
 water then fill the lid well 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.790
 then close the speed on the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:44.789
 highest level turn and then only completely 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:49.620
 short on and off and finished 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.180
 I have the red cabbage so the boat comes 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.820
 now given by a sieve 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.379
 and something easily by hand from 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.480
 pressed for excess water 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.489
 get rid of 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:04.489
 so now I make myself a delicious 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:14.520
 dressing of small cut carrots 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:21.020
 zucchini and then for the sharpness through 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.020
 then another chilli schote into it 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:33.720
 so and now come hand-tame 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.780
 depending on how much fat you want 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.350
 You can vary as you like 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.350
 I would not be more than a handful 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.350
 go in 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:59.320
 I definitely recommend all the seeds only in 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.720
 Spoken or broken form first 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.400
 why do not these seeds in 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.240
 they become the mixed vita 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.920
 rotten the vita mix needs now 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.690
 a little more water so I would 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.459
 a little more water down here 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.180
 fill in that he can mix at all 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.880
 so and ready is our salad 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.410
 I have a few more now 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:28.800
 on top of that 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:31.269
 and a few more radishes sprouted 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.840
 they also reinforce again the delicious 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.840
 taste
