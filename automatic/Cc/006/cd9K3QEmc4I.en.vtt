00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.769
 welcome back to spb tv 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.120
 Today I will give you a review too 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.430
 my new john deere 1026 tractor 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.410
 demonstrate 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:24.960
 So that's the tractor again legal 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.509
 we can see then we do it first 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.220
 first go around and I'll show you first 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:34.280
 the crucial and important things 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.760
 So let's start here 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:44.159
 here we have the two headlights the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:47.339
 I think that's very good 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:50.030
 here of course the four-wheel drive too 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:55.110
 at the front wheels 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:01:00.900
 here we have the hydraulic 42 double 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:03.780
 Acting woman are many then yes can 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:07.080
 one here with this thing with this one 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.119
 cable is the magic lifted and this 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:17.579
 two cables for the back 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:19.429
 show it to you right now this is it 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.499
 tail of our tournament 

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:24.990
 here have two lights each 

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:29.810
 each brake light position light and 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:33.689
 flashing light here, too, then we have here 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.119
 send the two hydraulic hoses 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.039
 exploration shows then we have 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.390
 here the hack force as with the 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.229
 Category 1 he raises around the 550 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.450
 kilogram 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.450
 and there we still have the PTO 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.680
 now there's nothing left on number 1 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.880
 a lot to say but still lonely to know 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.590
 here 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.240
 that's the tank okay now let's go 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.070
 Let's see how the driver's seat is 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.280
 So first of all, we're moving forward here 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.740
 and reverse gear so glass that one 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.210
 hydrostatic drive so not so 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.720
 heavy 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.010
 then we have the hand there there 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:27.570
 then we can tap here 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:30.490
 turn it on and off 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:35.460
 activated and how they interact 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:38.890
 Here we were rich, they also 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:43.770
 we have here we go here 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:46.720
 the tempomat the pretty high so to speak 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:51.070
 then we have three different ones here 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:53.080
 lights position lights for the 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.720
 Front lights and for the lights 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.930
 It sounded quite forgotten to show that 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:04.060
 here are two lights on both 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:06.520
 turn that off then we have 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:11.580
 here the group here the left turn signal 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:14.290
 gave us her right and tasty steps 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.120
 framed page do with the left 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.420
 side we have here as well 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.350
 addressed tank cap here is that 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.780
 play then we have the 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:29.230
 level indicator for the fuel 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:33.190
 here would like to have here 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.290
 optional lever for neutral lurking tiger so 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.880
 depending on which weapons go slowly 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.230
 or fast 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.959
 then we can choose here 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.280
 lever which tap as turn on 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.920
 so is the between axa source 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:52.350
 that the back let both gas pumps 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.350
 and that is the tap for rear 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.310
 Here we can pretend the more 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.180
 after how deep we want you here 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.180
 this switch 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.140
 then we can always stay here 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.940
 will be normal engine speeds 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:12.020
 displayed and here the temperature of the 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.670
 motors then will be down there 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:18.190
 hours are displayed how many 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:21.200
 have solved operating hours and otherwise 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.670
 Will be there when the tap 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.980
 is turned on the tap 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.160
 speed shown 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:29.960
 So how many revolutions inheritance 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:33.730
 then we have on the right side 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.370
 here once the handbrake this now 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.930
 inside also recognizes solve again 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.940
 then we have the joystick here once 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.630
 for the two double-acting tax 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.850
 valves 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.200
 then we can also seal here and 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:50.330
 bring back 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.280
 then we have the operator for the 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.600
 hectare 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:59.300
 we can get through this through this 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.860
 this simple construction always us 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.919
 then we have to return to the point 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:10.310
 always the same height force on their tail 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:12.310
 we can weaken the four-wheeler 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.940
 turn on 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:19.910
 down here we can see the 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.000
 regulate speed as fast 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.770
 of hectares on which myself and 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.630
 here you can adjust the driver's seat 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.520
 makes 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.950
 depending on the person heavier or 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.280
 is easier, we can not be strong 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.710
 explained and here you can do a little 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.150
 Do not put that first because as well 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:44.350
 you can still see the seat here 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:44.350
 drive forwards or backwards with this lever 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.460
 yes that was already a review I hope so 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.100
 you liked it 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.020
 if so, why not just relax? 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.590
 I like it click or maybe 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:02.510
 do not subscribe until the next one 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.510
