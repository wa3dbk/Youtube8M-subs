very little in common besides the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
steering wheel and the fact that they've

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.030

both<00:04:04.340> feel<00:04:04.670> really<00:04:05.060> good<00:04:05.390> to<00:04:05.600> drive<00:04:05.840> yes<00:04:06.800> in

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
both feel really good to drive yes in

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.920 
both feel really good to drive yes in
different<00:04:07.430> ways<00:04:07.610> but<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:07.970> Qashqai<00:04:08.420> is<00:04:08.600> a<00:04:08.660> lot

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
different ways but the Qashqai is a lot

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.810 
different ways but the Qashqai is a lot
of<00:04:09.110> people<00:04:09.470> carrier<00:04:09.830> okay<00:04:10.580> it<00:04:10.670> has<00:04:10.790> a
