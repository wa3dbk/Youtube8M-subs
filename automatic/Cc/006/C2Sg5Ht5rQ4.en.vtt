00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:17.880
 hello friends with you again that all 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:21.090
 games and again news about gta 5 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.210
 I probably already got many, and gta 5 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.850
 but nevertheless how would you enjoy yes 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.460
 while waiting to find out some 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:33.690
 game details 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:36.749
 analyze it all and in principle not 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.730
 so much information this time 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:44.219
 from petty information but still news 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.030
 Well, so friends and switching between 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:52.260
 the main characters in the game are hanging on 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:54.329
 the f5 f6 and f7 keys don't know whether 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.729
 convenient to switch exactly these 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.519
 keys but at any time you can 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.280
 change to completely different keys 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.049
 keyboard settings 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.740
 so here, in principle, everything is more or less 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.619
 understandable for movement using 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.240
 class uses classic double 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.820
 and with q and q key q used 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.610
 shelter and interaction with others 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.820
 world mouse wheel of course 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.500
 used to select weapons 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.789
 Naturally all this can be changed 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.490
 also setting up the keyboard and mouse 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:34.070
 confirmed that the new exclusive 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.710
 the radio station will be called hall 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.860
 ok 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.619
 in the game you can make your own 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.580
 sex radio sketching favorite edge to 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.560
 mp3 in a folder for example with the game here 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.210
 but what will be the most interesting 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.009
 full-fledged station with advertising and leading 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.800
 video editor can use 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.930
 the soundtrack from the radio station so you 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.930
 can not fear for copyright 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.240
 upload your video on youtube and here 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.399
 it's just gorgeous here because 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.239
 copyright is of course 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.790
 bad thing I do not argue here but it is 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:16.900
 she is and it is probably 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.970
 problem every blogger youtubera and here 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.580
 rockstar so do it as if for 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.350
 There are such people so you can not 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.459
 fear copyrights lay out 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:30.310
 video immediately on youtube so go hand 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.280
 Further material for the video editor 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.300
 can be written either in continuous piece 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.390
 either in 30-second intervals that is 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.010
 It turns out the last action in the game 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.829
 well here everything is clear what other 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.799
 video capture programs can 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.900
 record at least 30 minutes 40 and you can 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:55.060
 record last there 30 seconds before 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:57.630
 our game for sound in the video editor 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.000
 there are also filters and processing facilities 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:05.680
 that is, for music, too, here all sorts 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.670
 effects free cameras when shooting 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.920
 can be arranged 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.170
 very, very far from what it was 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.590
 four of when you take off 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.650
 portofino let's say so many will 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.440
 do and including we will try here 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:23.230
 and that is, you can arrange the camera 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.250
 absolutely at different distances 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.590
 that's why it is very good again 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.890
 supports outputting images immediately to 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.630
 multiple monitors 2 or 3 as well 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.650
 nvidia 3d vision technology 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:42.130
 Well, as already said, yes, that is 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.990
 game support in nvidia video cards and 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.980
 the game will be optimized of course in 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:52.730
 first on nvidia technology 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.620
 so whoever gives them principle is not 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.190
 upset friends that is who has them 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.230
 give me that will work fine too 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.610
 of course it will be controller support 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.320
 playstation 4 and xbox 360 and xbox one in 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.380
 principle any joystick will be 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.960
 be supported by the game that's all the news 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.670

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.780

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.800
