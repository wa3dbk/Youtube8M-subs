slide<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.810> in<00:03:12.959> here<00:03:13.550> then<00:03:14.550> what<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:14.880> do<00:03:15.000> is<00:03:15.030> you

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
slide it in here then what you do is you

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.810 
slide it in here then what you do is you
end<00:03:15.450> up<00:03:15.600> putting<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.769> part<00:03:17.400> that's<00:03:17.610> more

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
end up putting the part that's more

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.699 
end up putting the part that's more
that's<00:03:18.030> raised<00:03:18.360> at<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:19.110> very<00:03:19.260> bottom<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.650> the

that's raised at the very bottom of the

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.320 
that's raised at the very bottom of the
case<00:03:19.980> and<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:20.310> your<00:03:20.459> other<00:03:20.610> things<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.120> are

case and so your other things that are
stuffed<00:03:21.570> in<00:03:21.720> here<00:03:22.019> won't<00:03:22.350> kind<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.709> bulk<00:03:22.950> up

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
stuffed in here won't kind of bulk up

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.680 
stuffed in here won't kind of bulk up

this part here so this pouch is great on

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.840 
this part here so this pouch is great on
again<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.680> color<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:41.040> then<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.430> pattern<00:03:41.760> is

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
again the color and then the pattern is

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.360 
again the color and then the pattern is
kind<00:03:42.030> of<00:03:42.090> funky<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:43.110> that<00:03:43.620> their<00:03:44.070> design

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
kind of funky is that their design

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.190 
kind of funky is that their design
definitely<00:03:44.760> has<00:03:44.850> a<00:03:44.880> certain<00:03:45.120> vibe<00:03:45.510> to<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:45.930> i

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
definitely has a certain vibe to it i

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.050 
definitely has a certain vibe to it i
don't<00:03:46.560> i'm<00:03:46.709> not<00:03:46.739> a<00:03:46.860> real<00:03:47.070> big<00:03:47.220> fan<00:03:47.489> of<00:03:47.519> this<00:03:47.790> but

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
don't i'm not a real big fan of this but

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.620 
don't i'm not a real big fan of this but
you<00:03:48.390> may<00:03:48.930> love<00:03:49.110> it<00:03:49.170> it's<00:03:49.709> um<00:03:50.100> it's<00:03:50.630> protected

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
you may love it it's um it's protected

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.300 
you may love it it's um it's protected
so<00:03:51.810> there's<00:03:52.050> actually<00:03:52.380> a<00:03:52.440> bit<00:03:52.890> of<00:03:53.010> stiffness

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
so there's actually a bit of stiffness

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.890 
so there's actually a bit of stiffness
here<00:03:53.820> i<00:03:53.970> believe<00:03:54.450> there's<00:03:54.630> a<00:03:54.690> piece<00:03:54.870> of

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
here i believe there's a piece of

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.630 
here i believe there's a piece of
plastic<00:03:55.470> inside<00:03:55.890> here<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.250> then<00:03:56.489> there's

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
plastic inside here and then there's

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.240 
plastic inside here and then there's
also<00:03:56.820> some<00:03:57.510> plastic<00:03:58.080> on<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.500> inside<00:03:58.830> here<00:03:59.070> for

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
also some plastic on the inside here for

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.500 
also some plastic on the inside here for
some<00:03:59.370> stiffness<00:03:59.700> so<00:03:59.940> that's<00:04:00.120> actually<00:04:00.269> going

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
some stiffness so that's actually going

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.770 
some stiffness so that's actually going
to<00:04:00.600> give<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.810> some<00:04:00.870> some<00:04:01.860> pretty<00:04:02.100> decent

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
to give you some some pretty decent

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.270 
to give you some some pretty decent
protection<00:04:03.780> i'm<00:04:04.170> going<00:04:04.410> to<00:04:04.470> zip<00:04:04.650> it<00:04:04.800> up<00:04:04.920> here

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
protection i'm going to zip it up here

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.530 
protection i'm going to zip it up here
so<00:04:05.550> you<00:04:05.610> can<00:04:05.760> kind<00:04:05.970> of<00:04:06.000> see<00:04:06.060> what<00:04:06.300> it<00:04:06.390> looks

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
so you can kind of see what it looks

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.000 
so you can kind of see what it looks
like<00:04:06.690> when<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.110> whole<00:04:07.290> thing<00:04:07.530> is<00:04:07.769> put

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
like when the whole thing is put

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.789 
like when the whole thing is put
together<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.610> there<00:04:08.880> you<00:04:08.970> go<00:04:09.000> so<00:04:09.799> honestly

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
together and there you go so honestly

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.560 
together and there you go so honestly
when<00:04:11.459> you<00:04:11.549> think<00:04:11.760> of<00:04:11.820> what<00:04:11.940> everything<00:04:12.269> i<00:04:12.390> have

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
when you think of what everything i have

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.900 
when you think of what everything i have
crammed<00:04:12.930> in<00:04:13.110> here<00:04:13.140> this<00:04:13.650> is<00:04:13.860> a<00:04:13.890> fairly<00:04:14.340> thin

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
crammed in here this is a fairly thin

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:15.600 
crammed in here this is a fairly thin
and

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
and

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
to my local library which I sometimes go

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.560 
to my local library which I sometimes go
to<00:04:21.100> what<00:04:21.370> I<00:04:21.400> need<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:21.640> do<00:04:21.820> some<00:04:22.000> writing<00:04:22.240> work

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
to what I need to do some writing work

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.840 
to what I need to do some writing work
and<00:04:22.840> this<00:04:23.050> was<00:04:23.260> a<00:04:23.290> perfect<00:04:23.820> perfect<00:04:24.820> perfect

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.300 
there's a strap here I'm going to put a
graphic<00:04:31.720> up<00:04:32.050> on<00:04:32.230> the<00:04:32.380> screen<00:04:32.770> here<00:04:32.830> that<00:04:33.190> will

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
graphic up on the screen here that will

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.340 
graphic up on the screen here that will
kind<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.580> show<00:04:33.790> you<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:34.510> different<00:04:34.900> options

kind of show you the different options

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.230 
kind of show you the different options
for<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.650> strap<00:04:35.980> but<00:04:36.190> there's<00:04:36.370> they<00:04:36.880> have<00:04:37.030> they

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
for the strap but there's they have they

for the strap but there's they have they
have<00:04:37.360> a<00:04:37.390> suspension<00:04:37.870> strap<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.770> they<00:04:39.250> have<00:04:39.520> a

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
have a suspension strap and they have a

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.790 
have a suspension strap and they have a
shoulder<00:04:40.840> strap<00:04:41.170> and<00:04:41.440> this<00:04:41.530> is<00:04:41.650> the

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
shoulder strap and this is the

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.230 
shoulder strap and this is the
suspension<00:04:42.370> strap<00:04:42.640> so<00:04:42.760> it<00:04:42.850> actually<00:04:42.940> comes

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
suspension strap so it actually comes

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.500 
suspension strap so it actually comes
with<00:04:43.510> a<00:04:44.320> little<00:04:44.620> bit<00:04:45.130> of<00:04:45.190> padding<00:04:45.510> now

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
with a little bit of padding now

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.580 
with a little bit of padding now
depending<00:04:46.660> on<00:04:46.990> whether<00:04:47.170> or<00:04:47.230> not<00:04:47.290> you<00:04:47.380> get<00:04:47.470> it

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
depending on whether or not you get it

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.430 
depending on whether or not you get it
with<00:04:47.710> the<00:04:47.800> strap<00:04:48.240> if<00:04:49.240> it<00:04:49.510> adds<00:04:49.660> to<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:49.900> cost<00:04:50.169> so

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
with the strap if it adds to the cost so
