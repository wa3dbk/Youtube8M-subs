there<00:03:53.530> again<00:03:53.829> here<00:03:54.250> we're<00:03:54.430> using<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.870> ruler

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
there again here we're using the ruler

there again here we're using the ruler
to<00:03:56.560> keep<00:03:56.739> those<00:03:56.950> pages<00:03:57.489> a<00:03:57.519> little<00:03:57.879> bit

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
to keep those pages a little bit

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:12.679 
to keep those pages a little bit
straight<00:04:00.629> it<00:04:01.629> is<00:04:01.689> an<00:04:02.079> old<00:04:02.230> book<00:04:02.590> you<00:04:02.890> know<00:04:11.489> on

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:12.689 
straight it is an old book you know on

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:15.990 
straight it is an old book you know on
these<00:04:13.689> battered<00:04:14.170> books<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:15.010> cover<00:04:15.549> if<00:04:15.819> it's

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
these battered books the cover if it's

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.509 
these battered books the cover if it's
chipped<00:04:16.509> it<00:04:16.870> seems<00:04:17.380> like<00:04:17.650> a<00:04:17.680> thread<00:04:18.160> under

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
chipped it seems like a thread under

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.300 
chipped it seems like a thread under
there<00:04:18.729> so<00:04:19.120> I've<00:04:20.079> kind<00:04:20.440> of<00:04:20.500> doctored<00:04:20.979> up<00:04:21.100> the

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
there so I've kind of doctored up the

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.480 
there so I've kind of doctored up the
corners<00:04:21.699> a<00:04:21.729> little<00:04:21.970> bit<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.919> we<00:04:23.919> can<00:04:23.949> stress

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
corners a little bit and we can stress
