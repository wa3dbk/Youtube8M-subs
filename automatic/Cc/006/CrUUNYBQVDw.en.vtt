00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:03.550
 there is always something to do in the garden 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.700
 when lips are not used 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.330
 the bike hoe must be used when the hoe bike is not used 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.129
 to use 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.399
 the cinnamon to water 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:19.839
 I will put a certain point in amusement because it comes that things are gathered in this 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.119
 case we collect the green beans 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.280
 green beans 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.550
 that we don't have them here alca salon of different colors 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:33.590
 these that I am collecting now are of a luois strokes color 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.270
 they are very good 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.220
 very tender and are also quite early compared to the others 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.950
 if the test the green beans 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.520
 then I will teach you 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.740
 how to cook, which is then practically cooked 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.550
 in a way or 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.070
 that way that allows them 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.390
 not to be 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.930
 their destructive integrity 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.870
 hey you goodness 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.010
 these are at 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.330
 green gnome beans 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.960
 beati instead are green beans of a different color are the classic green beans 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.250
 greens eats everything 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.280
 these too must be collected 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.650
 I don't say every day but almost why 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.290
 every time they make their home 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.420
 at the right time the green beans are ready for our table 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.290
 I have collected 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.320
 someone and then I'd go to the third furrow 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.150
 we also use 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.180
 almost to highlight 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.289
 1 turn of color 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.420
 this is a different yellowish but still very good green bean 

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:44.170
 all 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.120
 a particularity 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.490
 to avoid putting them on 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.300
 frogs as they say Polynesian 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.390
 of we cultivate 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.390
 variety 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.900
 save some time 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.220
 climb 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.110
 along the frogs indeed 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.300
 so keep picking these diapers and once I'm cooked I'll bring them 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.879
 at a point where 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.940
 I will tell you why these are kate bush tales 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:15.209
 I prepare the beans 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.260
 tender prestiter collected almost daily 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.079
 everyone knows that the green beans before being used 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.599
 bayonetta chi of the two ends 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.350
 e2 and this applies both to the green beans key for 15 years 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.799
 kettler then blue 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.949
 that both 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:38.830
 the yellow ones 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.039
 the blue ones 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:43.299
 they are generally without a file 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.159
 which is even a little unpleasant that one finds 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:52.379
 between one end encarta therefore they are certainly the very but very green beans 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.009
 more tender 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:55.729
 wikipedia came 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:57.809
 generally continuous 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.809
 in a way that I recommend to everyone 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:04.309
 my friends at home fashion 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.099
 steamed in-laws why 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.159
 because doing so 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.150
 we will get a product 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.529
 which is definitely a product that is priceless 

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.669
 mineral salts and other properties 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.609
 for nutritional purposes 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.779
 of prisco 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:26.999
 once steamed, then practically nothing else but one 

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:28.299
 grid 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.099
 buy 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.499
 i'm edamer 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:31.709
 where it will fly 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.219
 discovery 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:36.059
 the steam source 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:41.159
 salt upwards of fonzo lisi port that remain truly keep rod 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.099
 golden post nutritional properties 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.439
 at this point 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:47.139
 a little bit of oil 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:48.569
 in my opinion 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.039
 pinwheels 

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:54.370
 we also need to put a few leaves of parsley 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.239
 street art 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.560
 right in the home garden 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.979
 and this 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:02.509
 i am quite easy to cut 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:07.089
 now festive and jax as they say collected for a few days 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:10.269
 we take care that you put us anxious. 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.199
 as I am doing 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:17.090
 the beans the monster 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.400
 we always try to cook openings 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.220
 as on the other hand also the other vegetables we try to flavor with 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.400
 fresh parsley 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.490
 and in any case 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.779
 small piece dai 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:31.840
 the oil goes a bomb on us 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.809
 and the salt depending 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:38.509
 d how do you mean you can put me with cellulite because why for me the 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.509
 salt does nothing else that will cover 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.419
 elisa. 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.419
 of christ rome 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:48.419
 with these all because we meet again with the next one 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:49.699
 proposed by
