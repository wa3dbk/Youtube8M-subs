I've already got a knob that standing
proud<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.590> if<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:31.920> lift<00:00:32.099> up<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.309> straight<00:00:32.520> edge

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
proud and if I lift up the straight edge

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.310 
proud and if I lift up the straight edge
even<00:00:32.820> further<00:00:33.239> there's<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.840> stub<00:00:34.140> that's

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
even further there's a stub that's

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.110 
even further there's a stub that's
sitting<00:00:34.559> back<00:00:34.710> out<00:00:34.859> of<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> line<00:00:35.250> both<00:00:35.940> of

sitting back out of the line both of

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.219 
sitting back out of the line both of
those<00:00:36.239> are<00:00:36.390> going<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.570> cause<00:00:36.690> problems<00:00:36.899> when

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:37.229 
those are going to cause problems when

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:40.759 
those are going to cause problems when
the<00:00:37.319> new<00:00:37.440> plaster<00:00:37.800> board<00:00:37.979> linings<00:00:38.280> go<00:00:38.429> on<00:00:39.769> the

the new plaster board linings go on the

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:42.590 
the new plaster board linings go on the
first<00:00:40.979> job<00:00:41.249> I<00:00:41.370> want<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.579> look<00:00:41.760> at<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.089> nog<00:00:42.329> I

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
first job I want to look at is the nog I

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.180 
first job I want to look at is the nog I
want<00:00:42.929> to<00:00:42.989> make<00:00:43.109> that<00:00:43.229> flush<00:00:43.589> with<00:00:43.769> the<00:00:43.859> starter

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
want to make that flush with the starter

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.529 
want to make that flush with the starter
to<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.579> I'm<00:00:44.729> going<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.940> use<00:00:45.120> an<00:00:45.239> electric

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
to do that I'm going to use an electric

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.200 
to do that I'm going to use an electric
planer<00:00:46.159> before<00:00:47.159> going<00:00:47.309> any<00:00:47.460> further<00:00:47.579> though<00:00:48.030> I

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
planer before going any further though I

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.969 
planer before going any further though I
want<00:00:48.449> to<00:00:48.539> punch<00:00:48.690> these<00:00:48.929> nails<00:00:49.229> by<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.499> surface

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:49.979 
want to punch these nails by the surface

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:51.319 
want to punch these nails by the surface
of<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> timber<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.760> they<00:00:50.850> don't<00:00:50.999> damage<00:00:51.179> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
of the timber so they don't damage the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:00.049 
of the timber so they don't damage the
blade<00:00:57.799> when<00:00:58.799> using<00:00:59.129> an<00:00:59.219> electric<00:00:59.519> planer<00:00:59.789> it's

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
blade when using an electric planer it's

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.910 
blade when using an electric planer it's
easier<00:01:00.389> to<00:01:00.479> set<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> blade<00:01:00.959> nice<00:01:01.229> and<00:01:01.499> low<00:01:01.649> and

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
easier to set the blade nice and low and

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.529 
easier to set the blade nice and low and
make<00:01:02.159> two<00:01:02.370> or<00:01:02.459> three<00:01:02.489> passes<00:01:02.819> removing<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
make two or three passes removing a

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.329 
make two or three passes removing a
small<00:01:03.809> amount<00:01:03.959> of<00:01:04.080> material<00:01:04.229> every<00:01:04.739> time<00:01:04.949> that

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
small amount of material every time that

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.980 
small amount of material every time that
is<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.670> set<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.880> blade<00:01:06.060> very<00:01:06.330> deep<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.780> remove

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
is to set the blade very deep and remove

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.950 
is to set the blade very deep and remove
too<00:01:07.229> much<00:01:07.380> material<00:01:08.030> also<00:01:09.030> remember<00:01:09.840> your

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
too much material also remember your

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:24.330 
too much material also remember your

look at that perfect and that's going to

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.929 
look at that perfect and that's going to
show<00:01:27.080> up<00:01:27.110> in<00:01:27.320> my<00:01:27.439> final<00:01:27.860> result<00:01:28.130> now<00:01:28.729> I'm<00:01:28.820> going

show up in my final result now I'm going

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.140 
show up in my final result now I'm going
to<00:01:29.000> look<00:01:29.060> at<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.270> stud<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:31.670> face<00:01:31.850> of<00:01:32.060> this

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
to look at the stud the face of this

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.520 
to look at the stud the face of this
stud<00:01:32.390> was<00:01:32.540> sitting<00:01:32.780> back<00:01:32.900> from<00:01:33.140> the<00:01:33.229> rest<00:01:33.409> of

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
stud was sitting back from the rest of

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.840 
stud was sitting back from the rest of
them<00:01:33.680> so<00:01:33.890> when<00:01:34.040> I<00:01:34.070> put<00:01:34.250> my<00:01:34.280> plaster<00:01:34.670> board

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
them so when I put my plaster board

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.880 
them so when I put my plaster board
linings<00:01:35.150> on<00:01:35.299> that<00:01:35.479> was<00:01:35.659> going<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:35.930> show<00:01:36.080> up<00:01:36.140> one

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
linings on that was going to show up one

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.499 
linings on that was going to show up one
way<00:01:37.040> of<00:01:37.159> fixing<00:01:37.310> that<00:01:37.580> is<00:01:37.790> to<00:01:37.909> put<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.090> pecker<00:01:38.330> in

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
way of fixing that is to put a pecker in

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.020 
way of fixing that is to put a pecker in
place<00:01:38.689> here<00:01:42.310> here's<00:01:43.310> one<00:01:43.460> I've<00:01:43.549> already<00:01:43.700> cut

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
place here here's one I've already cut

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.249 
place here here's one I've already cut
I've<00:01:44.270> ripped<00:01:44.420> it<00:01:44.539> down<00:01:44.600> out<00:01:44.810> of<00:01:44.899> a<00:01:44.960> piece<00:01:45.140> of

I've ripped it down out of a piece of

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.690 
I've ripped it down out of a piece of
timber<00:01:45.470> to<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.740> same<00:01:45.950> thickness<00:01:46.430> that<00:01:46.580> the

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
timber to the same thickness that the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.010 
timber to the same thickness that the
stud<00:01:46.909> was<00:01:47.090> sitting<00:01:47.330> back<00:01:47.450> from<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.720> rest<00:01:47.899> of

them that's one way of doing it however
I'm<00:01:49.970> going<00:01:50.090> to<00:01:50.149> show<00:01:50.270> you<00:01:50.360> another<00:01:50.509> way<00:01:53.200> by

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
I'm going to show you another way by

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.990 
I'm going to show you another way by
using<00:01:54.440> a<00:01:54.680> wedge<00:01:54.890> in<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.159> circular<00:01:55.369> saw<00:01:55.700> I<00:01:55.729> can

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
using a wedge in a circular saw I can

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.790 
using a wedge in a circular saw I can
straighten<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.479> stud<00:01:56.750> I'll<00:01:57.110> put<00:01:57.530> a<00:01:57.560> cut

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
straighten the stud I'll put a cut
