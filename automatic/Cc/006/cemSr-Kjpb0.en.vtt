00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
center of the objective point will win a

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.200

round<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:13.619> their<00:01:13.830> team<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.640> seems<00:01:14.850> like<00:01:15.090> a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
round for their team so it seems like a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.570 
round for their team so it seems like a
lot<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.659> take<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:15.900> guys<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.920> actually

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
lot to take in guys but it's actually

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.640 
lot to take in guys but it's actually
not<00:01:17.880> I<00:01:18.119> think<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.720> game<00:01:18.900> mode<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.229> actually

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
not I think this game mode is actually

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.320 
not I think this game mode is actually
designed<00:01:20.070> for<00:01:20.310> quick<00:01:20.460> engagements<00:01:21.210> and
