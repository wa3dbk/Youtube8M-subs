00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
degrees we're gonna give them about ten

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.619

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
minutes in a deep fryer so let's see how

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.200 
minutes in a deep fryer so let's see how
it<00:00:39.809> goes<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.559> thing<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.890> know<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.969> I

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
it goes the thing to know is that I

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.209 
it goes the thing to know is that I
haven't<00:00:42.540> seasoned<00:00:43.140> these<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.649> outside<00:00:43.680> in

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
haven't seasoned these on the outside in

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.610 
haven't seasoned these on the outside in
any<00:00:44.340> way<00:00:44.610> as<00:00:45.539> far<00:00:45.780> as<00:00:45.870> I'm<00:00:45.989> concerned<00:00:46.379> when<00:00:46.559> you

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
any way as far as I'm concerned when you

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.979 
any way as far as I'm concerned when you
do<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.550> seasoning<00:00:48.000> comes<00:00:48.239> off<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.809> bird

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
do that the seasoning comes off the bird

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.840 
do that the seasoning comes off the bird
immediately<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:50.100> all<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.370> get<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.670> really

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
immediately and all you get is really

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.920 
immediately and all you get is really
well-seasoned<00:00:51.600> oil

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
well-seasoned oil

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.319 
well-seasoned oil
so<00:00:52.379> we've<00:00:53.039> let<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.399> air<00:00:53.610> dry<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
so we've let this air dry so that the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.060 
so we've let this air dry so that the
oil<00:00:54.510> won't<00:00:54.690> explode<00:00:55.170> when<00:00:55.469> we<00:00:55.620> put<00:00:55.800> them<00:00:55.920> in

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
oil won't explode when we put them in

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.189 
oil won't explode when we put them in
and<00:00:56.340> no<00:00:57.059> seasoning<00:00:57.539> other<00:00:57.690> than<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> brining

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
and no seasoning other than the brining

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:17.069 
and no seasoning other than the brining
no<00:00:58.590> breading<00:00:59.010> either<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.940> they<00:01:00.180> go

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:19.420 

so<00:01:18.079> my<00:01:18.259> little<00:01:18.469> timer<00:01:18.649> is<00:01:18.860> going<00:01:19.039> off<00:01:19.250> I'm

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
so my little timer is going off I'm

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.649 
so my little timer is going off I'm
going<00:01:19.579> to<00:01:19.640> take<00:01:19.820> these<00:01:20.000> out<00:01:20.210> and<00:01:20.240> let<00:01:20.539> them

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659
