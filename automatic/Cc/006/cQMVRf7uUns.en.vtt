00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 today saw us in the yard 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.930
 the car came from 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.330
 big porsche cayenne came out 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.519
 little premal little i 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.559
 I understand that in theory over curled into the subject in 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.900
 but I felt so sorry because he had 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.090
 apparently such serious complexes otherwise 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.650
 He would not buy such an expensive car and 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.990
 all and for show 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.420
 but the worst thing is that in essence 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.189
 man became a victim of a conspiracy 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.500
 car manufacturers 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.990
 because it is no secret to anyone that the current 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.660
 car by quality well for a long time 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.239
 can not go to any comparison with 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.730
 those same machines from so to speak 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.590
 of our recent past of the twentieth 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.010
 century but I certainly do not say that we all 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.440
 need to 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.050
 get over there old muscovites or 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.149
 there is a victory or some trophy 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.309
 German cars of the time of Hitler 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.890
 Germany, well, however, even cars and 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.780
 seventies and eighties with a point 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.930
 view quality and yes repair ability 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.120
 maintainability 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.390
 Well, they can be on the order of two orders of magnitude 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.870
 better than what it currently produces 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.970
 time 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.119
 to understand it is not by chance because well 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.060
 you know, year after year you have to go 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.950
 and well with the development of technology machines 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.689
 should get better and better and 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.430
 there they should be all from the time 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.710
 but everything is up to 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.200
 on the contrary yes we get some there 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.439
 conditionally useful climate control 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.070
 heated seats gain 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.140
 there what black power steering 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.530
 some so-called powerful suspension 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.869
 but if you take a closer look 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.299
 there for example front front rear 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.759
 began to be killed much faster but 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.970
 This is basically another side of the coin 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.430
 this is still possible to live but the problem 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.180
 that we are constantly being persuaded to 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.130
 that a car is not even a luxury 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.920
 not a vehicle but it is just 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.380
 status thing that must necessarily 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.920
 change every 35 years that is by and large 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.229
 account is something like a smartphone because 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.290
 Well, it is not convenient to walk with the old 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.270
 squeaker when 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.580
 that neighbor's last iphone 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.100
 generations here are about the same us 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.500
 trying to convince that car but itâ€™s so 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.850
 the thing is that after three years already came out 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.550
 new model and although in this 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.760
 modification and it was drawn there 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.280
 slightly there changed the apron apron and 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.320
 all guy are you driving a ford focus 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.810
 some kind of third and fourth 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.440
 generations you loshara and indeed you 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.150
 ride focus that's bad yes you waited 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.970
 wife take a loan some cool 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.790
 status thing 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.680
 ride a Mercedes, BMW and Redan on the 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.380
 who wants to drive a simple car 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.570
 economical yes he just loshara 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.030
 what is the real real smart kid 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.490
 remove any calf only if it is 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.320
 ride in a real cool car and 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.480
 notice it goes 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.690
 universally well particularly in Russia is 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.110
 reached such know dinner apotheosis 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.060
 when a man goes to Moscow with him 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.970
 some gorgeous car but 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.980
 lives in odnushke somewhere on the outskirts of the city 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.019
 and all because he needs to show off 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.870
 he wants to buy a car on credit 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.090
 pay for it almost handing over each 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.010
 blood day sperm and all in order to 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.980
 ride a status car which is all 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.799
 equal he will have to change in 3-5 years 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.390
 so stay alert and don't
