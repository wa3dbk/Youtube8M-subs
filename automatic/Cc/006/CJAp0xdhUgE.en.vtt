interesting ideas with the domani
concept<00:00:40.760> what<00:00:41.059> you've<00:00:41.180> got<00:00:41.360> is<00:00:41.660> a<00:00:41.870> front<00:00:42.230> fork

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
concept what you've got is a front fork

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.810 
concept what you've got is a front fork
which<00:00:42.680> is<00:00:42.830> this<00:00:43.010> designed<00:00:43.370> to<00:00:43.489> give<00:00:43.580> with<00:00:43.699> that

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
which is this designed to give with that

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.369 
which is this designed to give with that
kick<00:00:44.030> forward<00:00:44.330> and<00:00:44.570> then<00:00:44.720> the<00:00:44.989> dropout

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379

reversing<00:00:45.890> bag<00:00:46.100> that<00:00:46.340> it<00:00:46.460> offers<00:00:46.730> nice<00:00:47.120> a

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
reversing bag that it offers nice a

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.910 
reversing bag that it offers nice a
little<00:00:47.420> bit<00:00:47.510> of<00:00:47.600> spring<00:00:47.840> there<00:00:48.080> it's<00:00:48.440> very

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
little bit of spring there it's very

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.500 
little bit of spring there it's very
very<00:00:49.130> laterally<00:00:49.550> stiff<00:00:49.790> but<00:00:50.030> it<00:00:50.210> allows<00:00:50.480> a

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
very laterally stiff but it allows a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.180 
very laterally stiff but it allows a
little<00:00:50.780> bit<00:00:50.989> of<00:00:51.079> clutter<00:00:51.320> for<00:00:51.649> an<00:00:51.829> F<00:00:51.950> which

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
little bit of clutter for an F which

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.340 
little bit of clutter for an F which
just<00:00:52.460> cushions<00:00:53.059> you<00:00:53.149> over<00:00:53.480> hitting<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:54.110> edges

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
just cushions you over hitting the edges

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.440 
just cushions you over hitting the edges
of<00:00:54.590> those<00:00:54.739> sharp<00:00:54.950> cobble<00:00:55.250> surfaces<00:00:55.790> but<00:00:56.270> then

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
of those sharp cobble surfaces but then

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.280 
of those sharp cobble surfaces but then
when<00:00:56.540> you<00:00:56.600> get<00:00:56.719> to<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:56.899> back<00:00:57.050> is<00:00:57.200> where

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
when you get to the back is where

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.360 
when you get to the back is where
they're<00:00:57.440> really<00:00:57.680> interesting<00:00:58.100> so<00:00:58.219> that's

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
they're really interesting so that's

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.979 
they're really interesting so that's
happening<00:00:58.489> with<00:00:58.880> the<00:00:59.000> isospeed<00:00:59.480> decoupler

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
happening with the isospeed decoupler

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.290 
happening with the isospeed decoupler
now<00:01:00.380> effectively<00:01:00.800> it's<00:01:01.160> a<00:01:01.370> rotating<00:01:01.910> pivot

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
now effectively it's a rotating pivot

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.299 
now effectively it's a rotating pivot
that<00:01:02.690> hangs<00:01:03.110> off<00:01:03.320> lugs<00:01:03.590> which<00:01:03.860> attach<00:01:04.160> to<00:01:04.190> the

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
that hangs off lugs which attach to the

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.980 
that hangs off lugs which attach to the
C<00:01:04.550> tube<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:05.149> the<00:01:05.239> C<00:01:05.420> tube<00:01:05.600> is<00:01:05.720> actually

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
C tube so the C tube is actually

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.870 
C tube so the C tube is actually
independent<00:01:06.229> of<00:01:06.649> that<00:01:06.830> top<00:01:07.040> tube<00:01:07.250> it's<00:01:07.640> held

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
independent of that top tube it's held

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.969 
independent of that top tube it's held
together<00:01:07.970> by<00:01:08.229> essentially<00:01:09.229> a<00:01:09.350> pin<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:09.770> as<00:01:09.890> you

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
together by essentially a pin so as you

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.200 
together by essentially a pin so as you
ride<00:01:10.160> on<00:01:10.280> your<00:01:10.399> hip<00:01:10.580> pad<00:01:10.729> services<00:01:11.090> when

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
ride on your hip pad services when

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.520 
ride on your hip pad services when
you're<00:01:11.300> sitting<00:01:11.539> on<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.720> seat<00:01:11.930> it<00:01:12.140> allows

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
you're sitting on the seat it allows

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.160 
you're sitting on the seat it allows
this<00:01:12.830> C<00:01:13.039> tube<00:01:13.250> just<00:01:13.520> a<00:01:13.610> bow<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:14.240> flex<00:01:14.750> use<00:01:15.140> a

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
this C tube just a bow and flex use a

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.350 
this C tube just a bow and flex use a
kind<00:01:15.440> of<00:01:15.530> or<00:01:15.770> suspension<00:01:16.280> like<00:01:16.580> comfort

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
kind of or suspension like comfort

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.700 
kind of or suspension like comfort
that's<00:01:17.539> inherent<00:01:17.960> within<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.289> way<00:01:18.410> that<00:01:18.590> they

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
that's inherent within the way that they

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.350 
that's inherent within the way that they
design<00:01:19.009> the<00:01:19.160> carbon<00:01:19.460> fiber<00:01:19.670> so<00:01:20.180> of<00:01:20.240> course

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
design the carbon fiber so of course

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.029 
design the carbon fiber so of course
when<00:01:20.570> you<00:01:20.660> get<00:01:20.780> on<00:01:20.930> board<00:01:21.200> of<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.500> morning<00:01:21.860> and

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
when you get on board of the morning and

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.070 
when you get on board of the morning and
start<00:01:22.310> riding<00:01:22.580> it<00:01:22.850> you<00:01:23.030> spend<00:01:23.539> the<00:01:23.690> first<00:01:23.720> few

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
start riding it you spend the first few

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.080 
start riding it you spend the first few

you know feel what it's doing so on

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.050 
you know feel what it's doing so on
normal<00:01:28.069> roads<00:01:28.220> you<00:01:28.490> probably<00:01:28.759> won't<00:01:28.910> notice

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
normal roads you probably won't notice

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.029 
normal roads you probably won't notice
the<00:01:29.270> most<00:01:29.450> different<00:01:29.899> but<00:01:30.440> as<00:01:30.619> soon<00:01:30.830> as<00:01:30.950> you

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
the most different but as soon as you

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:32.469 
the most different but as soon as you
hit<00:01:31.160> something<00:01:31.399> core<00:01:31.729> so<00:01:31.940> you<00:01:32.000> get<00:01:32.209> something

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479
