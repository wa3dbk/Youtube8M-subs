to find the move that black played and

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.290 
to find the move that black played and
this<00:03:57.800> is<00:03:58.100> the<00:03:58.550> move<00:03:58.990> for<00:03:59.990> global<00:04:00.380> captured

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
this is the move for global captured

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.800 
this is the move for global captured
with<00:04:02.300> rook<00:04:02.540> on<00:04:02.810> f2<00:04:03.020> if<00:04:03.920> now<00:04:04.430> Queen<00:04:05.239> takes<00:04:05.480> Queen

with rook on f2 if now Queen takes Queen

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.350 
with rook on f2 if now Queen takes Queen
then<00:04:06.380> that<00:04:06.620> is<00:04:06.739> checkmate<00:04:07.250> on<00:04:07.700> g2<00:04:08.980> if<00:04:10.360> rook

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
then that is checkmate on g2 if rook

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.010 
then that is checkmate on g2 if rook
takes<00:04:11.600> rook<00:04:11.950> then<00:04:12.950> look<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.550> even<00:04:13.880> check<00:04:14.239> rook

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
because in some variations there is a

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.360
