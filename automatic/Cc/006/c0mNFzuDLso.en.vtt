00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
the stick but the cushion is a very good

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.350 
the stick but the cushion is a very good
thing

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
thing

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.970 
thing
remind<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.810> where<00:02:52.050> to<00:02:52.170> put<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.410> finger<00:02:52.770> and

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
remind you where to put the finger and

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.580 
remind you where to put the finger and
also<00:02:53.130> perhaps<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.850> keep<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.210> arched<00:02:54.540> that's<00:02:55.410> an

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
also perhaps to keep it arched that's an

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
also perhaps to keep it arched that's an
excellent<00:02:55.920> idea

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
excellent idea

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.949 
excellent idea
so<00:02:57.180> let's<00:02:57.630> do<00:02:57.870> open<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.590> string<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.750> what<00:03:03.930> I

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
so let's do open a string and what I

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.320 
so let's do open a string and what I
want<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.380> notice<00:03:04.770> is<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.459> fluidity<00:03:05.910> in

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
want you to notice is the fluidity in

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.330 
want you to notice is the fluidity in
the<00:03:06.360> fingers<00:03:06.870> as<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.170> change<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.890> bow

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
the fingers as I change the bow

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.340 
the fingers as I change the bow
direction

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.270 

you

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.510 

I<00:03:18.480> call<00:03:19.480> this<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.750> tilt<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.950> roll<00:03:21.190> and

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
I call this the tilt and the roll and

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.330 
I call this the tilt and the roll and
the<00:03:21.970> tilt<00:03:22.240> part<00:03:22.690> is<00:03:22.900> executed<00:03:23.709> you're

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
the tilt part is executed you're

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.250 
the tilt part is executed you're
approaching<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.090> Frog<00:03:25.390> you'll<00:03:25.720> notice<00:03:26.080> a

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
approaching the Frog you'll notice a

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.910 
approaching the Frog you'll notice a
slight<00:03:26.860> elevation<00:03:27.130> of<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.790> wrist<00:03:28.740> and<00:03:29.740> it

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
slight elevation of the wrist and it

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.740 
slight elevation of the wrist and it
does<00:03:30.130> depend<00:03:30.490> on<00:03:30.580> how<00:03:30.790> loud<00:03:31.060> or<00:03:31.120> soft<00:03:31.480> you're

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
does depend on how loud or soft you're

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.330 
does depend on how loud or soft you're
trying<00:03:31.990> to<00:03:32.080> play<00:03:32.290> but<00:03:32.590> in<00:03:32.680> this<00:03:32.770> instance<00:03:33.010> I'll

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
trying to play but in this instance I'll

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.050 
trying to play but in this instance I'll
exaggerate<00:03:33.700> slightly<00:03:35.280> now<00:03:36.280> what<00:03:36.550> that<00:03:36.760> does

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
exaggerate slightly now what that does

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.770 
exaggerate slightly now what that does
is<00:03:37.450> it<00:03:37.660> releases<00:03:38.020> the<00:03:39.010> weight<00:03:39.280> of<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:40.420> bow<00:03:40.569> and

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
is it releases the weight of the bow and

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.540 
is it releases the weight of the bow and
the<00:03:40.870> arm<00:03:41.080> from<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.770> string<00:03:42.040> because<00:03:42.310> we're<00:03:42.459> in

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
the arm from the string because we're in

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.080 
the arm from the string because we're in
very<00:03:42.850> close<00:03:43.980> quarters<00:03:44.980> here<00:03:45.340> with<00:03:45.580> atop<00:03:45.880> the

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
very close quarters here with atop the

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.809 
very close quarters here with atop the
string<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:47.500> we<00:03:47.530> need<00:03:47.770> to<00:03:47.830> believe<00:03:48.160> that<00:03:48.430> wait<00:03:48.790> a

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
string so we need to believe that wait a

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.890 
string so we need to believe that wait a
little<00:03:49.090> bit<00:03:49.330> and<00:03:50.130> also<00:03:51.130> it<00:03:51.489> allows<00:03:51.820> you<00:03:52.180> to

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
little bit and also it allows you to

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.710 
little bit and also it allows you to
turn<00:03:53.260> so<00:03:53.950> you<00:03:54.519> think<00:03:54.760> of<00:03:54.880> this<00:03:55.000> almost<00:03:55.300> like

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
turn so you think of this almost like

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.199 
turn so you think of this almost like
turning<00:03:55.959> a<00:03:56.200> steering<00:03:56.560> wheel<00:03:56.940> something<00:03:57.940> there

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
turning a steering wheel something there

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.970 
turning a steering wheel something there
has<00:03:58.360> to<00:03:58.390> be<00:03:58.630> a<00:03:58.720> range<00:03:59.080> of<00:03:59.230> motion<00:03:59.590> there<00:03:59.769> has<00:03:59.950> to

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
has to be a range of motion there has to

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.100 
has to be a range of motion there has to
be<00:04:00.190> flexibility<00:04:00.970> you<00:04:01.330> can't<00:04:01.630> just<00:04:01.930> be

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
be flexibility you can't just be

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.040 
be flexibility you can't just be
Stockstill<00:04:02.890> or<00:04:03.100> as<00:04:03.370> I<00:04:03.550> call<00:04:03.580> with<00:04:04.510> my<00:04:04.630> students

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
Stockstill or as I call with my students

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.830 
Stockstill or as I call with my students
that<00:04:05.170> claw<00:04:05.500> like<00:04:05.860> bow<00:04:06.580> grip<00:04:06.910> we<00:04:07.120> want<00:04:07.450> to<00:04:07.660> have

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
that claw like bow grip we want to have

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.840 
that claw like bow grip we want to have
some<00:04:08.140> fluidity<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:10.350> range<00:04:11.350> of<00:04:11.620> motion<00:04:11.700> so<00:04:12.700> if

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
some fluidity and range of motion so if

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.440 
some fluidity and range of motion so if
you<00:04:12.970> can<00:04:13.120> look<00:04:13.300> carefully<00:04:14.850> this<00:04:15.850> part<00:04:16.209> as<00:04:16.329> I

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
you can look carefully this part as I

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.020 
you can look carefully this part as I
mentioned<00:04:16.840> is<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:16.959> tilt<00:04:17.350> and<00:04:17.979> as<00:04:18.370> we<00:04:19.000> change

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
mentioned is the tilt and as we change

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.840 
mentioned is the tilt and as we change
direction<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:20.079> wrist<00:04:20.410> falls<00:04:20.829> slightly<00:04:21.370> and

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
direction the wrist falls slightly and

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.070 
direction the wrist falls slightly and
the<00:04:22.810> fingers<00:04:23.320> contract<00:04:24.220> slightly<00:04:25.080> it's

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
the fingers contract slightly it's

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.400 
the fingers contract slightly it's
almost<00:04:26.350> it's<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.740> motion<00:04:27.160> kind<00:04:27.430> of<00:04:27.610> like<00:04:28.410> this

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
almost it's a motion kind of like this

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.240 
almost it's a motion kind of like this
kind<00:04:29.680> of<00:04:29.830> thing<00:04:30.070> and<00:04:31.350> oftentimes<00:04:32.350> it's<00:04:32.919> really

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
kind of thing and oftentimes it's really

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.029 
kind of thing and oftentimes it's really
easy<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:33.610> get<00:04:33.880> these<00:04:34.810> things<00:04:35.110> backwards<00:04:35.680> so<00:04:35.890> it

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
easy to get these things backwards so it

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:41.909 
easy to get these things backwards so it
does<00:04:36.220> require<00:04:36.370> some<00:04:36.970> repetition<00:04:40.650> you<00:04:41.650> can<00:04:41.800> do

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
does require some repetition you can do

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.800 
does require some repetition you can do
more<00:04:42.130> or<00:04:42.310> less<00:04:42.490> of<00:04:42.700> this<00:04:42.850> as<00:04:43.030> you<00:04:43.300> get<00:04:43.450> more

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
more or less of this as you get more

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.879 
more or less of this as you get more
accustomed<00:04:44.410> to<00:04:44.740> it

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.799 

you<00:04:48.889> tend<00:04:49.550> to<00:04:49.669> do<00:04:49.789> a<00:04:49.819> little<00:04:50.029> bit<00:04:50.300> less<00:04:50.539> that's

00:04:50.799 --> 00:04:50.809 
you tend to do a little bit less that's

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:53.200 
you tend to do a little bit less that's
one<00:04:50.990> reason<00:04:51.169> it's<00:04:51.409> very<00:04:51.469> difficult<00:04:52.069> you<00:04:52.309> go<00:04:53.150> to

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
one reason it's very difficult you go to

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.689 
one reason it's very difficult you go to
see<00:04:53.449> a<00:04:53.479> professional<00:04:54.080> play<00:04:54.349> they<00:04:54.919> do<00:04:54.979> this<00:04:55.400> to

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
see a professional play they do this to

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.459 
see a professional play they do this to
a<00:04:55.729> very<00:04:56.120> minimum<00:04:56.689> especially<00:04:57.259> if<00:04:57.319> they're

00:04:57.459 --> 00:04:57.469 
a very minimum especially if they're

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:59.980 
a very minimum especially if they're
trying<00:04:57.680> to<00:04:57.770> project<00:04:58.309> a<00:04:58.460> lot<00:04:58.639> and<00:04:59.569> it's<00:04:59.779> really

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
trying to project a lot and it's really

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.360 
trying to project a lot and it's really
hard<00:05:00.229> to<00:05:00.319> discern<00:05:00.620> what<00:05:00.919> it<00:05:01.039> is<00:05:01.189> exactly

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
hard to discern what it is exactly

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.010 
hard to discern what it is exactly
they're<00:05:01.849> doing<00:05:02.180> so<00:05:02.300> I'm<00:05:02.389> trying<00:05:02.629> to<00:05:02.659> break<00:05:02.870> it

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
they're doing so I'm trying to break it

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.799 
they're doing so I'm trying to break it
down<00:05:03.050> a<00:05:03.199> little<00:05:03.319> bit<00:05:03.529> for<00:05:03.830> you<00:05:04.009> and<00:05:04.809> exaggerate

00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:05.809 
down a little bit for you and exaggerate

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:09.570 
down a little bit for you and exaggerate
slightly<00:05:08.020> tilt

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:11.659 
notice how the stick goes in this

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:15.600 
notice how the stick goes in this

and<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:19.680> point<00:05:20.160> at<00:05:20.430> which<00:05:20.639> you<00:05:20.880> roll<00:05:21.210> and<00:05:21.539> it

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
and the point at which you roll and it

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:25.129 
and the point at which you roll and it
can<00:05:21.720> be<00:05:21.840> at<00:05:21.930> any<00:05:22.199> part<00:05:22.560> of<00:05:22.620> the<00:05:22.710> bow<00:05:24.050> it's<00:05:25.050> a

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
can be at any part of the bow it's a

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.760 
can be at any part of the bow it's a
little<00:05:25.380> more<00:05:25.530> subtle<00:05:25.949> here<00:05:26.630> is<00:05:27.630> part<00:05:28.169> of<00:05:28.319> the

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
little more subtle here is part of the

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.309 
little more subtle here is part of the
bow<00:05:28.919> change<00:05:29.280> it<00:05:29.460> doesn't<00:05:29.639> do<00:05:29.910> you<00:05:30.030> much<00:05:30.060> good

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319 
bow change it doesn't do you much good

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:33.980 
bow change it doesn't do you much good
to<00:05:31.319> anticipate<00:05:31.680> the<00:05:32.130> role<00:05:32.569> before<00:05:33.569> you're

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
to anticipate the role before you're

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.749 
to anticipate the role before you're
actually<00:05:34.349> going<00:05:34.500> to<00:05:34.590> execute<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:35.220> change<00:05:35.250> of

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 
actually going to execute the change of

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.730 
actually going to execute the change of
direction<00:05:36.000> so<00:05:36.840> this<00:05:37.110> really<00:05:37.410> should<00:05:37.710> be

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
direction so this really should be

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.730 
direction so this really should be
thought<00:05:38.069> of<00:05:38.099> as<00:05:38.460> a<00:05:38.520> kind<00:05:38.849> of<00:05:39.000> a<00:05:39.120> steering

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
thought of as a kind of a steering

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.960 
thought of as a kind of a steering
technique

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.119 

in<00:05:45.970> any<00:05:46.330> part<00:05:46.630> of<00:05:46.690> the<00:05:46.780> bow

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:48.129 
in any part of the bow

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:50.639 
in any part of the bow
you'll<00:05:48.759> notice<00:05:48.999> here<00:05:49.569> the<00:05:49.719> tilt<00:05:49.989> is<00:05:50.139> a<00:05:50.319> little

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:50.649 
you'll notice here the tilt is a little

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:54.449 
you'll notice here the tilt is a little
more<00:05:50.830> obvious<00:05:51.119> as<00:05:52.119> we<00:05:52.360> get<00:05:52.539> to<00:05:52.719> the<00:05:52.839> tip<00:05:53.459> the

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:54.459 
more obvious as we get to the tip the

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:56.729 
more obvious as we get to the tip the
tilt<00:05:54.819> it<00:05:55.029> looks<00:05:55.300> like<00:05:55.509> this<00:05:55.749> now<00:05:56.229> one<00:05:56.499> thing

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:56.739 
tilt it looks like this now one thing

00:05:56.739 --> 00:05:59.369 
tilt it looks like this now one thing
I'll<00:05:57.009> mention<00:05:57.249> here<00:05:57.699> is<00:05:57.819> it<00:05:58.360> as<00:05:58.509> a<00:05:58.569> general

00:05:59.369 --> 00:05:59.379 
I'll mention here is it as a general

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:01.979 
I'll mention here is it as a general
rule<00:05:59.409> the<00:06:00.279> stick<00:06:00.610> never<00:06:01.029> comes<00:06:01.389> toward<00:06:01.809> you

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:01.989 
rule the stick never comes toward you

00:06:01.989 --> 00:06:04.079 
rule the stick never comes toward you
like<00:06:02.199> this<00:06:02.499> that<00:06:02.949> pushes<00:06:03.489> the<00:06:03.580> bow<00:06:03.759> in<00:06:03.939> this

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:04.089 
like this that pushes the bow in this

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:06.029 
like this that pushes the bow in this
direction<00:06:04.269> and<00:06:04.719> just<00:06:04.899> as<00:06:05.080> an<00:06:05.199> advantageous<00:06:05.709> to

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
direction and just as an advantageous to

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:09.269 
direction and just as an advantageous to
a<00:06:06.069> good<00:06:06.309> tone<00:06:06.519> quality<00:06:06.819> so<00:06:07.509> that's<00:06:07.719> one<00:06:08.279> basic

00:06:09.269 --> 00:06:09.279 
a good tone quality so that's one basic

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:11.850 
a good tone quality so that's one basic
anchor<00:06:09.909> you<00:06:10.059> can<00:06:10.179> kind<00:06:10.389> of<00:06:10.449> hang<00:06:10.719> on<00:06:10.899> to<00:06:11.169> so<00:06:11.649> we

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
anchor you can kind of hang on to so we

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:17.650 
anchor you can kind of hang on to so we
either<00:06:12.099> address<00:06:12.699> the<00:06:13.089> the<00:06:13.269> bow<00:06:13.479> this<00:06:13.959> way

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.660 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.630 

more<00:06:17.780> or<00:06:17.930> less<00:06:18.140> have<00:06:18.470> the<00:06:18.620> stick<00:06:18.950> directly

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640 
more or less have the stick directly

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.939 
more or less have the stick directly
above<00:06:19.970> the<00:06:20.090> hair

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:22.949 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.480 

again<00:06:23.699> to<00:06:24.389> the<00:06:24.509> tilt<00:06:24.810> and<00:06:25.139> as<00:06:25.830> you<00:06:26.159> do<00:06:26.340> that

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
again to the tilt and as you do that

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.249 
again to the tilt and as you do that
tilt<00:06:26.849> at<00:06:27.090> the<00:06:27.210> tip<00:06:27.479> it<00:06:27.689> will<00:06:27.870> be<00:06:28.020> a<00:06:28.050> more

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:28.259 
tilt at the tip it will be a more

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:31.189 
tilt at the tip it will be a more
exaggerated<00:06:29.300> motion<00:06:30.300> especially<00:06:30.629> in<00:06:31.080> your

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:31.199 
exaggerated motion especially in your

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:34.730 
exaggerated motion especially in your
little<00:06:31.379> finger<00:06:31.620> and<00:06:31.909> therein<00:06:32.909> lies<00:06:33.150> the<00:06:33.740> the

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
little finger and therein lies the the

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.309 
little finger and therein lies the the
reasoning<00:06:35.400> behind<00:06:35.969> having<00:06:36.509> an<00:06:36.719> arch<00:06:36.960> in<00:06:37.199> your

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 
reasoning behind having an arch in your

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:39.110 
reasoning behind having an arch in your
little<00:06:37.469> finger<00:06:37.680> if<00:06:37.949> you<00:06:38.279> constantly<00:06:38.759> play

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
little finger if you constantly play

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.510 
little finger if you constantly play
like<00:06:39.360> this<00:06:39.599> you<00:06:40.169> have<00:06:40.379> no<00:06:40.620> range<00:06:40.889> of<00:06:41.069> motion

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 
like this you have no range of motion

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.429 
like this you have no range of motion
and<00:06:41.669> I<00:06:42.210> see<00:06:42.479> that<00:06:42.689> quite<00:06:42.900> a<00:06:42.960> bit<00:06:43.169> I'll<00:06:43.289> see

00:06:43.429 --> 00:06:43.439 
and I see that quite a bit I'll see

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:45.350 
and I see that quite a bit I'll see
people<00:06:43.770> holding<00:06:43.889> their<00:06:44.219> bows<00:06:44.370> way<00:06:44.729> down<00:06:44.999> here

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
people holding their bows way down here

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.439 
people holding their bows way down here
with<00:06:45.840> a<00:06:45.870> stock<00:06:46.409> straight<00:06:47.129> little<00:06:47.550> finger<00:06:48.029> this

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:48.449 
with a stock straight little finger this

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.869 
with a stock straight little finger this
is<00:06:48.659> not<00:06:48.900> encourage<00:06:49.680> fluidity<00:06:50.189> in<00:06:50.490> the<00:06:50.610> hand

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:50.879 
is not encourage fluidity in the hand

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:52.879 
is not encourage fluidity in the hand
I'd<00:06:51.120> really<00:06:51.449> highly<00:06:51.749> recommend<00:06:52.199> you<00:06:52.680> hold

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 
your bow a little bit higher a lot of
