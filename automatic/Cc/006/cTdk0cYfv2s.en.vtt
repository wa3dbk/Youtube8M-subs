Matt will use cooking spray as a mold
release<00:00:29.860> this<00:00:30.610> will<00:00:30.880> prevent<00:00:31.180> the<00:00:31.270> resin<00:00:31.630> from

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:49.060 

now<00:00:46.789> we<00:00:46.850> can<00:00:47.180> pour<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.510> resin<00:00:47.690> at<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.440> M<00:00:48.559> ekp

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
now we can pour the resin at the M ekp

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.869 
now we can pour the resin at the M ekp
and<00:00:49.280> mix<00:00:49.579> it<00:00:49.730> thoroughly<00:00:51.519> we'll<00:00:52.519> apply<00:00:52.760> the

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
the panel is completely visible now we

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.859 
the panel is completely visible now we
can<00:01:01.790> begin<00:01:02.059> applying<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.629> fiberglass<00:01:02.930> mat

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
can begin applying the fiberglass mat

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.359 
can begin applying the fiberglass mat
we'll<00:01:05.869> be<00:01:05.990> dabbing<00:01:06.200> the<00:01:06.440> resin<00:01:06.770> onto<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.159> mat

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
we'll be dabbing the resin onto the mat

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.730 
we'll be dabbing the resin onto the mat
instead<00:01:07.790> of<00:01:07.940> brushing<00:01:08.259> keep<00:01:09.259> in<00:01:09.409> mind<00:01:09.619> that

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
instead of brushing keep in mind that

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.230 
instead of brushing keep in mind that
brushing<00:01:10.159> can<00:01:10.310> move<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.580> mat<00:01:10.729> at<00:01:10.909> our<00:01:11.030> place

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
brushing can move the mat at our place

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.750 
brushing can move the mat at our place
and<00:01:11.450> cause<00:01:11.600> a<00:01:11.630> mess

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.760 

to<00:01:16.760> properly<00:01:17.000> mold<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.570> curved<00:01:17.810> areas<00:01:18.230> will

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
to properly mold the curved areas will

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.560 
to properly mold the curved areas will
be<00:01:18.890> using<00:01:19.190> aluminum<00:01:19.640> foil<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:20.090> hold<00:01:20.300> the<00:01:20.390> mat

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
be using aluminum foil to hold the mat

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.040 
be using aluminum foil to hold the mat
in<00:01:20.600> place

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.600 

before<00:01:27.050> we<00:01:27.170> move<00:01:27.350> on<00:01:27.500> we'll<00:01:28.130> inspect<00:01:28.490> the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
before we move on we'll inspect the

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.580 
before we move on we'll inspect the
panel<00:01:28.940> and<00:01:29.090> patch<00:01:29.390> any<00:01:29.720> areas<00:01:30.230> that<00:01:30.410> were<00:01:30.560> not

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
panel and patch any areas that were not

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.340 
panel and patch any areas that were not
covered<00:01:31.100> by<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.280> mat<00:01:32.050> once<00:01:33.050> we<00:01:33.200> are<00:01:33.230> finished

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
covered by the mat once we are finished

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.260 
covered by the mat once we are finished
we<00:01:33.860> can<00:01:34.010> set<00:01:34.160> the<00:01:34.280> panel<00:01:34.610> in<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.790> Sun<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:35.120> dry

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
we can set the panel in the Sun to dry

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.360 
we can set the panel in the Sun to dry
in<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:36.020> meantime<00:01:36.260> we'll<00:01:36.800> be<00:01:36.920> creating<00:01:37.280> the

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
in the meantime we'll be creating the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.720 
in the meantime we'll be creating the
mounting<00:01:37.730> rings<00:01:39.040> using<00:01:40.040> a<00:01:40.130> router<00:01:40.340> in<00:01:40.640> a

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
mounting rings using a router in a

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.340 
mounting rings using a router in a
circle<00:01:41.060> jig<00:01:41.270> we'll<00:01:41.570> cut<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:41.900> outer<00:01:42.050> diameter

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
circle jig we'll cut the outer diameter

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.600 
circle jig we'll cut the outer diameter
first

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.800 

next<00:01:47.610> we'll<00:01:47.790> break<00:01:48.030> out<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.300> mounting<00:01:48.630> hole

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
next we'll break out the mounting hole

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.990 
next we'll break out the mounting hole
this<00:01:49.740> will<00:01:49.950> make<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.250> easier<00:01:50.550> to<00:01:50.730> clear<00:01:50.910> out

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
this will make it easier to clear out

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.969 
this will make it easier to clear out
later

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.399 

now<00:01:54.909> we'll<00:01:55.149> cut<00:01:55.329> a<00:01:55.360> ring<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.869> Reese's<00:01:56.200> manner

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
now we'll cut a ring to Reese's manner

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.240 
now we'll cut a ring to Reese's manner
speaker<00:01:56.920> this<00:01:57.729> step<00:01:57.939> is<00:01:58.090> optional

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.520 

we'll<00:02:02.240> be<00:02:02.360> using<00:02:02.480> wood<00:02:02.840> glue<00:02:02.870> to<00:02:03.170> bond<00:02:03.410> the

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
we'll be using wood glue to bond the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.109 
we'll be using wood glue to bond the
ring<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.040> mounting<00:02:04.370> disk

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.850 

now<00:02:09.119> we<00:02:09.179> can<00:02:09.479> round<00:02:09.689> the<00:02:09.869> edges<00:02:10.049> using<00:02:10.439> a<00:02:10.649> round

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
now we can round the edges using a round

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.039 
now we can round the edges using a round
over<00:02:11.039> bit<00:02:11.189> this<00:02:12.000> will<00:02:12.269> complete<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.719> mounting

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
over bit this will complete the mounting

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.800 
over bit this will complete the mounting
disk

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.420 

once<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.960> panel<00:02:18.140> has<00:02:18.350> dried<00:02:18.680> we<00:02:18.890> can<00:02:19.040> remove

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
once the panel has dried we can remove

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:31.809 
once the panel has dried we can remove
the<00:02:19.610> original<00:02:19.700> cake<00:02:20.240> panel<00:02:20.540> from<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.780> mold

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.789 

we<00:02:32.450> will<00:02:32.599> trace<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.840> kick<00:02:33.110> panel<00:02:33.439> using<00:02:33.739> a

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
we will trace a kick panel using a

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.429 
we will trace a kick panel using a
marker<00:02:34.269> with<00:02:35.269> an<00:02:35.420> aerosol<00:02:35.780> we<00:02:35.989> will<00:02:36.140> cut<00:02:36.319> away

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 
marker with an aerosol we will cut away

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:41.330 
marker with an aerosol we will cut away
the<00:02:36.680> excess<00:02:36.950> fiberglass

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.950 

now<00:02:42.340> we<00:02:42.400> need<00:02:42.700> to<00:02:42.850> decide<00:02:43.030> where<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.510> mount<00:02:43.750> the
