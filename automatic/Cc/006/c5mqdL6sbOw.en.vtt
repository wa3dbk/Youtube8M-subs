application<00:03:39.910> of<00:03:39.970> superglue<00:03:41.940> wipe<00:03:42.940> that<00:03:43.150> right

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
application of superglue wipe that right

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.310 
application of superglue wipe that right
off<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:44.340> make<00:03:45.340> absolutely<00:03:45.579> sure<00:03:46.239> that<00:03:46.540> the

off and make absolutely sure that the
eye<00:03:47.350> of<00:03:47.560> this<00:03:47.890> hook<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:49.750> clear<00:03:50.230> it<00:03:50.950> is

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
eye of this hook is clear it is

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.950 
eye of this hook is clear it is
so<00:03:53.520> I<00:03:53.550> could<00:03:53.790> spend<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.090> little<00:03:54.240> I<00:03:54.570> can<00:03:54.720> spend<00:03:54.900> a

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
so I could spend a little I can spend a

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.610 
so I could spend a little I can spend a
little<00:03:55.080> bit<00:03:55.290> more<00:03:55.440> time<00:03:55.650> I<00:03:55.800> can<00:03:56.010> hold<00:03:56.250> this<00:03:57.620> but

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
little bit more time I can hold this but

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.530 
little bit more time I can hold this but
that's<00:03:58.830> how<00:03:59.070> you<00:03:59.100> do<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.460> that's<00:04:00.000> how<00:04:00.180> you<00:04:00.270> glue

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
that's how you do it that's how you glue

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.750 
that's how you do it that's how you glue
these<00:04:00.690> in<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:01.170> works<00:04:01.350> very<00:04:01.530> nicely<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:02.640> other

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
these in it works very nicely the other

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.240 
these in it works very nicely the other
thing<00:04:02.970> you<00:04:03.060> might<00:04:03.180> do<00:04:03.420> is<00:04:04.380> take<00:04:04.740> that<00:04:04.770> little

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
thing you might do is take that little

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.120 
thing you might do is take that little
dab<00:04:05.670> of<00:04:05.880> superglue<00:04:06.180> off<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:07.680> back<00:04:07.890> of<00:04:07.920> the

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
dab of superglue off the back of the

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.380 
dab of superglue off the back of the
popper<00:04:08.930> so<00:04:09.930> there<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:10.410> have<00:04:10.440> your<00:04:11.390> popper

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
popper so there you have your popper

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.280 
popper so there you have your popper
head<00:04:12.630> glued<00:04:13.320> onto<00:04:13.590> your<00:04:14.010> hook
