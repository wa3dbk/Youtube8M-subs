at the end of the tunnel come out on the

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.170 
at the end of the tunnel come out on the
homestretch<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.600> got<00:00:25.530> the<00:00:25.770> this<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.790> half<00:00:26.970> my

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
homestretch I got the this is half my

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.850 
homestretch I got the this is half my
chip<00:00:27.420> rails<00:00:27.690> here<00:00:27.960> I'm<00:00:28.080> kind<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.470> doing<00:00:28.590> some

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
chip rails here I'm kind of doing some

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.060 
chip rails here I'm kind of doing some
test<00:00:29.100> fitting<00:00:29.460> for<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:30.380> piece<00:00:31.380> up<00:00:31.590> top<00:00:31.830> here

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
test fitting for the piece up top here

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.829 
test fitting for the piece up top here
that<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.279> need<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.730> do<00:00:33.120> that's<00:00:33.300> one<00:00:33.539> of<00:00:33.629> the<00:00:33.690> next

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:33.839 
that I need to do that's one of the next

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:39.049 
that I need to do that's one of the next
steps<00:00:36.469> so<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.739> last<00:00:37.920> one<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.309> didn't<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
steps so the last one I didn't have the

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.599 
steps so the last one I didn't have the
middle<00:00:39.660> parts<00:00:40.019> here<00:00:40.199> kind<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.530> boxed<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.039> so<00:00:41.070> I

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:41.609 
middle parts here kind of boxed in so I

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:44.060 
middle parts here kind of boxed in so I
kind<00:00:42.089> of<00:00:42.149> measured<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.719> cut<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.800> know<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
kind of measured and cut you know the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.139 
kind of measured and cut you know the
twelve<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.429> a<00:00:44.460> quarter<00:00:44.550> for<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> outside

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
twelve and a quarter for the outside

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.840 
twelve and a quarter for the outside
eleven<00:00:45.510> inch<00:00:45.659> for<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.929> inside<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:47.670> just

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
eleven inch for the inside and it's just

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.489 
eleven inch for the inside and it's just
kind<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.089> custom<00:00:48.539> fitted<00:00:48.839> in<00:00:48.960> there<00:00:49.109> I<00:00:49.140> didn't

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:49.499 
kind of custom fitted in there I didn't

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:52.130 
kind of custom fitted in there I didn't
really<00:00:49.769> get<00:00:49.999> when<00:00:50.999> I<00:00:51.030> did<00:00:51.329> these<00:00:51.539> side<00:00:51.809> pieces

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
really get when I did these side pieces

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.599 
really get when I did these side pieces
as<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.829> see<00:00:52.980> there's<00:00:53.190> not<00:00:53.460> exactly

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:53.609 
as you can see there's not exactly

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:56.959 
as you can see there's not exactly
straight<00:00:54.179> up<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.510> down<00:00:55.489> one<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.579> these<00:00:56.670> sides

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
straight up and down one of these sides

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.130 
straight up and down one of these sides
is<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> little<00:00:57.510> better<00:00:57.629> than<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> other

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
is a little better than the other

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.899 
is a little better than the other
because<00:00:58.469> one<00:00:58.649> side<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.949> put<00:00:59.159> on<00:00:59.280> by<00:00:59.399> myself<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
because one side I put on by myself the

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.809 
because one side I put on by myself the
other<00:00:59.969> side<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.239> had<00:01:00.390> helped<00:01:00.979> so<00:01:01.979> I<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.579> kind

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:02.819 
other side I had helped so I just kind

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:04.760 
other side I had helped so I just kind
of<00:01:02.879> measured<00:01:03.269> and<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.629> could<00:01:03.809> tell<00:01:04.019> by<00:01:04.200> with

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770 
of measured and you could tell by with

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.750 
of measured and you could tell by with
measuring<00:01:05.160> tape<00:01:05.370> that<00:01:05.520> it<00:01:05.610> was<00:01:05.730> gonna<00:01:05.850> be

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
measuring tape that it was gonna be

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.940 
measuring tape that it was gonna be
angled<00:01:08.760> cut<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.960> kind<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.260> winged<00:01:10.740> it

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
angled cut so I just kind of winged it

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.250 
angled cut so I just kind of winged it
on<00:01:11.310> both<00:01:11.670> inside<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.360> outside<00:01:12.480> and<00:01:12.750> on<00:01:13.110> both

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
on both inside and outside and on both

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.750 
on both inside and outside and on both
sides<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:13.920> worked<00:01:14.070> pretty<00:01:14.220> well<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.490> got

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
sides and it worked pretty well I got

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.310 
sides and it worked pretty well I got
some<00:01:14.940> gaps<00:01:15.150> I'm<00:01:15.390> gonna<00:01:15.540> fill<00:01:15.750> with<00:01:15.990> some<00:01:16.140> body

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
some gaps I'm gonna fill with some body

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.190 
some gaps I'm gonna fill with some body
filler<00:01:16.790> to<00:01:17.790> make<00:01:17.820> everything<00:01:18.210> smooth<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:21.690> top

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
filler to make everything smooth the top

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.870 
filler to make everything smooth the top
here<00:01:22.530> was<00:01:22.710> actually<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.160> little<00:01:23.400> bit<00:01:23.550> uneven

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
here was actually a little bit uneven

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.960 
here was actually a little bit uneven
from<00:01:24.240> where<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.420> did<00:01:24.720> these<00:01:24.870> pieces<00:01:25.230> and<00:01:25.560> I'm

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
from where I did these pieces and I'm

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.970 
from where I did these pieces and I'm
use<00:01:26.970> my<00:01:27.120> belt<00:01:27.330> sander<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.020> went<00:01:28.770> really

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
use my belt sander and it went really

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.740 
use my belt sander and it went really
well<00:01:29.310> now<00:01:29.550> it's<00:01:29.730> nice<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.210> smooth<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.630> I

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
well now it's nice and smooth and I

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.940 
well now it's nice and smooth and I
checked<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.080> with<00:01:31.170> my<00:01:31.350> square<00:01:31.680> and

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
checked it with my square and

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.490 
checked it with my square and
everything's<00:01:32.630> level<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.810> square<00:01:34.080> and

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
everything's level and square and

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.350 
everything's level and square and
looking<00:01:35.250> good<00:01:35.370> there<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.940> got<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.330> a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
looking good there so I got to do a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.880 
looking good there so I got to do a
little<00:01:36.540> bit<00:01:36.750> here<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.230> belt<00:01:37.380> sander<00:01:37.860> and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
little bit here with the belt sander and

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.220 
little bit here with the belt sander and
the<00:01:38.670> edges<00:01:38.970> here<00:01:39.180> probably<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.900> rest<00:01:40.110> of

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
the edges here probably just the rest of

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.640 
the edges here probably just the rest of
the<00:01:40.320> way<00:01:40.410> around<00:01:41.420> trying<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.540> make<00:01:43.470> sure

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
the way around trying to make sure

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.120 
the way around trying to make sure
everything's<00:01:43.980> gonna<00:01:44.130> sit<00:01:44.430> nice<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.820> flush

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
everything's gonna sit nice and flush

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.810 
everything's gonna sit nice and flush
well<00:01:47.130> there<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:48.800> on<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:50.040> outside<00:01:50.400> piece

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
well there in that on the outside piece

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.590 
well there in that on the outside piece
I<00:01:52.130> clamped<00:01:53.130> here<00:01:53.550> and<00:01:53.910> then<00:01:54.120> I<00:01:54.150> had<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.420> pipe

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
I clamped here and then I had the pipe

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.780 
I clamped here and then I had the pipe
clamps<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.230> bottom<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.010> Brad<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.490> along

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
clamps on the bottom and Brad it along

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.880 
clamps on the bottom and Brad it along
the<00:01:56.940> bottom<00:01:57.090> as<00:01:57.360> well<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:58.380> then<00:01:58.500> when<00:01:58.620> I<00:01:58.650> did

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the bottom as well and then when I did

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.470 
the bottom as well and then when I did
the<00:01:59.010> inside<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.460> didn't<00:01:59.970> really<00:02:00.150> have<00:02:00.300> anything

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
the inside I didn't really have anything

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.990 
the inside I didn't really have anything
that<00:02:00.600> would<00:02:00.840> get<00:02:01.020> too<00:02:01.230> deep<00:02:01.440> so<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.340> clamped<00:02:02.910> all

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
that would get too deep so I clamped all

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.850 
that would get too deep so I clamped all
the<00:02:03.120> way<00:02:03.210> along<00:02:03.450> top<00:02:03.780> with<00:02:04.050> my<00:02:04.200> clamps<00:02:04.650> and

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
the way along top with my clamps and

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.280 
the way along top with my clamps and
then<00:02:05.010> use<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.580> brad<00:02:05.790> gun<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.330> put<00:02:07.080> a<00:02:07.110> whole

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
then use the brad gun and put a whole

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.139 
then use the brad gun and put a whole
bunch<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.620> Brad's<00:02:07.830> going<00:02:08.519> this<00:02:08.849> way<00:02:09.090> so

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
bunch of Brad's going this way so

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.330 
bunch of Brad's going this way so
they're<00:02:09.689> recessed<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.409> this<00:02:10.590> edge<00:02:10.799> and<00:02:11.129> kind

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
they're recessed on this edge and kind

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.830 
they're recessed on this edge and kind
of<00:02:11.430> poked<00:02:11.760> out<00:02:11.939> a<00:02:11.969> little<00:02:12.180> bit<00:02:12.329> as<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.510> can<00:02:12.569> see

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
of poked out a little bit as you can see

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.630 
of poked out a little bit as you can see
on<00:02:12.959> this<00:02:13.140> side

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
on this side

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.160 
on this side
so<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:15.120> might<00:02:15.330> take<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.569> little<00:02:15.780> bit<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.019> body

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
so I might take a little bit of body

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.020 
so I might take a little bit of body
filler<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.830> sand<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.430> fill<00:02:17.640> these<00:02:17.790> in<00:02:18.000> a

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
filler and sand and fill these in a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.030 
filler and sand and fill these in a
little<00:02:18.209> bit<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.480> don't<00:02:18.629> really<00:02:18.900> know<00:02:19.140> probably

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
little bit I don't really know probably

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.619 
little bit I don't really know probably
won't<00:02:20.190> show<00:02:20.250> but<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:20.819> side<00:02:21.030> I'll<00:02:21.239> just<00:02:21.420> use

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
won't show but this side I'll just use

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.270 
won't show but this side I'll just use
my<00:02:21.660> little<00:02:21.959> hand<00:02:22.230> Center<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.800> sand<00:02:23.099> it<00:02:23.250> down

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
my little hand Center and sand it down

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.550 
my little hand Center and sand it down
and<00:02:23.459> if<00:02:23.849> there's<00:02:24.090> some<00:02:24.750> little<00:02:24.989> divots<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.379> can

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
and if there's some little divots I can

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.369 
and if there's some little divots I can
just<00:02:25.739> fill<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.360> with<00:02:27.360> some<00:02:27.540> body<00:02:27.690> filler<00:02:28.050> and

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
just fill that with some body filler and

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.920 
just fill that with some body filler and
then<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:29.760> little<00:02:29.910> gaps<00:02:30.239> here<00:02:30.569> I'll<00:02:30.690> fill

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
then the the little gaps here I'll fill

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.330 
then the the little gaps here I'll fill
that<00:02:31.110> stuff<00:02:31.410> it's<00:02:31.590> pretty<00:02:31.739> easy<00:02:34.099> um<00:02:35.099> I<00:02:35.190> got<00:02:35.310> a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
that stuff it's pretty easy um I got a

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.100 
that stuff it's pretty easy um I got a
few<00:02:35.549> imperfections<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.420> top<00:02:36.780> here<00:02:37.080> you

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
few imperfections on the top here you

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.479 
few imperfections on the top here you
can<00:02:37.260> probably<00:02:37.500> see<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.769> little<00:02:38.069> run<00:02:38.250> there<00:02:38.459> I

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
can probably see the little run there I

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.660 
can probably see the little run there I
don't<00:02:38.700> know<00:02:38.790> what<00:02:39.000> did<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.830> but<00:02:40.830> I'm<00:02:41.549> gonna

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
don't know what did that but I'm gonna

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.110 
don't know what did that but I'm gonna
sand<00:02:42.709> most<00:02:43.709> of<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.010> top<00:02:44.220> here<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.549> few<00:02:44.790> spots

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
sand most of the top here a few spots

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.729 
sand most of the top here a few spots
like<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.569> I'm<00:02:45.900> gonna<00:02:46.049> use<00:02:46.170> some<00:02:46.200> body<00:02:46.500> filler

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
like that I'm gonna use some body filler

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.229 
like that I'm gonna use some body filler
make<00:02:46.950> sure<00:02:47.099> that<00:02:47.310> everything's<00:02:47.730> level<00:02:47.970> and

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
make sure that everything's level and

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.910 
make sure that everything's level and
there's<00:02:48.390> no<00:02:48.540> divots<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.200> actually<00:02:49.530> nicked<00:02:49.769> it

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
there's no divots I actually nicked it

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.470 
there's no divots I actually nicked it
here<00:02:50.400> when<00:02:50.579> I<00:02:50.640> was<00:02:50.760> doing<00:02:50.880> one<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.239> carved

whites<00:02:52.280> and<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.430> few<00:02:53.610> other<00:02:53.760> spots<00:02:53.910> it'll<00:02:54.720> be

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
whites and a few other spots it'll be

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.610 
whites and a few other spots it'll be
pretty<00:02:54.959> easy<00:02:55.260> pretty<00:02:55.560> quick<00:02:55.829> to<00:02:55.980> do<00:02:56.099> all<00:02:56.250> that

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620

the chip rails I've got these are the
only<00:03:53.160> straight<00:03:53.489> pieces<00:03:53.700> I<00:03:53.940> got<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.180> got<00:03:54.359> four

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
chip rails I got this vinyl for the

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.270 
chip rails I got this vinyl for the
armrests<00:04:47.120> this<00:04:47.390> is<00:04:47.540> one<00:04:47.750> yard<00:04:48.590> of<00:04:48.800> it<00:04:48.950> got<00:04:49.250> a

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
armrests this is one yard of it got a

armrests this is one yard of it got a
Hobby<00:04:49.610> Lobby<00:04:49.700> for<00:04:50.000> 7<00:04:50.510> bucks<00:04:50.660> actually<00:04:51.110> a

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
Hobby Lobby for 7 bucks actually a

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.240 
Hobby Lobby for 7 bucks actually a
pretty<00:04:51.320> good<00:04:51.500> deal<00:04:51.680> I<00:04:51.710> thought<00:04:51.980> it<00:04:52.040> was<00:04:52.130> gonna

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
pretty good deal I thought it was gonna

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.700 
pretty good deal I thought it was gonna
be<00:04:52.340> more<00:04:52.490> expensive<00:04:52.580> than<00:04:53.000> that<00:04:53.440> and<00:04:54.440> this

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
be more expensive than that and this

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.030 
be more expensive than that and this
should<00:04:54.980> be<00:04:55.010> enough<00:04:55.430> to<00:04:55.640> do<00:04:55.820> the<00:04:56.710> armrest<00:04:57.710> front

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
should be enough to do the armrest front

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.240 
should be enough to do the armrest front
and<00:04:58.190> back<00:04:58.340> so<00:04:59.710> hopefully<00:05:00.710> I<00:05:00.919> don't<00:05:01.010> have<00:05:01.160> to

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
and back so hopefully I don't have to

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:07.480 
and back so hopefully I don't have to
get<00:05:01.400> any<00:05:01.550> more<00:05:05.590> this<00:05:06.590> is<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:06.830> tea<00:05:07.100> molding

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
get any more this is the tea molding

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.630 
get any more this is the tea molding
that's<00:05:07.700> gonna<00:05:07.880> go<00:05:08.150> in<00:05:08.720> between<00:05:09.380> where<00:05:09.710> the<00:05:09.740> two

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
that's gonna go in between where the two

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.520 
that's gonna go in between where the two
chip<00:05:10.880> rails<00:05:11.150> and<00:05:11.510> those<00:05:11.720> metal<00:05:12.020> pieces<00:05:12.230> that<00:05:12.500> I

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
chip rails and those metal pieces that I

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.440 
chip rails and those metal pieces that I
was<00:05:12.710> gonna<00:05:12.860> cut<00:05:13.160> out<00:05:13.340> which<00:05:13.970> I<00:05:14.060> really<00:05:14.300> don't

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
was gonna cut out which I really don't

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.730 
was gonna cut out which I really don't
think<00:05:14.510> I'm<00:05:14.750> gonna<00:05:14.840> do<00:05:16.510> this<00:05:17.510> isn't<00:05:17.870> it<00:05:18.080> that's

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
think I'm gonna do this isn't it that's

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.480 
think I'm gonna do this isn't it that's
a<00:05:18.979> 3/4<00:05:20.050> so<00:05:21.050> the<00:05:21.200> two<00:05:21.350> 3/4<00:05:21.890> pieces<00:05:22.220> put<00:05:22.400> together

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
a 3/4 so the two 3/4 pieces put together

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.219 
a 3/4 so the two 3/4 pieces put together
is<00:05:22.910> roughly<00:05:23.390> an<00:05:23.450> inch<00:05:23.540> and<00:05:23.750> a<00:05:23.780> half<00:05:23.810> this<00:05:24.110> is

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
is roughly an inch and a half this is

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.980 
is roughly an inch and a half this is
inch<00:05:24.410> and<00:05:24.590> a<00:05:24.620> half<00:05:24.650> tea<00:05:24.950> molding<00:05:25.340> and<00:05:25.840> it's<00:05:26.840> got

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
inch and a half tea molding and it's got

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.800 
inch and a half tea molding and it's got
the<00:05:27.110> little<00:05:27.200> Ridge<00:05:27.470> in<00:05:27.680> there<00:05:28.419> so<00:05:29.419> I've<00:05:29.570> got

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
the little Ridge in there so I've got

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.630 
the little Ridge in there so I've got
the<00:05:30.020> bit<00:05:30.340> that<00:05:31.340> cuts<00:05:31.640> that<00:05:31.910> slot<00:05:33.460> that'll<00:05:34.460> cut

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
the bit that cuts that slot that'll cut

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.490 
the bit that cuts that slot that'll cut
the<00:05:34.790> slot<00:05:35.090> on<00:05:35.360> a<00:05:35.419> router<00:05:35.690> I'm<00:05:36.050> gonna<00:05:36.169> get<00:05:36.350> from

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
the slot on a router I'm gonna get from

least 250 pounds this thing is not too

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.960 
least 250 pounds this thing is not too
heavy<00:07:20.070> but<00:07:20.220> it's<00:07:20.490> still<00:07:20.670> pretty<00:07:20.850> heavy<00:07:22.970> so

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:23.970 
heavy but it's still pretty heavy so

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.530 
heavy but it's still pretty heavy so
other<00:07:24.150> than<00:07:24.270> that<00:07:24.450> until<00:07:24.960> next<00:07:25.170> time
