00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.800
 hello how come today I bring a video to 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.440
 show you how I make these daisies in 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.050
 the nails and I hope you like it so 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.769
 let's start first what 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:19.820
 you need is a yellow paintbrush a 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:23.150
 nail paints white and finally 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.760
 a transparent color nail polish for 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.519
 give the last layer of shine and protect 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.340
 what is the daisy also 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:34.460
 you will need a napkin or paper to 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.800
 Do not stain the table and finally the most 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.839
 important will be some toothpicks 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.000
 teeth but of these that are redonditos 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:43.879
 to be able to take well what is the 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.820
 nail polish on the tip is worth so let's go 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.250
 to start first we will take nail polish 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.440
 yellow to make the center of the 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.739
 daisy with the tip of the stick 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.110
 we will form what is a circle and we will 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.629
 retouching it as the 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.030
 nail polish then we will take the 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.059
 white nail polish with the tip of the 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.560
 stick we will do the same we will drop 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.020
 a droplet 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.350
 and we will give a little petal shape 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.149
 I'm going to make 5 petals but good 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.289
 you can do what you want is that I 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:20.149
 he believed that 4 were few and more than 5 were 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:23.000
 too many so 5 I think they are 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:26.330
 perfect and it's just leave it the 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.429
 droplet fall and if not and if too much remains 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.360
 round so lengthen it a little but 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:34.899
 nothing a little bit and nothing is going 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.869
 doing and there you have the daisy 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:42.350
 finally we give the shine layer 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:45.860
 so that the nail is better and protect the 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.700
 drawing that yes very important to let dry 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.000
 a lot of time because if it is not going to 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.460
 destroy the daisy 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.310
 good and as you can see it's super easy to do 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.990
 these nails so I encourage you to do them and 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.600
 nothing I hope you liked me 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.890
 tutorial and see you in the next 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.890
