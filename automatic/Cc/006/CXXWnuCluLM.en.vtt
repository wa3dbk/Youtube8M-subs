00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:07.740
 of liberation that we are also going to 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.019
 work the release is one is a 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.660
 emotional balance but let's work 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.660
 with the changes and this 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.699
 well let's work and this 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.060
 precisely it takes you suggested that already 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.539
 let's see it in the eyes again what 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.539
 strong 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:37.079
 you're going to tell him how stupid 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.629
 you're going to tell him five things 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:47.940
 the worst you can imagine of 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:50.670
 you will see now that as they say we are going to 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.480
 see focus and the worst criticism 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.100
 what can you imagine 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.800
 to see here if you're stupid 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:04.330
 misogynist intolerant closed of mind 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:07.960
 when I'm 44 and crazy 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.450
 very well now concentrate and get ready and 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.180
 tell him the 7 best things you can 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.690
 tell him the best you can think of 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.690
 okay 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:28.680
 you are intelligent fun creative 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:33.390
 extroverted as it says when the use that 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.920
 you do not know how to react and predictable 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.920
 thank explosive that that is positive and 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.920
 surprising 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.170
 five points of the worst that you 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:56.069
 can you imagine what you see in the 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:57.840
 environment 9 I hold I also 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:02.640
 I feel that you are suddenly intolerant 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:08.789
 little communicative little expressive 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:11.969
 closed you reach the heart 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:20.730
 and maybe closed again but because 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:23.099
 you feel so attacked that now you think 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.010
 in the seven best things in the 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.940
 qualities that I had do well then very 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.350
 creative 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.350
 bold on television 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.750
 is that I talked to him about things 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.850
 private and he 's a great boy I know that 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.270
 have 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.820
 a big heart and that's why he gets a 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.800
 carapace also very strong because no 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.140
 he likes to be hurt they have 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.940
 hurt and no longer wants to be hurt 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.940
 what very well
