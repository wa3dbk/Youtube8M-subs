00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 yes, I'm happy to find 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.100
 today for a little video vlog 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.529
 gold I never do your log 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.809
 but that's what it held me that held me to 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:14.549
 heart I wanted to tell you actually 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.199
 me from my will for many 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.380
 years it's been over 15 years of my 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.720
 round and do redo the nose so 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.769
 I know that reviews are usually 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.509
 all opposed to the mia unanimously that 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.910
 this is my family my friends no one 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.379
 includes seven 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.910
 this will I have that complex that 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.900
 I have but again a complex 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:40.839
 it's really own and unique 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.059
 it's true that I do not like my nose 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:46.329
 so again I'm fine 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.339
 aware that my nose is not huge 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.390
 one and I have no bail it is not 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:54.820
 twisted finally here it goes with my face 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.030
 there is no problem with it 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.309
 not horrible and here it is not 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.360
 horrible but it does not suit me 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.119
 Anyway I would have really liked 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.159
 to have just the tip of the nose a little bit 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:09.090
 more pointed without having it at the michael 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.049
 jackson let's say but a little to the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.670
 charlize theron for example having 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.939
 really a little more bed a little bit to 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.990
 see the tip a little bit more defined 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.670
 so I've been thinking about it for a very long time 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.189
 I was of course too young my parents 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.829
 did not want then then of course I 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.659
 I was scared and pushed back the deadlines 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.159
 and there I told myself I'm 30 years is 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.950
 the year of change clearly for 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.210
 me it's a year of total change 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.939
 and I thought to myself if you do not do it 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.140
 you 'll never do me so I'm 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.829
 decided to make an appointment with a 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.329
 surgeon only very experienced at the meeting 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.359
 kim rossi this morning so really there 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.729
 it is sure the moment of the emotions 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.609
 that I'm talking to you so I went on 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.230
 see this morning I told him about 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:53.100
 two to confront me 2 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.600
 I 'll redraw the tip of the nose 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.660
 and he refused 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.810
 so he told me that clearly no but 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.360
 did not have anything that could understand 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.940
 I want to have a little more nose 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.540
 pointed but that there was too much 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.080
 risk and unlikely to obtain 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.030
 the desired result 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.650
 surin and who as he says himself 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.630
 who goes with my face that has nothing to 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.410
 unsightly for him to embark on 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.200
 this operation 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.270
 it would have been necessary to 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.830
 cartilage all over the place to allow 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.810
 to redraw a tip he tells me that 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.720
 it is true that the cartilages do not remain 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.440
 not well in place it evolved it would have 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.510
 have probably been spotted spotted on 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.650
 fibrous to the room and the and the skin 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.900
 so for him it's not worth it and 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.550
 so he refused good anyway 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.490
 as I kind of insisted he 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.040
 oriented towards a fellow who is 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.570
 specialized in renovation so 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:58.209
 some hope game so I will go to consult 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.700
 this this other surgeon to have his 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.940
 opinion and then it's really him too 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.650
 say no I will do with you with effect 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.239
 for 30 years well ben I will do with 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.330
 for the next thirty years 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.150
 see the next 50 years if I have 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.260
 the chance to live so far but hey 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.370
 still very disappointed you have to 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.340
 know that when we have a complex 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.230
 physical 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.340
 all the more when I have complex 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.720
 nobody understands what me 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.180
 it's true that nobody understands this 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.190
 complex where I'm always told but 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.019
 to love your nose suits you very well everything is 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.370
 very well played because what's going on 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.910
 in his head but it's just happening 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.170
 in the head 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.849
 and so here I am with that 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.430
 does not prevent me from living from doing 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.269
 videos and all that but but that's it 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.660
 did something that was important to me 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.680
 I'm proud of myself for seeing 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.360
 decision but what is it when 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.879
 even to a sacred dose of courage I 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.709
 find in the end to have an opinion 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.090
 negative no this is only part discount 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.660
 I will keep you informed of 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.790
 the opinion of the second shiv and then I wanted 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.170
 show you a little purchase that suddenly 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.010
 I made myself to go back to 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.700
 moral 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.860
 considering that I was still very disappointed so 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.299
 it's a little a little gem that comes 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.709
 of the southern counter therefore for the 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.319
 reunion the southern counter 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.720
 find in saint paul downtown in 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.620
 the rue de la poste street so I 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.239
 think it's called rue rhin and 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.320
 danube and they make all the jewels gas 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.729
 reminiscences here is a lot of 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.049
 little cool stuff the prices are 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.450
 almost the same prices as in France 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.850
 it seems to me and so here and so I 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.200
 am offered a small pair of curls 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.620
 which really flashed me 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.210
 above 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.130
 I was also angry on an arm that is 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.270
 so they were connected like that 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.669
 with a big fat plate golden gas 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.830
 but the link was to brown caffin 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:46.289
 khaki and I would have liked to see her in black 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.889
 so this is the model and ever eve a 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.780
 something like that 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.370
 so as I go on paris at the month 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.099
 from August I will try to find with the 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.389
 link in black there if I do not find it 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.650
 a job that could be reached 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.440
 small cord and inked from China 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.240
 but I doubt a little 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.330
 so it looks small pouch gas 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.919
 like that as usual and you go 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.000
 see these little wonders they are 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.440
 beautiful 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.440
 I'm so happy 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:17.650
 from 7h to soap up a little morale I 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.879
 will show you here they are with the 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.009
 sun I do not know if you'll see well 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:22.870
 it looks a little like the one that poppy 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:25.629
 net offered me except that this is gold 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.490
 really yellow yellow but it's the same 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:30.780
 two-part principle I'm going to 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.780
 wear for you to show them 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.690
 here they are beautiful but 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.420
 I really find them splendid 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.870
 bring up the spirits 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.560
 the milks or the door and I do not have this 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.730
 what do you think 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.730
 I will try to zoom in 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:59.730
 here they are really but too much 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.070
 nice game i love them they are 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.560
 beautiful 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:06.150
 So here is the little I do not like my 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.490
 nose so if we zoom in on my nose it's okay 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:10.940
 go on so that's I listened this will be 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.350
 all for this little rhinoplasty blog game 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:16.680
 so I make a little wink to 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.460
 all my girlfriends who did they 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.980
 this operation 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.470
 and then also at youtube look at 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:25.320
 youtube us that I know who actually 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.880
 redo their noses lately one who in 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.610
 is very happy or the other a little 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.820
 little me and it's true that I want 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.650
 to share their emotions and this is true 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.510
 that I am still disappointed with 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.030
 not be able to do it but I keep 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:43.590
 hope I tell myself that maybe the 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:46.100
 doctor my vidal will be able to him him 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.390
 propose something with a result 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.460
 guaranteed since it's true that like me 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:51.650
 said the 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.990
 doctor goulard the problem is 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.960
 that with the nose that I have is too much 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:58.400
 risk of wanting to change it knowing 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.319
 that we are not at all sure of the result 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.020
 we will probably have 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:04.910
 something that will be worse when 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.789
 even a little annoying and that with 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:09.650
 his d2 cartilage problems 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:11.780
 we have here when we add more we know 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.819
 never how will it evolve 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.650
 who equip it euros move with the 

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:18.169
 time it is possible we must 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.699
 re-intervene and he tells me it's going 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:23.810
 operations and we do not 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:26.060
 never stops and it is here is good 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.620
 a professional is a surgeon 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.229
 plastic that is still well known 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.210
 so I I trust him but I 

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:34.220
 find that two opinions are always worth 

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.479
 better than one so that's it okay listen and if 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.750
 I will keep you informed of any 

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:40.820
 way I hope this little blog you 

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.280
 will have allowed a little to understand my 

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:45.560
 state of mind we are often judged when 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.430
 when it wants to start the 

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.830
 change his tics 

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:51.110
 I think that from the moment we 

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.789
 has a real complex that handicap us 

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:56.419
 on a daily basis that undermines our morale 

00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:58.990
 daily if we can do it we need the 

00:07:56.419 --> 00:08:01.370
 do as long as it's reasonable 

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:03.500
 and then after when it really comes 

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.060
 good voila is done again chest this 

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.560
