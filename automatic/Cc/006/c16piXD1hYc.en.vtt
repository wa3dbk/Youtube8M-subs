now we can raise this number but don't

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.770 
now we can raise this number but don't
go<00:01:32.189> over<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.670> half<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.060> your<00:01:33.270> total<00:01:33.479> memory

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
go over the half of your total memory

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.020 
go over the half of your total memory
because<00:01:34.439> also<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.950> operating<00:01:35.430> system<00:01:35.850> needs

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
because also you operating system needs

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.940 
because also you operating system needs
some<00:01:36.329> RAM<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.990> don't<00:01:37.170> want<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.740> all

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
some RAM and we don't want to have all

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.460 
some RAM and we don't want to have all
the<00:01:38.159> stuff<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.520> our<00:01:38.610> paging<00:01:39.150> file<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.320> will

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the stuff in our paging file so I will

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.219 
the stuff in our paging file so I will
now<00:01:40.619> type<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.220> 4G<00:01:41.880> because<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.479> stands<00:01:42.720> for<00:01:42.930> 4

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
now type on 4G because the stands for 4

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.530 
now type on 4G because the stands for 4
gigabytes<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.490> exactly<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.210> half

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
gigabytes and this is exactly the half

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.480 
gigabytes and this is exactly the half
of<00:01:45.750> my<00:01:45.810> ram<00:01:46.409> which<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.770> have<00:01:46.950> here<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.310> my

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
of my ram which I have here on my

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.760 
of my ram which I have here on my
notebook<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.329> for<00:01:48.840> instance<00:01:49.229> if<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.619> have

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
notebook and for instance if you have

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.880 
notebook and for instance if you have
three<00:01:50.040> gigabytes<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.670> RAM<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.149> can<00:01:51.329> also<00:01:51.540> type

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
three gigabytes of RAM you can also type

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.910 
three gigabytes of RAM you can also type
1.5<00:01:52.890> G<00:01:53.310> which<00:01:53.670> stands<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.210> 1.5<00:01:54.960> gigabytes<00:01:55.649> or

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
1.5 G which stands for 1.5 gigabytes or

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.010 
1.5 G which stands for 1.5 gigabytes or
1.3<00:01:56.700> or<00:01:56.729> anything<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.509> want<00:01:57.689> to

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
1.3 or anything you want to

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.410 
1.3 or anything you want to
so<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.469> will<00:01:58.740> set<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.100> now<00:01:59.250> here<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.670> 40<00:02:00.180> and

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
so I will set just now here to 40 and

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.149 
so I will set just now here to 40 and
then<00:02:00.840> just<00:02:01.049> go<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.590> right<00:02:01.799> bottom<00:02:02.130> corner

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
then just go to the right bottom corner

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.670 
then just go to the right bottom corner
hit<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.030> save<00:02:03.210> profile<00:02:03.659> button<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.140> then<00:02:04.469> it

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
hit the save profile button and then it

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.280 
hit the save profile button and then it
is<00:02:05.009> applied<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.759> now<00:02:06.180> double<00:02:06.600> check<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.869> the

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
is applied so now double check that the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.050 
is applied so now double check that the
box<00:02:07.530> is<00:02:07.649> ticked<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.700> have<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
box is ticked and that you have the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.119 
box is ticked and that you have the
number<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.330> there<00:02:09.629> just<00:02:10.110> go<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.349> save<00:02:10.649> profile

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
number in there just go to save profile

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.809 
number in there just go to save profile
choose<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.670> profile<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.270> now<00:02:12.480> just

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
choose the profile and now just

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.910 
choose the profile and now just
go<00:02:12.939> to<00:02:12.999> play<00:02:13.420> so<00:02:14.079> now<00:02:14.260> let's<00:02:14.469> wait<00:02:14.680> until

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
go to play so now let's wait until

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.759 
go to play so now let's wait until
minecraft<00:02:15.519> has<00:02:15.700> loaded<00:02:16.030> up<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.499> there<00:02:17.499> we<00:02:17.590> go

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
minecraft has loaded up and there we go

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.500 
minecraft has loaded up and there we go
let's<00:02:18.280> make<00:02:18.489> it<00:02:18.519> a<00:02:18.670> little<00:02:18.849> bit<00:02:18.999> bigger<00:02:19.239> and

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
let's make it a little bit bigger and

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.050 
let's make it a little bit bigger and
now<00:02:20.409> we'll<00:02:20.590> check<00:02:20.920> if<00:02:21.189> it<00:02:21.400> has<00:02:21.430> worked<00:02:21.879> so

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
now we'll check if it has worked so

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.039 
now we'll check if it has worked so
therefore<00:02:22.389> we<00:02:22.480> will<00:02:22.599> create<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.930> new

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
therefore we will create a new

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.050 
therefore we will create a new
single-player<00:02:23.709> world<00:02:23.799> and<00:02:24.280> there<00:02:24.609> we<00:02:24.700> go

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
single-player world and there we go

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.239 
single-player world and there we go
ok<00:02:25.659> so<00:02:25.719> now<00:02:25.989> just<00:02:26.170> wait<00:02:26.439> until<00:02:26.829> you<00:02:26.950> are<00:02:26.980> in<00:02:27.159> the

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:27.249 
ok so now just wait until you are in the

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.119 
ok so now just wait until you are in the
game<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.700> there<00:02:28.030> we<00:02:28.120> go<00:02:28.269> and<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:29.349> check<00:02:29.650> if<00:02:29.889> it

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
game and there we go and to check if it

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.800 
game and there we go and to check if it
has<00:02:30.310> worked<00:02:30.609> all<00:02:30.879> you<00:02:31.120> have<00:02:31.269> to<00:02:31.389> do<00:02:31.510> is<00:02:31.629> just

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
has worked all you have to do is just

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.140 
has worked all you have to do is just
press<00:02:32.079> the<00:02:32.290> f3<00:02:32.500> key<00:02:32.920> on<00:02:33.370> your<00:02:33.579> keyboard<00:02:33.819> so

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
press the f3 key on your keyboard so

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.550 
press the f3 key on your keyboard so
it's<00:02:34.329> on<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.540> top<00:02:34.780> of<00:02:34.959> your<00:02:35.049> keyboard<00:02:35.439> and

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
it's on the top of your keyboard and

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.589 
it's on the top of your keyboard and
then<00:02:36.099> you<00:02:36.189> will<00:02:36.310> see<00:02:36.459> this<00:02:36.609> menu<00:02:36.849> here<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:37.389> now

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
then you will see this menu here and now

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:38.970 
then you will see this menu here and now
on<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.930> right<00:02:38.079> top<00:02:38.230> corner<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.739> will<00:02:38.919> see

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
on the right top corner you will see

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.209 
on the right top corner you will see
used<00:02:39.519> memory<00:02:40.000> for<00:02:40.359> instance<00:02:40.469> 5%<00:02:41.469> and<00:02:41.799> 200

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:42.219 
used memory for instance 5% and 200

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.179 
used memory for instance 5% and 200
megabytes<00:02:42.639> off<00:02:42.879> a<00:02:43.540> maximum<00:02:44.230> number<00:02:44.620> which<00:02:44.859> can

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
megabytes off a maximum number which can

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:47.789 
megabytes off a maximum number which can
be<00:02:45.250> allocated<00:02:45.609> to<00:02:46.329> Minecraft<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.109> maybe<00:02:47.650> you

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
be allocated to Minecraft and maybe you

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:49.500 
be allocated to Minecraft and maybe you
will<00:02:47.889> notice<00:02:48.280> that<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:48.730> number<00:02:48.939> of<00:02:49.269> the

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
will notice that the number of the

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.050 
will notice that the number of the
maximum<00:02:49.989> memory<00:02:50.169> is<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.650> little<00:02:51.280> bit<00:02:51.430> below<00:02:51.609> and

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
maximum memory is a little bit below and

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.849 
maximum memory is a little bit below and
the<00:02:52.180> number<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.510> have<00:02:52.689> entered<00:02:53.199> before<00:02:53.379> but

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
the number you have entered before but

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.770 
the number you have entered before but
this<00:02:54.040> is<00:02:54.250> okay<00:02:54.669> then<00:02:55.180> further<00:02:55.389> we<00:02:55.540> have

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
this is okay then further we have

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.349 
this is okay then further we have
allocated<00:02:56.169> memory<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:57.159> this<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.519> in<00:02:57.730> real<00:02:58.030> time

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
allocated memory so this is in real time

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.420 
allocated memory so this is in real time
and<00:02:58.629> you<00:02:58.659> can<00:02:59.079> see<00:02:59.230> how<00:02:59.530> much<00:02:59.739> memory<00:03:00.219> is

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
and you can see how much memory is

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.300 
and you can see how much memory is
allocated<00:03:00.879> to<00:03:01.449> Minecraft<00:03:01.959> right<00:03:02.169> now<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:02.859> as

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
allocated to Minecraft right now and as

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.189 
allocated to Minecraft right now and as
you<00:03:03.340> can<00:03:03.579> see<00:03:03.639> um<00:03:04.000> this<00:03:04.269> increases<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.049> whole

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:05.199 
you can see um this increases the whole

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:07.679 
you can see um this increases the whole
time<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.769> also<00:03:06.280> this<00:03:06.519> increases<00:03:07.150> very<00:03:07.359> fast

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
time and also this increases very fast

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.689 
time and also this increases very fast
um<00:03:07.959> if<00:03:08.139> you're<00:03:08.290> rendering<00:03:08.500> a<00:03:08.889> huge<00:03:09.219> distance

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:09.699 
um if you're rendering a huge distance

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:12.270 
um if you're rendering a huge distance
so<00:03:10.329> for<00:03:10.480> instance<00:03:10.810> if<00:03:10.959> we<00:03:11.019> go<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.349> options<00:03:12.010> and

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
so for instance if we go to options and

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.580 
so for instance if we go to options and
video<00:03:12.669> settings<00:03:12.879> and<00:03:13.329> if<00:03:13.689> you<00:03:13.810> set<00:03:14.049> the<00:03:14.260> render

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
video settings and if you set the render

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.740 
video settings and if you set the render
distance<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:15.189> very<00:03:15.489> high<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.060> fly

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
distance to very high and you fly

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.629 
distance to very high and you fly
through<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.139> world<00:03:17.349> dentist<00:03:18.009> gets<00:03:18.280> really

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
through the world dentist gets really

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.490 
through the world dentist gets really
big<00:03:18.849> and<00:03:19.120> also<00:03:19.540> if<00:03:19.659> you<00:03:19.750> have<00:03:19.840> many<00:03:20.199> mods

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
big and also if you have many mods

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.259 
big and also if you have many mods
installed<00:03:20.680> then<00:03:21.159> minecraft<00:03:21.639> can<00:03:21.819> run<00:03:22.000> out<00:03:22.239> of
