00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
about parallelism how you can take the

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:43.109 
about parallelism how you can take the
same<00:01:40.640> thing<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.000> move<00:01:41.149> it<00:01:41.330> yeah<00:01:41.810> you<00:01:42.229> know<00:01:42.350> to

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
same thing and move it yeah you know to

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.380 
same thing and move it yeah you know to
do<00:01:44.119> a<00:01:44.150> different<00:01:44.750> melodic<00:01:45.229> minor<00:01:45.409> scale<00:01:45.590> since

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
do a different melodic minor scale since

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.149 
do a different melodic minor scale since
they're<00:01:47.390> very<00:01:47.659> similar<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.920> there's<00:01:49.100> no

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
they're very similar and there's no

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.580 
they're very similar and there's no
avoid<00:01:49.610> notes<00:01:49.939> in<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:50.420> melodic<00:01:50.780> minor<00:01:50.990> okay

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
avoid notes in the melodic minor okay

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.740 
avoid notes in the melodic minor okay
and<00:01:51.830> then<00:01:52.130> i'm<00:01:52.280> also<00:01:52.549> in<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.119> second<00:01:53.540> part
