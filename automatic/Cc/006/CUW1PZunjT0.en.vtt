for what the for standing up really for
democracy<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.330> I<00:01:38.690> think<00:01:38.900> that<00:01:39.020> that's<00:01:39.050> what

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
democracy and I think that that's what

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.990 
democracy and I think that that's what
people<00:01:39.770> need<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:39.920> recognize<00:01:40.100> this<00:01:40.640> is<00:01:40.790> not

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
people need to recognize this is not

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.700 
people need to recognize this is not
about<00:01:41.150> a<00:01:41.300> wage<00:01:41.540> freeze<00:01:41.900> this<00:01:42.110> is<00:01:42.260> about<00:01:42.500> an

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
about a wage freeze this is about an

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.310 
about a wage freeze this is about an
attack<00:01:43.010> on<00:01:43.220> charter<00:01:43.670> right<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.320> the

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
attack on charter right and the

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.350 
attack on charter right and the
fundamental<00:01:46.040> rights<00:01:46.310> of<00:01:46.460> organized<00:01:46.910> labor<00:01:47.000> in

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
fundamental rights of organized labor in

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.000

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
the future of organized labor in our

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.710 
the future of organized labor in our
province<00:01:49.400> and<00:01:49.760> I<00:01:49.850> think<00:01:50.060> that<00:01:50.180> that's<00:01:50.330> why<00:01:50.570> I'm

it's extremely difficult this year

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:16.259 
it's extremely difficult this year
because<00:03:14.049> the<00:03:14.860> government<00:03:15.370> has<00:03:15.459> set<00:03:15.819> a<00:03:16.000> tone

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
because teachers only deal with stuff

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.800 
because teachers only deal with stuff
involving<00:03:21.940> students<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:22.569> those<00:03:22.659> are<00:03:22.780> the
