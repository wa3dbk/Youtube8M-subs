00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.859
 I had five children 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.530
 and the railroad pig was not much 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:49.530
 in the wind 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.570
 then came a co-worker a 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.030
 big man I told him I had 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.879

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.729
 when I finished cooking the bread 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.430
 to take a handful of flour in the 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.380
 hand and throw it into the oven and 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.080
 that it was going to produce a lot very much 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.680
 achieve inah burned and they were going to come 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.490
 the neighbors to buy me the bread 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.490
 to 0 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.610

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.770

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.550

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.550
 come the neighbors 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.170
 the Turkish is a puff pastry invoice that 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.530
 here in Rosario was one what was crazy 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.100
 he did not make homemade bread 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.909
 and after a day before wanting this 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.909
 and try to take it out and do it too 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.729
 I practiced where I practiced and did not go 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.409
 I did not know how the dough was then 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.930
 day they told me it was a buttonhole 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.479

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.630
 I was not doing well and the cakes came out 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.010
 I think for the pastry 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:20.810

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.810

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:34.890
 training population then included the 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.890
 and I make the puff pastry 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.459

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.590

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.390

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.980
 in a fountain 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.580
 30 degrees 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.580

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.450

 I had forgotten 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.700
 and one day one of the neighbors sits down 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:29.580

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:42.470
 It was the only thing we ate in the day 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:45.650
 It was always a swarthy musician 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.120
 that are always my relationship 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.080
 with flour 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.080

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.740
 and a lot of thanks
