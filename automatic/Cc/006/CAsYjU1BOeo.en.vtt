00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.130 

always<00:00:34.750> have<00:00:34.900> a<00:00:34.930> problem<00:00:35.200> with<00:00:35.470> this<00:00:35.590> one<00:00:35.649> spot

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
always have a problem with this one spot

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.660 
always have a problem with this one spot
because<00:00:38.140> it<00:00:38.290> always<00:00:38.590> gets<00:00:38.800> I<00:00:39.190> got<00:00:39.489> a<00:00:39.520> lot<00:00:39.640> of

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
because it always gets I got a lot of

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.930 
because it always gets I got a lot of
solder<00:00:40.649> that's<00:00:41.649> the<00:00:41.860> only<00:00:42.130> spot<00:00:42.280> that<00:00:42.730> when

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
solder that's the only spot that when

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.180 
solder that's the only spot that when
the<00:00:43.030> solder<00:00:43.300> pops<00:00:43.720> out<00:00:44.110> I<00:00:44.559> lose<00:00:44.950> track

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
the solder pops out I lose track

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.310 
the solder pops out I lose track
connection<00:00:45.940> so<00:00:46.630> that's<00:00:46.810> one<00:00:47.050> of<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:47.170> main

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
connection so that's one of the main

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.730 
connection so that's one of the main
