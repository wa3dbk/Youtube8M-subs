with<00:01:20.350> a<00:01:20.380> widening<00:01:20.770> hook<00:01:20.950> because<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.340> bait

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
with a widening hook because the bait

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.340 
with a widening hook because the bait
this<00:01:21.700> doesn't<00:01:22.090> work<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:22.479> we<00:01:22.540> get<00:01:22.960> nipped<00:01:23.200> off
