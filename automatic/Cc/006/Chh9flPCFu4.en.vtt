um<00:04:14.070> the<00:04:14.400> trick<00:04:14.580> is<00:04:14.700> on<00:04:14.790> the<00:04:14.910> left<00:04:15.180> hand<00:04:15.330> is<00:04:15.900> that

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
um the trick is on the left hand is that

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.390 
um the trick is on the left hand is that
you're<00:04:16.260> not<00:04:16.410> going<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.680> hold<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:16.980> chord<00:04:17.220> down

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
you're not going to hold the chord down

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.860 
you're not going to hold the chord down
like<00:04:17.609> this<00:04:17.790> you're<00:04:18.030> going<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.209> actually<00:04:18.359> let

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
like this you're going to actually let

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.199 
like this you're going to actually let
go<00:04:18.900> of<00:04:19.200> that<00:04:19.560> tension<00:04:19.890> line<00:04:20.220> take<00:04:21.060> your

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
go of that tension line take your

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.820 
go of that tension line take your
fingers<00:04:21.510> slightly<00:04:21.840> off<00:04:22.230> so<00:04:22.590> you're<00:04:22.710> not

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
fingers slightly off so you're not

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.740 
fingers slightly off so you're not
pressing<00:04:23.100> down<00:04:23.280> hard<00:04:23.430> your<00:04:24.330> fingers<00:04:24.600> are<00:04:24.720> just

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
pressing down hard your fingers are just

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.690 
pressing down hard your fingers are just
blocking<00:04:25.350> the<00:04:25.470> strength<00:04:25.740> ok<00:04:26.310> because<00:04:26.490> the

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
blocking the strength ok because the

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.040 
blocking the strength ok because the
second<00:04:27.000> you<00:04:27.090> lift<00:04:27.330> off

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.080 

okay<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.260> court<00:04:31.500> stops<00:04:31.860> ringing<00:04:32.190> so

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
okay the court stops ringing so
