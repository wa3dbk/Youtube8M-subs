considerations keep in mind one of the
most<00:00:17.820> important<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.509> what<00:00:18.689> type<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.320> stone<00:00:19.529> are

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
most important is what type of stone are

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.979 
most important is what type of stone are
you<00:00:19.739> working<00:00:20.040> with<00:00:20.360> harder<00:00:21.360> stone<00:00:21.570> such<00:00:21.840> as
