[Music]

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:53.060 

you

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.720 

round<00:00:53.730> edges<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.420> each<00:00:54.570> teardrop<00:00:55.199> shape

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
round edges of each teardrop shape

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.590 
round edges of each teardrop shape
unfortunately<00:00:56.730> we'd<00:00:56.910> run<00:00:57.089> out<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.239> cotton

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
unfortunately we'd run out of cotton

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.389 
unfortunately we'd run out of cotton
buds<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.109> had<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.500> use<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> brush<00:00:59.070> for<00:00:59.309> this

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
buds so I had to use a brush for this

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.369 
buds so I had to use a brush for this
step<00:00:59.640> which<00:00:59.820> made<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.210> lot<00:01:00.359> harder<00:01:00.420> cotton

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
step which made it a lot harder cotton

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.110 
step which made it a lot harder cotton
buds<00:01:01.530> or<00:01:01.739> q-tips<00:01:02.129> are<00:01:02.339> actually<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.729> lot<00:01:02.969> better

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
buds or q-tips are actually a lot better

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.620 
buds or q-tips are actually a lot better
to<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.719> step<00:01:03.899> with<00:01:08.240> I'll<00:01:09.240> be<00:01:09.299> using

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
to do this step with I'll be using

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.469 
to do this step with I'll be using
uniball<00:01:10.229> signo<00:01:10.289> gel<00:01:11.039> pens<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.909> fine<00:01:12.180> tip

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
uniball signo gel pens in the fine tip

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.359 
uniball signo gel pens in the fine tip
because<00:01:12.960> obviously<00:01:13.500> they<00:01:13.710> draw<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.009> line

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
because obviously they draw a line

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.950 
because obviously they draw a line
that's<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.759> lot<00:01:14.909> thinner<00:01:15.180> which<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.630> better<00:01:15.780> for

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
that's a lot thinner which is better for

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.710 
that's a lot thinner which is better for
