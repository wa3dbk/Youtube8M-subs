00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
like best luck I've done a decent job

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.260 
like best luck I've done a decent job
copying<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.280> although<00:01:56.280> looking<00:01:57.000> at<00:01:57.119> the

copying this although looking at the
instructions<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.020> build<00:01:58.259> seems<00:01:58.710> very<00:01:59.460> simple

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
instructions the build seems very simple

hang on isn't that just a broken bit of
wall<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.149> when<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.290> is<00:02:04.439> odd<00:02:04.619> we've<00:02:05.040> got<00:02:05.219> the

You Russians but we've also got
something<00:02:10.289> next<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.709> same<00:02:10.979> for<00:02:11.250> ages<00:02:11.790> 5

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
something next to the same for ages 5

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.910

so the ages of not too free or a big
no-no<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.140> get<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.850> anything<00:02:17.850> above<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.180> age

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300

no-no I get that anything above the age
of<00:02:18.510> five<00:02:19.020> is<00:02:19.410> okay<00:02:19.830> but<00:02:20.520> what<00:02:20.700> if<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.880> fall

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
of five is okay but what if you fall

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.720 
of five is okay but what if you fall
years<00:02:21.360> old<00:02:21.860> does<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.010> mean<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.190> it's<00:02:23.430> stuck

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
years old does it mean that it's stuck

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.890 
years old does it mean that it's stuck
in<00:02:23.880> toy<00:02:24.180> limbo<00:02:24.780> during<00:02:25.709> that<00:02:25.860> time<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.900> this

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
I come to be asked there is a little bit

I come to be asked there is a little bit

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
of broken wall as well that he didn't

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.750 
of broken wall as well that he didn't
get<00:02:39.959> instructions<00:02:40.470> far<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.250> had<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.550> build

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
get instructions far and I had to build

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.040 
get instructions far and I had to build
it<00:02:41.940> based<00:02:42.150> on<00:02:42.270> what<00:02:42.360> was<00:02:42.510> displayed<00:02:42.690> on<00:02:42.959> the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
it based on what was displayed on the

it based on what was displayed on the
box<00:02:43.290> which<00:02:44.100> is<00:02:44.250> just<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.459> few<00:02:44.640> bits<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.970> brick

and a can with the word gas written on
it<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.750> then<00:02:48.930> we've<00:02:49.050> got<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.320> main<00:02:49.560> man

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
it and then we've got the main man

look weird weave noses in my opinion
it's<00:03:14.880> not<00:03:15.000> bad<00:03:15.300> I<00:03:15.330> suppose<00:03:15.840> it's<00:03:16.050> certainly

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
it's not bad I suppose it's certainly

not a disaster the little plastic bricks

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.910 
not a disaster the little plastic bricks
might<00:03:18.570> feel<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.840> bit<00:03:19.049> cheap<00:03:19.290> but<00:03:19.440> at<00:03:19.530> least<00:03:19.680> they

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
might feel a bit cheap but at least they

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.289 
might feel a bit cheap but at least they

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
apart having said that this just seems

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.640 
apart having said that this just seems

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
like a really lazy effort to be honest

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.830 
the minifigure and the bike it's not
awfully<00:03:32.730> bad<00:03:32.970> but<00:03:33.329> then<00:03:33.450> again<00:03:33.540> it's<00:03:33.810> not

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
awfully bad but then again it's not

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.259 
awfully bad but then again it's not
awfully<00:03:34.290> good<00:03:34.530> either<00:03:34.769> it<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:35.760> compatible

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
awfully good either it is compatible

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.270 
awfully good either it is compatible
with<00:03:36.510> real<00:03:36.750> Lego<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:37.769> although<00:03:37.920> it<00:03:38.100> still

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
with real Lego and although it still

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.890 
with real Lego and although it still
feels<00:03:38.549> cheaper<00:03:39.000> compared<00:03:39.299> to<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.480> real<00:03:39.630> thing

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
feels cheaper compared to the real thing

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.020 
feels cheaper compared to the real thing
it<00:03:40.110> feels<00:03:40.470> nowhere<00:03:40.920> near<00:03:41.220> as<00:03:41.430> bad<00:03:41.610> as<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:42.000> last

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
it feels nowhere near as bad as the last

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.180 
it feels nowhere near as bad as the last
two<00:03:42.299> offerings<00:03:42.600> that<00:03:42.690> we've<00:03:42.810> looked<00:03:42.959> at<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:44.070> be

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
two offerings that we've looked at to be

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.740 
two offerings that we've looked at to be
honest<00:03:44.370> it's<00:03:44.549> quite<00:03:44.790> a<00:03:44.820> funny<00:03:45.209> quirky<00:03:45.540> little

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
honest it's quite a funny quirky little

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.300 
honest it's quite a funny quirky little
thing<00:03:46.079> and<00:03:46.440> although<00:03:46.799> we're<00:03:46.980> not<00:03:47.070> going<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.250> be

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
thing and although we're not going to be

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.100 
thing and although we're not going to be
putting<00:03:47.519> this<00:03:47.700> in<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:47.970> big<00:03:48.150> box<00:03:48.420> of<00:03:48.570> let<00:03:48.780> go<00:03:48.810> I

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
putting this in the big box of let go I

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.080 
putting this in the big box of let go I
reckon<00:03:49.650> we'll<00:03:49.739> still<00:03:49.980> end<00:03:50.040> up<00:03:50.220> keeping<00:03:50.400> this<00:03:50.790> I

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
reckon we'll still end up keeping this I

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.759 
reckon we'll still end up keeping this I
might<00:03:51.870> even<00:03:52.049> keep<00:03:52.200> an<00:03:52.350> eye<00:03:52.470> out<00:03:52.500> for<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.739> other

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
might even keep an eye out for the other

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.759 
might even keep an eye out for the other
Terminator<00:03:53.340> set<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:53.820> a<00:03:53.880> stargate<00:03:54.269> sg1<00:03:54.780> one<00:03:55.500> as

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
Terminator set and a stargate sg1 one as

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.830 
Terminator set and a stargate sg1 one as
well<00:03:55.980> they're<00:03:56.640> really<00:03:56.820> 99p<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:57.660> the

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
well they're really 99p and the

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.539 
well they're really 99p and the
equivalent<00:03:58.260> of<00:03:58.320> an<00:03:58.440> official<00:03:58.860> Lego<00:03:59.040> set<00:03:59.400> would

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
equivalent of an official Lego set would

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.400 
equivalent of an official Lego set would
probably<00:03:59.850> cost<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.120> about<00:04:00.269> 20<00:04:00.570> 30<00:04:00.750> quid

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
probably cost you about 20 30 quid

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.819 
probably cost you about 20 30 quid
well<00:04:02.190> done<00:04:02.670> best<00:04:03.060> lock<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.750> bestest<00:04:04.260> mumps<00:04:04.620> so

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
well done best lock the bestest mumps so

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.610 
well done best lock the bestest mumps so
far<00:04:05.130> but<00:04:05.400> maybe<00:04:06.150> put<00:04:06.360> a<00:04:06.390> bit<00:04:06.750> more<00:04:06.780> effort<00:04:07.079> into

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
far but maybe put a bit more effort into

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.420 
far but maybe put a bit more effort into
it<00:04:07.709> next<00:04:07.980> time

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430
