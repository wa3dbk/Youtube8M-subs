00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.750
 turn down the voice is you set up the microphone 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.380
 and set up a microphone with this feature 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.540
 records 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.330
 stop recording voice message 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.520

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.510
 move to the crayfish-men you tick but me 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.580
 it is not necessary so start recall 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.530
 imagine windows i don't need this either 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.440
 on 4 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.770
 Other settings Sound Sound speakers 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.170
 it means microphone support here 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.910

 Listen to me reception reception 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.239
 so here we have a voice setting here 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.069
 we put down the key with which we will 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.800
 talk because setting 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.530
 voices it is rather uncomfortable if u 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.110
 you working TV or crying 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.069
 baby this will hear your zaklan 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.410
 sheep there are clearly rarely hear 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.060
 voice tuning is not useful to us 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.910
 hot keys mean here here 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.780
 There is naturally file management. 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.550
 nothing sounds here 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.920
 must be included on building overlays 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.620
 do not touch at all but also to the connection 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.319
 Facebook principle can not need not 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.569
 need it means so i click i have 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.030
 the default is the mouse wheel button 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.430
 Here I am talking 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.500
 you can move yourself to the rooms of the left 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.470
 click to release 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.000
 we move rooms to ourselves further we fill 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.799
 here your profile is a nickname 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.380
 insert mean avatar means if 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:57.620
 we need a photo cut if we can do it 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:01.220
 do information can include or not 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.620
 include member group means here 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.019
 displayed means x to and participant in 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.880
 group means badges here these here 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.079
 This one here is this if I played in 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.480
 any toy 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:15.370
 the other means I probably would have been 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.989
 bonus well and basically expand the window 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.359
 make it such a window for me 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.800
 very convenient means and I just 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.750
 bastard here but in principle everything but 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.690
 Basically, all the announcement you do not do 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.510
 need members of my clan means and 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.840
 the only thing 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.960
 when included in the game you rarely included 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.200
 it was a short lesson where download as 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.810
 on 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:44.110
 and why does he even need you vocals 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.870
 also rarely say management tool 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.760
 clan here we are going because in 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.070
 the world of tanks is not comfortable communication 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.080
 ie someone headphones someone 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.100
 someone else has a microphone 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.590
 not a professional cat 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.660
 professional so that there is no background 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.850
 and that means we are each other more or less 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.210
 heard we use the program 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.940
 calculated it was find the easiest lesson 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.070
 stay with me on the channel 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:12.780
