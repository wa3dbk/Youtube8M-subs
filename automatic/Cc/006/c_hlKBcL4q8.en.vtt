the ball you get it also you get choices

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.180 
the ball you get it also you get choices
of<00:00:33.570> different<00:00:33.600> balls<00:00:34.020> here<00:00:34.320> I'm<00:00:34.829> gonna<00:00:35.040> go

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
of different balls here I'm gonna go

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.209 
of different balls here I'm gonna go
with<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> heavy<00:00:35.579> 16<00:00:36.090> pounder<00:00:36.800> you<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:37.950> flick

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
with the heavy 16 pounder you can flick

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.650 
with the heavy 16 pounder you can flick
the<00:00:38.370> phone<00:00:38.660> and<00:00:40.640> then<00:00:41.640> tilt<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.360> get<00:00:42.510> your

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
the phone and then tilt it to get your

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.610 
the phone and then tilt it to get your
hook<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:44.149> that<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.390> think<00:00:45.629> works<00:00:46.140> actually<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
hook and that I think works actually the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.889 
hook and that I think works actually the
best<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.219> get<00:00:47.399> better<00:00:47.610> speed<00:00:48.420> on<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> ball

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
best you get better speed on the ball

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.119 
best you get better speed on the ball
and<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.160> overall<00:00:50.430> better<00:00:50.700> control<00:00:52.129> it

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
and it's just overall better control it

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.270 
and it's just overall better control it
lets<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.399> choose<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.640> ball<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.090> at<00:00:54.539> every

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
lets you choose a ball and at every

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.410 
lets you choose a ball and at every
in-between<00:00:56.280> every<00:00:56.489> shot<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.910> can<00:00:57.090> turn<00:00:57.239> off

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
in-between every shot you can turn off

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.779 
in-between every shot you can turn off
that<00:00:57.600> as<00:00:57.809> well<00:00:57.989> well<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.949> got<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.190> try<00:00:59.340> flicking

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
that as well well I got to try flicking

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.590 
that as well well I got to try flicking
it<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.149> just<00:01:00.750> don't<00:01:00.989> get<00:01:01.170> as<00:01:01.289> much<00:01:01.440> control<00:01:02.600> it's

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
it I just don't get as much control it's

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.899 
it I just don't get as much control it's
a<00:01:03.660> lot<00:01:03.809> slower<00:01:07.549> especially<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.610> don't<00:01:08.729> get<00:01:08.850> as

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
a lot slower especially you don't get as

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:09.920 
a lot slower especially you don't get as
much<00:01:09.000> control<00:01:09.360> especially<00:01:09.450> when<00:01:09.810> you're

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
much control especially when you're

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.539 
much control especially when you're
holding<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.290> phone<00:01:10.470> behind<00:01:10.680> or<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.280> front<00:01:11.340> of

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
holding a phone behind or in front of

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.050 
holding a phone behind or in front of
the<00:01:11.610> camera<00:01:11.970> as<00:01:12.060> well<00:01:13.340> but<00:01:14.340> let<00:01:14.700> me<00:01:14.790> just<00:01:14.820> try

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the camera as well but let me just try

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.850 
the camera as well but let me just try
to<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.979> then<00:01:16.979> tilt<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.280> phone<00:01:17.549> get<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:17.970> hook

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
to and then tilt the phone get that hook

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.020 
to and then tilt the phone get that hook
