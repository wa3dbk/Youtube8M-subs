fact let me show you a little trick that

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.170 
fact let me show you a little trick that
you<00:01:43.259> can<00:01:43.350> use<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:43.829> any<00:01:44.040> camera<00:01:44.369> Ralph<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
you can use with any camera Ralph the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.910 
you can use with any camera Ralph the
bat<00:01:45.360> see<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.960> little<00:01:45.990> thing<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.710> says

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
bat see the little thing that says

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.280 
bat see the little thing that says
shutter<00:01:47.820> speed<00:01:48.180> if<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.689> raise<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.229> number

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
shutter speed if you raise that number

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.380 
shutter speed if you raise that number
to<00:01:49.829> make<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.009> longer<00:01:50.159> whenever<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.180> take<00:01:51.329> a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
to make it longer whenever you take a

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.780 
to make it longer whenever you take a
picture<00:01:51.689> now<00:01:51.990> your<00:01:52.409> camera<00:01:52.950> will<00:01:53.070> be<00:01:53.159> on<00:01:53.369> for

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
picture now your camera will be on for

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.420 
picture now your camera will be on for
several<00:01:54.119> seconds<00:01:54.689> taking<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.619> picture<00:01:56.009> for

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
several seconds taking a picture for

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.370 
several seconds taking a picture for
that<00:01:56.640> amount<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.240> time<00:01:57.299> now<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.020> really

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
that amount of time now this is really

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.899 
that amount of time now this is really
cool<00:01:58.619> because<00:01:58.799> what<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.219> can<00:01:59.369> do<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.670> take<00:01:59.880> a

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
cool because what you can do is take a

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.819 
cool because what you can do is take a
light<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.630> then<00:02:00.899> move<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.229> around<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.590> frame

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
light and then move it around the frame

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.130 
light and then move it around the frame
and<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.130> can<00:02:02.579> actually<00:02:02.729> record<00:02:03.270> light<00:02:03.840> trails

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
and you can actually record light trails

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.590 
and you can actually record light trails
with<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.770> people<00:02:05.610> if<00:02:05.939> you've<00:02:06.210> heard<00:02:06.479> of

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
with that and people if you've heard of

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.969 
with that and people if you've heard of
this<00:02:06.659> technique<00:02:07.110> before<00:02:07.140> it's<00:02:07.560> called<00:02:07.770> light

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
this technique before it's called light

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.770 
this technique before it's called light
painting<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:08.550> most<00:02:08.789> people<00:02:09.060> think<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.509> oh<00:02:09.690> I

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
painting but most people think that oh I

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.960 
painting but most people think that oh I
just<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.379> just<00:02:10.670> wave<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.700> flashlight<00:02:12.060> around<00:02:12.420> and

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
just I just wave a flashlight around and

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.000 
just I just wave a flashlight around and
it's<00:02:13.150> done<00:02:13.420> well<00:02:13.750> actually<00:02:13.990> it's<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.530> whole<00:02:14.740> art

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
it's done well actually it's a whole art

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.100 
it's done well actually it's a whole art
form<00:02:15.280> in<00:02:15.460> and<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.700> itself<00:02:15.850> because<00:02:16.510> there<00:02:16.840> are

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
form in and of itself because there are

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.740 
form in and of itself because there are
dozens<00:02:17.650> of<00:02:17.920> different<00:02:18.490> types<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.240> lights<00:02:19.570> that
