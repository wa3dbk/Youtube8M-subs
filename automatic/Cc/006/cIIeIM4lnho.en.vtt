00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
bottom no problem about that one of the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.120 
bottom no problem about that one of the
things<00:02:47.750> that<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:48.110> don't<00:02:48.320> like<00:02:48.440> about<00:02:48.500> this<00:02:48.830> case

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
things that I don't like about this case

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.250 
things that I don't like about this case
is<00:02:49.160> that<00:02:49.370> as<00:02:49.970> you<00:02:50.030> see<00:02:50.420> down<00:02:50.720> here<00:02:51.020> at<00:02:51.230> the

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
is that as you see down here at the

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.760 
is that as you see down here at the
bottom<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:52.630> don't<00:02:53.630> know<00:02:53.750> if<00:02:53.990> that's<00:02:54.440> their

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
bottom I don't know if that's their

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.750 
bottom I don't know if that's their
design<00:02:55.190> but<00:02:55.730> it's<00:02:56.030> not<00:02:56.330> straight<00:02:57.460> design<00:02:58.460> as

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
design but it's not straight design as

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.340 
design but it's not straight design as
you<00:02:59.030> see<00:02:59.240> it's<00:02:59.960> not<00:03:00.200> on<00:03:00.650> straight<00:03:01.390> path<00:03:02.390> as

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
you see it's not on straight path as

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.340 
you see it's not on straight path as
opposed<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:04.010> this<00:03:04.160> rebel<00:03:04.460> scholar<00:03:04.880> here<00:03:05.350> where

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
opposed to this rebel scholar here where

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.200 
opposed to this rebel scholar here where
it's<00:03:06.470> straight<00:03:07.220> on<00:03:08.030> design<00:03:09.760> unlike<00:03:10.760> this<00:03:10.970> one

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
it's straight on design unlike this one

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.890 
it's straight on design unlike this one
this<00:03:11.720> is<00:03:11.780> not<00:03:12.110> straight<00:03:12.530> I<00:03:13.630> don't<00:03:14.630> know<00:03:14.720> why

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
this is not straight I don't know why

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.070 
this is not straight I don't know why
maybe<00:03:15.380> that's<00:03:15.650> for<00:03:15.860> their<00:03:16.040> design<00:03:17.080> Griffin

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
maybe that's for their design Griffin

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.890 
maybe that's for their design Griffin

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
to take out because this is plastic on

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.120 
to take out because this is plastic on
plastic<00:04:11.440> it<00:04:12.440> will<00:04:12.620> rub<00:04:12.920> that<00:04:13.190> so<00:04:14.440> I'm<00:04:15.440> quite

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
plastic it will rub that so I'm quite

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.789 
plastic it will rub that so I'm quite
scared<00:04:16.459> that<00:04:17.090> that's<00:04:17.630> gonna<00:04:17.900> get<00:04:18.140> all<00:04:18.380> scuffed

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799
