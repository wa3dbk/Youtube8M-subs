 probability of bash 10% duration the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:08.460
 best of 0.8 1.2 1.6 and two seconds 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.549

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.720
 a chance to make a minister when he 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.509
 to have skill 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.210
 I'll show you guys, he attacks. 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.400
 far and I quote change 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.680
 he goes near attacking attacking well 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.979
 fast and he is known to have that 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.829
 famous for the best sintufs is the one here 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.650
 the squash gain another chance to 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.009
 dabbashi and so he gets with almost 100% 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.110
 chance you're causing this, that is if 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.670
 You stick the guy up and he's going to be very 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.549
 it's hard to leave you 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.560
 but he was also a lot of paper so he 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.930
 it is also very easy to be changed but 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.869
 also if it is formed it will 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.280
 take almost everyone else easy team 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.380
 and if it is in the hands of a good 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.360
 player 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:02:00.240
 let me give you reflect here gave the second 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.140
 since his is that 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.049
 max if he talks like that then he will play the 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.399
 his ax actually changes if he 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.849
 I will register 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:16.239
 It's on the net, you're going to play the ax. 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:22.750
 give 75 seat damage will give a goal too 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:25.659
 three seconds 3.75 4.5 and 5.25 is 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:33.730
 second slow and 30% say or leaves 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:42.000

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:42.000
 the new site to attack 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:49.349
 I feel to use to stay in him he is to stay in 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.349
 around him will change 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:58.409
 he attacks whoever is around him 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:01.810
 and when it changes it will give 125 7575 225 and 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:04.209
 275 damage within 300 radius of it 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:08.230
 the duration of this segment because 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:11.500
 causes blindness of 4 5 6 and 7 seconds 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.079
 probability of failure is 60 is per 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.889
 cent or was going to attack it will 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.239
 give mis will have a chance to give names 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:22.329
 if putting in the range will be that business 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.440
 that he's going to walk here soon 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.440

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:36.400
 Passive is fervor it with every blow is in the 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.620

 of 5 starting with 2 cumulative loads 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.129
 It's two three four and five at the end. 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:57.030
 the accumulation rate is 20 then 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:59.859
 he will win there but accumulation 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.449
 no attack speed itu attack 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.889
 five times the hero who also will not 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.419
 take too long because he has an attack 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:09.319
 very fast 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:16.849
 the data reflects here fresh 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:16.849
 I wrote everything wrong and fresh 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.780
 so here 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.550

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.340
 Truth already have another five times workout 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.760
 Tactical attack rapid charge 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.760

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:37.200
 wait a minute his shot is barretense he 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.690
 troll it will give a good end in itself 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.910
 and everyone read the ally he has a 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.430
 duration of ten seconds 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.850
 it will give an attack speed of 60 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.720
 120 and 180 for everyone for all 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.850
 allies 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.580
 and for him then everyone will be with 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.930
 almost attacks on martius grandson is 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.570
 everyone with attacks asking for the maximum 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.490
 for you to see what v power is like 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:05.280
 I'll show you here now how 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:07.830
 is that he is attacking mille with the 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.990
 bach and with a kick for you to see why 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.110
 he is considered to be known by the 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:16.140
 remains of him 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.530
 However he will attack he is already with 5 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.450
 load use booth 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:28.020
 so it's very difficult and it's just me not 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:31.140
 can actually run type is one of the 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.720
 my favorite is he is very good if I 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.660
 make a bkb for him plus some items 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.729
 damage that county is several items of 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.250
 speed and speed attack what I 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:43.380
 I do not advise because everything he does 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.130
 so I do not need attack speed is 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:49.260
 waste time doing is separating from 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.760
 attac speed of the butterfly will 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.979
 help you stay alive and will also give you 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:59.460
 damage but do not do any of that that 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:00.960
 attack for them only is up to is good 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.000
 also do this type that will attack 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.950
 very fast also critical because 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.010
 attacks very fast beige which is one of the 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.919
 his main items and other items 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.680
 of tic damage and make it run more 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:16.139
 giving slow and sure everything I do against 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.280
 the big enemy troll and not wide of 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.440
 no way 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.710
