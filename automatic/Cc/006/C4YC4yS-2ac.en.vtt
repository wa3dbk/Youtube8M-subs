00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
and crap like I what I gotta wonder how

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.289 
and crap like I what I gotta wonder how
many<00:04:20.580> there<00:04:20.760> are<00:04:20.880> now

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
many there are now

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.820 
many there are now
on<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.449> game<00:04:21.690> like<00:04:21.900> in<00:04:22.049> total<00:04:22.440> because<00:04:22.590> I<00:04:22.620> mean

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
on the game like in total because I mean

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.159 
on the game like in total because I mean
they're<00:04:22.919> like<00:04:23.009> what<00:04:23.159> 500k<00:04:23.849> it's<00:04:24.060> like<00:04:24.180> 1.5<00:04:24.389> mil

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
they're like what 500k it's like 1.5 mil

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.260 
they're like what 500k it's like 1.5 mil
each<00:04:25.289> the<00:04:25.560> red<00:04:25.710> 1i<00:04:25.860> think<00:04:25.949> i'm<00:04:26.520> not<00:04:26.669> sure<00:04:27.030> if

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
each the red 1i think i'm not sure if

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.820 
each the red 1i think i'm not sure if
like<00:04:27.509> the<00:04:27.810> reason<00:04:28.139> the<00:04:28.229> red<00:04:28.379> ones<00:04:28.590> more

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
like the reason the red ones more

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.700 
like the reason the red ones more
expensive<00:04:29.340> is<00:04:29.550> because<00:04:30.169> they're<00:04:31.169> more<00:04:31.409> rare

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
expensive is because they're more rare

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.619 
expensive is because they're more rare
or<00:04:32.039> just<00:04:32.460> because<00:04:32.819> you<00:04:33.300> know<00:04:33.419> we're<00:04:33.599> just

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:33.629 
or just because you know we're just

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:35.990 
or just because you know we're just
normal<00:04:34.199> we<00:04:34.620> use<00:04:34.949> for<00:04:35.099> having<00:04:35.400> red<00:04:35.580> is<00:04:35.729> the<00:04:35.759> most

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
normal we use for having red is the most

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.240 
normal we use for having red is the most
expensive<00:04:36.240> and<00:04:36.810> green<00:04:37.349> and<00:04:37.560> then<00:04:37.710> blue<00:04:38.039> and

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
expensive and green and then blue and

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.950
