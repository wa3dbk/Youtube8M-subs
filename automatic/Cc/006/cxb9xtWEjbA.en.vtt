00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.700
 or they solved it we're going to make a 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.519
 very simple recipe with the puree of the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.900
 indecove brand this recipe is based 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.610
 in simplicity and in 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.810
 use of the products that are 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.730
 they usually have one in one 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.309
 housing in this case we have opted for 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.619
 catch a little bit of tuna to make 

00:00:23.309 --> 00:00:28.489
 the croquettes put usual flour 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.489
 egg and breadcrumbs 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.650
 we take a little 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.070
 of mashed potatoes 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.000
 we put it in a bowl 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.800
 and we mix it with in this case tuna 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.510
 but what is clear is that it can be 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.040
 Tuna can be a bit of ham 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.470
 york can be a bit of ham 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.329
 Iberian or a bit of a chicken leg 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.120
 that has been left over from a previous meal 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.000
 then the idea is to be more would do well 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.920
 the product so that a dough remains 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.920
 firm I will proceed and masters 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.259
 to make croquettes the croquette 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.770
 it would be like always then 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.770
 we would beat an egg 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.920
 Y 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.270
 and the process was usual 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.799
 we would choose a little bit of dough with two 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.799
 spoons be more would be fine 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.280
 we do not introduce in flour 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.110
 later in the egg 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.740
 and finally the bread crumbs 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.560
 then already the usual process of more 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.560
 of kneading a croquette 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.350
 and they would be like this we repeat the process the 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.350
 times that are necessary of course 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.569
 Once the croquettes are ready 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.370
 process and simple the only thing that there is 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.469
 make them and fry in very hot oil 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.000
 I started to smoke white with 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:32.079
 warm stretches this guarantees us that 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.079
 the croquette would not break 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 one 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.770
 do not
