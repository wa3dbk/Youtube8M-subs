00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
it's really easy it comes with three

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:49.280 
it's really easy it comes with three
size<00:01:39.180> disks<00:01:47.540> comes<00:01:48.540> with<00:01:48.690> three<00:01:48.960> different

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
size disks comes with three different

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.639 
size disks comes with three different
size<00:01:49.470> disks<00:01:50.300> this<00:01:51.300> is<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.659> small<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
size disks this is like small and the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.930

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
medium and then the large one so I think

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.910 
medium and then the large one so I think
the<00:01:56.940> large<00:01:57.180> one<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.690> suitable<00:01:58.170> for<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.710> if

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
the large one is suitable for like if

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.370 
the large one is suitable for like if
you're<00:01:59.070> gonna<00:01:59.159> do<00:01:59.399> your<00:01:59.550> toes<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:01.050> haven't
