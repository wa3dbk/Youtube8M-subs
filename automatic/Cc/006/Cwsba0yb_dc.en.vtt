00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.820
 on the subject that I had already promised 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.440
 makes two past videoblogs and it's how 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.469
 clear the skin easily and 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.180
 progressive and above all economic as well 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.830
 we're going to it when I referred to a 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.600
 easy and simple trick to clarify the 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.990
 skin of the face really tell me about 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.689
 constant easy and simple to make 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.339
 we only need lemons and cotton 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.659
 If you want to show the brand of 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.640
 cottons because I do not want to give 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.860
 advertising this brand punctually but 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.680
 I like it and the cotton that udinese 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.270
 small flakes in small specks 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.610
 the people in jericho and easy to 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.590
 use this mixture is very easy to 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.330
 do guys only is to extract the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.280
 lemon juice in a bowl and 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.739
 combine it with a little water and then 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.260
 submerge one of the fields in this 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.090
 mix and pass it through the area 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.340
 affected towards your whole face be a 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.350
 punctual person include the neck and 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.820
 others because you want to clarify the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.100
 face but you also want to clarify the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.750
 neck that also usually burns 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.729
 much tans a lot with the sun 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.530
 once you apply the lemon juice in 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.540
 the face is important to let dry 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.759
 the mixture in a shady place in a 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.240
 dark place where there is no lightning 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.070
 of the sun because it is well known that the sun 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.720
 in combination with the lemon stain the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.280
 skin and well that's precisely what 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.280
 we want to avoid spots and other 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.840
 ah 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.120
 really when industrial is 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.160
 mix with lemon juice I prefer 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.050
 put a small towel with water 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.840
 hot alone on my face 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.580
 this opens the pores and makes the juice 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.320
 of lemon penetrate much more on the 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.530
 skin the effect is much faster 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.000
 much more cash is very important 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.410
 guys that know that if they cheer up 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.180
 do this treatment with the juice of 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.340
 lemon the results are seen around 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.500
 the third or fourth week is to say that 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.270
 take care of a lot of patience and a lot 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.060
 discipline and use the mask 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.800
 every day since we are talking 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.150
 of lemon from lemon juice that can 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.100
 become a pretty ingredient 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.540
 strong for the skin it is important that in 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.040
 the skin you do not have any kind of 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.350
 wound no kind of open wound 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.820
 especially acne because lemon 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.890
 what he's going to do is irritate 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.840
 very much more the skin will hurt the 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.150
 wounds that you have open and good you 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.010
 keep it is a little bit experience 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.680
 pleasant ten is very important that 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.910
 you have the skin in perfect condition and for 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.040
 last talking about this mask 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.480
 to lighten the skin with lemon is very 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.760
 very important, I think it's one of the 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.680
 most important steps guys 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.959
 and it is the front use and solar all 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.340
 days so it's raining or whatever 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.959
 the day is cloudy, so the day 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.909
 it's sunny so it's not very 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.010
 sunny every day in any 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.560
 weather condition must be used 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.900
 friend explained that uv rays see the 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.329
 sun are always present in the 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.430
 environment whether the rainy day or 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.230
 the day is cloudy therefore always 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.370
 It is very important to use it 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.019
 I use the dawn probe mark 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.420
 I know that this brand especially 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.489
 specialized for when we go to the 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.769
 beach when we go to the pool but 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.540
 in truth it is the only formula that serves 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.860
 for my skin that if everything really a 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:39.010
 protective cover and only beech 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.480
 I use the solar factor 50 although I think 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.610
 that there are solar factors up to 100 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.290
 possible or 50 because the sky the 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.060
 firm it seems that the resistances of is 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.629
 too thick and leave the skin 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.700
 too greasy the 50 is ideal for me 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.799
 and I do not know what works for me 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.390
 perfectly 50 I wanted to show you 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.459
 the showdown because it's really a 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.420
 formula that works a lot and maybe 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.420
 also solve to you
