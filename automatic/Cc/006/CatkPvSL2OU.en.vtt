build<00:04:36.760> up<00:04:36.910> embers<00:04:37.330> and<00:04:37.570> you<00:04:37.750> can<00:04:37.900> also<00:04:38.050> build

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
build up embers and you can also build

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.650 
build up embers and you can also build
up<00:04:38.440> proxy<00:04:38.980> it<00:04:39.130> has<00:04:39.280> all<00:04:39.460> kinds<00:04:39.910> of<00:04:39.940> advantages

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
up proxy it has all kinds of advantages

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.080 
up proxy it has all kinds of advantages
being<00:04:41.200> able<00:04:41.380> to<00:04:41.560> summon<00:04:41.890> a<00:04:42.100> low-level<00:04:42.550> hostile

mob<00:04:43.300> in<00:04:43.480> that<00:04:43.600> situation<00:04:44.230> which<00:04:44.410> is<00:04:44.440> very

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
mob in that situation which is very

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.200 
mob in that situation which is very
invulnerable<00:04:45.280> it's<00:04:45.640> basically<00:04:46.030> like

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
invulnerable it's basically like

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.620 
invulnerable it's basically like
summoning<00:04:46.750> a<00:04:46.840> training<00:04:47.230> dummy<00:04:47.850> to<00:04:48.850> a<00:04:49.240> mob

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 
and I'm just building up stacks the

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.200 
and I'm just building up stacks the
interesting<00:05:03.050> thing<00:05:03.349> with<00:05:03.650> this<00:05:03.830> is<00:05:04.210> doesn't
