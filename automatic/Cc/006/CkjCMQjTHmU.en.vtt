00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.340
 I bring you another 1000 that this ticket is 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.040
 very interesting since as you can see 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.560
 the names are changing the color of 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.480
 the names of the applications in this 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.859
 case they are changing to many colors 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.810
 but you can configure what 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.179
 colors want them to change this tweet 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.070
 you can customize it a lot and the truth is 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.539
 very easy to do it is not to install it 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.310
 in settings you will find a new 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.289
 option that is here maybe there is color 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.119
 isolating always has to be activated 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.430
 once you have it, ask for a spring 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.500
 and here you can change the options here 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.270
 for example I have light colors was for 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.750
 that they were changing for example 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.910
 Now if you see it, everything is different 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.220
 program color change but so what 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.470
 active are going to be changing as 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.360
 you can see then if what 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.010
 deactivated is not going to be changing here 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.540
 we can change the style so that 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.360
 change for example if I put here 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.400
 changing or they will change all at the same 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.770
 time to the same color and unified 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.450
 then there you can choose the 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.160
 that you like more here we have other 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.869
 societies so that we can know the 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.300
 colors that we want to see the most 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.330
 then there you can go out alone 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.950
 here logically it would be the same but if 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.080
 we remove the green then 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.120
 we would remove a color scale that 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.500
 color we would miss here like we have 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.900
 some options for the dock if 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.940
 we want to customize not to make them look 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.320
 Different colors can be done 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.910
 because it does not work for me but it can 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.380
 that you and it works for you is supposed to 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.730
 same should be changing color 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.190
 in this case I have it blank 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.720
 because I have all activated and but there 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.640
 you can see what the 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.440
 options that work for them and we have 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.210
 Options to change the size and 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.250
 typeface as you can see here we 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.930
 some letter options appear and 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.000
 here you could select the one 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.040
 want and also here they could modify 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.180
 the size to install only us 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.190
 we have to go so once you 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.130

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.020

 handsome that is a jacques rivette puntocom 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.350
