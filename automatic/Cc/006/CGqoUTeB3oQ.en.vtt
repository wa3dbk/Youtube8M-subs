00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.000
 so the days of him and another go by 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.889
 Maybe you remember your case in 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.410
 August of last year a transformer 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.930
 In San Ramon exploded pouring on the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.980
 oil living and changing your life for 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.980
 always in just seconds 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.039
 work of teaching some little girl 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.349
 well that account I do not remember very well 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.390
 without me pushing them to the lady with the 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.870
 little boy and that's why I shut up to me the 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.300
 Transformer oil I turned on 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.600
 calls 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.399
 and I ran like 25 meters to throw myself to the 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.700
 street to go around to try 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.800
 pay me 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.020
 have been seven times of multiple 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.180
 so many operations that the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.220
 count and countless hours of 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.590
 therapy to recover some mobility 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:00.090
 especially in his arms and hands of god 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.460
 I can not stand it anymore or they moved me because 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.520
 the pain was exaggerated and I can eat 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.710
 he just says he no longer has alone and put it 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.820
 walk alone are already several things that 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.979
 I can do for myself, let's say 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.000
 the most admirable thing throughout all this 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.660
 process has been optimism 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.380
 in 17 years that has impressed doctors 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.380
 and therapists 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.600
 definitely an example that despite 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.570
 of adversity and some 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.460
 complications always arrives with attitude 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.830
 positive and it always goes forward and 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.300
 he always wants more 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.040
 his mother tells me that what most 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.380
 They ask if they plan to sue the 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.240
 been after this accident but that's not 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.400
 is in your priorities at the moment 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.170
 many people tell us clearly a demand 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.330
 millionaire you look good 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.270
 economically we are not family 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.370
 We are a simple family of 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.000
 sant ramon i 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.680
 that for us this I know sincerely 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.260
 at least I would not staff from 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.950
 better to have him as he was to have 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:10.160
 millions in the stock market but we 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.880
 demand we have not thought as I say 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.920
 have covered what are the policies we 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.210
 They have helped with travel expenses but more for 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.420
 can I come every day I do not know what 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.400
 they see after almost four months of 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.220
 training they will give you in these 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.390
 days the hospital's departure from the trauma 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.740
 will return to your home in sant ramon and 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.990
 do you have plans to take 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.530
 while he works on recovering his total 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.530
 independence
