00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.250
"I'm Samir Zaidi, I'm a MD/PhD student, now
in my fifth year and finishing my third year

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.669
in Doctor Lipton's lab.

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:29.340
My parents were born in India, went to med
school in India and then moved to the U.K.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.030
So I was born in London, England along with
my sister, and I lived my first 7 years of

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.580
life in London.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.460
The thing that I was most fond of in London
is that I got to grow up with my grand parents

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.809
and as a kid, I remember I was really fascinated
that my grand father had type 2 diabetes,

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.720
and I would follow him around and try to help
him figure out his blood sugar and even administer

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.940
his insulin.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:03.189
And that I think I kind of had this kind of
curiosity behind why he has that disease and

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:06.110
no one else in my immediate family does.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.430
And it was really interesting to look at the
factors that cause disease at a early age

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.050
or even spark that curiosity.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.160
From London, my family and I moved to New
York where my parents are still there, so

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:27.430
my mom's a physician who works at the V.A
hospital in the Bronx, and my dad is a MD/PhD

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.730
who works at Mt. Sinai.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.490
There's two things that can happen when you
have parents that are doctors.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.590
You can either see what they do and go totally
in a different path, or you can kind of follow

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.650
their trajectory.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.510
And I really, so I went to college at MIT
and there I tried to test the waters.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.950
But the thing that was most gratifying, for
me at least, was working with a professor

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.950
there, Rudolf Jaenisch, who worked on stem
cells, and realizing there the potential of

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.950
stem cells.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.730
So I really ended up liking it, and that's
what lead me to the MD/PhD track.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:10.289
So my project since I've come in has been
to figure out why one percent of live births

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.540
result in congenital heart disease.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.659
So we've taken a thousand cases and a thousand
controls of both parents and their kid and

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.189
seen what's present in the kid.

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:27.769
And we've been able to stratify a set of genes
that would likely explain approximately 10

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.099
percent of congenital heart disease.

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.769
So this is the main area of the Lipton laboratory.

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:37.090
Can just walk through here.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.769
This is where a lot of the wet lab experiments
take place, we have a number of benches that

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.010
individuals use.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.909
Wet lab experiments are where you're a little
bit working hands on, you're doing cell cultures,

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:57.079
you're working with animal models, compared
to dry lab part of our lab which is more computational.

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:04.579
So in here are over 20 years of DNA that's
been collected by Dr. Lipton and the members

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:05.689
of his lab.

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.489
A lot of it has been focused initially on
hypertension and since moved to a lot of different

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.250
diseases such as cardio-vascular disease and
also cancer.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.260
We can take people's DNA and sequence their
entire coding regions, and see what's different

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.269
from the reference genome.

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.249
This has given us a lot of insight in to what
mutations cause human disease.

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:37.549
My favorite part of my job is working on new
and exciting questions, and also discussing

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.219
data with people like Dr. Lipton.

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:49.109
They've been in science for over 30 years
but they're still very excited about new data,

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:55.909
and just the way they analyze the data and
look at the broad perspective of it is very

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:56.510
exciting."
