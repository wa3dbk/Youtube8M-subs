and it captures shivers so beautifully

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.270 
and it captures shivers so beautifully
because<00:05:13.350> when<00:05:13.500> I<00:05:13.560> think<00:05:13.770> of<00:05:13.860> it<00:05:13.979> when<00:05:14.070> I<00:05:14.130> look

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
because when I think of it when I look

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.680 
because when I think of it when I look
at<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.430> cover<00:05:14.610> I<00:05:14.729> think<00:05:15.000> of<00:05:17.030> like<00:05:18.030> a<00:05:18.090> world<00:05:18.450> of

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
at the cover I think of like a world of

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.810 
at the cover I think of like a world of
play<00:05:19.250> where<00:05:20.250> anything<00:05:20.639> is<00:05:20.729> possible

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
play where anything is possible

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.510 
play where anything is possible
everything<00:05:21.630> is<00:05:21.780> made<00:05:21.930> out<00:05:22.110> of<00:05:22.139> paper<00:05:22.370> so<00:05:23.370> go

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
everything is made out of paper so go

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.029 
everything is made out of paper so go
into<00:05:23.789> the<00:05:23.970> inner<00:05:24.810> workings<00:05:24.990> of<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:25.680> wearable

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
into the inner workings of the wearable

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.850 
into the inner workings of the wearable
of<00:05:26.310> how<00:05:26.850> this<00:05:27.210> works<00:05:27.539> how<00:05:27.900> the<00:05:28.260> humans<00:05:28.650> turn

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
of how this works how the humans turn

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.710 
of how this works how the humans turn
into<00:05:29.070> wolves<00:05:29.160> in<00:05:29.340> the<00:05:29.430> winter<00:05:29.729> it<00:05:29.940> doesn't

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
into wolves in the winter it doesn't

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.529 
into wolves in the winter it doesn't
there's<00:05:31.430> some<00:05:32.430> debate<00:05:33.150> between<00:05:33.389> the

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
there's some debate between the

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:35.080 
there's some debate between the
characters<00:05:33.720> whether<00:05:34.110> it's<00:05:34.289> science<00:05:34.650> or<00:05:34.800> magic

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
characters whether it's science or magic

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.210 
characters whether it's science or magic
but<00:05:36.090> it's<00:05:36.330> never<00:05:36.960> revealed<00:05:37.470> and<00:05:37.830> I<00:05:38.039> think

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
but it's never revealed and I think

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.070 
but it's never revealed and I think
that's<00:05:38.400> so<00:05:38.850> beautiful<00:05:39.120> because<00:05:39.510> that's<00:05:39.960> not

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
that's so beautiful because that's not

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.909 
that's so beautiful because that's not
something<00:05:40.880> that's<00:05:42.169> any<00:05:43.169> reader<00:05:43.590> should<00:05:43.830> be

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 
something that's any reader should be

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.730 
something that's any reader should be
focusing<00:05:44.340> on<00:05:44.490> really<00:05:44.820> in<00:05:44.940> my<00:05:45.030> opinion<00:05:45.060> is

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
focusing on really in my opinion is

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
focusing on really in my opinion is
scientific<00:05:46.740> how<00:05:46.830> does<00:05:47.010> it<00:05:47.130> work<00:05:47.280> how<00:05:47.490> does<00:05:47.550> it

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
scientific how does it work how does it

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.830 
scientific how does it work how does it
work<00:05:49.310> it's<00:05:50.310> just<00:05:50.700> amazing<00:05:51.000> to<00:05:51.210> be<00:05:51.539> able<00:05:51.600> to

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
work it's just amazing to be able to

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.830 
work it's just amazing to be able to
embrace<00:05:52.729> the<00:05:53.729> mystery<00:05:54.120> of<00:05:54.240> this<00:05:54.479> because<00:05:54.690> the

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
embrace the mystery of this because the

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.640 
embrace the mystery of this because the
mystery<00:05:55.229> is<00:05:55.410> often<00:05:55.860> more<00:05:56.190> beautiful<00:05:56.729> than<00:05:57.650> the

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
mystery is often more beautiful than the

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.000 
mystery is often more beautiful than the
revelation<00:05:59.400> of<00:05:59.520> the<00:05:59.580> truth<00:06:00.030> you<00:06:00.479> know<00:06:01.010> there's

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
revelation of the truth you know there's

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.529 
revelation of the truth you know there's
nothing<00:06:02.190> more<00:06:02.520> beautiful<00:06:02.669> than<00:06:03.030> the<00:06:03.180> unknown

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
nothing more beautiful than the unknown

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:05.860 
nothing more beautiful than the unknown
