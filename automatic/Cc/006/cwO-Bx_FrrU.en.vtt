00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:24.579
 equipment for the start of the tournament 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.899

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:28.149
 defining the campus for 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:30.309
 provincial competition the last 15 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:32.710
 days like we went and without friendly mode 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:34.000
 with cane well because it was also the 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.310
 first match today that brings out a 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.290
 tactical conclusion 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.860
 and really if we're going to get to the first 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.510
 Championship game fairly 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.970
 lack of pace of matches and these 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.530
 matches were served and good and it 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.030
 they keep bringing players closer I can 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.350
 say that I still do not know what the 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.300
 team that will open the weekend 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.430
 that comes' israel moncayo hopes that the 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.770
 albo team fits in the best way 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.610
 and be able to be protagonists in this 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.540
 intense contest and the group was assembled 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.690
 we have been working there for more than a month and 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.830
 medium and happy and we have just been a good 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.510
 match against a gualaceo and now 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.830
 prepare the footwear with salt against a 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.450
 backrest with right foot as 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.400
 find the basin league to face 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.510
 this provincial well the leaders I think 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.150
 that is the beginning they saw a body 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.590
 technical capable as the teacher fought and little 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.420
 little with the people of the thing excel 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.890
 five choirs two weeks already I know if 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.900
 make up the group and now we will think 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.700
 in the strategy of the Eastern team of 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.160
 azuay indicated that it has served much 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.650
 this type of collations where they will be polished 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.310
 details to boot with right foot 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.780
 this provincial journey 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.549
 for us I think it's even 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.560
 positive that we have lost since 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.470
 several points of view because with that 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.740
 we can 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.450
 bare many flaws that we have and 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.280
 we hope that this is what will 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.830
 serve that we have an important income 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.720
 and in the competitive period itself 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.450
 Professor maybe you are already sketching 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.310
 the team that will be presented in each 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.130
 one of the two collates officially 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.780
 that's how we have the base team that was left 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.690
 of the previous year and to that base team 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.670
 we are trying to cover some 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.500
 posts and Juan Jose Moscoso assured that 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.929
 the goal is to consolidate the objectives that 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.510
 are traced as a team if it really is 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.700
 something important his parties of 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.709
 friendly and as it is said positively 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.600
 for it's going to be a very championship 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.640
 hard-fought and that work will get the 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.000
 mood and the atmosphere of the gualaceo yes well 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.860
 well there are great players a lot 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.810
 experience and the fight is going to be very hard 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.610
 that can not be then 11 andrés
