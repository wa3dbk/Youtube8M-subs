00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
thinking behind that yeah I've been

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.180 
thinking behind that yeah I've been
doing<00:00:13.139> it<00:00:13.230> for<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.440> last<00:00:13.650> few<00:00:13.830> years<00:00:13.889> now

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
doing it for the last few years now

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.790 
doing it for the last few years now
probably<00:00:14.549> for<00:00:15.150> nine<00:00:15.809> ten<00:00:16.109> years<00:00:16.139> now<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.619> just

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
probably for nine ten years now I just

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.269 
probably for nine ten years now I just
just<00:00:17.310> think<00:00:18.199> the<00:00:19.199> conditions<00:00:19.680> in<00:00:19.800> January

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
just think the conditions in January

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.519 
just think the conditions in January
it's<00:00:20.369> quite<00:00:20.550> cold<00:00:21.080> and<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.230> environment

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
it's quite cold and the environment

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.650 
it's quite cold and the environment
train<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.580> get<00:00:23.670> some<00:00:23.880> really<00:00:24.090> good<00:00:24.240> quality

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
train and get some really good quality

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.660 
train and get some really good quality
training<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.560> with<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.980> players<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.430> quite

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
training in with the players is quite

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.870 
training in with the players is quite
difficult<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.480> take<00:00:28.230> them<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.710> somewhere<00:00:29.279> you

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
difficult so take them to somewhere you

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.279 
difficult so take them to somewhere you
know<00:00:30.000> sort<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.240> mid-january<00:00:30.660> where<00:00:31.199> the

twice a day really condensed really

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.090 
twice a day really condensed really
quite<00:00:47.789> demanding<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.410> conditions<00:00:49.950> are
