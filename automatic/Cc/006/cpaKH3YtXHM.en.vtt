00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.460
 hello everyone with you andrew goats and in 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.610
 In this video tutorial I'll show you how 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.870
 configure every 30 using panels 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.330
 gray quick settings 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.210
 this is a new tool which 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.199
 developers have added a range version on with 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.029
 3 so if you have set to 3d max 3 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.910
 do you have veritas here 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.810
 such is the menu where we look for the very button 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.420
 quick settings and click on it if 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.520
 you faith and not set as render as 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.520
 the main scene grabber to wear and 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.399
 will prompt you to restore it as 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.030
 the main render we click yes and we 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.370
 a window opens with four presets 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.710
 that is, hello settings for different 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.890
 types of prices for exterior and interior for 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.899
 video effects and studio settings in 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.719
 our case is the interior accordingly 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.930
 we click on the interior and we immediately 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.520
 settings become normal but 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.290
 like they should be in the interior 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.390
 and now we can try from wounds 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.100
 gives our scene only I have included 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.520
 render animation but i will switch to 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.520
 single 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.549
 to render from only one frame and 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.549
 we'll see 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.969
 Now we see that the render goes and 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:39.600
 goes fast enough and in sufficient 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.890
 I personally do not see any noise 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.850
 the surfaces are not glossy here therefore 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.590
 they shouldn't be here and the render goes 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.390
 fast enough that is literally 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:58.090
 a few minutes to 10 minutes the whole picture 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.709
 here it is now rendered if you if u 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.390
 for some reason you are not happy 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:04.420
 render quality you basically can 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.759
 then tweak these settings and from 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.860
 renders the first parameter again 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.530
 responsible for global quality 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.720
 lighting is the second parameter for quality 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:19.150
 pictures in general and third for quality 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:23.040
 anti scarlet zynga that is for the quality here 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.420
 There are such moments of these here 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.450
 now in detail 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.430
 explanations of what it is I will not who 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.480
 knows that knows who does not know but for now 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:37.750
 you can not bother here actually 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.100
 such there are presets when setting up in viri 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.500
 30 and all novice visualizers I 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.519
 I advise you not to bother with in-depth 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.870
 studying vereya 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.790
 especially at the initial stage 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.889
 use these settings here 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.489
 Thank you for your attention was Andrei 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:54.420
 goats 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.420
