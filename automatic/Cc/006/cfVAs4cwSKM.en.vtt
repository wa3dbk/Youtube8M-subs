line<00:00:37.040> right<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:40.050> highest<00:00:40.469> point<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:41.010> where

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
line right to the highest point of where

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.770 
line right to the highest point of where
it's<00:00:41.280> rounded<00:00:41.760> which<00:00:41.910> will<00:00:42.059> become<00:00:42.390> your<00:00:42.570> arch

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
this is the very key step in this

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.490 
this is the very key step in this
technique<00:00:47.329> moving<00:00:48.329> from<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.809> line<00:00:49.050> I'll<00:00:49.350> do

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
technique moving from that line I'll do

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.520 
technique moving from that line I'll do
go<00:00:49.649> upwards<00:00:50.160> towards<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.550> top<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> brow
