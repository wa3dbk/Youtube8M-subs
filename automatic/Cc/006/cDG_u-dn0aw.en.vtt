00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.690 
of that particular pocket I'll put
everything<00:02:53.660> back<00:02:53.989> in<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:58.520> you<00:02:59.300> can<00:02:59.480> see<00:02:59.720> there

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
everything back in and you can see there

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.850 
everything back in and you can see there
is<00:03:01.700> plenty<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.630> room<00:03:02.870> left<00:03:03.230> for<00:03:03.470> other<00:03:03.620> things

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
is plenty of room left for other things

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.290 
is plenty of room left for other things
but<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.070> don't<00:03:04.340> want<00:03:04.550> it<00:03:04.610> to<00:03:04.730> get<00:03:04.850> too<00:03:05.120> bulky

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
but I don't want it to get too bulky

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.680 
but I don't want it to get too bulky
because<00:03:05.930> then<00:03:06.739> it<00:03:07.130> won't<00:03:07.340> have<00:03:07.610> the<00:03:07.940> nice<00:03:08.330> look

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
because then it won't have the nice look

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.370 
because then it won't have the nice look
that<00:03:08.900> it<00:03:09.019> has<00:03:09.550> with<00:03:10.550> these<00:03:10.910> items<00:03:11.180> so<00:03:11.900> that's<00:03:12.290> a

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
that it has with these items so that's a
