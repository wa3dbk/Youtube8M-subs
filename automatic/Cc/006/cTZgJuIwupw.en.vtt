00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.859
 welcome techno android friends 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:19.740
 today I'll show you something a little 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.910
 particular ie how to make one 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.330
 microsim from a normal sim I have here 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.029
 two sim that does not use more use 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.630
 these to do to show you how 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:36.870
 make a micro 5 before you go 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.690
 forward I show them that they work in this 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.130
 old phone coloring samsung la 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.970
 micro SIM 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:48.120
 if you can actually see, let's do one 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:52.770
 what do you really see because the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.270
 call to 119 the mind keep in mind 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.340
 that an old man 's cell phone 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.340
 so it's not really the best like 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:07.700
 we are up is worth like sound 119 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.530
 we close because I do say that 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.560
 inside we have the microsim 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:24.079
 clearly in the employer 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:29.310
 here it is we can get out of the way 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:31.020
 in this phone then to realize 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.429
 the microsim of what we need 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.009
 we first need this is the 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:39.710
 micro SIM 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:44.819
 we can also put aside 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:47.819
 of the adapter the adapter is a part 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:50.310
 fundamental to realize the micro sim 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.780
 obviously in the sim however I will 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.549
 I recommend to use if you have them 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.549
 sims and old ones to do a test 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.060
 but old phone card a 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.789
 paper sheet any paper 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.500
 take the shape from the micro sim 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.960
 a first to outline 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.539
 the geometry a scissor I use this is 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.990
 the one for electricians' work a 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.500
 cutter and a file a file for 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.470
 proceed 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.940
 obviously you have to do everything with a lot 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.360
 much caution 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.540
 the first thing to do is take the 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.490
 micro SIM 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.490
 the adapter that has in the corners 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:42.360
 indeed this is how it is in the corners at the edges 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.239
 obviously because you have to support the 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.459
 micro SIM 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:55.140
 so first thing we go to 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:56.880
 make a saab the silhouette with one 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.730
 pen with pencil of course now 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.350
 this make writes caught on the fly 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.050
 the one I had maybe a better one 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.270
 pencil in short, or the shape with 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.170
 this shape then you can go to 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:13.260
 place it on the sim and then 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.340
 make the cut 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:22.200
 I advise you to be accomplished 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.620
 first of all, the grooves with the cutter 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.390
 top on the sim 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.690
 in this way so as to have 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.690
 guidelines 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.950
 now I do everything very quickly 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.049
 obviously you have to be a lot 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.970
 beware of all you have to do 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.820
 I will now go to cut directly 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.670
 what I advise you to ask 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.730
 attention is this then only two 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.140
 first of all points to achieve the 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.090
 micro sim but you have to cut 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:59.880
 completely longer sides 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.840
 there is this and this goes completely 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.819
 from the data to the edge of the 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.370
 of the chip clearly in this operation 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.370
 you must pay the utmost attention 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.090
 don't worry if I'm wrong that much 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:22.550
 this nasim that I don't use more or less 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:25.010
 so here is this for example is already the 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.990
 similarly, first cut is made from 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.880
 this part what according to this is 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.669
 therefore the first suggestion is to stay a lot 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.770
 be careful and don't worry too much about 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.900
 leave some edges because then precisely 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.880
 we will use the file to go to them 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.860
 smooth using maybe even 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.830
 precisely the shape we have made 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:46.100
 so you don't put your finger on the chip 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:49.220
 to ruin it the second piece of advice 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:52.430
 does concern in ten shorter edges e 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.410
 the upper one than the lower one in 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.970
 this case I advise you not to go to 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.530
 cut in particular in the part 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:02.570
 top go to cut too much 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.380
 in the chip area but to leave a 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:09.050
 certain space so you can then 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.120
 gradually adjust the head sim 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.460
 up to then to cut 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.190
 gradually even then perhaps helping you with 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:25.280
 the cutter until perfectly shaped 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:27.110
 the sim in the adapter now 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.710
 I interrupt I make some cuts and 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:36.320
 we continue later then I did the 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:37.849
 silhouette of with the phone card 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.910
 indeed I recommend you to use 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:44.479
 the inclined burgundy as I now have it 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:46.690
 cut into shorter parts however than of 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:49.520
 use the inclined bordeaux of the 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.470
 of the phone card or if you don't have 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:55.610
 a new ritual, a card in short by 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:57.169
 use that of the film for 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.770
 realize the shape once realized 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:03.650
 as performed a series of cuts on the 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.020
 sim go to just use this 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:12.220
 shape for then 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:17.330
 of competitions and to obtain the form of 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:22.729
 of the model we say so and go to 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:25.699
 then realize this in the end 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:30.139
 of the whole sim as we see remains 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:32.389
 practically only the chip is a small one 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:35.150
 top edge at the top in the 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:37.490
 lower part with that is all 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.870
 a greeting to all the friends I quarrel with 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.870
