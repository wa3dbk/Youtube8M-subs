 swim 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:28.410
 Best regards to all 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.680
 this is a tutorial on how to hack ps3 i have tried several methods p 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.470
 not here I will detail the best system because you do not lose the blu-ray nor 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.880
 the guarantee and it is totally reversible 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.600
 that is to say 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.900
 if for whatever your ps3 is not working as it should be, you can leave it such and 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.130
 as it was before the modification process 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.360
 Well then I will detail the tools we need 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.190
 not the basics we need a ps3 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.210
 a bottle of glue imid if possible 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.430
 4 round-nose scissors so as not to damage the equipment when handling it 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.900
 5 a normal plastic bag this will be needed at the end of the process 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.510
 ok now let's explain the first step 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.500
 with the ps3 completely unplugged and without any connected cable we look for the face 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.520
 front right where it puts playstation 3 when we have it we take the boat from 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.670
 glue and we throw half a pot just above the letters the other half what 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.650
 we save because we will need later 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.390
 done this we go to step two while the glue is drying we use 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.790
 our internet connection and very quickly we search in the 'google' 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.040
 images of pirates to later print them for example since sparrow 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.640
 black beard zp or captain hook among others 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.140
 Once printed the one that we like we take our scissors and cut 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.130
 the edges of the image and quickly put it on the glue so that 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.310
 go dry 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.310
 and we have our modified ps3 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.610
 and now the last step so we can see all the games that we feel like 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.040
 a pirate but pirates we take the half pot of glue that we had before and 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.670
 we put it inside the plastic bag and then we put 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.600
 the bag in the face so that it covers our nose and mouth and we breathe 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.989
 several times with great force until I felt an intense pain in the neck 

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:28.589
 Once this is done we start playing the game and I assure you that 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:32.029
 you can play everything you want even in online mode 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:35.129
 And if it's not like that, it's because you have what's better, more glue 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.629
 before leaving I want to make a clarification on this new system 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:45.949
 works perfectly with other consoles such as the ps2 the x box 360 and the 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:47.179
 nintendo wii 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:51.329
 good nothing more to say is ok and I leave you I hope you help me 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:51.869
