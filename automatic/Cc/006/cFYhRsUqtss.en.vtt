00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:33.810
 Here we continue the fun 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:40.370
 skar audio 1500 sandal 12 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:43.140
 the same feed box here is measured power 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.290
 of course I did not have time to catch yet 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.340
 take off seedlings like there is no strong 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.340
 felled cheerfully 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.890
 still 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.920
 turned on the flashlight 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.610
 melodrama literally and 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.610
 and amount 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:37.150
 something there already rattles behind them just not 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:47.780
 I know that the power comes normally 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:52.810
 amplifier cold speaker bit 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:59.620
 warm water was a decoration works 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.620
 while warming up the wires easy 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.700
 so good blowing 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.680
 due to 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.680
 but 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:17.090
 the door to so slyly affects the flex 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.090
 we open the test and not all 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:33.740
 bit did not catch the moment but it seems to be on 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:45.259
 one flew in the region of 200 or 300 watts and 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:59.599
 I definitely did not notice the speaker lukewarm 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:05:02.110
 not hot clearance works just 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:05.590
 measure how many flies we try 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.590
 more normal 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:41.790
 that's actually what sandal goes by 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:45.950
 measurements like flew 300 watts can 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:49.530
 a bit more can a little less 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:53.180
 a lukewarm cap more threw not much 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:57.690
 warm normal operating temperature 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:07:01.710
 registration works she can be happy 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:07.130
 tumble more power in principle here 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:10.130
 at 300,400 watts everyday melts 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:14.130
 trunk shakes need to glue 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:17.610
 especially flies here this part number 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.230
 already even from a sidelong glance begins 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:24.630
 shake 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:28.740
 pleased the antenna also go glass 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:32.490
 nehilo like hands they move like that 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:37.100
 damn she waves music dick well and the wind 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:40.940
 present although it is rather small 

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.940
 it seems so far as
