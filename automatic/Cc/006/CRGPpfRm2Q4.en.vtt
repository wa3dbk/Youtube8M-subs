 marie-josÃ©e lavoie 414 ch 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.059
 we will leave 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.349
 it's an idea behind the head 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.349
 he arrived at kepler 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:18.480
 I propose 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.539
 even if we make them want to talk about it 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.079
 if laurent blanc 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:23.960
 I had to learn German 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.230
 Israel 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.199
 everyone can take place 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.130
 - identity at the cinema 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.829
 and while lifting the law of supply and demand 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.370
 it's like that for a long time 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.790
 today 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.000
 I've lost the waters that are out there, you need what you need to do 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.480
 thing entrusted to his players tonight for 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.160
 it takes to do tonight 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.510
 but what is less pretty I'm doing here a few years ago 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.830
 besides the risk if you want to spend she wrote us Thursday evening 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.470
 double mouths to finish Friday at 3 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.780
 the number of cards 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.270
 Oscar 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.530
 otherwise I do not know 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.050
 that's why 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.300
 decidedly the siege judges and the homeland butchers 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.620
 the group is present 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.690
 why is he bent on him 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.690
 however more than 16% 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.620
 tonight's session in front of the stadium 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.870
 to succeed him 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.640
 why these researchers 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.140
 it's their love story 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.140
 the head of French diplomacy 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.710
 at the time of the game again said m the organizer of the companies 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.630
 this test of his car he interested 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.380
 Their efforts 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.249
 borloo and the turbulent also talked about the evening or chile 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.750

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.940
 other way 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.940
 it has been twinned since July 6 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.309
