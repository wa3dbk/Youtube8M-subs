 Y 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.190
 they do not know each other 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.690
 yes 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.900
 Y 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.880
 above 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.500
 welcome to my special 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.540
 Christmas before starting with the 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.480
 tutorial I want to tell you something very 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.340
 personal for you 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.000
 I would like to see the whole video not 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.100
 just come by the download links 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.140
 many of us know that this year 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.870
 it has not been very good either 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.850
 disease problems love or whatever 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.800
 but the good thing about all this is that 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.410
 Despite that we have had moments 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.810
 unforgettable that every experience 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.210
 that we have makes us wiser more 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.850
 strong to face life and its 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.009
 challenges the good thing about these dates is that 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.410
 we realize the people that still 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.020
 they continue with us, supporting us in 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.350
 good and bad those people are the ones 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.900
 they are worth a year more, a 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.630
 year of experiences whether bad or 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.840
 good we always learn from them for 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.300
 be better in the future I do not have 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.120
 nothing more to say thank you all 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.940
 by subscribing for supporting me and why 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.310
 Let 's move forward encouragement and your goals 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.880
 have been fulfilled and if not we wait 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.220
 Merry Christmas and Happy New Year in 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.440
 this Christmas special I will give you a 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.450
 Christmas gift and it is nothing more and 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.180
 nothing less than grand theft auto san 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.340
 andreas for android cost me a lot 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.470
 get a stable version since the 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.290
 first version that rockstar released had 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.980
 many mistakes I will share the one that 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.500
 it worked for me 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.060
 first of all we download the 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.560
 files of the scholarship and the data of 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.390
 unzip the sd data and the 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:10.390
 we went to the route of android data a 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.940
 Once this is done, we install the scholarship and 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.160
 we started the game I recommend you 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.610
 First reset your device to 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.040
 that release ram memory another thing is that 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.019
 do not register in the social club which is the 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.670
 first window that appears to them already 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.360
 that rockstar will notice and 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.480
 will close the game does not come with wifi 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.879
 last enjoyed by friends thanks 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.549

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.980
