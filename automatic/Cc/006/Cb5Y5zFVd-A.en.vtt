00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
controller which this will work with

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.479 
controller which this will work with
pretty<00:00:30.359> much<00:00:30.539> any<00:00:30.929> console<00:00:31.590> or<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.099> PC

pretty much any console or the PC
whatever<00:00:32.759> once<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.809> plug<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.410> should

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
whatever once you plug it in you should

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.110 
whatever once you plug it in you should
all<00:00:34.770> have<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.070> exact<00:00:35.340> same<00:00:35.370> sort<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.790> settings

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
all have the exact same sort of settings

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.850 
all have the exact same sort of settings
and<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.630> guys<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:36.930> sort<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.350> copy<00:00:37.500> everything

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
and you guys can sort of copy everything

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.600 
and you guys can sort of copy everything
the<00:00:38.340> exact<00:00:38.579> same<00:00:38.760> as<00:00:38.969> what<00:00:39.300> mine<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.590> so<00:00:40.590> if<00:00:41.460> you

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
the exact same as what mine is so if you

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.369 
the exact same as what mine is so if you
guys<00:00:41.700> have<00:00:41.850> seen<00:00:41.969> my<00:00:42.239> latest<00:00:42.510> few<00:00:42.930> videos<00:00:43.260> you

guys have seen my latest few videos you
guys<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.649> seen<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.890> I've<00:00:44.070> been<00:00:44.250> driving

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
guys have seen that I've been driving

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.090 
guys have seen that I've been driving
pretty<00:00:44.610> smoothly<00:00:45.090> on<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> track<00:00:46.100> there

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
pretty smoothly on the track there

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.010 
pretty smoothly on the track there
hasn't<00:00:47.280> been<00:00:47.460> too<00:00:47.700> much<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.120> change<00:00:48.390> between

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
hasn't been too much of a change between

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.930 
hasn't been too much of a change between
my<00:00:49.200> last<00:00:49.379> video<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:49.829> this<00:00:49.980> video<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.760> there

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
my last video on this video but there

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.369 
my last video on this video but there
has<00:00:51.059> been<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.449> couple<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.930> things<00:00:52.140> which

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
has been a couple of things which

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.229 
has been a couple of things which
actually<00:00:52.500> makes<00:00:52.829> such<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> big<00:00:53.250> difference<00:00:53.579> to

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
actually makes such a big difference to

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.580 
actually makes such a big difference to
the<00:00:54.329> controller<00:00:54.660> setup<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.170> how<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.320> are

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
the controller setup and how you are

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.959 
the controller setup and how you are
able<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.949> sort<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.280> control<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> care<00:00:56.850> and

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
able to sort of control the care and

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.130 
able to sort of control the care and
drive<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.329> stuff<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:57.870> let's<00:00:57.899> go

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
drive and stuff like that so let's go

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.740 
drive and stuff like that so let's go
ahead<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:59.190> jump<00:00:59.460> into<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.000> options<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.510> help

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
ahead and jump into the options and help

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.299 
ahead and jump into the options and help
go<00:01:01.320> into<00:01:01.469> controls<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.949> show<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.160> guys

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
go into controls and show you guys

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.619 
go into controls and show you guys
pretty<00:01:02.460> much<00:01:02.640> everything<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.570> on

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
pretty much everything that I have it on

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.109 
pretty much everything that I have it on
here<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.049> as<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.680> can<00:01:04.830> see<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.729> my<00:01:05.850> setup

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
here so as you can see this is my setup

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.760 
here so as you can see this is my setup
right<00:01:06.360> now<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.990> steering<00:01:07.260> dead<00:01:07.409> zone<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.650> on

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
right now the steering dead zone is on

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.270 
right now the steering dead zone is on
five<00:01:08.210> zero<00:01:09.210> zero<00:01:09.299> thirty<00:01:09.990> fourteen<00:01:10.650> fifteen

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
five zero zero thirty fourteen fifteen

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.679 
five zero zero thirty fourteen fifteen
if<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.610> can<00:01:11.729> put<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.090> fourteen<00:01:12.420> put<00:01:12.600> it

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
if you can put this on fourteen put it

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.690 
if you can put this on fourteen put it
to<00:01:12.750> fifteen<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.380> will<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.770> think<00:01:13.950> change<00:01:14.310> to

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
to fifteen and it will I think change to

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.789 
to fifteen and it will I think change to
fourteen<00:01:15.060> for<00:01:15.270> some<00:01:15.390> reason<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:16.080> still<00:01:16.320> put

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
fourteen for some reason but still put

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.730 
fourteen for some reason but still put
it<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.950> fifteen<00:01:17.450> fifteen<00:01:18.450> ten<00:01:18.810> forty-five

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
it to fifteen fifteen ten forty-five

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.679 
it to fifteen fifteen ten forty-five
particular<00:01:20.400> sensitivity<00:01:20.759> now<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.570> where

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
particular sensitivity now this is where

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.640 
particular sensitivity now this is where
it<00:01:21.780> gets<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.990> little<00:01:22.080> bit<00:01:22.259> different<00:01:22.530> right

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
it gets a little bit different right

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.620 
it gets a little bit different right
speed<00:01:23.310> sensitivity<00:01:23.729> I've<00:01:23.790> changed<00:01:24.060> up<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.210> 55

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
speed sensitivity I've changed up to 55

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.420 
speed sensitivity I've changed up to 55
controller<00:01:25.439> filtering<00:01:25.950> sensitivity<00:01:26.400> I

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
controller filtering sensitivity I

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.090 
controller filtering sensitivity I
change<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> ad<00:01:27.590> damper<00:01:28.590> saturation<00:01:29.070> you

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
change that the ad damper saturation you

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.190 
change that the ad damper saturation you
can't<00:01:29.310> even<00:01:29.520> change<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.939> first<00:01:30.780> feedback<00:01:31.110> I

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
can't even change that first feedback I

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.539 
can't even change that first feedback I
changed<00:01:31.409> up<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.560> zero<00:01:31.770> because<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.159> messes<00:01:32.460> up

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
changed up to zero because it messes up

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.550 
changed up to zero because it messes up
my<00:01:32.610> controllers<00:01:33.420> headset<00:01:33.960> whenever<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.380> have

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
my controllers headset whenever I have

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.109 
my controllers headset whenever I have
it<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.040> basically<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.549> just<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.939> turn

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
it on so basically this is just to turn

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.469 
it on so basically this is just to turn
off<00:01:36.299> vibration<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.500> controller<00:01:38.150> and<00:01:39.150> now

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
off vibration in the controller and now

when you're in advanced mode which is

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.679 
when you're in advanced mode which is

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
important these are the things I haven't

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.950 
important these are the things I haven't
had<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.850> previous<00:02:03.299> video<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.780> they

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
had in the previous video and they

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.889 
had in the previous video and they
definitely<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.619> hundred<00:02:05.549> percent<00:02:05.729> make<00:02:06.689> your

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
definitely a hundred percent make your

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.600 
definitely a hundred percent make your
you're<00:02:07.560> driving<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.979> little<00:02:08.160> bit<00:02:08.250> easier<00:02:08.580> and

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
you're driving a little bit easier and

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.570 
you're driving a little bit easier and
it<00:02:08.819> should<00:02:08.970> be<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.239> lot<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:10.020> lot<00:02:10.470> better<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.890> sort

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
it should be a lot a lot better you sort

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.619 
it should be a lot a lot better you sort
of<00:02:11.640> get<00:02:11.790> used<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.150> once<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.330> got<00:02:12.480> on<00:02:12.569> the

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
of get used to it once you got on the

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.820 
of get used to it once you got on the
track<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.989> steering<00:02:13.319> feels

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
track the steering feels

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.620 
track the steering feels
little<00:02:14.010> bit<00:02:14.160> sluggish<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.940> little<00:02:15.330> bit<00:02:15.450> slow

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
little bit sluggish a little bit slow

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.600 
little bit sluggish a little bit slow
again<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.890> can<00:02:17.010> measure<00:02:17.130> out<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.370> speech

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
again you can measure out the speech

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.890 
again you can measure out the speech
sensitivity<00:02:18.060> and<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.240> controller<00:02:18.510> filtering

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
sensitivity and the controller filtering

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.480 
sensitivity and the controller filtering
sensitivity<00:02:19.380> just<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.740> sort<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.010> speed<00:02:20.250> up<00:02:20.340> the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
sensitivity just to sort of speed up the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.710 
sensitivity just to sort of speed up the
steering<00:02:20.700> if<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.000> really<00:02:21.240> really<00:02:21.330> wanted<00:02:21.600> to

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
steering if you really really wanted to

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.630 
steering if you really really wanted to
I<00:02:21.930> usually<00:02:22.920> mess<00:02:23.040> around<00:02:23.160> with<00:02:23.310> these<00:02:23.430> when

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
I usually mess around with these when

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.310 
I usually mess around with these when
I'm<00:02:23.730> sort<00:02:23.910> of<00:02:24.000> trying<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.330> get<00:02:24.480> myself<00:02:24.840> as<00:02:25.170> to

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
I'm sort of trying to get myself as to

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.280 
I'm sort of trying to get myself as to
drift<00:02:25.620> or<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.860> slide<00:02:26.100> so<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:27.300> bring<00:02:27.630> usually

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
drift or to slide so I bring usually

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.020 
drift or to slide so I bring usually
these<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.920> little<00:02:29.160> bit<00:02:29.220> further<00:02:29.550> down<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.940> the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
these a little bit further down to the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.020 
these a little bit further down to the
left<00:02:30.240> maybe<00:02:30.990> around<00:02:31.140> 60<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.710> 54<00:02:32.610> for<00:02:32.970> the

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
left maybe around 60 to 54 for the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.430 
left maybe around 60 to 54 for the
controller<00:02:33.300> filtering<00:02:33.660> sensitivity<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.320> that

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
controller filtering sensitivity so that

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.960 
controller filtering sensitivity so that
should<00:02:34.980> definitely<00:02:35.340> help<00:02:35.490> when<00:02:35.850> you're

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
should definitely help when you're

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.000 
should definitely help when you're
trying<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.210> drift<00:02:36.570> or<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.810> slide<00:02:37.020> but<00:02:37.230> for<00:02:37.440> for

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
trying to drift or to slide but for for

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.320 
trying to drift or to slide but for for
driving<00:02:38.430> normally<00:02:38.580> for<00:02:38.850> driving<00:02:39.090> around<00:02:39.210> the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
driving normally for driving around the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.150 
driving normally for driving around the
track<00:02:39.360> these<00:02:39.990> are<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.680> settings<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.070> you

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
track these are the settings that you

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.950 
track these are the settings that you
need<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.430> have<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.940> like<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.390> said<00:02:42.540> if<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.870> guys

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
need to have and like I said if you guys

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.780 
need to have and like I said if you guys
want<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.170> see<00:02:43.350> me<00:02:43.800> drive<00:02:43.980> around<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.280> track<00:02:44.580> as

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
want to see me drive around the track as

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.060 
want to see me drive around the track as
you<00:02:44.850> like<00:02:45.510> you'll<00:02:45.660> see<00:02:45.750> in<00:02:46.140> a<00:02:46.440> few<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:46.920> my

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
you like you'll see in a few of my

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.560 
you like you'll see in a few of my
previous<00:02:47.370> videos<00:02:47.790> how<00:02:47.820> smooth<00:02:48.270> I<00:02:48.450> can

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
previous videos how smooth I can

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.510 
previous videos how smooth I can
actually<00:02:48.690> take<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.020> care<00:02:49.170> on<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.410> track<00:02:49.620> and

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
actually take the care on the track and

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.150 
actually take the care on the track and
how<00:02:50.640> easy<00:02:50.850> it<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.360> control<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.350> yeah

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
how easy it is to control it so yeah

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.360 
how easy it is to control it so yeah
hopefully<00:02:53.400> this<00:02:54.060> helped<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:55.140> so<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:55.860> told<00:02:56.220> you

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
hopefully this helped I so I told you

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.199 
hopefully this helped I so I told you
guys<00:02:56.459> that<00:02:56.520> I<00:02:56.640> was<00:02:56.730> going<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:56.940> bring<00:02:57.060> out

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
guys that I was going to bring out

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.699 
guys that I was going to bring out
another<00:02:57.540> video<00:02:57.690> showing<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.560> guys

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
another video showing you guys

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.280 
another video showing you guys
everything<00:02:59.070> and<00:02:59.459> here's<00:03:00.120> my<00:03:00.330> assignments<00:03:01.230> I

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
everything and here's my assignments I

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.080 
everything and here's my assignments I
guess<00:03:01.470> for<00:03:01.800> everything<00:03:02.190> that's<00:03:02.310> let's<00:03:02.940> set<00:03:03.060> up

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
guess for everything that's let's set up

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.370 
guess for everything that's let's set up
on<00:03:03.209> my<00:03:03.300> controller<00:03:03.600> I've<00:03:03.690> made<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:03.959> pretty

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
on my controller I've made it pretty

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.630 
on my controller I've made it pretty
much<00:03:04.650> very<00:03:04.920> very<00:03:05.160> similar<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.520> my<00:03:05.730> my<00:03:06.060> Forza<00:03:07.640> my

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
much very very similar to my my Forza my

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.910 
much very very similar to my my Forza my
first<00:03:08.880> controls<00:03:09.300> so<00:03:09.570> pretty<00:03:10.230> much<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.770> know<00:03:10.890> a

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
first controls so pretty much you know a

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.740 
first controls so pretty much you know a
and<00:03:11.310> X<00:03:11.459> is<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.820> change<00:03:12.030> gears<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.450> stuff<00:03:12.600> like

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
and X is to change gears and stuff like

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.360 
and X is to change gears and stuff like
that<00:03:12.930> so<00:03:13.110> everything<00:03:13.709> should<00:03:13.980> be<00:03:14.130> there<00:03:14.310> if

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
that so everything should be there if

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.800 
that so everything should be there if
you<00:03:14.459> guys<00:03:14.550> want<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.790> copy<00:03:14.940> that<00:03:15.180> as<00:03:15.360> well<00:03:15.600> but
