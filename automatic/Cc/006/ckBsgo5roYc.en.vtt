 hi my name is t 3 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.039
 I was a robot before I had a family but 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.949
 then they left me alone I waited for them 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.590
 waited about 11 thousand for a long time 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.990
 four hundred thirty two days and went on 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.840
 would stand like that however found me 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.870
 flying past an alien called him 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.180

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.320
 and what needs me 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:42.120
 reprogramme and then in me there is no h 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.030
 humanity I could not find anywhere 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.730
 the definition of this word jeff is also not 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.300
 humanity explained it to me 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.370
 it does not mean to be human it means 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.190
 see understand others like this all 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.469
 confused but jeer said that would help me 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.859
 become more humane maybe then i 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.110
 again I am able to see his family or else 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:13.650
 I have to deactivate me 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:17.189
 agreed it should be fun here 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.310
 this is my planet here and riga i live here 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.500
 not so much but it is for now 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.740
 I can create items from nothing 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.030
 didn't I talk about it right from 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.240
 of air 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.460
 and I started decorating but quickly 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.740
 I realized that not many things I can 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.500
 create then I decided to start my 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.909
 the journey is humanity and incidentally 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.960
 learn many new and interesting 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.330
 things 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.130
 jumped on my flying image 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.290
 flasher and went straight to the stars 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.860
 here it is my universe 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.720
 I can fly here where I want to sit 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.080
 on planets and asteroids 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.960
 and still collect yes and probes it helps me 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.759
 create items don't have to laugh 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.149
 let's look at one of the asteroids 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.610
 there always someone lives someone who loves 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.769
 ask me questions i love them 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.370
 answer what picture I like 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.920
 more I would do such and such a situation 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:19.350
 what i like and what i don't like 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.600

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.780

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.540
 love leap and easily fiction trust 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.510
 logic or their feelings and pretty 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.940
 often they are right every time i 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.299
 find out about myself something new and start 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.590
 be aware of this I have a personal doctor 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:45.870

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:48.959
 gigahertz rated joke 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:55.170
 this is a humor robot you do not understand so what 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:56.010
 I stopped loading loading doctor 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.410
 therapist 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.840
 he somehow associates with all of these 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.500
 asteroids residents and recognize them mine 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.470
 answers 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.310
 I still think it's not quite 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.709
 legally 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.900
 but I donâ€™t want to sue him 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.480
 he gives an even deeper appreciation of my 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.590
 personalities are always interested in learning about themselves 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.750
 more 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.849
 and it's great but I still haven't 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.010
 close to understanding what it is 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.400
 humanity how do i become it 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.920
 that is , to become me for this 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.629
 have to visit the major planets on 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.379
 each of which reigns its own atmosphere 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:35.170
 where is hot where is cold and scary and where 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:37.660
 fun these worlds inhabit all kinds 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.450
 corby creatures with their own character and 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.360
 different objects of love and hate i 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.690
 go I talk to them find out more 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:49.299
 personalities and give them their favorite things here 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.569
 this boy likes the robots I created 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:56.970
 him this but these are beautiful things and 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.970
 he got me so hard on get 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.420
 Yes, I do not have to treat everyone well 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.910
 it does not mean that I am angry just happen 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.930
 such people who initially block themselves 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.940
 position 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.310
 but what is most important for everyone here 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.890
 there are assignments for me to transfer 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.730
 connected with humanity 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.590
 weightlifter asked me to introduce 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.530
 him with a dance teacher 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.750
 and he himself was shy about knights 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.150
 dragon with whom he would fight and 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.310
 Humpty Dumpty is constantly mourning 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.410
 his dead relative just 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.750
 I wanted to know if I can have that 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.750
 Tom light of a relative that he hears and 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.600
 watching Rome I said yes and he 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.810
 glad funny sometimes words can 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.970
 help grief and so i wandered the planets 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.370
 talked helped having fun and 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.950
 danced but then flew jeff and 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.190
 I asked if I learned something new 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.470
 or really found out in one place 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.030
 everyone feared a huge monster and not 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.430
 only wanted to communicate with him because 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.110
 one of his kind and then it turned out that he 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.530
 very kind and caring 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:04.540
 it's called prejudice in another 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.490
 scarecrow forgot about your birthday 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.080
 tits and still could not decide 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.740
 come and apologize 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.780
 it is pride and remember that weightlifter 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.090
 about which I spoke he still 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.479
 met this teacher and they 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:22.390
 now together this is called a dream and her 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:25.060
 implementation does not have much 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.910
 learn about people's feelings like this 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.910
 little by little i'm learning to be more human 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:34.510
 I continue to try and hope that 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.970
 I can soon return to my family to me 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.010
 it seems that if you have been around 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:42.490
 more human to each 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.729
 my friend and our whole would not be a little 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.729
 it is better
