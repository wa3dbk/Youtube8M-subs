00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
there are a couple of explanations

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.160 
there are a couple of explanations
behind<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.890> first<00:00:50.190> one<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.850> that<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.420> I

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
behind on the first one is is that I I

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.520 
behind on the first one is is that I I
finished<00:00:52.710> school<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.750> so<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.780> finished<00:00:55.230> my

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
finished school and so I finished my

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.650 
finished school and so I finished my
phlebotomy<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.399> ECG<00:00:56.699> diploma<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.510> that's

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
phlebotomy and ECG diploma so that's

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.479 
phlebotomy and ECG diploma so that's
good<00:00:57.870> that's<00:00:58.109> out<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> way<00:00:58.410> doesn't<00:00:59.219> help

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
good that's out of the way doesn't help

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.250

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
that I can't find a job but I guess that

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.070 
that I can't find a job but I guess that
that's<00:01:01.890> something<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.280> will<00:01:02.489> work<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.080> a

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
couple of other things but the next big

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.480
