00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.890
 clock 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.040
 these relationships the great advantage that 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.480
 It is a mobile phone with card 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.719
 independent that is not a clock 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.180
 that we need to link with our 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:26.650
 mobile phone to work is a 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.709
 watch that when carrying mobile card 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.659
 We can make calls independently 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.459
 and receive calls without the need for another 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.980
 mobile phone is already here within the 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:40.329
 phone number here and the phone 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.819
 mobile with the advantage that it has 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:45.849
 we see the android operating system this 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.950
 type of icons and this type of menu what 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.019
 we know about our mobile phones 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.849
 with android system fix with what 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.669
 fluency 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.150
 we enter the menus we enter the 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:57.150
 configuration 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.650

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.700
 in the settings we go out with the keys 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.739
 side to back 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.760
 the main menu we have here the 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:15.760
 desktop that we can both access 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.410
 make a call worth here for 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.300
 mark as if it were a normal phone 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:24.100
 a normal mobile phone headphones 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.630
 calculator calendar here we have 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.220
 all the shortcuts and then 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.669
 inside we have all the icons 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.070
 This watch has the great advantage that 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:36.910
 when carrying the android operating system 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.970
 We can install hundreds of 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:45.300
 applications and free games that 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.300
 we found in the android play store 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:54.150
 and in addition this particular model also 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:58.259
 to incorporate wifi bluetooth and all this 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:01.919
 type of connections also carries 3g is 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:04.289
 say we can navigate at 3g speed that 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.380
 it's faster than the gsm gprs 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.180
 normal we have other models that we 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.050
 they carry 3g and this particular model is 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.150
 a superior model that incorporates 3g 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.520
 It also carries an internal memory of 4GB 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.570
 to be able to install games applications 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.570
 music and so on 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.540
 otherwise, its handling is very 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.970
 simple as it is handled 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.100
 mobile phone with android system 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.880
 normal and current we enter the menus 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:37.520
 and we can then that if the browser everything 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.250
 we can enter here right now by 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.730
 example are entering the page 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:45.920
 google and although right now we're not 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.480
 connected by wifi but as we have 3g 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.380
 because right now we are not connecting 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:54.490
 as we see the page there it appears 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.310

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:01.060

 twitter all kinds of applications that 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.940

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:15.759
