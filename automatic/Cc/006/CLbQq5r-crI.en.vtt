or<00:00:35.539> creatine<00:00:36.230> phosphate<00:00:36.800> which<00:00:37.219> are<00:00:37.370> all

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
or creatine phosphate which are all

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.220 
or creatine phosphate which are all
essentially<00:00:38.090> the<00:00:38.149> same<00:00:38.359> thing<00:00:38.659> so<00:00:38.870> when<00:00:39.019> one

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
essentially the same thing so when one

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.079 
essentially the same thing so when one
person<00:00:39.260> uses<00:00:39.980> one<00:00:40.190> way<00:00:40.339> and<00:00:40.609> another<00:00:40.850> the

back to that myth I just exposed it

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.459 
back to that myth I just exposed it
might<00:00:47.149> surprise<00:00:47.479> some<00:00:47.600> of<00:00:47.929> you<00:00:48.079> to<00:00:48.289> know<00:00:48.440> that

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
might surprise some of you to know that

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.860 
might surprise some of you to know that
creatine<00:00:48.979> is<00:00:49.280> naturally<00:00:49.909> made<00:00:50.120> in<00:00:50.329> the<00:00:50.449> bottom

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
creatine is naturally made in the bottom

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.739 
creatine is naturally made in the bottom
one<00:00:51.109> and<00:00:51.710> creatine's<00:00:52.519> main<00:00:52.819> function<00:00:53.359> is<00:00:53.510> to

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:53.749 
one and creatine's main function is to

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:56.139 
one and creatine's main function is to
supply<00:00:54.229> energy<00:00:54.499> to<00:00:54.859> all<00:00:55.309> the<00:00:55.579> cells<00:00:55.850> in<00:00:56.059> the

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
supply energy to all the cells in the

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.379 
supply energy to all the cells in the
body<00:00:56.329> primarily<00:00:57.289> muscle<00:00:57.799> muscle<00:00:58.339> go<00:00:59.089> create

00:00:59.379 --> 00:00:59.389 
body primarily muscle muscle go create

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:01.569 
body primarily muscle muscle go create
it<00:00:59.569> go<00:00:59.839> the<00:01:00.260> problem<00:01:00.620> here<00:01:00.799> with<00:01:00.889> creatine<00:01:01.399> is

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
it go the problem here with creatine is

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.910 
it go the problem here with creatine is
that<00:01:01.850> although<00:01:02.269> our<00:01:02.629> body<00:01:02.870> makes<00:01:03.199> creatine<00:01:03.739> by

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
that although our body makes creatine by

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.340 
that although our body makes creatine by
itself<00:01:04.250> it<00:01:04.489> does<00:01:04.699> not<00:01:04.879> make<00:01:05.180> a<00:01:05.360> lot<00:01:05.630> of<00:01:05.659> it<00:01:05.960> so<00:01:06.320> a

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
itself it does not make a lot of it so a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.930 
itself it does not make a lot of it so a
lot<00:01:06.500> of<00:01:06.620> people<00:01:06.830> get<00:01:06.950> tired<00:01:07.220> halfway<00:01:07.729> through

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
lot of people get tired halfway through

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.430 
lot of people get tired halfway through
their<00:01:08.090> workout<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:08.600> they<00:01:08.960> want<00:01:09.170> to<00:01:09.200> stop

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
their workout and they want to stop

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.719 
their workout and they want to stop
because<00:01:09.799> they<00:01:09.920> just<00:01:10.130> don't<00:01:10.310> have<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.490> energy

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
because they just don't have the energy

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.330 
because they just don't have the energy
to<00:01:11.000> go<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:11.509> that's<00:01:11.899> why<00:01:12.079> people<00:01:12.469> look<00:01:12.770> for

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
to go and that's why people look for

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.490 
to go and that's why people look for
creatine<00:01:13.880> as<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.119> supplementation<00:01:15.110> for<00:01:15.140> their
