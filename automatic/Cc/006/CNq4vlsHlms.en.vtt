00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.040
 I think we had a very good game today 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.790
 the abbot acted well at the beginning 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.740
 allowed 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.320
 certain mistakes but after 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.140
 managed to score the first goal situation 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.640
 evolved in our favor were first 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.970
 small problems with long gears 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.130
 urala with crumbs but then what has changed 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.410
 I think that today all the players spent 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.300
 very good game acted well out 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.950
 terms of tactics and physical terms 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.960
 there was no problem so this 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.489
 very good result for us 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.750
 it is certainly nice that we continue 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.079
 be in first place in the tournament 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.079
 table 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.929
 it goes even further than the joint itself 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.880
 satisfied and. 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.350
 here you can look at the facts you know 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.510
 that the central protective line is left 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.030
 flank it's all foreigners and we have 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.770
 hulk so the situation is such 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.630
 way that randomly really doesn't 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.120
 just get into the main team I 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.490
 talking to him on this topic saying that 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.140
 need to take look for some 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.850
 certain solutions well of course it is 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.710
 incredible situation when a person 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.410
 who finished last season race 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.120
 league scorers at 2 second in 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.930
 next year is essentially 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.620
 thrown out of it 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.200
 and because of the same league decision, I have a lot 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.910
 talked about this situation is reality 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.410
 I have very modest hopes 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.510
 as to what the situation may be 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.370
 change but I repeat at the moment 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.370
 the situation is of course she is incredible 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.630
 you know we have been waiting for this moment 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.330
 when we play ourselves in the new 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.700
 stadium can be some measure 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.580
 burned out because but a bit too much 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.090
 many mistakes made by such 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.489
 team zenith she does not forgive and this 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.319
 is questioning because football is like 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.500
 no other game is made up of bugs 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.450
 when we started 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.800
 the first half in general, we looked good 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.600
 by drawing but when in the second 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.420
 tiring transfer inside to do 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.989
 who are such midfielders defenders 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.760
 cart 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.130
 pass forward and immediately howl dangerous 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.790
 counterattack of course this is something that is not something 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.160
 I would like what we saw but in general at 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.110
 This is what prerequisites for us 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.209
 good did spend enough 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.280
 but unfortunately the score on the scoreboard is 41 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:13.569
 Well that completely corresponds to what was 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:17.380
 although in terms of performers certainly not 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.850
 forgive our thanks colleagues let's 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.670
 move on to the questions don't not forget 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:27.620
 it was presented called please things 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.010
 the end in particular goal 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.170
 and this fatigue maybe you went 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.610
 woman 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.159
 yes no she began to risk already to the doctor 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.610
 began to 21 what to lose you already 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:42.379
 we have to think about what any homework 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.140
 matches must score points if 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:47.950
 another but probably 4 was me more 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.410
 total reprisal because well if 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.660
 call your things on the metro berezkina 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.430
 skips on this 11 I don't get it 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.970
 absolutely with a young guy who came out 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.489
 to replace 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.769
 he should lower 220 but not to you 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.420
 go through such a situation the epicenter of the field 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.510
 transmission quality between lines 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.400
 already there yes did not work who missed 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.819
 on the game of course not very much 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.819
 upset 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.290
 it is great for the light given that view 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.660
 that is, we have it is also very 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.330
 mail we need players who can 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:36.540
 it will take any moment from that 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:36.540
 mind shortages, that is, yes, please 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:47.880
 you apologize to every coach so question 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.290
 asked no yes but you know what he 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.860
 such a football with which you need a special 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.630
 an approach 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.669
 his level of performing art 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:59.169
 exact very high but unfortunately we 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.510
 we can not guarantee that he falls 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.550
 sleep in the morning stanitsa health skin like 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.590
 everything was fine 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.960
 and in the morning he had a fever that 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.930
 intestinal some kind of infection even today 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.060
 so we hope believe then we are with him 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.380
 talk about what he will be 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.480
 bring use amateur on 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.450
 football field in a hospital bed 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:24.990
 he understands that we hope that he is 20 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:26.760
 meditation totality even more he doesn't 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.560
 only can any game enhance in from 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.370
 The first can enough quality plant 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:35.820
 but so far it is not enough of course strengthened 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:38.840
 even hit that coin but in the second 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.930
 half on just do not 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:50.449
 last say a bunch of fountain night 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:53.300
 this is the central and season what the question is they 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:58.030
 understand some variations there if you 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:06:11.600
 tell the blue alarming 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:14.139
 yes no absolutely all the same there we are 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.550
 played on two fronts maybe yes so I 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:18.889
 I think that the best combination because 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.600
 that if there are three of them then 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:22.010
 arise not so it is said that to us 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.870
 we need absolutely well then let's take 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:29.389
 they have lodygin have malachia have 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.310
 young baburin and you really need 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.539
 mouth alleles 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.330
 even the situation itself is the same 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:35.919
 central we can type as you can 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.150
 people 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:39.400
 some kind of use it like this 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.960
 will be reflected on 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:48.490
 inside the team this is of course a question 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:58.539
 quite interesting serves me mercy 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:07:01.539
 brother-in-law moment but here we are 

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:04.630
 Now itâ€™s just getting sour on Mars. 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:07.509
 No, well, although there can not be ruled out a sort of 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.039
 Oleg Shatov is such a football player who can 

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:10.600
 slip before he judge will 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:12.789
 to confuse with not trying anyone 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.539
 impose a penalty she was not even he 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:15.539
 like 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.210
 We feel great in Austria 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.610
 preparing for the grass 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:36.990
 Kuban Krasnodar we played the game 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:40.240
 left no absolutely no problem 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:43.539
 new stadium and but also that it was in the name 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:46.770
 what up feeling awesome we're here 

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:48.820
 built several workouts of course it 

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:50.800
 motivates additional players 

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.300
 although I have to say that everything is enough 

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.669
 quality train to 

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.689
 show good 

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:57.189
 but of course 

00:07:55.689 --> 00:07:59.020
 we will try to do everything possible 

00:07:57.189 --> 00:08:01.979
 so we have a boy follow the product 

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.979
 us victories
