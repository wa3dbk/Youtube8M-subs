the<00:00:16.980> game<00:00:17.160> yeah<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:17.940> think<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.960> think<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.529> boys

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
the game yeah I think I think the boys

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.099 
the game yeah I think I think the boys
deserved<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.340> have<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.550> good<00:00:20.820> result<00:00:20.970> in<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
deserved to have a good result in the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.410 
deserved to have a good result in the
first<00:00:22.350> game<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:22.949> played<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.240> little<00:00:24.240> bit

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
first game we played a little bit

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.120 
first game we played a little bit
nervous<00:00:24.600> second<00:00:25.199> half<00:00:25.320> was<00:00:25.439> much<00:00:25.650> better<00:00:25.830> and

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
nervous second half was much better and

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.250 
nervous second half was much better and
today<00:00:26.849> it's<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.689> know<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.930> last<00:00:28.050> game

the<00:01:42.420> training<00:01:42.750> methods<00:01:43.049> from<00:01:43.140> cover<00:01:43.619> into

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
the training methods from cover into

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.679 
the training methods from cover into
their<00:01:44.130> teams<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.790> we<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.479> some

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
their teams so that we can have some

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.810 
their teams so that we can have some
effect<00:01:45.869> through<00:01:46.350> song<00:01:46.560> done<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.490> way<00:01:47.700> as

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
effect through song done in that way as

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.670 
effect through song done in that way as
well<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.509> it's<00:01:48.659> not<00:01:48.720> just<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
well so it's not just just the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.260 
well so it's not just just the
individual<00:01:50.310> players<00:01:50.579> but<00:01:50.790> we<00:01:50.939> can<00:01:51.090> have<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
individual players but we can have a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.660 
individual players but we can have a
greater<00:01:51.960> impact<00:01:52.049> through<00:01:52.710> through<00:01:53.250> song<00:01:53.460> done

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
greater impact through through song done

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.959 
greater impact through through song done
that<00:01:53.820> way<00:01:54.170> I<00:01:55.170> think<00:01:55.619> they<00:01:55.799> learn<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.610> live<00:01:56.880> away

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
that way I think they learn to live away

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.179 
that way I think they learn to live away
from<00:01:57.090> home<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.689> know<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.290> eat<00:01:58.590> Spanish<00:01:58.979> food
