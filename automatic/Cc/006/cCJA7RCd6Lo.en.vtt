other extra features they have here so
we<00:02:09.009> have<00:02:09.179> another<00:02:10.179> two<00:02:10.420> extra<00:02:10.720> windows<00:02:11.080> dotted

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
we have another two extra windows dotted

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.410 
we have another two extra windows dotted
around<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.830> tent<00:02:12.130> if<00:02:12.640> one<00:02:12.970> here<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:13.300> one<00:02:13.390> on

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
around the tent if one here and one on

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.050 
around the tent if one here and one on
the<00:02:13.569> other<00:02:13.690> side<00:02:13.900> is<00:02:14.020> well<00:02:14.170> exactly<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.650> same

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
the other side is well exactly the same

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.399 
the other side is well exactly the same
benefit<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.150> these<00:02:16.299> ones<00:02:16.540> it<00:02:16.659> has<00:02:16.689> Coleman's

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
benefit of these ones it has Coleman's

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.369

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
down the side they coil up when you undo

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.619 
down the side they coil up when you undo
it<00:02:29.099> rolling<00:02:30.099> that<00:02:30.219> window<00:02:30.579> away<00:02:30.849> tucking<00:02:31.510> it
