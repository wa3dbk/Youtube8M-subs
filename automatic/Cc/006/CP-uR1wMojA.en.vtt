in<00:02:43.930> into<00:02:44.379> the<00:02:44.470> microphone<00:02:44.920> so<00:02:45.400> here<00:02:45.730> we<00:02:45.910> have

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
in into the microphone so here we have

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.479 
in into the microphone so here we have
it<00:02:46.329> so<00:02:46.510> we<00:02:46.629> have<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:47.079> microphone<00:02:47.829> it's

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489
