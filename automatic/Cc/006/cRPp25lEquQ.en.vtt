where the old one was okay it looks like

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.330 
where the old one was okay it looks like
I<00:02:42.690> gotta<00:02:42.870> loosen<00:02:43.110> them<00:02:45.590> no<00:02:46.590> that's<00:02:46.950> where<00:02:47.220> it

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
I gotta loosen them no that's where it

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.640 
I gotta loosen them no that's where it
goes<00:02:47.580> it's<00:02:48.090> different<00:02:48.599> this<00:02:49.290> one<00:02:49.530> is

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
goes it's different this one is

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.270 
goes it's different this one is
different<00:02:49.920> than<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.519> original<00:02:53.959> okay<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:56.160> it

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
different than the original okay so it

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.410 
different than the original okay so it
is<00:02:56.310> different<00:02:58.099> so<00:02:59.099> you<00:02:59.670> can<00:02:59.819> see<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.150> dirty

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
is different so you can see the dirty

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.809 
is different so you can see the dirty
spot<00:03:00.840> on<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.230> glass<00:03:01.530> here<00:03:01.890> in<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.190> clean<00:03:02.430> spot

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
spot on the glass here in the clean spot

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.559 
spot on the glass here in the clean spot
so<00:03:03.660> these<00:03:04.019> sit<00:03:04.349> down<00:03:05.000> in<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.120> little<00:03:06.420> bit

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
so these sit down in a little bit

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.479 
so these sit down in a little bit
different<00:03:07.730> than<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.940> original<00:03:09.510> did<00:03:10.459> so<00:03:11.459> I

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
different than the original did so I

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.479 
different than the original did so I
probably<00:03:11.880> can't<00:03:12.269> see<00:03:12.480> this<00:03:12.660> one<00:03:12.720> but<00:03:13.489> it's

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
probably can't see this one but it's

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.460 
probably can't see this one but it's
rest<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.030> work<00:03:15.209> should<00:03:15.540> be<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.290> looks

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
rest and work should be and it looks

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.819 
rest and work should be and it looks
like<00:03:16.560> it's<00:03:16.829> relatively<00:03:17.519> straight<00:03:17.940> so<00:03:18.829> let's

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
like it's relatively straight so let's

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.509 
like it's relatively straight so let's
try<00:03:20.160> that<00:03:21.230> okay<00:03:22.230> I'm<00:03:22.590> gonna<00:03:22.680> give<00:03:22.920> this<00:03:23.069> a<00:03:23.250> test

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
try that okay I'm gonna give this a test

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.190 
try that okay I'm gonna give this a test
run<00:03:23.850> first<00:03:24.209> so<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.569> need<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.810> plug<00:03:24.989> the

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
run first so you need to plug the

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.809 
run first so you need to plug the
control<00:03:25.620> box<00:03:25.889> back<00:03:26.340> in<00:03:28.069> before<00:03:29.069> I<00:03:29.310> tighten

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
control box back in before I tighten

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:30.860 
control box back in before I tighten
this<00:03:29.910> up<00:03:30.120> because<00:03:30.239> I<00:03:30.450> want<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.660> make<00:03:30.840> sure

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:49.490 
this up because I want to make sure
we're<00:03:31.200> somewhat<00:03:31.920> in<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.100> ballpark<00:03:32.670> here

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
that's interesting oh I didn't plug it

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.700 
that's interesting oh I didn't plug it
in<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:54.230> that<00:03:55.230> would<00:03:55.410> help<00:03:57.260> I'm<00:03:58.260> like<00:03:58.470> what<00:03:58.680> the

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
to make sure that the window is lining

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.730 
to make sure that the window is lining
up<00:04:07.920> properly<00:04:08.520> over<00:04:08.970> here<00:04:12.320> okay<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:13.470> it<00:04:13.530> does

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
appear to be yeah okay so the window

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.750 
appear to be yeah okay so the window
stayed<00:04:27.060> because<00:04:27.360> it's<00:04:27.660> kind<00:04:27.900> of<00:04:28.020> high<00:04:28.580> it's<00:04:29.580> a

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
stayed because it's kind of high it's a

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.790 
stayed because it's kind of high it's a
tight<00:04:29.970> fit<00:04:30.000> toward<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:30.750> top<00:04:30.990> which<00:04:31.200> is<00:04:31.380> fine<00:04:31.620> I

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
tight fit toward the top which is fine I

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.290 
tight fit toward the top which is fine I
just<00:04:32.040> wanted<00:04:32.310> to<00:04:32.430> see<00:04:32.610> if<00:04:32.700> this<00:04:32.880> is<00:04:32.910> gonna<00:04:33.210> work

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
just wanted to see if this is gonna work

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:40.820 
just wanted to see if this is gonna work
right<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:35.460> it<00:04:36.030> did<00:04:37.550> so<00:04:38.750> that<00:04:39.750> being<00:04:40.050> said<00:04:40.140> I

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
right and it did so that being said I

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.800 
right and it did so that being said I
won't<00:04:41.010> swing<00:04:41.340> this<00:04:41.610> back<00:04:41.910> up<00:04:42.270> again

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.450 

that<00:04:45.810> was<00:04:45.990> good<00:04:46.230> it<00:04:46.350> helps<00:04:46.650> me<00:04:46.770> my<00:04:46.950> motors

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
that was good it helps me my motors

00:04:47.460 --> 00:05:07.650 
that was good it helps me my motors
bought<00:04:47.790> them<00:04:50.180> okay

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.840 

all<00:05:08.290> right<00:05:08.530> so<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:08.920> looks<00:05:09.220> like<00:05:09.460> we're<00:05:09.670> where

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
all right so it looks like we're where

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.060 
all right so it looks like we're where
we<00:05:10.060> belong<00:05:10.510> so<00:05:10.540> I'll<00:05:11.140> tighten<00:05:11.410> this<00:05:11.620> up<00:05:11.860> and

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
we belong so I'll tighten this up and

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.550 
we belong so I'll tighten this up and
then<00:05:12.220> we'll<00:05:12.430> resume<00:05:15.540> okay<00:05:16.540> so<00:05:16.600> I<00:05:16.900> now<00:05:17.170> have<00:05:17.200> it

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
then we'll resume okay so I now have it

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:29.340 
then we'll resume okay so I now have it
mounted<00:05:19.410> let's<00:05:20.410> see<00:05:20.620> if<00:05:20.710> it<00:05:20.860> works<00:05:27.270> good<00:05:28.350> you

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:29.350 
mounted let's see if it works good you

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:35.619 
mounted let's see if it works good you
Express<00:05:29.770> down<00:05:30.040> clicks<00:05:30.460> back

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:35.629 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:52.450 

nice

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.030 

so<00:05:53.460> anyway<00:05:53.850> that's<00:05:54.060> how<00:05:54.300> you<00:05:54.360> do<00:05:54.660> it<00:05:55.040> I'm

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
so anyway that's how you do it I'm

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.830 
so anyway that's how you do it I'm
almost<00:05:56.280> wondering<00:05:56.700> if<00:05:56.970> maybe<00:05:57.150> I<00:05:57.330> should<00:05:57.600> lube

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
almost wondering if maybe I should lube

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.710 
almost wondering if maybe I should lube
up<00:05:58.050> the<00:05:58.230> track<00:05:58.530> a<00:05:58.560> little<00:05:59.010> bit<00:05:59.220> I<00:05:59.660> wonder<00:06:00.660> if

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
up the track a little bit I wonder if

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.010 
up the track a little bit I wonder if
that's<00:06:00.900> why<00:06:01.170> it's<00:06:01.350> having<00:06:01.740> a<00:06:02.720> little<00:06:03.720> trouble

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
that's why it's having a little trouble

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.290 
that's why it's having a little trouble
toward<00:06:04.890> the<00:06:05.040> top<00:06:05.250> course<00:06:05.580> the<00:06:05.730> engines<00:06:06.090> not

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
toward the top course the engines not

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.840 
toward the top course the engines not
running<00:06:06.510> the<00:06:06.810> battery's<00:06:07.320> voltage<00:06:07.640> is<00:06:08.640> down

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
running the battery's voltage is down

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.520 
running the battery's voltage is down
because<00:06:09.210> I've<00:06:09.360> been<00:06:09.510> playing<00:06:09.780> with<00:06:09.930> this<00:06:10.230> too

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
because I've been playing with this too

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.980 
because I've been playing with this too
so<00:06:12.470> anyway<00:06:13.470> that's<00:06:14.310> how<00:06:14.670> you<00:06:14.730> do<00:06:15.120> it<00:06:15.300> it<00:06:15.810> really

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
so anyway that's how you do it it really

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.740 
so anyway that's how you do it it really
wasn't<00:06:16.290> that<00:06:16.500> bad<00:06:16.800> actually<00:06:17.160> I<00:06:17.880> think<00:06:18.510> the

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:18.750 
wasn't that bad actually I think the

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.480 
wasn't that bad actually I think the
biggest<00:06:18.930> pain<00:06:19.260> in<00:06:19.290> the<00:06:19.530> neck<00:06:19.680> was<00:06:19.860> that<00:06:20.010> stupid

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
biggest pain in the neck was that stupid

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.830 
biggest pain in the neck was that stupid
water<00:06:20.730> barrier<00:06:21.660> thing<00:06:22.050> junk<00:06:23.240> so<00:06:24.240> anyway<00:06:24.630> now

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
water barrier thing junk so anyway now

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.010 
water barrier thing junk so anyway now
it's<00:06:25.220> reassembly<00:06:26.220> time<00:06:26.540> and<00:06:27.540> I'll<00:06:27.750> show<00:06:27.960> you

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
it's reassembly time and I'll show you

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.710 
it's reassembly time and I'll show you
how<00:06:28.230> that's<00:06:28.380> done
