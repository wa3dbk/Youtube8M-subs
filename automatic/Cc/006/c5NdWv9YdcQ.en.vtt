00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:07.580
 Hello everyone, this is a review of 1000 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.800
 keep heading lead to you today 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.440
 I want to tell show how to 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.100
 you need to transplant fish that is when you 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.400
 purchased 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.170
 fish shop give you it sealed 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.600
 nearly 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.630
 or jars package they may be located 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.780
 long enough our case is three 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:31.270
 boxes and clown three things 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:34.130
 see that the water is clean enough 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.260
 pouch so when water is clean 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.500
 literally short and possible principle 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.460
 there with this water it is possible without this water i 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.850
 you next time 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.530
 any form will show the second way that is 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:51.620
 initially we are sealed package 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.800
 we omit it in the aquarium do not disclose and 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.120
 wait and a 10 minutes for what it's done 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.059
 this is done in order for us 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.250
 caught up from the temperature gradually not 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.339
 it fits sharply so the package in the aquarium 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.709
 for five minutes now anashkina put 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.230
 in 5 minutes I will continue the story that you need 

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:09.960
 do next 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.100
 but five minutes have passed 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.610
 our water temperature is equal to 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.790
 aquarium water now we need 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.580
 gradually mix this water which is 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.260
 we can cost in a package and which 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.420
 is in the aquarium this is done 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.630
 gradually, too, for what purpose 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.730
 chemical composition of water 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.330
 conquered and in that boiled where their 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.760
 brought 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.610
 different and so that the chemical composition of water 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.190
 gradually mixed also need 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.570
 do gradually open the pouch and 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.570
 add to this bag 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:51.659
 somewhere around convenient somewhere around 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.749
 like this 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.090
 water bag we add so now i 

00:01:54.749 --> 00:02:02.390
 a little help out to call uncomfortable 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.390
 shoot so well here's the pouch and opened and 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:16.910
 now a little scooped up scooped up 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.910
 now we will need to wait 5 minutes 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.910
 so well, that's five minutes we have passed and 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.610
 turned off 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.650
 now we will need to add more and 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:31.470
 so will need to do a total 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.470
 pirate still add 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:45.890
 led by how much water was still waiting 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.890
 five minutes 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.430
 and then we will need to add more 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.430
 water 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.760
 so here is the last final time 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:04.340
 beginners as far as 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.340
 now almost complete package and typing 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.540
 almost full package scored 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.120
 left to wait 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.219
 also five minutes will be possible them 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.030
 release the total time you go out 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:23.340
 it turns out 5 5 so 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.469
 it takes 20 minutes to properly transfer the fish 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.140
 but it will be necessary to translate the fish 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:29.909
 only if the water in the package is clean if 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.209
 the fish in it was not the head if its 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:35.310
 around in the pack a lot of fish and it is dirty 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.489
 then it will need another way I you 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.430
 I'll show a friend a video of how I'll take off here. 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.349
 Tymochka will all wait five minutes and 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.239
 will release 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:51.680
 so well, that's all the total time we have passed 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.680
 20 minutes now stand our lips more 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.310
 12 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.310
 3 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.000
 just released everything that's better here 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.310
 to translate a fish because to sharp 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.139
 there were no drops so the fish would be better 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.560
 themselves carry crossings 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.110
 Thank you all who watched my video
