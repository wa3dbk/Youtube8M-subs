put a needle into my pancreas and got a

put a needle into my pancreas and got a

few cells from the tumor I was sedated

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.530 
few cells from the tumor I was sedated
but<00:02:04.020> my<00:02:04.170> wife<00:02:04.410> who<00:02:04.710> was<00:02:04.860> there<00:02:05.130> told<00:02:05.910> me<00:02:06.030> that

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
but my wife who was there told me that

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.730 
but my wife who was there told me that
when<00:02:06.690> they<00:02:06.840> viewed<00:02:06.870> the<00:02:07.230> cells<00:02:07.440> under<00:02:07.710> a

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
when they viewed the cells under a

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.980 
when they viewed the cells under a
microscope<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.850> doctor<00:02:09.270> started<00:02:09.630> crying

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
microscope the doctor started crying

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.260 
microscope the doctor started crying
because<00:02:10.740> it<00:02:11.040> turned<00:02:11.220> out<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.490> be<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> very<00:02:11.970> rare

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
because it turned out to be a very rare

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.300 
because it turned out to be a very rare
form<00:02:12.600> of<00:02:12.720> pancreatic<00:02:12.960> cancer<00:02:13.740> that<00:02:13.920> is

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
form of pancreatic cancer that is

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.940 
form of pancreatic cancer that is
curable<00:02:14.370> with<00:02:14.850> surgery<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:15.510> had<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.530> surgery

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
curable with surgery I had the surgery

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:27.390 
curable with surgery I had the surgery
and<00:02:17.210> thankfully<00:02:18.210> I'm<00:02:18.390> fine<00:02:18.960> now

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.850 

this<00:02:28.090> was<00:02:28.299> the<00:02:28.420> closest<00:02:28.900> I've<00:02:29.079> been<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.349> facing

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
this was the closest I've been to facing

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.890 
this was the closest I've been to facing
death<00:02:30.069> and<00:02:30.310> I<00:02:30.849> hope<00:02:31.030> it's<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.329> closest<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:31.840> get

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
death and I hope it's the closest I get

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.440 
death and I hope it's the closest I get
for<00:02:32.409> a<00:02:32.439> few<00:02:32.620> more<00:02:32.739> decades<00:02:33.269> having<00:02:34.269> lived

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
for a few more decades having lived

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.690 
for a few more decades having lived
through<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:34.900> I<00:02:35.079> can<00:02:35.739> now<00:02:35.890> say<00:02:36.189> this<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.549> you

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
through it I can now say this to you

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.309 
through it I can now say this to you
with<00:02:37.030> a<00:02:37.060> bit<00:02:37.269> more<00:02:37.299> certainty<00:02:37.689> than<00:02:38.170> when

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
with a bit more certainty than when

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.929 
with a bit more certainty than when
death<00:02:38.530> was<00:02:38.769> a<00:02:38.980> useful<00:02:39.280> but<00:02:39.640> purely

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
death was a useful but purely

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:44.330 
death was a useful but purely
intellectual<00:02:40.510> concept<00:02:42.000> no<00:02:43.000> one<00:02:43.269> wants<00:02:43.989> to<00:02:44.049> die

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
intellectual concept no one wants to die

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.710 
intellectual concept no one wants to die
even<00:02:45.340> people<00:02:45.879> who<00:02:46.000> want<00:02:46.239> to<00:02:46.269> go<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.450> heaven

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
even people who want to go to heaven

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.449 
even people who want to go to heaven
don't<00:02:47.379> want<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.650> die<00:02:47.799> to<00:02:47.859> get<00:02:48.099> there

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
don't want to die to get there

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.960 
don't want to die to get there
and<00:02:48.780> yet<00:02:49.780> death<00:02:50.769> is<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.129> destination<00:02:51.340> we<00:02:51.939> all

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
and yet death is the destination we all

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.809 
and yet death is the destination we all
share<00:02:52.120> no<00:02:52.750> one<00:02:53.590> has<00:02:53.709> ever<00:02:53.920> escaped<00:02:54.430> it<00:02:54.640> and

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
share no one has ever escaped it and

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.199 
share no one has ever escaped it and
that<00:02:55.629> is<00:02:55.840> as<00:02:56.049> it<00:02:56.470> should<00:02:56.500> be<00:02:56.799> because<00:02:57.549> death<00:02:58.000> is

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
that is as it should be because death is

that is as it should be because death is
