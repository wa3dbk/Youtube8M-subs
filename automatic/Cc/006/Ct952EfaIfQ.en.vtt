00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.400
 My soul languishes without you, 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.360
 My land dries out without rain. 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.140
 Sand desert brings my sprout 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:42.320
 I can not bear fruit, I witch ... 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.260
 Oh, I need the Source so much, where always 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.640
 By day it would boil over and in water at night! 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.460
 What would ever quench my thirst 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:25.120
 And gave life to others on earth ... 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.980
 I ask for rain on this land 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:39.400
 Hear me, hear the prayers! 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.380
 Pour out your rain upon this land 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:55.420
 May the Holy Spirit change me! 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.360
 My soul languishes without you, 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.340
 My land dries out without rain. 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.020
 Sand desert brings my sprout 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:38.280
 I can not bear fruit, I witch ... 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.500
 Oh, I need the Source so much, where always 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.960
 By day it would boil over and in water at night! 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.760
 What would ever quench my thirst 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.280
 And gave life to others on earth ... 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.200
 I ask for rain on this land 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.040
 Hear me, hear the prayers! 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.820
 Pour out your rain upon this land 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.620
 May the Holy Spirit change me! 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.720
 And then my land will blossom forever 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.640
 The desert will never happen! 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.740
 And Your words in my heart 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.000
 Become Life once and for all! 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.780
 Strength, wonders and signs 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.280
 Faith and love and grace 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.080
 There will be my life - praise the Lord, 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.420
 And in me He will dwell! 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.200
 I ask for rain on this land 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:16.060
 Hear me, hear the prayers!

 I ask for rain on this land 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.240
 Hear me, hear the prayers! 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.400
 Pour out your rain upon this land 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.740
 May the Holy Spirit change me! 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.700
 I ask for rain on this land 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.460
 Hear me, hear the prayers! 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.120
