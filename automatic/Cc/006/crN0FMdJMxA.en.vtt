 claude damn us to mess with him 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.290
 if you and I kill him now then 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.030
 our trail rush all the police 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.800
 pack at the beginning of the twenty-first century 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.769
 Tyrone Corporation began to produce and 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.350
 the replicants of robots are practically nothing 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.809
 different from man 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.129
 nexus 6 replicants outnumbered people by 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.680
 strength and endurance 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.890
 nexus 6 intelligence is not inferior 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.720
 the intelligence of their creators replicants 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.589
 used in the outer worlds as 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.629
 labor force 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:01.180
 as well as when conducting hazardous 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.449
 research and colonization of planets 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.610
 after a bloody nexus 6 in me 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.840
 from the colonies of the outside world they were 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.690
 declared on earth 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.750
 outlaw special police units 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.299
 called blade-runners killed 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.150
 any replicant when detecting it on 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:22.830
 earth it was not called murder it 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.830
 was called to resign 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.000
 hi all friends today with you again 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.820
 Vladimir and today's heading she 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.770
 experimental i'm actually a gamer 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.079
 with experience and of course I'm playing 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.420
 modern blockbusters but there is one 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.490
 they are not a transient problem and they are unlikely 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.490
 can make you spend long 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.229
 long sleepless nights at the computer I 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.640
 I will not now and the network component 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.369
 just talking about games with a soul storyline and 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.600
 games that absorb you so now 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.429
 blade runner and you are a wonderful toy 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.020
 which is important made by developers 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.200
 westwood studios 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.390
 let's drop them don't say so wins 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.709
 strategy awards beyond all 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.689
 other westwood studios did 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:08.410
 great adventure games 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.899
 quests 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.500
 same gadgets kiran de so here 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.140
 bladerunner 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.849
 This is a quest although it is also impossible 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.640
 call it an adventure game 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.000
 based on the same film blade 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.590
 runner 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.079
 or in the Russian box office running on 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.019
 blade this movie told us about 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.459
 the future is probably not even far when 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.319
 people managed 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.170
 create in your own image and likeness 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.989
 cyborgs and the most modern ones were 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.430
 nexus so there was a problem with them and not 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.239
 confused with the same smartphone from 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.359
 android by the way and why is that okay 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.340
 just now I paid attention to the whole 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:48.160
 the point is that if you watched the movie 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.930
 and you liked both the atmosphere and the plot 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.150
 is it that all this was done noir but 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.670
 such a depressed atmosphere of everything 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.900
 what is happening is the most important thing here I am 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.840
 I think in games on films 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.790
 This is when the game can convey the atmosphere 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.040
 film and be able to immerse you so you 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.709
 could also empathize with the main character 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.569
 on the screen fear for their not destiny somehow 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.290
 fight trying to figure everything out 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.109
 happening 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.269
 to do bladerunner is one of the most 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:16.780
 There are such perfect representatives of the genre 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.760
 games for movies I advise everyone to play and 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.190
 don't just download it if you have it 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.290
 the disk is great to install it as if there 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.760
 Never after this movie I want 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.319
 I want to play it after the game 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.630
 get to know the movies but I had 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.780
 on the contrary, I first watched the movie so 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.209
 the toy came out on November 21, 1997 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.669
 it seems to be as old but without problems 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.440
 runs on windows 7 and if that 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.440
 will need to patch with 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.960
 applets up 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.450
 tacks they are not exactly a library so on 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.810
 the screen you haven't shaved everything bright there 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.060
 rainbow colors I can credit 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.340
 program from the box in the description of the video and 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.630
 let's a little bit on the game that is, we 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.840
 playing here is not the main character 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:04:00.350
 film, he somehow even recalls 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.030
 be theorists on ford but no major 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.980
 the hero is called ray macke 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.130
 and events happen at the same time 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.750
 what are the events of the film that's what me 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.280
 pleased with some locations that is 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.770
 same police station 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.590
 poultry market production laboratory 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.630
 eye for nexus of and other stuff they 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.070
 completely copied from the movie not 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.220
 be lazy to look and specially 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.140
 made a video series to demonstrate 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.480
 matching movies and games that is 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.180
 they are shown completely down to the angle 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.640
 which was the movie here so there are 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.650
 episodes when the main characters are mentioned 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.690
 that let's say the same Cartes went to 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.880
 retired on was again invited to 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.860
 the police to investigate 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.740
 kills here are related sex with Nekrasov 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.020
 also if you're an ardent fan and and you love 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.240
 absorb all that is for sure to study 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.890
 you will also like each location 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.830
 some fragments from films from 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.050
 photos let's say yes correspondent yes she will 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.820
 in the photographs a because of or and for like 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.280
 it will be right in Russian and that 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.830
 the most important guys is the quest and what 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.680
 the most interesting quest he completed 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.780
 so here are 16 endings you 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.540
 go to locations collect evidence 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.110
 do interrogations watch your 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.060
 by computer 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.550
 search for clues in photos using 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.740
 the super zoom future that is oh exactly 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.919
 as well as in the film itself is interesting 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.050
 that even if you saw the movie from 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.960
 what is happening on the computer screen here in 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.480
 this game is nothing like this 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.340
 as if the second film and his toys were 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.770
 these 15 plus because there is and 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.890
 killings are there let's say so some 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.540
 fragments there is one of admissible 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.820
 suspected was with pedophilia we 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.040
 inclinations that is this serious 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.380
 adult game is a serious quest quest 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.700
 in which you are not attached some 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.350
 location you are completely calm 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.270
 travel the city of the future 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.580
 some locations you gradually 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.570
 open that is the protagonist even 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.880
 have to shoot 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.100
 there is a mode here when you get your 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.630
 a pistol from a holster and shoot you can 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.980
 kill the innocent of it will 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.440
 certain consequences ie 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.900
 depending on all your actions 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.090
 sequences like you opened 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:08.660
 revealed there evidence of murder and stuff in 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:10.190
 the game has 16 16 endings options 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.080
 have you understand this game is not for one night 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.240
 if you like you want 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.220
 to act differently for example I am very 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.590
 I even remember remembering the moment very well 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.440
 when the first time passed and by chance 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:25.970
 shot a stroller in an alley taking vines 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:29.540
 nexus and later became a kind of well events 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:32.360
 these then made themselves felt somewhere a little 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.890
 closer to the middle of the game that is when 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.750
 re-passing of course I already 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.880
 would not kill and because of this were 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.680
 completely different consequences here 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.390
 interesting to follow the news that 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.430
 show on tv what 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:45.320
 tell the radio interesting 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.270
 talk to characters if you 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.820
 lucky look for different 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.770
 Sites, especially on rutraker there is a version 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.680
 with the smartest just transfer to 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.750
 in the purest Russian, everyone translated everything 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.000
 well done fargus it's just great 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.830
 translation is cool ie the actors are not 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.290
 lazy this is an example of one of the most 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:05.810
 best probably perfect voice acting 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.490
 Here in Russia, that is the same 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.150
 starcraft famously digested believe me 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.610
 bladerunner 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.160
 the game of actors is felt and it is very 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:15.020
 great besides everything else here is very 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.110
 many expensive videos that is 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.820
 rollers on the engine on the engine at that moment 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.250
 used virgin and tracks with 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.390
 entertainment and published a toy and they 

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.090
 used the engine 

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:28.130
 voxel layer that is on this engine was 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.560
 made not so many games it is really something 

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:32.810
 business is demanding but believe the graphics and 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.000
 videos are all just news 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.230
 The poison of this toy is thrilled I put 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.240
 solid top five 

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:40.070
 if you have not played, be sure to play 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.170
 if you are any not any 

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.910
 casual gamer on which the main thing there 

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:46.160
 graphics and the gameplay was so 

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.050
 idle no if the way out 

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.720
 if you love quests necessarily 

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:53.360
 pass I assure you you will be a game 

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.530
 satisfied also while i was talking to 

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.600
 you probably looked at you 

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:58.880
 demo passage 

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.070
 the first location in the game is very much 

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:03.410
 the locations of the game are very intense therefore 

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:05.390
 I advise everyone to go adventure toys 

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.010
 blade runner and watch a movie 

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.750
