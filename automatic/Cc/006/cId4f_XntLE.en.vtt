00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.380
 greetings friends horse here and in the video 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.209
 today came with a video very quickly 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.440
 with some news that went on during 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.270
 the week 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.509
 remembering that I do not usually do not 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:21.630
 sleep without knowing it this way but not 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:22.320
 delaying the news so you do 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.670
 like this 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.029
 also remember that they will be 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.999
 mentioned in the next do not sleep without knowing 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.650
 with staff today has finally been revealed 

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:35.010
 another character who will be 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.220
 present in why he makes and is nothing 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.530
 nothing less than the gamer last year 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.080
 fans voted to decide who they 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.910
 would like to see in pokémon internet and 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.980
 winning was the winner 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.050
 the Pokémon is a reflection of movements and 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.870
 also uses its mega evolution to 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.550
 further amplify your gum 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.030
 remembering that it is not yet known if the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.740
 game will be thrown to the river but I 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.730
 I'm crossing my fingers so this 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.880
 happen 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.430
 someone here is a fan of flamengo who here 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.610
 he got p out of life when he did not win 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.520
 a mega evolution because well finally the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.760
 game freak has decided to open fans who 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.290
 talk a little about flickr in a 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.730
 interview conducted by the magazine 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.000
 im nintendo 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.140
 the topic flaibam ended up popping up in a 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.030
 of questions 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.030
 in conversation with those who linger 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.460
 responsible for setting up councils and 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.740
 of the design of each pokémon sul de mori 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.640
 said Flavio not only did not appear from 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.940
 fact in the game due to a block 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.710
 how is it that the South Uncle 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.010
 talk just long I talk about the 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.799
 key characters that exist in the game and 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.810
 as they all have a pokémon that 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.259
 they achieve on average 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.880
 evolve but it was not a case of someone who 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.310
 I had many laymen 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.560
 it was then that he was asked about 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.430
 why the pokémon does not have a mega 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.170
 evolution 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.579
 this takes and responds as follows 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.590
 way 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.100
 there I had great potential for 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.050
 mega evolve from pokémon xey 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.360
 but we were not able to complete his 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.670
 then dis design consider the idea 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.980
 to bring him to the game 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.690
 What can we say that mega flaibam up 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.330
 exists on paper 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.540
 with their status and skills but still 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.060
 It has an appearance that we see it 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.940
 in the future, remembering that it takes time 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.160
 also one of those responsible for giving a signal 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.440
 about the seventh generation 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.569
 soon after the launch of pokémon x and y 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.069

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.349
 what is game freak is already 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.870
 working in the seventh generation of games 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.500
 and states that the game will redeem the 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.150
 simple first generation mechanics 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.760
