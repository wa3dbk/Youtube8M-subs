00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
in the Sen set we are we are using the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.030 
in the Sen set we are we are using the
shark's<00:00:32.040> grip<00:00:32.309> high<00:00:32.610> gloss<00:00:33.230> resin<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.860> is

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
shark's grip high gloss resin this is

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.759 
shark's grip high gloss resin this is
the<00:00:35.190> 225<00:00:35.970> part<00:00:36.300> number<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:37.080> can<00:00:37.230> see<00:00:37.440> it's<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 
the 225 part number you can see it's the

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:40.959 
the 225 part number you can see it's the
brilliant<00:00:38.220> white<00:00:38.400> resin<00:00:38.970> and<00:00:39.469> all<00:00:40.469> we<00:00:40.680> did

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
brilliant white resin and all we did

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.979 
brilliant white resin and all we did
while<00:00:41.969> we<00:00:42.149> did<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:42.870> take<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:44.989> manufactured

while we did is we take and manufactured
a<00:00:46.610> catalyst<00:00:47.610> work<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.329> primer

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
a catalyst work this is a primer

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.529 
a catalyst work this is a primer
catalyst<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.460> versatility<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
catalyst so the versatility of the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.639 
catalyst so the versatility of the
primer<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.199> one<00:00:52.940> you<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:54.149> use<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.359> 216<00:00:55.289> part

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
primer is one you can use a 216 part

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.490 
primer is one you can use a 216 part
number<00:00:56.539> or<00:00:57.620> with<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> 225<00:00:59.600> resin<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.750> that

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
use a 215 part number and convert it to

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.330 
use a 215 part number and convert it to
a<00:01:06.390> primer<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.530> you're<00:01:07.649> only<00:01:07.800> carrying<00:01:08.100> one

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340

white single resin the only thing that
will<00:01:11.399> change<00:01:11.429> is<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.910> catalyst<00:01:12.450> say<00:01:13.259> it<00:01:13.350> again

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
will change is a catalyst say it again

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.270 
will change is a catalyst say it again
two<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:15.000> five<00:01:15.270> white<00:01:16.020> resin<00:01:16.470> normal<00:01:16.950> sharks

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
about this primer is no telegraphing our

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.870 
about this primer is no telegraphing our
last<00:01:35.400> primer<00:01:36.079> well<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.259> liked<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.549> not<00:01:38.759> as

much as I like this this is very very
very<00:01:41.939> creamy<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.530> sprays<00:01:43.920> down<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.610> lays

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
very creamy so it sprays down and lays

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.539 
very creamy so it sprays down and lays
out<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> top<00:01:46.350> coat<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:46.979> there<00:01:47.399> no

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
out just like a top coat so there no

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.660 
out just like a top coat so there no
telegraphing<00:01:48.390> through<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:49.380> a<00:01:49.409> steel<00:01:50.340> tub

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
telegraphing through like a steel tub

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.490 
telegraphing through like a steel tub
you<00:01:51.360> know<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.570> get<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.719> when<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.200> put<00:01:52.469> a

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
you know you get that when you put a

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.350 
you know you get that when you put a
primer<00:01:52.770> down<00:01:53.040> your<00:01:53.640> finishers<00:01:54.060> don't<00:01:54.240> have

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
primer down your finishers don't have

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.950 
primer down your finishers don't have
the<00:01:54.479> opportunity<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.020> come<00:01:55.110> back<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.500> sand<00:01:55.710> so

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
the opportunity to come back and sand so

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.590 
the opportunity to come back and sand so
the<00:01:57.960> better<00:01:58.229> our<00:01:58.409> primer<00:01:58.740> lays<00:01:59.189> down<00:01:59.600> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
the better our primer lays down the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.039 
the better our primer lays down the
better<00:02:00.780> you're<00:02:00.960> going<00:02:01.079> to<00:02:01.170> have<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.469> finish

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
better you're going to have the finish

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:03.779 
better you're going to have the finish
all<00:02:02.289> right<00:02:02.439> the<00:02:02.829> other<00:02:02.950> thing<00:02:03.189> is<00:02:03.399> it's<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.759> very

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
all right the other thing is it's a very

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.330 
all right the other thing is it's a very
very<00:02:04.329> creamy<00:02:04.689> resin<00:02:05.229> you<00:02:05.619> know<00:02:05.740> I<00:02:05.799> think<00:02:06.100> I

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
very creamy resin you know I think I

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.699 
very creamy resin you know I think I
highlighted<00:02:06.789> that<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:07.299> won<00:02:07.539> one<00:02:08.229> sentence

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
highlighted that and won one sentence

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.550 
highlighted that and won one sentence
here<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.220> I<00:02:09.280> can't<00:02:09.519> say<00:02:09.670> enough<00:02:09.849> about<00:02:09.970> that

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
here and I can't say enough about that

the catalyst has been upgraded want to

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.949 
the catalyst has been upgraded want to
get<00:02:14.980> hit<00:02:15.190> on<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.430> over<00:02:15.819> and<00:02:15.940> over<00:02:16.180> before<00:02:16.690> we
