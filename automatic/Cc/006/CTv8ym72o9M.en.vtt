whatever it was that whatever so anyway
um<00:01:43.070> now<00:01:44.070> my<00:01:44.430> first<00:01:44.579> thought<00:01:44.820> was<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.240> soft<00:01:47.990> it's

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
um now my first thought was is soft it's

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.039 
um now my first thought was is soft it's
up<00:01:49.490> um<00:01:50.490> thing<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:51.060> when<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.270> was<00:01:51.420> installing<00:01:51.720> it

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
up um thing is when I was installing it

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.130 
up um thing is when I was installing it
I<00:01:52.590> did<00:01:53.009> feel<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:54.420> needle<00:01:54.780> was<00:01:54.869> going

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
I did feel like the needle was going

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.700 
I did feel like the needle was going
through<00:01:55.290> really<00:01:55.470> smoothly<00:01:55.920> for<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.729> first<00:01:57.710> 12

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
through really smoothly for the first 12

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.030 
through really smoothly for the first 12
for<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.549> first<00:01:59.790> two<00:02:00.090> rows<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:01.619> was<00:02:01.829> going

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
for the first two rows it was going

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.639 
for the first two rows it was going
through<00:02:02.280> smoothly<00:02:02.549> by<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:02.969> third<00:02:03.329> row<00:02:03.869> it

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
through smoothly by the third row it

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.089 
through smoothly by the third row it
just<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:06.329> was<00:02:06.600> stiff<00:02:06.840> as<00:02:07.229> like<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.799> ain't

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
just it was stiff as like it ain't

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.430 
just it was stiff as like it ain't
even<00:02:08.310> go<00:02:08.429> through<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.569> I'd<00:02:09.690> work<00:02:09.929> around<00:02:10.289> it

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
even go through so I'd work around it

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.050 
even go through so I'd work around it
you'd<00:02:10.590> say<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.890> as<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.039> positive<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.640> negative

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
you'd say it as a positive a negative

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.820 
you'd say it as a positive a negative
but<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.540> didn't<00:02:12.750> really<00:02:12.840> matter<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.349> me<00:02:13.380> so<00:02:13.800> I

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
but it didn't really matter to me so I

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.320 
but it didn't really matter to me so I
didn't<00:02:14.040> really<00:02:14.069> care<00:02:14.250> i<00:02:14.430> just<00:02:14.550> was<00:02:14.880> sharing<00:02:15.239> it

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
didn't really care i just was sharing it

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.820 
didn't really care i just was sharing it
because<00:02:15.569> this<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:15.959> just<00:02:15.989> what<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.349> thought<00:02:16.650> of

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
because this is just what I thought of

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.880 
because this is just what I thought of
the<00:02:16.920> hair<00:02:17.209> since<00:02:18.209> you<00:02:18.450> know<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.989> just<00:02:19.440> got<00:02:19.800> it

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
the hair since you know I just got it

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.949 
the hair since you know I just got it
