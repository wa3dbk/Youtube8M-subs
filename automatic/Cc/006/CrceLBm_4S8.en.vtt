be the answer for trophy fish number one

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.580 
be the answer for trophy fish number one
that's<00:01:04.739> just<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.970> norm<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.570> number<00:01:07.110> two<00:01:07.260> it's

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
that's just the norm and number two it's

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.109 
that's just the norm and number two it's
easier<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.130> people<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.909> aren't

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
easier for people that aren't

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.510 
easier for people that aren't
experienced<00:01:09.960> fishermen<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:11.010> catch<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.369> big

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
experienced fishermen to catch a big

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.929

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
fish on shiners plastic worms are great

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.760 
fish on shiners plastic worms are great
and<00:01:15.180> I've<00:01:15.630> got<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> lot<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.110> big<00:01:16.380> fish<00:01:16.560> on

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
and I've got a lot of big fish on

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.679 
and I've got a lot of big fish on
plastic<00:01:17.159> worms<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:17.820> hard<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.210> detect<00:01:18.509> a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
plastic worms that it's hard to detect a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.200 
plastic worms that it's hard to detect a
strike<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:20.009> shiners<00:01:20.490> they<00:01:20.850> pretty<00:01:21.119> well

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
strike and with shiners they pretty well

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.780 
strike and with shiners they pretty well
annihilate<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.979> there's<00:01:23.310> no<00:01:23.490> doubt<00:01:23.759> that

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
annihilate it so there's no doubt that

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.140 
annihilate it so there's no doubt that
you<00:01:24.150> have<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> fish<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:25.100> these<00:01:26.100> are<00:01:26.310> extra<00:01:26.970> large

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
you have a fish on these are extra large

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.990 
you have a fish on these are extra large
domestic<00:01:27.570> shiners<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:29.369> wintertime<00:01:29.700> we

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
domestic shiners in the wintertime we

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.609 
domestic shiners in the wintertime we
use<00:01:30.210> wild<00:01:30.689> shiners<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.290> they're<00:01:31.439> too

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
use wild shiners but they're too

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.890 
use wild shiners but they're too
expensive<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:32.250> use<00:01:32.400> year-round<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.720> just

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
expensive to use year-round so we just

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.230 
expensive to use year-round so we just
buy<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.110> extra<00:01:34.500> large<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.850> hook<00:01:36.090> it

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
once it hits the water you give it a

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.420 
once it hits the water you give it a
