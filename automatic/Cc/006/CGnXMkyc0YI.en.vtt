probably 25 like as you know as a

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.780 
probably 25 like as you know as a
batting<00:00:23.010> group<00:00:23.190> you<00:00:23.370> should<00:00:23.460> have<00:00:23.670> been<00:00:23.760> a

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:23.790 
batting group you should have been a

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.580 
batting group you should have been a
little<00:00:23.910> bit<00:00:24.120> better<00:00:24.240> really<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.200> puts<00:00:25.500> a

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
little bit better really and that puts a

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.590 
little bit better really and that puts a
little<00:00:25.860> bit<00:00:25.950> of<00:00:26.040> pressure<00:00:26.280> we<00:00:27.240> had<00:00:27.360> a<00:00:27.390> good

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
little bit of pressure we had a good

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.000 
little bit of pressure we had a good
opportunity<00:00:27.870> to<00:00:28.260> take<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> couple<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.740> early
