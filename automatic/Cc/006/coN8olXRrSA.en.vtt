00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
one thing that I felt they could have

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.599 
one thing that I felt they could have
done<00:03:11.909> better<00:03:12.060> with<00:03:12.209> this<00:03:12.510> is<00:03:12.799> that<00:03:13.799> they<00:03:14.129> could

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
done better with this is that they could

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.809

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
have combined all of it together so that

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.110 
have combined all of it together so that
is<00:03:18.120> just<00:03:18.329> one<00:03:18.599> long<00:03:18.959> 90-minute<00:03:19.530> documentary

instead you have to watch it in sections
what<00:03:23.459> I'd<00:03:23.579> love<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.090> see<00:03:24.299> is<00:03:24.569> that<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:25.500> would<00:03:25.650> be

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
what I'd love to see is that it would be

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.979 
what I'd love to see is that it would be
just<00:03:25.980> one<00:03:26.220> long<00:03:26.489> 90-minute<00:03:26.910> documentary<00:03:27.269> and

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
just one long 90-minute documentary and

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.770 
just one long 90-minute documentary and
then<00:03:28.530> if<00:03:28.919> you<00:03:29.370> want<00:03:29.579> to<00:03:29.669> skip<00:03:29.819> a<00:03:29.879> chapter<00:03:30.419> then

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
then if you want to skip a chapter then

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.500 
then if you want to skip a chapter then
you<00:03:30.930> can<00:03:31.079> do<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.409> in<00:03:31.739> this<00:03:32.310> version<00:03:32.579> for<00:03:33.389> what

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
you can do that in this version for what

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.449 
you can do that in this version for what
they<00:03:33.629> did<00:03:33.810> with<00:03:33.930> ending<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.379> night<00:03:34.590> it's<00:03:35.280> not

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
they did with ending the night it's not

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.369 
they did with ending the night it's not
like<00:03:35.669> that<00:03:35.730> at<00:03:35.909> all<00:03:36.150> but<00:03:36.389> that<00:03:36.599> doesn't<00:03:37.290> mean

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
like that at all but that doesn't mean

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.619 
like that at all but that doesn't mean
to<00:03:37.409> say<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.739> there<00:03:38.430> isn't<00:03:38.730> bad<00:03:38.879> content<00:03:39.419> the

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
to say that there isn't bad content the

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.170 
to say that there isn't bad content the
content<00:03:39.840> is<00:03:40.260> great<00:03:40.590> but<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.489> interface<00:03:41.970> is

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
content is great but the interface is

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.270 
content is great but the interface is
just<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.810> little<00:03:43.079> bit<00:03:43.349> choppy<00:03:43.650> then<00:03:44.099> of<00:03:44.250> course

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
just a little bit choppy then of course

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.830 
just a little bit choppy then of course
there's<00:03:44.760> something<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.150> I<00:03:45.269> love<00:03:45.599> and<00:03:45.629> that

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
there's something that I love and that

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.899 
there's something that I love and that
is<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.169> trailers<00:03:46.650> archive<00:03:47.099> what<00:03:47.579> I<00:03:47.609> always

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
is the trailers archive what I always

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:49.729 
is the trailers archive what I always
hope<00:03:48.329> for<00:03:48.359> whenever<00:03:48.900> they<00:03:49.079> do<00:03:49.349> trailer

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
hope for whenever they do trailer

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.460 
hope for whenever they do trailer
archives<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.489> that<00:03:51.090> they<00:03:51.299> put<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.690> TV<00:03:51.959> spots

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
archives is that they put the TV spots

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.289 
archives is that they put the TV spots
in<00:03:52.709> them<00:03:52.889> as<00:03:53.040> well<00:03:53.069> they<00:03:53.609> didn't<00:03:53.849> do<00:03:53.940> that<00:03:54.060> for

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
in them as well they didn't do that for

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.789 
in them as well they didn't do that for
the<00:03:54.389> dark<00:03:54.599> knight<00:03:54.750> rises<00:03:54.900> they<00:03:55.199> also<00:03:55.379> then<00:03:55.650> do

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
the dark knight rises they also then do

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.710 
the dark knight rises they also then do
that<00:03:55.949> for<00:03:56.129> a<00:03:56.159> lot<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.400> blu-ray<00:03:57.060> releases<00:03:57.389> of

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
that for a lot of blu-ray releases of

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.719 
that for a lot of blu-ray releases of
other<00:03:57.959> major<00:03:58.229> movies<00:03:58.680> but<00:03:59.069> at<00:03:59.190> least<00:03:59.340> we<00:03:59.549> got
