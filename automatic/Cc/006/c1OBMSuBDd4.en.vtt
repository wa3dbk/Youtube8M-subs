00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.439
 furniture that is seasoned very well 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.570
 and add salt and the consomme 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.030

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.610
 then I'm just going to wait for 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.220

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.570
 began to let the boil go to 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.570
 add our numbers 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.800
 let's stir it well 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.510
 the nopalitos that are already 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.640
 cooked 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.540
 and our potatoes that are cooked 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.659
 and peeled 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:35.170
 let's leave here to let the boil 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:35.170
 to add our shrimp 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.580
 here we have our numbers these 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:48.030
 they are ready I added the shrimp 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.610
 but I added it in this apart a bit and 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.620
 I added the shrimp here because to me 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.800
 family does not all like the 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:00.120
 then with nothing but shrimp 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.610
 more I'll leave here about two or three 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.890
 minutes and I'll turn it off to be able to serve 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.170
 our numbers 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.170
 That's how our numbers have been 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:16.330
 As you can see they are very easy to do 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.900
 and they are very rich 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.420
