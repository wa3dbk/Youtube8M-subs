00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.000
 I wanted to say that if you want to add me 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.500

 number of lives that I have and he adds me 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.869
 just for that reason if you add me it's like that so 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.130
 I 'm going to add that you are 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.359
 subscribers you add is because no 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.010
 I have no problem in adding or 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.420
 play with you from time to time and 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.279
 as you see I have two thousand seventy five 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.900
 teeth next week when it comes out 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.970
 to exodus I could buy all the 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.470
 improvements and you keep uploading it to the channel 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.360
 but come on if you want to see me play in 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.400
 I live I have an account on twitter from 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.170
 the one that I'm going to retransmit my games and 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.020
 nothing will be there if you want to see me play 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.850
 Live and online good at what 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.070
 consists of the trick this one of lobby of point 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.020
 contact is in making the second 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.700
 meteorite container before which we go 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.130
 to be able to arrive before the helicopter this 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.500
 meteorite usually goes down in two seconds in 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.970
 two minutes 05 seconds as you see me 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.340
 could have reached the helicopter in 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.840
 two minutes 20 but come on, people do not know 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.650
 you know this trick then it's my turn 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.910
 wait 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.080
 I'll explain how to do it for 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.420
 do this trick what we have to 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.070
 to do is place a turret in the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.380
 second zone of the map before pressing 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.520
 the escape button does not have in the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.380
 turret can be a turret 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.240
 grenade launcher or it can be a turret 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.280
 manual can be improved or be without 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.140
 improve and we put it in this part of the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.910
 soil does not have to be that 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.280
 I exactly put that syringe 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.870
 syringe in it as a reference then 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.040
 well once we start fleeing to the 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.900
 get to this point we have to 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.530
 grab us to the turret from outside and 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.690
 as you see 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.550
 does like a kind of teleportation 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.810
 and it gets us into the next phase of the 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.450
 flight 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.979
 you do not have to do anything in you do not have 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.160
 to shoot you do not have to do anything 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.500
 just stay in this in this 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.119
 turret for the machine to think that 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.770
 let's move forward we're in the 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.540
 next area of ​​the map when in 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.020
 actually we are still in the third 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.820
 with it, what we are going to do is make 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.220
 that the machine thinks that the one 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.380
 we are in this area as I said and that 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.530
 start counting the time to get off 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.910
 the second meteorite the time in which 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.800
 lower the second meteorite will depend 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.019
 of the time you stay in the turret 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.430
 if you carry enhancers if you stay 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.159
 a lot of time 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.109
 Well, it's going to open before but I 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:17.700
 enhancers as you see here then 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:20.069
 I 'm still a bit confined but 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.390
 Right away you see work because 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.109
 stayed quite a while in the 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.930
 turret 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:27.030
 and nothing that's all as I said no 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.040
 it takes nothing more than staying the 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.359
 turret and nothing next week and 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.280
 When I leave so2 I'm going up 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.139
 little things so nothing I hope that I have 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.670
 liked this trick greetings to all and 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:37.670
 thanks for watching the video as always
