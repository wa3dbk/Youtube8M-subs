00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.599
 what quality in digital game and with 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.280
 luck with priceless prices just have 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.150
 games and use our history code 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:23.369
 purchases to take 50 off 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:24.300
 Hey you guys, youtube video. 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.099
 you 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.800
 First came here to thank 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.969
 you the ordinary speedy bextra that had 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.200
 in the episode the top 5 in the first I 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.460
 I think the first chain I made 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.620
 what the channel if I am not mistaken because 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.930
 I'm not much of a fan of chains or 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.690
 I think the guys that are more 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.090
 old woman who knows the channel and I came 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.640
 So I 've seen the current I've been very 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.160
 glad to have you 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.100
 as I can tell you have indicated that 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.090
 It was a friend of mine, Hayashi and I liked it. 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.469
 very 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.730
 the top 5 was a way I wanted to do 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.829
 a style of that video that I never 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.760
 I had the idea is not to say if I had 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.720
 That fucking thing in the head that wanted to make a 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.100
 video of this style 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.799
 but I had never gotten on with the face 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.570
 in the head and someone indicated me and with a 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.979
 which I probably already wanted 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.259
 I did it a long time ago but I never 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.509
 I had an interesting idea in my head. 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.490
 do that also that they indicated me and 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.020
 hollow to make a video on my 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.509
 opinion one of the best than on the channel 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.850
 because it was very good to record that video 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.909
 and it was very interesting of you too 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.040
 see neckel the weapons that the course also 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.970
 see the water you hear that there 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.950
 in the comments 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.049
 I found it very interesting too 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.880
 anyway the first subject of the video is 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.920
 basically I think the only one of these 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.170
 video or bring it to you is what is 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.439
 happening with the channel where the series 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.780
 Where are the videos and I already tell you 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.610
 People, I do not know what we can. 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.649
 bring the channel because I really am 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.869
 very no idea i'm well off 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.939
 even because you know the channel is a 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.979
 fps channel I can do any 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.689
 probably more focused on 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.659
 culture as you know it 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.360
 however I do not have many ideas in 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.860
 Head, I just see the idea, guys. 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.190
 I asked the people on twitter a lot. 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.110
 People gave me the idea of rtv rtc ertc 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.840
 really I'm not very into the vibe of 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.209
 do here 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.430
 now at least not now since the bel 3 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.860
 It will turn and there will be a lot of video 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.050
 on sic channel it gets smart there I vote one 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.060
 hype says graminha you will see a whole 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.790

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.190

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.319
 many light on the channel that I 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.810
 showing you laszlo if you do not 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.430
 Follow me on the blue cap of the 1st followed item 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.190
 registration will I do there and will put 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.870
 damn but open and let's go like this 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.670
 also coming back a lot of video and beta 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.380
 block leaving you 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.640
 and that's what I 'm trying to bring to 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.130
 you before launching open 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.599
 first I want to bring a rpg that 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.860
 the crowd a lot of people I asked 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.590
 twitter about this as I said to 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.329
 and you guys gave me much of rtg 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.500
 trt / ce the galley that will prevent 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:04.180
 but a lot of people talk about mw3 rpg 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.890
 of black to the two types of blocks today 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.980
 I would like to bring of cove 3 also 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.299
 what a game I like to play so more 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.950
 looking 30 thousand 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.140
 so it's easier to pick up a 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.060
 Let's go golden so you only get the 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.980
 level of the weapon that at each level you go 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.920
 releasing and releasing the gold camouflage is 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.900
 simple and bel 2 is more 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.940
 complicated on the track and make headshot 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.350
 depending on my choice or must 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.600
 take a shot depending on the area you 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.220
 chose to do a rap well kill 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.950
 with a shot only then it depends 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.989
 quite so then yes I 'm wanting it 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.450
 I'm going to leave a vote down here. 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.970
 if you can vote and leave right there 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:43.989
 Please, what you want to see is a 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.819
 rpg know there where 103 a rpg 62 will 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.190
 leave in the description you go back there that 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.560
 I already have this idea in my head to 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.880
 and today you guys today the fifth fair 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.919
 video still played on the video in the 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.870
 Wednesday night and it's being today 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.700
 late in the video and today I probably 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.620
 I'll make a list one channel will 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.970
 be here in the description as I said 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.370
 For you do not forget to give unfollow 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.859
 there and also when I left live 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.630
 stream I return to a video on the channel 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.120
 I warn you as you always let go of one 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.470
 video already tells you that on the channel 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.989
 starting a light workout to another 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.760
 platform and you guys take a look there 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.959
 because I'm trying to bring the greatest 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.970
 content that I can 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.099
 in life x because the galas enjoy gameplay 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.380
 live and a good show to make mpb to 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:27.090
 live is my opposite to live is one of the 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.400
 better then my videos 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.360
 Let's say so, but I'm going too, guys. 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.910
 do the following 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.490
 plus so let the two votes 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.860
 I'll leave it in the same vote, I'll leave it 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.449
 a third option that the videos option 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.850
 live is because a lot of people ask me 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.710
 for your live videos and that in your 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.380
 what kind I like all the videos 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.360
 Live, but it's mine I think 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.400
 I do not know about you, but if you 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.570
 they think they do not like my 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.639
 comment as I have seen many people 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.470
 commenting, do not forget to comment and do not 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.760
 below is why it is where I can see the 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.130
 feedback from you 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.290
 so please comment below are 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.510
 continuous if you want or live 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.700
 You want the RPG you vote in the astral. 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.590
 I will not let the registration and do 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.090
 all this is for you to watch the videos 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.950
 on the channel because I really am 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.190
 few ideas in my head I think the 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:17.400
 what comes in the head now is talking and doing 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.110
 a rpg with the make a live and speech 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.580
 until then I think even things of the day to 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.500
 day was also interesting to bring more 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.020
 my life is not so interesting 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.539
 so I let go, but let's go 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.580
 so but anyway that's what brings me 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.220
 here for you this game play there is from 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.990
 mw2 nothing out of the top 5 there I do not know if 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.400
 I commented that at the beginning of the video is 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.229
 one of the great players that I got there 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.780
 It's a fucking good time because the gun 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:42.030
 that the shorter dodo in two like you 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.760
 know until 2011 and a game very well with 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.220
 her with anyone so any map 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.410
 so the world is unfortunately a robbery 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:51.060
 iphone but if she was a rose I guess 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.039
 that it would be nice to see power in my 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.470
 opinion but being a robbery is already good 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:57.660
 Too much for me today, it 's too short. 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.400
 this weapon she did not have much choice 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.229
 good match at least in my opinion 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.200
 it was not very good but a lot of people are going 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.970
 To say that was good because God 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.130
 year 2 as you know is a game 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.229
 different is a code is another game 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.240
 different like all the others, because 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.729
 You have to play slower than you. 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.229
 can not pull too much if it does not run out 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.940
 mainly fucking assault 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:20.400
 hiphone let's say like this 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.349
 and this law I was I recorded together with 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:25.849
 That's when we were running. 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:28.580
 behind the grips the top-5 there along with 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:29.689
 along with a lot of people there but at last it was 

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.849
 That's what I wanted to say if you 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:33.469
 They like to forget to leave the one who 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:34.759
 favorite can give publicity if 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:36.139
 subscribe to the channel and also leave 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:37.819

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.069
 I sign social as twitter

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:48.789
 description beauty has there we see the 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:48.789
 Next video is this and people are talking
