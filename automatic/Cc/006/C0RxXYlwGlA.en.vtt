00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
little bit of something that I don't

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.050 
little bit of something that I don't
it's<00:02:06.930> not<00:02:07.590> as<00:02:07.799> bad<00:02:07.829> as<00:02:08.039> if<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.429> cheated<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.940> had

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
it's not as bad as if I cheated and had

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.369 
it's not as bad as if I cheated and had
some<00:02:09.300> sprite<00:02:09.629> because<00:02:09.929> that's<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.259> ultimate

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
some sprite because that's the ultimate

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.660 
some sprite because that's the ultimate
goal<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.920> not<00:02:11.190> drink<00:02:11.610> sprite<00:02:11.790> anymore

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
goal to not drink sprite anymore

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.250 
goal to not drink sprite anymore
but<00:02:12.849> I'm<00:02:13.000> going<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.180> try<00:02:13.300> not<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.720> cheat<00:02:13.959> at<00:02:14.140> all

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
but I'm going to try not to cheat at all

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.650 
but I'm going to try not to cheat at all
anymore<00:02:14.620> um<00:02:14.980> so<00:02:15.849> I<00:02:15.880> should<00:02:16.000> probably<00:02:16.030> not<00:02:16.330> hang

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
anymore um so I should probably not hang

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.699 
anymore um so I should probably not hang
out<00:02:16.720> with<00:02:16.780> Brett<00:02:17.220> um<00:02:18.959> but<00:02:19.959> yeah<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:20.349> don't<00:02:20.590> think

a little tired but I felt I don't know
when<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:33.430> woke<00:02:33.670> up<00:02:33.790> in<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.000> morning<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.390> felt

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
when I woke up in the morning I felt

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.160 
when I woke up in the morning I felt
kind<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.230> better<00:02:35.440> than<00:02:35.650> usual<00:02:36.100> um<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:37.510> didn't

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
kind of better than usual um I didn't

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.130 
kind of better than usual um I didn't
feel<00:02:38.440> as<00:02:38.950> tired<00:02:39.880> as<00:02:40.269> I<00:02:40.420> do<00:02:40.480> when<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:40.870> wake<00:02:41.080> up

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
feel as tired as I do when I wake up

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.220 
feel as tired as I do when I wake up
usually<00:02:42.030> maybe<00:02:43.030> it's<00:02:43.209> my<00:02:43.390> head<00:02:43.630> I<00:02:43.660> don't<00:02:43.989> know

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
usually maybe it's my head I don't know

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.770 
usually maybe it's my head I don't know
but<00:02:44.590> it's<00:02:45.100> just<00:02:45.220> that's<00:02:45.580> how<00:02:45.790> I<00:02:45.819> felt<00:02:46.060> I<00:02:46.269> also

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
but it's just that's how I felt I also

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.050 
but it's just that's how I felt I also
think<00:02:47.170> it's<00:02:48.069> probably<00:02:48.400> too<00:02:48.519> soon<00:02:48.550> for<00:02:48.880> this<00:02:48.970> to

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
think it's probably too soon for this to

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.330 
think it's probably too soon for this to
happen<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:49.720> might<00:02:50.140> okay<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.620> was<00:02:50.830> just<00:02:50.950> New<00:02:51.160> York

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
happen it might okay I was just New York

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.820 
happen it might okay I was just New York
like<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:51.580> told<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:51.880> guys<00:02:51.970> before<00:02:52.239> so<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:53.650> might

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
like I told you guys before so it might

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.140 
like I told you guys before so it might
be<00:02:53.860> because<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.160> that<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.519> you<00:02:54.610> but<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:54.790> think<00:02:55.030> my

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
be because of that to you but I think my

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.500 
be because of that to you but I think my
skin<00:02:55.569> is<00:02:55.840> getting<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.470> little<00:02:56.709> better<00:02:56.950> um<00:02:57.510> I

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
skin is getting a little better um I

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.360 
skin is getting a little better um I
don't<00:02:59.350> think<00:02:59.530> it's<00:02:59.739> because<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.010> soda<00:03:00.250> cuz

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
don't think it's because the soda cuz

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.550 
don't think it's because the soda cuz
it's<00:03:00.489> too<00:03:00.610> soon<00:03:00.850> for<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.239> isn't<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.690> first<00:03:02.080> my

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
it's too soon for that isn't it first my

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.809 
it's too soon for that isn't it first my
skin<00:03:02.830> to<00:03:02.950> have<00:03:03.069> effects<00:03:03.400> from<00:03:03.549> not<00:03:03.730> drinking

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
skin to have effects from not drinking

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.550 
skin to have effects from not drinking
soda<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.600> I<00:03:04.630> think<00:03:04.720> maybe<00:03:04.930> it's<00:03:05.110> just<00:03:05.170> going

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
soda so I think maybe it's just going

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.640 
soda so I think maybe it's just going
from<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.950> New<00:03:06.100> York<00:03:07.049> atmosphere<00:03:08.049> to<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.380> LA

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
from the New York atmosphere to the LA

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.620 
from the New York atmosphere to the LA
atmosphere<00:03:09.130> maybe<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.640> have<00:03:09.880> better<00:03:10.000> skin<00:03:10.330> in

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
atmosphere maybe I have better skin in

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.559 
atmosphere maybe I have better skin in
LA<00:03:10.959> I<00:03:11.140> don't<00:03:11.350> know<00:03:12.150> but<00:03:13.150> that's<00:03:13.269> just<00:03:13.360> when<00:03:13.540> I

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569
