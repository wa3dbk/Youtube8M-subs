see see can you see that the water
started<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.119> leave<00:01:25.360> because<00:01:25.599> we<00:01:25.869> had<00:01:26.020> added

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
started to leave because we had added

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.529 
started to leave because we had added
some<00:01:26.590> salt<00:01:26.800> into<00:01:27.160> it<00:01:27.190> at<00:01:27.789> this<00:01:28.000> stage<00:01:28.240> we<00:01:28.390> will

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
some salt into it at this stage we will

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:34.490 
some salt into it at this stage we will
be<00:01:28.660> adding<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:29.050> Bengal<00:01:29.500> gram<00:01:29.770> flour

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.199 

this<00:01:35.500> will<00:01:35.709> help<00:01:35.950> bind<00:01:36.399> the<00:01:36.550> vegetables

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:37.209 
this will help bind the vegetables

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:49.800 
this will help bind the vegetables
together

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.109 

all<00:01:50.810> right<00:01:51.080> now<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.520> spinners<00:01:52.520> have<00:01:52.729> formed

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
all right now the spinners have formed

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.870 
all right now the spinners have formed
into<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.390> dark<00:01:53.630> consistency<00:01:54.500> it<00:01:55.250> is<00:01:55.400> very<00:01:55.640> thick

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
into a dark consistency it is very thick

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.850 
into a dark consistency it is very thick
I<00:01:56.090> have<00:01:56.210> not<00:01:56.450> added<00:01:56.840> water<00:01:57.050> into<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:57.650> because

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
I have not added water into it because

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.550 
I have not added water into it because
spinach<00:01:58.220> itself<00:01:58.790> contains<00:01:59.210> a<00:01:59.450> decent<00:02:00.259> amount

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
spinach itself contains a decent amount

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.190 
spinach itself contains a decent amount
of<00:02:00.680> water<00:02:00.979> in<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.430> so<00:02:02.000> our<00:02:02.330> C<00:02:02.690> would<00:02:02.869> have<00:02:03.020> a

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
of water in it so our C would have a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.580 
of water in it so our C would have a
virus<00:02:03.619> just<00:02:03.830> added<00:02:04.520> a<00:02:04.840> good<00:02:05.840> quantity<00:02:06.470> of

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
virus just added a good quantity of

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.770 
virus just added a good quantity of
about<00:02:07.130> 6<00:02:07.520> tbsp<00:02:08.209> of<00:02:09.429> ground<00:02:10.429> floor<00:02:10.789> so<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.450> it

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
about 6 tbsp of ground floor so that it

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.530 
about 6 tbsp of ground floor so that it
becomes<00:02:12.170> a<00:02:12.440> very<00:02:12.620> thick<00:02:12.980> paste<00:02:13.370> like<00:02:13.790> this<00:02:13.819> and

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
becomes a very thick paste like this and

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.080 
becomes a very thick paste like this and
it<00:02:14.690> will<00:02:14.840> be<00:02:15.020> very<00:02:15.170> easy<00:02:15.290> for<00:02:16.160> us<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.370> shape<00:02:16.880> it

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
it will be very easy for us to shape it

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.820 
it will be very easy for us to shape it
in<00:02:17.980> now<00:02:18.980> let's<00:02:19.370> give<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.760> ball<00:02:20.030> shape<00:02:20.830> you

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
in now let's give it a ball shape you

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.100 
in now let's give it a ball shape you
can<00:02:21.980> do<00:02:22.160> any<00:02:22.489> shape<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.970> like<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.540> will<00:02:23.780> be

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
can do any shape you like I will be

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.240 
can do any shape you like I will be
giving<00:02:24.410> it<00:02:24.530> a<00:02:24.620> round<00:02:24.860> shape<00:02:25.040> here<00:02:26.709> okay<00:02:27.709> here

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
giving it a round shape here okay here

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.050 
giving it a round shape here okay here
we<00:02:28.489> have<00:02:28.519> our<00:02:29.120> spinach<00:02:30.019> boys<00:02:30.410> are<00:02:31.040> ready<00:02:31.730> for
