Werner<00:01:15.250> logs<00:01:15.490> on<00:01:15.760> the<00:01:15.910> ground<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:17.470> can<00:01:17.650> back

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
Werner logs on the ground you can back

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.940 
Werner logs on the ground you can back
up<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.310> it<00:01:18.430> get<00:01:19.330> one<00:01:19.750> of<00:01:19.900> the<00:01:20.020> tines<00:01:20.260> underneath

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
up to it get one of the tines underneath

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.920 
up to it get one of the tines underneath
the<00:01:21.130> end

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the end

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.950 
the end
lift<00:01:22.930> it<00:01:23.110> up<00:01:23.200> hook<00:01:23.440> the<00:01:23.560> chains<00:01:23.830> on<00:01:24.130> and<00:01:24.780> I<00:01:25.780> try

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
lift it up hook the chains on and I try

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.240 
lift it up hook the chains on and I try
to<00:01:25.990> hook<00:01:26.170> them<00:01:26.350> short<00:01:26.619> so<00:01:26.860> that<00:01:26.890> when<00:01:27.130> I'm

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
to hook them short so that when I'm

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.160 
to hook them short so that when I'm
coming<00:01:27.460> out<00:01:27.670> of<00:01:27.850> there<00:01:28.060> you're<00:01:28.720> on<00:01:28.810> going<00:01:29.110> on

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
coming out of there you're on going on

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.749 
coming out of there you're on going on
some<00:01:29.440> side<00:01:29.710> hills<00:01:30.009> and<00:01:30.190> stuff<00:01:30.340> you<00:01:30.490> get<00:01:30.610> them

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
some side hills and stuff you get them

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.460 
some side hills and stuff you get them
too<00:01:30.850> much<00:01:31.030> line<00:01:31.330> and<00:01:31.720> it'll<00:01:32.050> roll<00:01:32.229> downhill

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
too much line and it'll roll downhill

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.160 
too much line and it'll roll downhill
and<00:01:32.950> then<00:01:33.070> you<00:01:33.190> get<00:01:33.310> a<00:01:33.340> mess<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.540> this<00:01:34.570> way<00:01:34.869> it

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
and then you get a mess so this way it

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.740 
and then you get a mess so this way it
really<00:01:35.350> can't<00:01:35.650> go<00:01:35.800> out<00:01:35.890> of<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.009> way<00:01:36.130> at<00:01:36.280> all

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
really can't go out of the way at all

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.719 
really can't go out of the way at all
plus<00:01:37.750> you<00:01:38.560> want<00:01:38.650> to<00:01:38.800> put<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.070> chains<00:01:39.340> around<00:01:39.550> I

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
plus you want to put the chains around I

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.990 
plus you want to put the chains around I
have<00:01:39.910> to<00:01:40.060> build<00:01:40.270> four<00:01:40.570> down<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:42.460> when<00:01:42.640> I<00:01:42.670> lift

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
have to build four down so when I lift

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.700 
have to build four down so when I lift
it<00:01:43.180> I<00:01:43.330> take<00:01:43.570> all<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.869> weight<00:01:44.050> off<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.470> front

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
it I take all the weight off the front

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.040 
it I take all the weight off the front
of<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.890> log<00:01:45.100> so<00:01:46.060> ant<00:01:46.270> puts<00:01:46.509> the<00:01:46.690> weight<00:01:46.780> on<00:01:46.960> the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
of the log so ant puts the weight on the

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.740 
of the log so ant puts the weight on the
back<00:01:47.170> of<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.410> tractor<00:01:47.619> where<00:01:47.890> you<00:01:47.979> need<00:01:48.160> it<00:01:48.750> so

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
back of the tractor where you need it so

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.740 
back of the tractor where you need it so
it<00:01:49.810> works<00:01:50.020> real<00:01:50.229> well<00:01:50.259> you<00:01:51.270> know<00:01:52.270> these<00:01:52.509> bail

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
it works real well you know these bail

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.499 
it works real well you know these bail
Forks<00:01:53.200> actually<00:01:53.500> I<00:01:53.530> could<00:01:53.830> I<00:01:54.069> could<00:01:55.030> hook<00:01:55.330> the

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
Forks actually I could I could hook the

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.440 
Forks actually I could I could hook the
log<00:01:55.660> you<00:01:56.380> know<00:01:56.440> back<00:01:56.679> up<00:01:56.920> and<00:01:57.190> slide<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.179> forks

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
log you know back up and slide the forks

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.180 
log you know back up and slide the forks
under<00:01:58.690> and<00:01:58.899> haul<00:01:59.080> the<00:01:59.229> log<00:01:59.410> that<00:01:59.649> way<00:01:59.860> I<00:01:59.890> move

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
under and haul the log that way I move

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.469 
under and haul the log that way I move
them<00:02:00.460> that<00:02:00.610> way<00:02:00.789> but<00:02:02.069> it's<00:02:03.069> a<00:02:03.250> little<00:02:03.520> hard<00:02:04.390> to

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
them that way but it's a little hard to

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.200 
them that way but it's a little hard to
get<00:02:04.660> to<00:02:04.899> gates<00:02:05.740> and<00:02:06.100> narrow<00:02:06.340> spots<00:02:06.759> and<00:02:07.060> stuff

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
get to gates and narrow spots and stuff

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.930 
get to gates and narrow spots and stuff
so<00:02:07.800> easiest<00:02:08.800> way<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:08.979> do<00:02:09.220> it<00:02:09.310> is<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:09.550> drag<00:02:09.759> them

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
so easiest way to do it is to drag them

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.610 
so easiest way to do it is to drag them
but<00:02:10.270> I<00:02:10.420> do<00:02:10.479> like<00:02:10.750> to<00:02:10.869> wait<00:02:10.990> till<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.230> ground<00:02:11.440> is

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
but I do like to wait till the ground is

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.470 
but I do like to wait till the ground is
frozen<00:02:11.740> in<00:02:12.220> it's<00:02:12.400> been<00:02:12.640> below<00:02:12.880> zero<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.270> few

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
frozen in it's been below zero a few

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.660 
frozen in it's been below zero a few
days<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:15.160> froze<00:02:17.100> but<00:02:18.100> this<00:02:18.220> is<00:02:18.400> what<00:02:18.550> I'm

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
days so it it froze but this is what I'm

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.720 
days so it it froze but this is what I'm
gonna<00:02:18.819> cut<00:02:19.090> up<00:02:19.770> for<00:02:20.770> lumber<00:02:21.130> you<00:02:21.340> know<00:02:21.459> I'll<00:02:21.610> be

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
gonna cut up for lumber you know I'll be

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.930 
gonna cut up for lumber you know I'll be
doing<00:02:21.970> some<00:02:22.180> project<00:02:22.660> with<00:02:22.810> this<00:02:23.700> yeah<00:02:24.700> cuz

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
doing some project with this yeah cuz

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.309 
doing some project with this yeah cuz
it's<00:02:25.230> really<00:02:26.230> nice<00:02:26.440> good<00:02:27.190> sized<00:02:27.459> log<00:02:28.319> yeah

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
it's really nice good sized log yeah

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.650 
it's really nice good sized log yeah
well<00:02:29.620> over<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:29.950> foot<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.430> could<00:02:30.670> get<00:02:30.790> my<00:02:31.209> boards

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
well over a foot I could get my boards

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.710 
well over a foot I could get my boards
off<00:02:31.840> of<00:02:32.020> it<00:02:32.940> yeah<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.209> got<00:02:34.390> over<00:02:35.319> 20<00:02:35.620> feet<00:02:36.720> no

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720
