Wow Vic's got ultra tuned and da Barra
is<00:00:52.620> also<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:54.440> think<00:00:55.440> I'll<00:00:55.710> try<00:00:55.829> wanna<00:00:56.100> throw

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
is also on I think I'll try wanna throw

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.369 
is also on I think I'll try wanna throw
the<00:00:56.699> better<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.180> match<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.719> think<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.050> too

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
the better in this match I think so too

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.720 
the better in this match I think so too
it<00:00:58.530> misses<00:00:58.710> out<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.129> little<00:00:59.460> bit<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.670> damage

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
it misses out on a little bit of damage

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.090 
it misses out on a little bit of damage
also<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.910> could<00:01:03.090> react<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.600> jump<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.049> with<00:01:04.890> it

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
also you could react to jump in with it

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100 
also you could react to jump in with it
so<00:01:05.339> not<00:01:06.090> like<00:01:06.240> there'll<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.540> lot<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.750> jumping

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
so not like there'll be a lot of jumping

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.260 
so not like there'll be a lot of jumping
but<00:01:07.320> if<00:01:07.409> they<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:07.590> yeah<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.670> don't<00:01:08.820> know<00:01:08.880> big

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270
