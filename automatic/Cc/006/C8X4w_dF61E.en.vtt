tutorial<00:00:12.120> we<00:00:12.570> created<00:00:13.350> a<00:00:13.500> flow<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.970> ball<00:00:15.360> we

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
tutorial we created a flow and a ball we

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.650 
tutorial we created a flow and a ball we
attached<00:00:16.560> rigid<00:00:17.130> body<00:00:17.310> tags<00:00:17.610> to<00:00:17.849> both<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.480> them

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
attached rigid body tags to both of them

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.480 
attached rigid body tags to both of them
we<00:00:18.840> did<00:00:19.050> this<00:00:19.170> by<00:00:19.380> pressing<00:00:19.590> simulation

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
we did this by pressing simulation

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.120 
we did this by pressing simulation
dynamic<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.210> rigid<00:00:21.660> body<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.110> we<00:00:22.619> set<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
dynamic and rigid body and we set the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.880 
dynamic and rigid body and we set the
attribute<00:00:23.310> for<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.180> floor<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.650> bounce

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
attribute for the floor and the bounce

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.159 
attribute for the floor and the bounce
to<00:00:26.130> 200<00:00:26.700> and<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.360> this<00:00:27.480> tutorial<00:00:27.660> we're<00:00:28.140> going

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:28.169 
to 200 and in this tutorial we're going

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:29.540 
to 200 and in this tutorial we're going
to<00:00:28.349> be<00:00:28.439> doing<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.739> little<00:00:28.919> bit<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.130> animation

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
to be doing a little bit of animation

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.499 
to be doing a little bit of animation
and<00:00:29.970> I'm<00:00:30.029> going<00:00:30.180> to<00:00:30.239> give<00:00:30.360> you<00:00:30.450> the

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
and I'm going to give you the

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.860 
and I'm going to give you the
foundations<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.560> how<00:00:32.310> to<00:00:32.369> animate<00:00:33.000> an<00:00:33.450> object

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
foundations of how to animate an object

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.380 
foundations of how to animate an object
or<00:00:34.050> animate<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.739> cinema<00:00:35.280> 4d<00:00:35.310> and<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.360> a

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
or animate in cinema 4d and this is a

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.630 
or animate in cinema 4d and this is a
very<00:00:36.660> very<00:00:36.809> important<00:00:37.500> tutorial<00:00:38.040> if<00:00:38.250> you

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
very very important tutorial if you

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.340 
very very important tutorial if you
understand<00:00:39.240> this<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.690> think<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.170> should

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
understand this I think you should

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.400 
understand this I think you should
understand<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.040> basics<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:42.110> also<00:00:43.110> probably

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
understand the basics and also probably

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.190 
understand the basics and also probably
the<00:00:43.590> advanced<00:00:43.950> aspects<00:00:44.490> of<00:00:44.670> animation<00:00:45.300> okay

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the advanced aspects of animation okay

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.340 
the advanced aspects of animation okay
so<00:00:46.910> what<00:00:47.910> we'll<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.150> doing<00:00:48.240> is<00:00:48.570> animating<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
so what we'll be doing is animating the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.050 
so what we'll be doing is animating the
ball<00:00:49.590> I'm<00:00:49.830> going<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.040> make<00:00:50.220> the<00:00:50.430> ball<00:00:50.610> shrink

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
ball I'm going to make the ball shrink

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.350 
ball I'm going to make the ball shrink
and<00:00:51.330> grow<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.870> we'll<00:00:52.620> also<00:00:52.800> make<00:00:53.580> them<00:00:53.820> flow

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
and grow and we'll also make them flow

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.630 
and grow and we'll also make them flow
move<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.960> I'll<00:00:55.830> show<00:00:56.040> you<00:00:56.070> two<00:00:56.610> different

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
move and I'll show you two different

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.090 
move and I'll show you two different
methods<00:00:57.150> and<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.290> decide<00:00:58.620> which<00:00:58.860> one<00:00:59.070> is

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
methods and you can decide which one is

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.850 
methods and you can decide which one is
best<00:00:59.610> for<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.210> okay<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.200> the<00:01:01.380> first<00:01:01.410> thing<00:01:01.650> I'm

thingamajig is on the left I'm going to
click<00:01:14.219> on<00:01:14.460> my<00:01:14.999> sphere<00:01:15.569> and<00:01:15.840> now<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.799> want<00:01:17.609> to

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
click on my sphere and now I want to

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.340 
click on my sphere and now I want to
introduce<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.569> the<00:01:18.719> attributes<00:01:19.259> panel

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
introduce you to the attributes panel

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.950 
introduce you to the attributes panel
which<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.159> right<00:01:20.609> here<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.479> attributes

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
which is right here and the attributes

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.480 
which is right here and the attributes
panel<00:01:22.049> has<00:01:22.439> different<00:01:22.829> tabs<00:01:23.039> I'm<00:01:23.280> going<00:01:23.429> to

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
panel has different tabs I'm going to

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.090 
panel has different tabs I'm going to
click<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.789> the<00:01:23.939> object<00:01:24.119> tab<00:01:24.719> you<00:01:25.499> can<00:01:25.530> see<00:01:25.889> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
click on the object tab you can see the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.090 
click on the object tab you can see the
radius<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.149> sphere<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.929> at<00:01:28.469> a<00:01:28.740> hundred

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
radius of the sphere is at a hundred

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.209 
radius of the sphere is at a hundred
percent<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.609> what<00:01:29.729> I'm<00:01:29.850> going<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.119> do<00:01:30.389> is<00:01:30.689> just

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
percent so what I'm going to do is just

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:34.520 
percent so what I'm going to do is just
change<00:01:32.219> that<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.729> about<00:01:32.880> thirty<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.810> watch

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
change that to about thirty and watch

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.469 
change that to about thirty and watch
the<00:01:34.740> ball<00:01:35.189> shrink<00:01:35.609> when<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.819> press<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.179> enter

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
the ball shrink when I press the enter

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.340 
the ball shrink when I press the enter
button<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.139> ball<00:01:37.350> has<00:01:37.560> shrunk<00:01:39.139> at<00:01:40.139> this

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
button so the ball has shrunk at this

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.039 
button so the ball has shrunk at this
point<00:01:40.679> we're<00:01:41.159> going<00:01:41.399> to<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.869> placing<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
point we're going to be placing a

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.270 
point we're going to be placing a
keyframe<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.920> basically<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.609> keyframe<00:01:45.119> is

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
keyframe and basically a keyframe is

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.819 
keyframe and basically a keyframe is
what<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.850> particular<00:01:48.090> objects<00:01:49.079> what<00:01:49.679> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
what that particular objects what the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.499 
what that particular objects what the
attributes<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.459> the<00:01:50.520> object<00:01:50.609> will<00:01:51.149> look<00:01:51.329> like

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
attributes of the object will look like

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.809 
attributes of the object will look like
at<00:01:51.719> this<00:01:51.959> particular<00:01:52.170> point<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:53.159> time<00:01:53.219> so<00:01:53.700> at

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
at this particular point in time so at

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.039 
at this particular point in time so at
frame<00:01:54.329> 0<00:01:55.039> the<00:01:56.039> radius<00:01:56.549> will<00:01:56.819> be<00:01:56.850> 30<00:01:57.389> and<00:01:57.869> the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
frame 0 the radius will be 30 and the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.370 
frame 0 the radius will be 30 and the
way<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.560> submit<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> keyframe<00:01:59.609> is<00:01:59.939> press<00:02:00.450> ctrl

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
way is submit a keyframe is press ctrl

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.190 
way is submit a keyframe is press ctrl
and<00:02:01.789> click<00:02:02.789> on<00:02:02.999> the<00:02:03.509> edge<00:02:03.779> of<00:02:04.109> the<00:02:06.020> what's<00:02:07.020> the

ready so that means a keyframe has been

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.300 
ready so that means a keyframe has been
set<00:02:18.120> for<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.720> radius<00:02:19.140> now<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:19.860> just<00:02:19.950> want<00:02:20.280> to

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310

guys right here where the key frame is

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.570 
guys right here where the key frame is
at<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.760> bottom<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.300> is<00:02:24.360> bluish<00:02:24.840> sort<00:02:25.440> of

the moment now I've clicked it but that
represents<00:02:30.240> a<00:02:30.270> keyframe<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.200> lets<00:02:31.410> me

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
represents a keyframe and that lets me

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.980 
represents a keyframe and that lets me
know<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.890> at<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.190> moment<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.820> time<00:02:33.000> there

know that at that moment in time there
is<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.170> keyframe<00:02:34.740> what<00:02:35.370> I'm<00:02:35.460> going<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.730> do<00:02:35.940> is

is a keyframe what I'm going to do is

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.510 
is a keyframe what I'm going to do is
move<00:02:36.450> over<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.320> about<00:02:37.830> 40<00:02:38.780> frames<00:02:39.780> in<00:02:40.050> time<00:02:40.590> go

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
I'm going to click and another keyframe

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.170 
I'm going to click and another keyframe
has<00:03:29.549> been<00:03:29.730> set<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.239> let's<00:03:30.480> watch<00:03:30.630> this<00:03:32.180> grows

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
has been set and let's watch this grows

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.800 
has been set and let's watch this grows
and<00:03:33.570> shrinks<00:03:34.370> s'okay<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:35.519> was<00:03:35.700> one<00:03:36.360> method

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
and shrinks s'okay that was one method

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.110 
and shrinks s'okay that was one method
and<00:03:37.590> that's<00:03:37.799> quite<00:03:38.100> a<00:03:38.130> cool<00:03:38.430> method<00:03:38.640> I<00:03:38.880> think

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
and that's quite a cool method I think

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.590 
and that's quite a cool method I think
and<00:03:39.500> and<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:41.280> method<00:03:41.700> is<00:03:41.880> for<00:03:42.209> when<00:03:42.360> you<00:03:42.420> want

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
and and that method is for when you want

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.630 
and and that method is for when you want
to<00:03:42.690> specifically<00:03:43.380> change<00:03:43.799> only<00:03:44.100> one

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
to specifically change only one

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.160 
to specifically change only one
attribute<00:03:44.880> so<00:03:45.360> if<00:03:45.420> you<00:03:45.510> want<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.720> just<00:03:45.840> change

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
attribute so if you want to just change

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.340 
attribute so if you want to just change
the<00:03:46.620> radius<00:03:47.610> size<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:48.120> an<00:03:48.480> object<00:03:48.570> or<00:03:48.959> whatever

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
the radius size of an object or whatever

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.140 
the radius size of an object or whatever
there's<00:03:49.950> lots<00:03:50.190> of<00:03:50.370> different<00:03:50.430> things<00:03:50.730> we<00:03:50.970> can

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
there's lots of different things we can

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.890 
there's lots of different things we can
change<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:52.640> now<00:03:53.640> what<00:03:53.820> we'll<00:03:54.000> do<00:03:54.239> is<00:03:54.540> go<00:03:54.750> back

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
change and now what we'll do is go back

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.570 
change and now what we'll do is go back
to<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.140> home<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.709> I'll<00:03:55.769> show<00:03:55.950> you<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.190> second

to the home and I'll show you the second

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.050 
to the home and I'll show you the second
method<00:03:56.700> of<00:03:57.330> actually<00:03:57.870> using<00:03:58.610> animation<00:03:59.610> and

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
method of actually using animation and

I'm going to do is make flow come higher

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.039 
I'm going to do is make flow come higher
lower<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.580> maybe<00:04:05.820> change<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.269> rotation<00:04:06.510> and

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
lower and maybe change the rotation and

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.070 
lower and maybe change the rotation and
see<00:04:07.260> what<00:04:07.470> happens<00:04:08.360> my<00:04:09.360> goal<00:04:09.570> a<00:04:09.720> bit<00:04:09.870> crazy

00:05:40.049 --> 00:05:40.059 
moving and you can see now the ball is

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:42.449 
moving and you can see now the ball is
having<00:05:40.479> an<00:05:40.599> the<00:05:41.199> flow<00:05:41.529> is<00:05:41.679> having<00:05:42.039> an<00:05:42.159> effect

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:42.459 
having an the flow is having an effect

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:43.709 
having an the flow is having an effect
on<00:05:42.579> the<00:05:42.729> ball<00:05:42.939> you<00:05:42.969> can<00:05:43.209> see<00:05:43.329> it's<00:05:43.449> now<00:05:43.539> as

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:43.719 
on the ball you can see it's now as

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:46.049 
on the ball you can see it's now as
though<00:05:43.869> it's<00:05:44.050> going<00:05:44.289> downhill<00:05:44.669> so<00:05:45.669> that's<00:05:45.879> the

00:05:46.049 --> 00:05:46.059 
though it's going downhill so that's the

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:48.540 
though it's going downhill so that's the
physics<00:05:46.419> of<00:05:46.599> cinema<00:05:47.079> 4d<00:05:47.319> and<00:05:47.469> you<00:05:47.709> you<00:05:48.399> can

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
physics of cinema 4d and you you can

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.299 
physics of cinema 4d and you you can
also<00:05:48.699> see<00:05:49.029> even<00:05:49.419> though<00:05:49.659> it's<00:05:50.069> the<00:05:51.069> balls

00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:51.309 
also see even though it's the balls

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:57.479 
also see even though it's the balls
moved<00:05:51.639> outside<00:05:51.879> of<00:05:52.479> the<00:05:54.599> the<00:05:55.599> flow<00:05:56.289> area<00:05:56.619> this

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:57.489 
moved outside of the the flow area this

00:05:57.489 --> 00:05:59.249 
moved outside of the the flow area this
it's<00:05:57.759> actually<00:05:58.360> the<00:05:58.479> flow<00:05:58.749> actually<00:05:59.169> is

00:05:59.249 --> 00:05:59.259 
it's actually the flow actually is

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:01.259 
it's actually the flow actually is
unlimited<00:05:59.559> it<00:05:59.949> extends<00:06:00.550> throughout<00:06:00.879> so<00:06:01.179> you

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:01.269 
unlimited it extends throughout so you

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:03.089 
unlimited it extends throughout so you
can<00:06:01.419> see<00:06:01.539> I'll<00:06:01.629> keep<00:06:01.869> bouncing<00:06:02.409> down<00:06:02.649> the<00:06:02.709> hill

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:03.099 
can see I'll keep bouncing down the hill

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:05.279 
can see I'll keep bouncing down the hill
so<00:06:03.939> hope<00:06:04.209> you<00:06:04.239> guys<00:06:04.389> have<00:06:04.749> enjoyed<00:06:04.839> this
