00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
first generation but we'll have a quick

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.810 
first generation but we'll have a quick
look<00:02:55.370> at<00:02:55.610> another<00:02:56.150> time<00:02:56.740> and<00:02:57.880> this<00:02:58.880> is<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.390> new

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
look at another time and this is the new

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.260 
look at another time and this is the new
Retina<00:03:01.820> display<00:03:03.640> so<00:03:04.640> we'll<00:03:04.790> give<00:03:04.970> it<00:03:05.000> a<00:03:05.120> quick

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
Retina display so we'll give it a quick

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.720 
Retina display so we'll give it a quick
setup<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.560> then<00:03:06.980> we'll<00:03:07.130> pop<00:03:07.310> back<00:03:07.520> with<00:03:07.700> a

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
setup and then we'll pop back with a

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.720 
setup and then we'll pop back with a
quick<00:03:08.000> look<00:03:08.180> at<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.360> display<00:03:09.100> so<00:03:10.100> in<00:03:10.370> my<00:03:10.520> left

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
quick look at the display so in my left

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.060 
quick look at the display so in my left
hand<00:03:10.910> obviously<00:03:11.060> this<00:03:11.450> is<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:11.750> new<00:03:12.350> iPad<00:03:12.830> Mini

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
hand obviously this is the new iPad Mini

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.100 
hand obviously this is the new iPad Mini
with<00:03:13.310> Retina<00:03:13.340> display<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.210> just<00:03:14.930> from

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
with Retina display and just from

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.460 
with Retina display and just from
looking<00:03:15.440> at<00:03:15.530> it<00:03:15.710> side<00:03:16.130> by<00:03:16.340> side<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.940> can<00:03:17.120> see

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
looking at it side by side you can see

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.310 
looking at it side by side you can see
the<00:03:18.470> huge<00:03:18.980> difference<00:03:19.490> there<00:03:19.700> is<00:03:19.730> in<00:03:20.540> the

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
the huge difference there is in the

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.840 
the huge difference there is in the
sharpness<00:03:21.710> of<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:22.100> display<00:03:22.430> now<00:03:22.610> from<00:03:22.820> a

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
sharpness of the display now from a

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.820 
sharpness of the display now from a
distance<00:03:23.360> you<00:03:23.450> won't<00:03:23.720> see<00:03:23.990> it<00:03:24.140> that<00:03:24.170> much<00:03:24.620> but

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
distance you won't see it that much but

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.350 
distance you won't see it that much but
as<00:03:24.980> soon<00:03:25.130> as<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:25.430> get<00:03:25.580> up<00:03:25.640> close<00:03:25.910> with<00:03:26.030> it

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
as soon as you get up close with it

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.700 
as soon as you get up close with it
you'll<00:03:26.900> probably<00:03:27.140> see<00:03:27.410> it<00:03:27.500> on<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.680> camera

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
you'll probably see it on the camera

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.680 
you'll probably see it on the camera
already<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.580> counter<00:03:29.060> colors<00:03:29.420> are<00:03:29.570> more

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 
already the counter colors are more

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.010 
already the counter colors are more
vivid<00:03:30.140> a<00:03:30.350> lot<00:03:30.920> more<00:03:31.070> contrast<00:03:31.730> it's<00:03:32.420> sharper

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
vivid a lot more contrast it's sharper

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.500 
vivid a lot more contrast it's sharper
it's<00:03:33.320> clearer<00:03:33.800> and<00:03:34.340> that<00:03:35.030> should<00:03:35.270> make<00:03:35.450> it

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
it's clearer and that should make it

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.300 
it's clearer and that should make it
much<00:03:35.960> better<00:03:36.230> at<00:03:36.470> things<00:03:36.740> like<00:03:36.830> obviously

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
much better at things like obviously

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.060 
much better at things like obviously
high<00:03:37.520> intense<00:03:37.970> high<00:03:38.750> graphics<00:03:39.050> games<00:03:39.620> like

Infinity Blade real racing 3 stuff like

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.590 
Infinity Blade real racing 3 stuff like
that<00:03:43.160> as<00:03:43.400> well<00:03:43.640> as<00:03:43.820> one<00:03:44.120> thing<00:03:44.300> I<00:03:44.360> really

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
that as well as one thing I really

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.290 
that as well as one thing I really
struggled<00:03:44.990> with<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.260> original<00:03:45.410> iPad<00:03:46.040> was<00:03:46.820> the

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
struggled with the original iPad was the

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.480 
struggled with the original iPad was the
comic<00:03:48.020> book<00:03:48.200> reading<00:03:48.410> apps<00:03:48.740> like<00:03:48.950> comiXology

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
comic book reading apps like comiXology

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.640 
comic book reading apps like comiXology
where<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.030> font<00:03:50.300> of<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.630> type<00:03:50.840> was<00:03:51.080> so<00:03:51.290> small

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
where the font of the type was so small

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.560 
where the font of the type was so small
I<00:03:51.980> could<00:03:52.490> barely<00:03:52.790> read<00:03:53.000> it<00:03:53.150> most<00:03:53.330> of<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.510> time

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
I could barely read it most of the time

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.500 
I could barely read it most of the time
on<00:03:53.780> this<00:03:54.170> iPad<00:03:54.710> but<00:03:55.700> on<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:55.940> new<00:03:56.090> one<00:03:56.270> that<00:03:56.420> I

on this iPad but on the new one that I

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.560 
on this iPad but on the new one that I
hope<00:03:56.720> that's<00:03:56.990> going<00:03:57.350> to<00:03:57.470> be<00:03:57.590> addressed<00:03:58.570> really

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
hope that's going to be addressed really

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.630 
hope that's going to be addressed really

from<00:04:01.850> what<00:04:02.000> I've<00:04:02.090> been<00:04:02.330> doing<00:04:02.510> with<00:04:02.750> it<00:04:02.900> so<00:04:03.140> far

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.580 
from what I've been doing with it so far
but<00:04:04.360> then<00:04:05.360> I've<00:04:05.480> only<00:04:05.660> had<00:04:05.870> it<00:04:05.930> switched<00:04:06.350> on

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
but then I've only had it switched on

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.290 
but then I've only had it switched on
and<00:04:06.740> powered<00:04:07.040> on<00:04:07.160> for<00:04:07.340> about<00:04:07.430> two<00:04:07.700> minutes<00:04:07.910> so

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
and powered on for about two minutes so

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.660 
and powered on for about two minutes so
I'll<00:04:09.140> have<00:04:09.320> a<00:04:09.350> full<00:04:09.620> review<00:04:09.830> at<00:04:10.130> another<00:04:10.430> point

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
I'll have a full review at another point

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.520 
I'll have a full review at another point
I<00:04:10.940> probably<00:04:10.970> put<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.420> written<00:04:11.810> one<00:04:11.960> up<00:04:12.200> on<00:04:12.380> the

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
I probably put the written one up on the

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.370 
I probably put the written one up on the
site<00:04:12.740> before<00:04:13.160> I<00:04:13.190> film<00:04:13.730> one<00:04:14.030> but<00:04:14.390> we'll<00:04:14.570> see<00:04:14.780> I'm

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
site before I film one but we'll see I'm

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.960 
site before I film one but we'll see I'm
planning<00:04:15.770> to<00:04:15.800> do<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:16.130> at<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.549> end<00:04:16.700> of<00:04:16.910> next

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
planning to do it at the end of next

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.789 
planning to do it at the end of next
week<00:04:17.390> once<00:04:17.780> I've<00:04:17.959> had<00:04:18.109> a<00:04:18.140> week<00:04:18.440> with<00:04:18.680> the

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
week once I've had a week with the

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.710 
week once I've had a week with the
device<00:04:19.070> I<00:04:19.370> can<00:04:19.430> see<00:04:19.760> what<00:04:20.000> the<00:04:20.150> battery<00:04:20.570> is

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
device I can see what the battery is

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.600 
device I can see what the battery is
like<00:04:20.989> how<00:04:21.260> it<00:04:21.410> performs<00:04:21.980> on<00:04:22.190> a<00:04:22.220> consistent

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
like how it performs on a consistent

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.780 
like how it performs on a consistent
basis<00:04:23.530> whether<00:04:24.530> it's<00:04:24.770> worth<00:04:25.010> upgrading<00:04:25.250> from

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
basis whether it's worth upgrading from

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.850 
basis whether it's worth upgrading from
the<00:04:26.030> original<00:04:26.450> iPad<00:04:26.870> if<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.140> retina<00:04:27.530> display

the original iPad if the retina display

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.310 
the original iPad if the retina display
does<00:04:28.130> make<00:04:28.370> that<00:04:28.580> much<00:04:28.880> of<00:04:28.910> a<00:04:29.090> difference<00:04:29.320> now

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
does make that much of a difference now

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.679 
does make that much of a difference now
