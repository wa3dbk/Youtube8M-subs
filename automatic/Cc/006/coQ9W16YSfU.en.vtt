00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.750 
here and we see device lock screen here
is<00:03:28.959> our<00:03:29.140> option<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:30.220> then<00:03:30.310> we've<00:03:30.430> got<00:03:30.459> all

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
is our option and then we've got all

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.640 
is our option and then we've got all
their<00:03:31.060> different<00:03:31.150> options<00:03:31.690> so<00:03:31.900> how<00:03:32.410> about<00:03:32.470> the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
their different options so how about the

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.060 
their different options so how about the
miui<00:03:33.070> unlock<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:35.320> we<00:03:35.500> can<00:03:35.650> check<00:03:35.800> that<00:03:35.860> out

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
miui unlock and we can check that out

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.759 
miui unlock and we can check that out
swipe<00:03:36.730> down<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:37.239> unlock<00:03:37.570> and<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:38.290> also<00:03:38.380> like<00:03:38.739> the

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
swipe down to unlock and I also like the

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.820 
swipe down to unlock and I also like the
for<00:03:39.430> tab<00:03:39.700> unlock<00:03:40.360> as<00:03:40.660> well<00:03:40.930> in<00:03:41.470> which<00:03:41.620> you<00:03:41.800> can

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
for tab unlock as well in which you can

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.110 
for tab unlock as well in which you can
set<00:03:42.190> for<00:03:42.370> different<00:03:42.610> things<00:03:42.640> so<00:03:42.970> if<00:03:43.060> you

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
set for different things so if you

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.699 
set for different things so if you
wanted<00:03:43.330> to<00:03:43.390> unlock<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.750> phone<00:03:44.019> would<00:03:44.620> be

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
wanted to unlock the phone would be

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.080 
wanted to unlock the phone would be
there<00:03:45.010> but<00:03:45.340> if<00:03:45.430> you<00:03:45.519> want<00:03:45.640> to<00:03:45.700> unlock<00:03:45.940> the

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
there but if you want to unlock the

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.850 
there but if you want to unlock the
phone<00:03:46.299> and<00:03:46.510> go<00:03:46.570> into<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:47.049> phone<00:03:47.260> application

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
phone and go into the phone application

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.400 
phone and go into the phone application
it'd<00:03:48.160> be<00:03:48.310> there<00:03:48.489> so<00:03:49.090> lots<00:03:49.600> of<00:03:49.720> cool<00:03:49.900> options

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
it'd be there so lots of cool options
