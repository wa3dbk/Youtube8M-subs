300<00:00:35.260> and<00:00:35.350> something<00:00:35.500> models<00:00:35.950> now<00:00:36.130> that<00:00:36.640> I<00:00:36.700> get

300 and something models now that I get
kind<00:00:37.030> of<00:00:37.090> jaded<00:00:37.360> when<00:00:37.630> new<00:00:37.750> lights<00:00:37.990> come<00:00:38.230> in

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
kind of jaded when new lights come in

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
batteries in here and show you the

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.470 
batteries in here and show you the
interface<00:02:44.579> again<00:02:45.579> these<00:02:45.879> all<00:02:46.030> have<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.239> same

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
interface again these all have the same

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.449 
interface again these all have the same
interface<00:02:46.750> so<00:02:47.590> you'll<00:02:48.010> have<00:02:48.129> the<00:02:48.280> same

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
interface so you'll have the same

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.809 
interface so you'll have the same
functions<00:02:48.909> for<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.329> different<00:02:49.599> models<00:02:49.840> so

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
functions for the different models so

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.309 
functions for the different models so
interesting<00:02:51.819> interface<00:02:52.180> on<00:02:52.359> this<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:53.170> it's

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
interesting interface on this so it's

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.710 
interesting interface on this so it's
kind<00:02:53.500> of<00:02:53.560> similar<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.370> ITP<00:02:54.730> s<00:02:55.120> series<00:02:55.540> if

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
kind of similar to the ITP s series if

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.580 
kind of similar to the ITP s series if
you've<00:02:55.840> seen<00:02:56.019> those<00:02:56.200> before

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
you've seen those before

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.440 
you've seen those before
think<00:02:57.129> of<00:02:57.220> these<00:02:57.310> as<00:02:57.370> premium<00:02:57.849> versions<00:02:58.299> of

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
think of these as premium versions of

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.629 
think of these as premium versions of
those<00:02:58.599> so<00:02:58.900> nicer<00:02:59.650> LED<00:03:00.069> a<00:03:00.099> little<00:03:00.400> bit<00:03:00.489> better

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639 
those so nicer LED a little bit better

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.449 
those so nicer LED a little bit better
switches<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.239> everything<00:03:01.569> but<00:03:02.530> they<00:03:03.250> both

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
switches and everything but they both

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.129 
switches and everything but they both
have<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.760> dual<00:03:03.909> switches<00:03:04.299> so<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:04.989> have<00:03:05.079> a

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
have the dual switches so you have a

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:07.050 
have the dual switches so you have a
switch<00:03:05.319> on<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.500> back<00:03:05.639> turns<00:03:06.639> the<00:03:06.760> light<00:03:06.909> off

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
switch on the back turns the light off

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.539 
switch on the back turns the light off
and<00:03:07.090> on<00:03:07.409> they'll<00:03:08.409> click<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:08.739> all<00:03:08.859> the<00:03:08.980> way<00:03:09.129> and

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
and on they'll click it all the way and

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.339 
and on they'll click it all the way and
the<00:03:09.790> turn<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.090> light<00:03:10.239> on<00:03:10.269> obviously<00:03:11.260> it's

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
the turn the light on obviously it's

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.449 
the turn the light on obviously it's
going<00:03:11.439> to<00:03:11.500> leave<00:03:11.680> it<00:03:11.799> on<00:03:11.859> if<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.069> let<00:03:12.250> it<00:03:12.280> go

and you also have momentary if you
lightly<00:03:14.349> press<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:14.680> now<00:03:15.459> you<00:03:15.579> notice<00:03:15.849> it<00:03:15.970> is

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
lightly press it now you notice it is

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.699 
lightly press it now you notice it is
staying<00:03:16.299> in<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.480> same<00:03:16.750> mode<00:03:16.989> this<00:03:17.470> has<00:03:17.680> a

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
staying in the same mode this has a

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.319 
staying in the same mode this has a
bunch<00:03:17.950> of<00:03:18.040> different<00:03:18.340> modes<00:03:18.519> but<00:03:18.849> if<00:03:19.060> you<00:03:19.180> only

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
bunch of different modes but if you only

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.449 
bunch of different modes but if you only
use<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.750> rear<00:03:19.930> switch<00:03:20.230> it's<00:03:21.069> going<00:03:21.220> to<00:03:21.280> stay

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
use the rear switch it's going to stay

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.830 
use the rear switch it's going to stay
in<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.639> mode<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:21.940> wanted<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:22.269> stay<00:03:22.449> in<00:03:22.660> it's

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
in the mode you wanted to stay in it's

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.720 
in the mode you wanted to stay in it's
that's<00:03:22.989> nice<00:03:23.560> reliable<00:03:23.949> light<00:03:24.310> if<00:03:24.459> you<00:03:24.549> want

that's nice reliable light if you want

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.970 
that's nice reliable light if you want
it<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.879> be<00:03:25.000> in<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.150> certain<00:03:25.449> mode<00:03:25.709> so<00:03:26.709> I'll<00:03:26.769> turn

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
it to be in a certain mode so I'll turn

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.180 
it to be in a certain mode so I'll turn
that<00:03:27.129> on<00:03:27.340> side<00:03:28.299> switch<00:03:28.540> up<00:03:28.720> here<00:03:29.040> it's<00:03:30.040> going

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
that on side switch up here it's going

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.589 
that on side switch up here it's going
to<00:03:30.250> switch<00:03:30.459> between<00:03:30.669> the<00:03:30.970> different<00:03:31.000> modes<00:03:31.269> in

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
to switch between the different modes in

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.689 
to switch between the different modes in
a<00:03:31.690> mode<00:03:31.870> group<00:03:32.109> you'll<00:03:33.040> see<00:03:33.159> the<00:03:33.310> one<00:03:33.430> we're<00:03:33.639> in

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:33.699 
a mode group you'll see the one we're in

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:35.069 
a mode group you'll see the one we're in
right<00:03:33.849> now<00:03:33.909> has<00:03:34.540> three<00:03:34.810> different

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
right now has three different

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.500 
right now has three different
brightnesses<00:03:35.730> now<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.909> switch<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.359> other

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
brightnesses now to switch to the other

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.270 
brightnesses now to switch to the other
mode<00:03:37.780> group<00:03:38.049> what<00:03:38.530> we're<00:03:38.650> going<00:03:38.769> to<00:03:38.799> do<00:03:38.980> is

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
mode group what we're going to do is

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.129 
mode group what we're going to do is
just<00:03:39.519> loosen<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:40.030> head<00:03:40.209> so<00:03:40.900> you've<00:03:40.989> got<00:03:41.109> a

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
just loosen the head so you've got a

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:42.689 
just loosen the head so you've got a
really<00:03:41.560> low<00:03:41.680> brightness<00:03:42.099> in<00:03:42.250> there<00:03:42.430> that's

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
really low brightness in there that's

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:47.399 
really low brightness in there that's
only<00:03:43.030> one<00:03:43.209> or<00:03:43.329> two<00:03:43.359> lumens<00:03:44.909> SOS<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.199> last

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
only one or two lumens SOS and the last

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:49.020 
only one or two lumens SOS and the last
one<00:03:47.590> is<00:03:47.709> a<00:03:47.739> beacon<00:03:48.040> flashing<00:03:48.489> mode<00:03:48.639> you'll<00:03:48.970> see

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
one is a beacon flashing mode you'll see

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.390 
one is a beacon flashing mode you'll see
it<00:03:49.269> flash<00:03:49.510> rapidly<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:50.079> few<00:03:50.319> times<00:03:50.560> then<00:03:51.250> it

it flash rapidly a few times then it

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.430 
it flash rapidly a few times then it
flashes<00:03:51.790> once<00:03:52.000> every<00:03:52.269> 15<00:03:52.599> seconds<00:03:52.989> I<00:03:53.199> won't

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
flashes once every 15 seconds I won't

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.649 
flashes once every 15 seconds I won't
make<00:03:53.680> you<00:03:53.709> guys<00:03:53.979> wait<00:03:54.190> that<00:03:54.370> long<00:03:54.549> so<00:03:54.819> we'll<00:03:55.510> go

switch it back over there there's your

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.699 
switch it back over there there's your
three<00:04:00.639> different<00:04:00.909> brightnesses<00:04:01.709> you

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
three different brightnesses you

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.500 
three different brightnesses you
actually<00:04:03.010> have<00:04:03.159> one<00:04:03.400> more<00:04:03.609> mode<00:04:03.879> that's<00:04:04.239> kind

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
actually have one more mode that's kind

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.569

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.550 
of hidden you press and hold it it's
gonna<00:04:06.669> switch<00:04:06.940> over<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.239> strop<00:04:07.569> if<00:04:07.810> you<00:04:08.199> let<00:04:08.409> go

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
gonna switch over to strop if you let go

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.289 
gonna switch over to strop if you let go
it'll<00:04:08.739> stay<00:04:08.919> in<00:04:09.099> that<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.549> you'll<00:04:09.970> see<00:04:10.150> it's

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
it'll stay in that and you'll see it's

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.180 
it'll stay in that and you'll see it's
one<00:04:10.479> of<00:04:10.599> the<00:04:10.690> the<00:04:10.720> random<00:04:11.260> strobes<00:04:11.739> so<00:04:11.919> it<00:04:12.040> goes

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
one of the the random strobes so it goes

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.589 
one of the the random strobes so it goes
through<00:04:12.370> a<00:04:12.400> few<00:04:12.879> different<00:04:12.970> frequencies<00:04:13.569> of

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 
through a few different frequencies of

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.420 
through a few different frequencies of
the<00:04:13.810> stroke<00:04:14.049> and<00:04:14.229> then<00:04:14.739> hit<00:04:14.889> the<00:04:15.040> side<00:04:15.280> switch

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
the stroke and then hit the side switch

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.039 
the stroke and then hit the side switch
and<00:04:15.819> it<00:04:15.909> goes<00:04:16.030> back<00:04:16.269> into<00:04:16.479> whatever<00:04:16.810> you<00:04:16.930> had

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
still going to go into your strobe so

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.969 
still going to go into your strobe so
neat<00:04:28.419> feature<00:04:28.659> if<00:04:29.200> you<00:04:29.320> need<00:04:29.469> the<00:04:29.560> strobe<00:04:29.830> is

okay we got a zoomed in a little bit
better<00:04:41.050> just<00:04:41.289> so<00:04:41.409> you<00:04:41.499> can<00:04:41.589> see<00:04:41.710> the<00:04:41.830> features

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:42.159 
better just so you can see the features

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:43.829 
better just so you can see the features
of<00:04:42.309> the<00:04:42.370> light<00:04:42.550> there<00:04:43.029> you<00:04:43.150> can<00:04:43.300> see<00:04:43.419> that<00:04:43.599> side

00:04:43.829 --> 00:04:43.839 
of the light there you can see that side

00:04:43.839 --> 00:04:47.070 
of the light there you can see that side
switch<00:04:44.169> nice<00:04:44.979> feeling<00:04:45.460> to<00:04:45.490> it<00:04:45.779> showed<00:04:46.779> you<00:04:46.930> the

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
switch nice feeling to it showed you the

switch nice feeling to it showed you the
reflector<00:04:47.499> in<00:04:47.559> the<00:04:47.650> LED<00:04:47.889> earlier<00:04:48.309> we'll<00:04:48.460> show

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
reflector in the LED earlier we'll show

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.999 
reflector in the LED earlier we'll show
you<00:04:48.610> that<00:04:48.699> again<00:04:49.289> really<00:04:50.289> good<00:04:50.439> machining<00:04:50.919> on

there's<00:04:55.930> your<00:04:56.520> rotated<00:04:57.520> rest<00:04:57.759> so<00:04:57.909> you<00:04:57.969> can<00:04:58.029> see

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
there's your rotated rest so you can see

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.290 
there's your rotated rest so you can see
the<00:04:58.300> different<00:04:58.569> angles<00:04:58.839> of<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:58.990> light<00:05:00.300> nice

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
the different angles of the light nice

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.939

20 out here just to show you what these

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:25.379 
20 out here just to show you what these
lights<00:05:24.189> can<00:05:24.399> do<00:05:24.550> and<00:05:24.909> we're<00:05:25.120> going<00:05:25.240> to<00:05:25.300> be

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
lights can do and we're going to be

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.019 
lights can do and we're going to be
comparing<00:05:25.809> them<00:05:26.020> like<00:05:26.919> that<00:05:27.099> I<00:05:27.129> always<00:05:27.370> use<00:05:27.699> a

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:28.029 
comparing them like that I always use a

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:31.559 
comparing them like that I always use a
big<00:05:28.569> 4<00:05:29.020> D<00:05:29.289> incandescent<00:05:30.129> mag<00:05:30.520> light<00:05:30.729> so<00:05:31.270> let's

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:31.569 
big 4 D incandescent mag light so let's

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:33.570 
big 4 D incandescent mag light so let's
give<00:05:31.719> that<00:05:31.749> mag<00:05:32.050> light<00:05:32.259> a<00:05:32.319> shot<00:05:32.589> first<00:05:32.830> and<00:05:33.159> see

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
give that mag light a shot first and see

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.079 
give that mag light a shot first and see
how<00:05:33.610> it<00:05:33.849> does<00:05:34.029> so<00:05:35.580> there's<00:05:36.580> the<00:05:36.729> mag<00:05:36.879> light

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:37.089 
how it does so there's the mag light

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:38.550 
how it does so there's the mag light
there's<00:05:37.419> a<00:05:37.479> little<00:05:37.719> bush<00:05:37.870> that's<00:05:38.050> about<00:05:38.199> 15

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
there's a little bush that's about 15

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.179 
there's a little bush that's about 15
feet<00:05:38.740> away

00:05:39.179 --> 00:05:39.189 
feet away

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:40.469 
feet away
of<00:05:39.249> course<00:05:39.459> it<00:05:39.610> lights<00:05:39.759> that<00:05:39.909> up<00:05:40.060> really<00:05:40.330> well

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 
of course it lights that up really well

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:42.600 
of course it lights that up really well
and<00:05:40.659> then<00:05:41.439> a<00:05:41.469> tree<00:05:41.860> that's<00:05:42.039> about<00:05:42.189> 100<00:05:42.520> feet

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
and then a tree that's about 100 feet

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.929 
and then a tree that's about 100 feet
away<00:05:42.669> does<00:05:43.389> a<00:05:43.449> pretty<00:05:43.599> decent<00:05:43.689> job<00:05:43.990> with<00:05:44.409> that

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:44.939 
away does a pretty decent job with that

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:46.889 
away does a pretty decent job with that
everything<00:05:45.939> else<00:05:46.089> is<00:05:46.240> all<00:05:46.389> going<00:05:46.599> on<00:05:46.749> around

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:46.899 
everything else is all going on around

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:48.449 
everything else is all going on around
it<00:05:47.199> and<00:05:47.289> I<00:05:47.379> can<00:05:47.560> maybe<00:05:47.770> see<00:05:48.039> what's<00:05:48.159> going<00:05:48.339> on

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:48.459 
it and I can maybe see what's going on

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:51.389 
it and I can maybe see what's going on
for<00:05:48.879> I'd<00:05:49.240> say<00:05:49.270> probably<00:05:49.509> 10<00:05:49.839> 15<00:05:50.259> feet<00:05:50.469> not<00:05:51.159> much

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:51.399 
for I'd say probably 10 15 feet not much

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:52.649 
for I'd say probably 10 15 feet not much
beyond<00:05:51.639> that<00:05:51.669> and<00:05:51.969> how<00:05:52.089> does<00:05:52.149> of<00:05:52.300> course<00:05:52.509> as

00:05:52.649 --> 00:05:52.659 
beyond that and how does of course as

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:54.659 
beyond that and how does of course as
focused<00:05:52.990> as<00:05:53.110> he<00:05:53.139> gets<00:05:53.409> we'll<00:05:54.189> spread<00:05:54.399> it<00:05:54.459> out

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
focused as he gets we'll spread it out

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.219 
focused as he gets we'll spread it out
you<00:05:55.060> can<00:05:55.180> see<00:05:55.360> that<00:05:55.719> doesn't<00:05:55.930> really<00:05:56.110> help

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
you can see that doesn't really help

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.040 
you can see that doesn't really help
much<00:05:56.580> that's<00:05:57.580> as<00:05:57.729> focused<00:05:58.060> as<00:05:58.149> it<00:05:58.300> gets<00:05:58.479> so

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
much that's as focused as it gets so

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.629 
much that's as focused as it gets so
let's<00:05:59.259> give<00:05:59.379> those<00:05:59.469> little<00:05:59.559> klaris<00:06:00.099> lights<00:06:00.370> a

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
let's give those little klaris lights a

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.519 
let's give those little klaris lights a
shot<00:06:01.479> and<00:06:01.719> see<00:06:01.870> how<00:06:01.899> they<00:06:02.139> do

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:02.529 
shot and see how they do

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:07.110 
shot and see how they do
so<00:06:03.039> we'll<00:06:03.129> try<00:06:03.339> the<00:06:05.430> little<00:06:06.430> one<00:06:06.610> first<00:06:06.789> this

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
so we'll try the little one first this

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.089 
so we'll try the little one first this
is<00:06:07.240> a<00:06:07.360> double-a<00:06:07.719> model<00:06:08.050> this<00:06:08.169> is<00:06:08.319> the<00:06:08.439> St<00:06:08.830> 10

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099 
is a double-a model this is the St 10

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:11.610 
is a double-a model this is the St 10
see<00:06:10.029> it<00:06:10.330> lights<00:06:10.539> up<00:06:10.659> everything<00:06:11.110> in<00:06:11.379> front<00:06:11.559> of

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
see it lights up everything in front of

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:12.570 
see it lights up everything in front of
me

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
me

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.980 
me
pretty<00:06:12.939> much<00:06:13.059> everything<00:06:13.360> that's<00:06:13.689> in<00:06:13.809> front

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
pretty much everything that's in front

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.570 
pretty much everything that's in front
of<00:06:14.050> me<00:06:14.110> I<00:06:14.139> can<00:06:14.319> see<00:06:14.439> really<00:06:14.620> well<00:06:14.919> even<00:06:15.459> at<00:06:15.550> a

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
of me I can see really well even at a

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.540 
of me I can see really well even at a
distance<00:06:16.349> hundred<00:06:17.349> feet<00:06:17.469> out<00:06:17.620> there<00:06:17.649> it's<00:06:18.430> up

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
distance hundred feet out there it's up

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.219 
distance hundred feet out there it's up
everything<00:06:18.939> really<00:06:19.089> well<00:06:19.300> so<00:06:19.749> that's<00:06:19.899> the<00:06:20.020> max

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:20.229 
everything really well so that's the max

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:22.649 
everything really well so that's the max
brightness<00:06:20.469> I<00:06:20.919> cycle<00:06:21.520> through<00:06:21.550> you<00:06:22.539> had

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
brightness I cycle through you had

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:23.969 
brightness I cycle through you had
different<00:06:22.959> brightnesses<00:06:23.379> that's<00:06:23.649> the<00:06:23.770> lowest

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
different brightnesses that's the lowest

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:27.299 
different brightnesses that's the lowest
on<00:06:24.370> the<00:06:24.610> regular<00:06:24.939> modes<00:06:25.349> medium<00:06:26.349> and<00:06:27.099> there's

00:06:27.299 --> 00:06:27.309 
on the regular modes medium and there's

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:29.999 
on the regular modes medium and there's
high<00:06:27.520> again<00:06:28.110> show<00:06:29.110> you<00:06:29.169> that<00:06:29.349> a<00:06:29.379> little<00:06:29.680> bit<00:06:29.800> I

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:30.009 
high again show you that a little bit I

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:31.860 
high again show you that a little bit I
notice<00:06:30.639> on<00:06:30.729> some<00:06:30.759> of<00:06:30.969> my<00:06:31.029> other<00:06:31.180> videos<00:06:31.270> that<00:06:31.809> I

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
notice on some of my other videos that I

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.679 
notice on some of my other videos that I
kind<00:06:32.139> of<00:06:32.229> spaz<00:06:33.009> out<00:06:33.309> and<00:06:33.550> put<00:06:34.300> the<00:06:34.389> light<00:06:34.539> all

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:34.689 
kind of spaz out and put the light all

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:35.969 
kind of spaz out and put the light all
over<00:06:34.719> the<00:06:34.990> place<00:06:35.169> so<00:06:35.199> I'll<00:06:35.409> try<00:06:35.529> to<00:06:35.559> keep<00:06:35.680> it<00:06:35.889> in

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:35.979 
over the place so I'll try to keep it in

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.040 
over the place so I'll try to keep it in
one<00:06:36.069> place<00:06:36.279> for<00:06:36.309> a<00:06:36.490> little<00:06:36.669> while<00:06:36.789> so<00:06:37.569> that<00:06:37.599> is

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
one place for a little while so that is

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:41.119 
one place for a little while so that is
the<00:06:38.409> St<00:06:38.949> 10<00:06:39.219> let's<00:06:39.879> give<00:06:40.089> the<00:06:40.329> NT<00:06:40.899> 10

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:41.129 
the St 10 let's give the NT 10

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:46.399 
the St 10 let's give the NT 10
rnt<00:06:41.879> 20<00:06:42.239> shot<00:06:42.779> see<00:06:42.989> how<00:06:43.020> it<00:06:43.259> does<00:06:45.169> there's<00:06:46.169> the

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:46.409 
rnt 20 shot see how it does there's the

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:48.409 
rnt 20 shot see how it does there's the
lowest<00:06:46.739> brightness<00:06:47.209> cycle<00:06:48.209> through<00:06:48.360> the

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 
lowest brightness cycle through the

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:49.669 
lowest brightness cycle through the
different<00:06:48.659> brightnesses<00:06:49.080> there's<00:06:49.529> your

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:49.679 
different brightnesses there's your

00:06:49.679 --> 00:06:50.469 
different brightnesses there's your
medium

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 
medium

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.729 
medium
there's<00:06:51.479> your<00:06:51.659> high<00:06:51.779> you<00:06:52.169> see<00:06:52.349> that<00:06:52.559> one's

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:52.739 
there's your high you see that one's

00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:54.949 
there's your high you see that one's
even<00:06:52.979> brighter<00:06:53.489> which<00:06:53.879> on<00:06:54.179> to<00:06:54.449> see<00:06:54.629> I<00:06:54.659> went<00:06:54.839> to

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:54.959 
even brighter which on to see I went to

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:57.489 
even brighter which on to see I went to
three<00:06:55.169> batteries<00:06:55.469> of<00:06:55.769> course<00:06:55.949> this<00:06:56.389> so

00:06:57.489 --> 00:06:57.499 
three batteries of course this so

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:59.179 
three batteries of course this so
everything<00:06:58.499> in<00:06:58.589> front<00:06:58.739> of<00:06:58.800> me<00:06:58.919> is<00:06:58.979> lit<00:06:59.159> up

00:06:59.179 --> 00:06:59.189 
everything in front of me is lit up

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:01.999 
everything in front of me is lit up
really<00:06:59.580> well<00:06:59.699> that<00:07:00.059> tree<00:07:00.499> that's<00:07:01.499> only<00:07:01.649> 100

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:02.009 
really well that tree that's only 100

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:04.009 
really well that tree that's only 100
feet<00:07:02.129> out<00:07:02.279> there<00:07:02.309> I'm<00:07:03.149> sure<00:07:03.330> I<00:07:03.360> could<00:07:03.539> go<00:07:03.659> a<00:07:03.689> lot

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:04.019 
feet out there I'm sure I could go a lot

00:07:04.019 --> 00:07:05.719 
feet out there I'm sure I could go a lot
further<00:07:04.199> than<00:07:04.499> that<00:07:04.559> really<00:07:05.369> really<00:07:05.519> easily

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:05.729 
further than that really really easily

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:08.989 
further than that really really easily
so<00:07:06.119> we're<00:07:06.989> gonna<00:07:07.080> keep<00:07:07.319> the<00:07:07.649> NT<00:07:08.309> 20<00:07:08.699> on<00:07:08.909> the

00:07:08.989 --> 00:07:08.999 
so we're gonna keep the NT 20 on the

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:12.769 
so we're gonna keep the NT 20 on the
right<00:07:09.149> here<00:07:09.509> and<00:07:10.129> there<00:07:11.129> is<00:07:11.369> the<00:07:11.639> st<00:07:12.089> 10<00:07:12.330> on<00:07:12.599> the

00:07:12.769 --> 00:07:12.779 
right here and there is the st 10 on the

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:14.179 
right here and there is the st 10 on the
left<00:07:12.959> let's<00:07:13.259> put<00:07:13.469> it<00:07:13.559> back<00:07:13.649> to<00:07:13.830> that<00:07:13.949> max

00:07:14.179 --> 00:07:14.189 
left let's put it back to that max

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:16.909 
left let's put it back to that max
brightness<00:07:14.689> you<00:07:15.689> can<00:07:15.779> see<00:07:15.990> still<00:07:16.559> lights<00:07:16.769> of

00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:16.919 
brightness you can see still lights of

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:19.939 
brightness you can see still lights of
things<00:07:17.129> really<00:07:17.309> well<00:07:17.899> but<00:07:18.899> not<00:07:19.349> quite<00:07:19.409> as<00:07:19.769> well

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:19.949 
things really well but not quite as well

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:24.049 
things really well but not quite as well
as<00:07:20.219> the<00:07:20.669> NT<00:07:20.969> 20<00:07:21.330> so<00:07:22.139> st<00:07:22.529> 10<00:07:22.709> on<00:07:22.830> the<00:07:22.919> left<00:07:23.159> and<00:07:23.459> t

00:07:24.049 --> 00:07:24.059 
as the NT 20 so st 10 on the left and t

00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:26.089 
as the NT 20 so st 10 on the left and t
20<00:07:24.360> on<00:07:24.449> the<00:07:24.539> right<00:07:24.719> we're<00:07:25.469> down<00:07:25.559> the<00:07:25.709> ground<00:07:25.949> so

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:26.099 
20 on the right we're down the ground so

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:27.799 
20 on the right we're down the ground so
you<00:07:26.189> can<00:07:26.279> see<00:07:26.449> difference<00:07:27.449> a<00:07:27.539> little<00:07:27.599> bit

00:07:27.799 --> 00:07:27.809 
you can see difference a little bit

00:07:27.809 --> 00:07:31.070 
you can see difference a little bit
