00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.549 

I<00:00:10.740> would<00:00:11.370> go<00:00:11.519> home<00:00:11.760> I<00:00:12.120> would<00:00:12.900> just<00:00:13.110> draw<00:00:13.380> on<00:00:13.500> the

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
I would go home I would just draw on the

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.590 
I would go home I would just draw on the
floor<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.219> like<00:00:14.490> my<00:00:15.000> friends<00:00:15.330> would<00:00:15.450> come

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:15.600 
floor and like my friends would come

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.170 
floor and like my friends would come
over<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:16.279> I'd<00:00:17.279> just<00:00:17.460> be<00:00:17.610> drawing<00:00:17.880> on<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
over and I'd just be drawing on the

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.580 
over and I'd just be drawing on the
floor<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.600> then<00:00:18.750> they'd<00:00:18.930> have<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.290> go<00:00:19.439> home

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
floor and then they'd have to go home

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.440 
floor and then they'd have to go home
because<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.130> would<00:00:20.310> just<00:00:20.520> bore<00:00:20.700> them<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:20.910> death

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.450 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.269 

so<00:00:24.450> I<00:00:24.480> think<00:00:24.689> it's<00:00:25.230> really<00:00:25.500> important<00:00:26.040> if<00:00:26.130> you

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
so I think it's really important if you

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.519 
so I think it's really important if you
want<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.580> get<00:00:26.730> good<00:00:26.880> at<00:00:26.939> anything<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.720> just

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
want to get good at anything to just

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.609 
want to get good at anything to just
just<00:00:29.009> to<00:00:29.189> keep<00:00:29.369> going<00:00:29.880> at<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.239> you<00:00:30.419> you<00:00:30.869> you

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
just to keep going at it you you you

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.330 
just to keep going at it you you you
start<00:00:31.919> to<00:00:31.980> find<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.940> there's<00:00:33.840> these<00:00:34.350> almost

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
start to find that there's these almost

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.150 
start to find that there's these almost
like<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> plateau<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.809> can't<00:00:37.260> get<00:00:37.440> across

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
like a plateau that you can't get across

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.850 
like a plateau that you can't get across
and<00:00:38.610> then<00:00:38.760> one<00:00:39.030> day<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.600> will<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:40.170> able<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.559> do

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
and then one day you will be able to do

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.919 
and then one day you will be able to do
it<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.340> it's<00:00:41.520> almost<00:00:41.670> like<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.180> slept<00:00:42.570> and

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:42.929 
it and it's almost like you slept and

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:46.430 
it and it's almost like you slept and
then<00:00:43.679> the<00:00:43.800> next<00:00:44.070> day<00:00:44.629> you're<00:00:45.629> able<00:00:45.839> to<00:00:46.019> do<00:00:46.289> it

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
then the next day you're able to do it

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.310 
then the next day you're able to do it
it's<00:00:46.589> like<00:00:46.769> it<00:00:46.920> magically<00:00:47.579> appears<00:00:48.289> so<00:00:49.289> I

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
it's like it magically appears so I

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.739 
it's like it magically appears so I
thought<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.070> was<00:00:50.309> really<00:00:50.699> important<00:00:51.329> if<00:00:51.629> you

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:51.749 
thought that was really important if you

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:54.950 
thought that was really important if you
keep<00:00:52.050> working<00:00:52.230> at<00:00:52.499> something<00:00:53.239> it's<00:00:54.239> almost

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
keep working at something it's almost

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.529 
keep working at something it's almost
it's<00:00:55.379> not<00:00:55.620> by<00:00:55.800> magic<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.399> it's<00:00:56.760> by<00:00:57.089> a<00:00:57.120> lot<00:00:57.420> of

it's not by magic it's it's by a lot of

in the middle and I still feel like I'm

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.150 
in the middle and I still feel like I'm
not<00:02:48.599> exactly<00:02:49.599> sure<00:02:50.670> where<00:02:51.670> it's<00:02:51.879> going<00:02:51.970> but<00:02:52.480> I

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
not exactly sure where it's going but I

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.860 
not exactly sure where it's going but I
I'm<00:02:54.160> really<00:02:54.610> excited<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.299> find<00:02:55.510> out<00:02:55.629> and

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870

I'm really excited to find out and
that's<00:02:56.079> another<00:02:56.500> reason<00:02:56.739> why<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.040> feel<00:02:57.400> like<00:02:57.609> I

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
that's another reason why I feel like I

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.110 
that's another reason why I feel like I
have<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.120> seclude<00:02:58.510> myself<00:02:58.540> right<00:02:59.170> now<00:02:59.319> to<00:03:00.129> dig

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
have to seclude myself right now to dig

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.039 
have to seclude myself right now to dig
deep<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:01.720> like<00:03:01.989> know<00:03:02.680> where<00:03:03.299> why<00:03:04.299> I<00:03:04.329> make<00:03:04.810> art

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
deep and like know where why I make art

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.460 
deep and like know where why I make art
so<00:03:05.410> I'm<00:03:06.370> still<00:03:06.730> figuring<00:03:06.940> that<00:03:07.359> out<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.810> then

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
so I'm still figuring that out and then

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.500 
so I'm still figuring that out and then
I'm<00:03:08.799> sure<00:03:08.859> that<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.760> would<00:03:09.849> all<00:03:10.030> come<00:03:10.060> together

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
I'm sure that it would all come together

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.660 
I'm sure that it would all come together
