00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.140
 it is already a success story 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.440
 the golf gti seeks its equal since 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.580
 the original model from 1976 he has until today 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.289
 nearly 1.9 million owners found 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.630
 now the seventh generation is in the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.240
 start holes twice as strong as the ur 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.369
 gti and with two drive alternatives 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.369
 we have tested for you 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.079
 welcome to the cÃ´te d'azur where we 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.850
 today with the new golf gti test with 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.620
 board a new locking differential at the 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.629
 the front axle for even more dynamics 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.550
 should take care of and the so-called 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.670
 Progressively steering but you look 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.670
 even 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.270
 instead of the 110 ps of yore sends the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.170
 two liter turbo direct injection of 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.970
 today 220 ps into the race and who that 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.740
 not enough gets at the 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.460
 performance variant one more 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.990
 10 ps and the 230 horses 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.260
 Feel damned good 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:10.110
 In any case, 350 newton meters care 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.170
 1500 rpm for an impressive 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.270
 force on the front axle in 6 4 seconds 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.720
 happen like the centennial and 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.450
 it continues until 250 then comes 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.340
 the electronic trowel ingenious in the new 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.280
 gti is the electronically controlled 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.340
 differential lock the vw specifically for 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.900
 has developed its high end variant 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.390
 You do not have to be a technology freak and too 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.650
 feel that this addition for each of 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.860
 with the racer on the socks 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.729
 make the purest cream is when you 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.500
 now out of a turn 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.260
 they will accelerate out 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.750
 notice that understeer what 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.940
 otherwise you had earlier more often 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.640
 front-wheel drive vehicles now complete 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.050
 is eliminated and the vehicle 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.970
 wonderfully drawn in the curve 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.410
 along the ideal line you can do so 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.080
 accelerate out clean 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.119
 that is an essential part of the lock 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.070
 the nice thing about it being electronic 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.869
 works is she can communicate 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.429
 with all other systems for example 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.740
 also with the steering the 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.240
 Electromechanical steering can 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.890
 disadvantages one with one earlier 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.230
 lock had namely that one in the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.660
 steering has felt compensated so that 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.400
 Do not be irritated in the steering 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.900
 get because the steering knows exactly what 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.659
 makes mistakes 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.030
 the rest is done by progressive steering 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:26.340
 which has premiere in both variants 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.049
 here only a small steering wheel is enough 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.810
 movement and the gti genuinely 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.670
 by the curve a driving behavior that 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.060
 even a die-hard racing driver 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.900
 to rave about how high the 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.370
 Turning speeds are it is 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.319
 unbelievable how that x compares to 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.060
 it used to be fantastic in the car 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.010
 the connected to the brake with the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.109
 new steering with the new lock with 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.700
 this full fear cross-lock does that 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.590
 just right bock and lauda with 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.060
 to drive around you will still be you 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.310
 still motivated to do more 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.680
 by car and you reach it completely 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.849
 just not fantastic 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.980
 inside is also the seventh 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.159
 generation loyal to the traditions 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.019
 remained neat of the covers 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.840
 halting sports seats in the legendary 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.280
 check pattern down to the typical gti 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.120
 Details that you do not miss 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.670
 want 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.650
 in the right track is brought the 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.069
 wolfsburger power latch on a leather 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.629
 sport steering wheel with multifunction buttons 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.019
 technical refinements ensure that 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.639
 the ride with the gti without regrets 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.579
 the new gti is a worthy successor 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:28.019
 the previous gti is extremely agile 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.760
 it makes him incredibly fun 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.069
 drive and he is at moderate 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.120
 driving not so funny 6 liters 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.440
 are the measure of things 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.440
 we think that fits
