volume 21 issue 4 which is 2007 winter I
can<00:00:34.489> honestly<00:00:34.670> remember<00:00:35.060> I<00:00:35.270> have<00:00:35.420> to<00:00:35.570> look

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
can honestly remember I have to look

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.960 
can honestly remember I have to look
that<00:00:35.870> up<00:00:36.020> anyways<00:00:36.800> it's<00:00:37.040> called<00:00:37.280> demystifying

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
that up anyways it's called demystifying

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.479 
that up anyways it's called demystifying
sharpening<00:00:38.510> and<00:00:38.750> this<00:00:39.590> has<00:00:39.770> really<00:00:39.980> given<00:00:40.340> me

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
sharpening and this has really given me

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.660 
sharpening and this has really given me
the<00:00:40.640> ability<00:00:40.970> to<00:00:41.239> set<00:00:41.570> my<00:00:41.800> jigs<00:00:42.800> up<00:00:43.010> every<00:00:43.430> time

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
the ability to set my jigs up every time

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.840 
the ability to set my jigs up every time
so<00:00:43.910> I<00:00:43.940> can<00:00:44.210> get<00:00:44.420> consistent<00:00:45.320> sharpening<00:00:46.010> every

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
so I can get consistent sharpening every

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.330 
so I can get consistent sharpening every
time<00:00:47.090> every<00:00:47.510> time<00:00:47.540> I<00:00:47.720> put<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.200> gouge<00:00:48.830> onto

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
time every time I put the gouge onto

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.820 
time every time I put the gouge onto
this<00:00:49.520> jig<00:00:49.880> setup<00:00:50.270> it<00:00:50.930> comes<00:00:51.200> out<00:00:51.380> sharpened

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:51.830 
this jig setup it comes out sharpened

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.220 
this jig setup it comes out sharpened
exactly<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:52.340> same<00:00:52.520> every<00:00:52.820> time<00:00:53.080> one<00:00:54.080> of<00:00:54.110> the

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
exactly the same every time one of the

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.630 
exactly the same every time one of the
problems<00:00:54.560> with<00:00:54.680> any<00:00:54.950> kind<00:00:55.160> of<00:00:55.190> a<00:00:55.280> grinding

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
problems with any kind of a grinding

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.040 
problems with any kind of a grinding
wheel<00:00:55.700> system<00:00:56.060> of<00:00:56.300> course<00:00:56.480> is<00:00:56.660> as<00:00:56.780> you<00:00:56.900> use

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
wheel system of course is as you use

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.050 
wheel system of course is as you use
these<00:00:57.230> wheels<00:00:57.500> they<00:00:57.800> get<00:00:57.950> smaller<00:00:58.250> so<00:00:58.550> that's

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.060 
these wheels they get smaller so that's

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.340 
these wheels they get smaller so that's
going<00:00:59.240> to<00:00:59.300> change<00:00:59.360> your<00:00:59.690> relationship<00:01:00.200> here

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
going to change your relationship here

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.520 
going to change your relationship here
between<00:01:00.470> the<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:01.870> distance<00:01:02.870> from<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.110> pocket

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
between the the distance from the pocket

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.560 
between the the distance from the pocket
here<00:01:03.800> to<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:04.430> wheel<00:01:04.610> which<00:01:04.879> changes<00:01:05.449> the

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
here to the wheel which changes the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.630 
here to the wheel which changes the
angle<00:01:05.720> that<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.170> gouge<00:01:06.860> will<00:01:07.070> be<00:01:07.159> sharpened

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
angle that the gouge will be sharpened

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.660 
angle that the gouge will be sharpened
so<00:01:08.420> this<00:01:08.810> is<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.200> wood<00:01:09.979> little<00:01:10.189> wooden<00:01:10.430> Jake

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
so this is the wood little wooden Jake

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.580 
so this is the wood little wooden Jake
and<00:01:10.909> if<00:01:11.420> you<00:01:11.509> read<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.840> article<00:01:12.200> he<00:01:12.320> gives<00:01:12.500> you

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
and if you read the article he gives you

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.750 
and if you read the article he gives you
all<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:12.770> dimensions<00:01:13.250> and<00:01:13.400> everything<00:01:13.460> else

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:13.760 
all the dimensions and everything else

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.399 
all the dimensions and everything else
depending<00:01:14.120> on<00:01:14.240> what<00:01:14.450> degree<00:01:14.840> you<00:01:15.110> want<00:01:15.260> to<00:01:15.350> go

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
depending on what degree you want to go

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.980 
depending on what degree you want to go
I<00:01:15.500> like<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.770> 55<00:01:16.400> degree<00:01:16.760> so<00:01:17.360> this<00:01:17.570> goes<00:01:17.810> down

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
I like the 55 degree so this goes down

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.570 
I like the 55 degree so this goes down
in<00:01:18.170> here<00:01:18.380> you<00:01:18.560> see<00:01:18.710> a<00:01:18.740> better<00:01:18.980> set<00:01:19.159> up<00:01:19.280> already

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
in here you see a better set up already

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.940 
in here you see a better set up already
and<00:01:19.700> that's<00:01:20.630> sure<00:01:20.870> that<00:01:21.170> sets<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.590> distance

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
and that's sure that sets the distance

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.270 
and that's sure that sets the distance
there<00:01:22.190> I've<00:01:22.909> got<00:01:23.120> other<00:01:23.240> ones<00:01:23.510> here<00:01:23.840> I<00:01:24.280> got

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
there I've got other ones here I got

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.880 
there I've got other ones here I got
another<00:01:25.520> one<00:01:26.030> here<00:01:26.240> for<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.659> detail<00:01:27.409> gouge<00:01:27.620> at

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
another one here for the detail gouge at

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.950 
another one here for the detail gouge at
48<00:01:28.280> degrees<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:28.909> another<00:01:29.360> one<00:01:29.600> here<00:01:29.750> for<00:01:29.870> the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
48 degrees and another one here for the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.020 
48 degrees and another one here for the
the<00:01:30.409> long<00:01:30.620> strong<00:01:30.920> spindle<00:01:31.340> gouge<00:01:31.490> at<00:01:31.700> 40

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
the long strong spindle gouge at 40

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.490 
the long strong spindle gouge at 40
degrees<00:01:32.300> you<00:01:32.450> can<00:01:32.600> tell<00:01:32.780> they're<00:01:32.960> different

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
degrees you can tell they're different

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.110 
degrees you can tell they're different
sizes<00:01:34.070> because<00:01:34.250> they<00:01:34.370> set<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.729> pocket

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
sizes because they set the pocket

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.580 
sizes because they set the pocket
distance<00:01:35.479> different<00:01:35.840> distances<00:01:36.320> away<00:01:36.380> from

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
distance different distances away from

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.610 
distance different distances away from
the<00:01:36.800> from<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.790> grinding<00:01:38.150> wheel<00:01:38.560> okay<00:01:39.560> so

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
the from the grinding wheel okay so

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.649 
the from the grinding wheel okay so
that's<00:01:39.920> that<00:01:41.170> next<00:01:42.170> I<00:01:42.260> have<00:01:42.470> my<00:01:43.120> own<00:01:44.120> version

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
that's that next I have my own version

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.420 
that's that next I have my own version
of<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:46.299> sharpening<00:01:47.350> gouge<00:01:48.350> holder<00:01:49.070> whatever
