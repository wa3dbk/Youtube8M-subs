00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.770 
didn't pull my nods i did not bleach
them<00:02:46.739> i<00:02:46.769> did<00:02:47.040> not<00:02:47.159> tweeze<00:02:47.519> them<00:02:47.549> all<00:02:48.180> i<00:02:48.239> did<00:02:48.750> was

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
i think this is the best way because a

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.610 
i think this is the best way because a
lot<00:02:54.389> of<00:02:54.420> people<00:02:54.510> have<00:02:54.840> been<00:02:54.870> messing<00:02:55.409> up<00:02:55.500> their

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
closures due to trying to bleach it

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.679 
closures due to trying to bleach it
themselves<00:02:58.250> +<00:02:59.250> bleaching<00:02:59.760> takes<00:03:00.030> time<00:03:00.359> to<00:03:00.540> do

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
themselves + bleaching takes time to do

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.830 
themselves + bleaching takes time to do
I<00:03:01.310> don't<00:03:02.310> even<00:03:02.400> bleach<00:03:02.669> my<00:03:02.849> closures<00:03:03.450> anymore
