00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
it kind of faded away so I could start

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.690 
it kind of faded away so I could start
seeing<00:02:58.510> again

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
seeing again

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.660

and I'm near-sighted and far-sighted so

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.280 
and I'm near-sighted and far-sighted so
following<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.209> also<00:03:16.420> get<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.900> questions

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
following that I also get the questions

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.830 
following that I also get the questions
of<00:03:17.500> how<00:03:18.070> far<00:03:18.340> can<00:03:18.520> you<00:03:18.610> see<00:03:18.790> how<00:03:19.150> close<00:03:19.420> up<00:03:19.630> can

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
of how far can you see how close up can

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.630 
of how far can you see how close up can
you<00:03:19.870> see<00:03:19.959> I<00:03:20.440> mean<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.459> all<00:03:21.550> depends<00:03:22.170> but<00:03:23.640> mostly

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
you see I mean it all depends but mostly
