make it my own with yours truly a
Celsius<00:00:44.120> energy<00:00:45.120> drink<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.680> what<00:00:46.680> I'm<00:00:46.800> gonna

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
Celsius energy drink so what I'm gonna

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.889 
Celsius energy drink so what I'm gonna
do<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.370> I'm<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.149> fill<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.480> up<00:00:48.690> to

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
do is I'm going to fill this up to

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.560 
do is I'm going to fill this up to
basically<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:50.309> top<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.000> blades<00:00:51.210> all

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
basically the top of the blades all

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.250 
basically the top of the blades all
right<00:00:52.430> there<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.670> so<00:00:54.270> now<00:00:54.420> not<00:00:54.780> only<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:55.140> this

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
right there this so now not only is this

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.680 
right there this so now not only is this
going<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.620> provide<00:00:55.920> me<00:00:56.070> with<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.280> energy<00:00:57.090> that

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
going to provide me with the energy that

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.689 
going to provide me with the energy that
I'm<00:00:57.840> looking<00:00:58.020> for<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.739> my<00:00:58.980> workout<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.579> it's

great stuff like the green tea which has

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.210 
great stuff like the green tea which has
the<00:01:05.390> EGCG<00:01:06.560> it's<00:01:07.560> gonna<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.010> ginger

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the EGCG it's gonna have the ginger

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.039 
the EGCG it's gonna have the ginger
extract<00:01:08.490> root<00:01:09.060> which<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.720> know<00:01:09.810> gonna

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
extract root which is you know gonna

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.520 
extract root which is you know gonna
provide<00:01:10.409> me<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:11.119> um<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.750> energy<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.470> I'm

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
provide me that um that energy that I'm

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.719 
provide me that um that energy that I'm
looking<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:13.860> there's<00:01:14.220> going<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.430> caffeine

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
looking for there's going to be caffeine

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.149 
looking for there's going to be caffeine
in<00:01:15.240> there<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.540> well<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.140> taurine<00:01:16.680> iguana

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
in there as well the taurine iguana

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.510 
in there as well the taurine iguana
extract<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.530> great<00:01:19.740> thing<00:01:19.920> about<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.369> is

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
extract and the great thing about it is

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.080 
extract and the great thing about it is
that<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:21.360> whole<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:22.040> has<00:01:23.040> ten<00:01:23.400> calories<00:01:23.909> so

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
that this whole can has ten calories so

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.880 
that this whole can has ten calories so
that<00:01:24.119> two<00:01:24.960> ounces<00:01:25.380> probably<00:01:25.890> forget<00:01:26.340> about<00:01:26.430> it

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
that two ounces probably forget about it

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.660 
that two ounces probably forget about it
has<00:01:29.240> maybe<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.479> calorie<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.680> what's

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
has maybe a calorie in it and what's

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.090 
has maybe a calorie in it and what's
even<00:01:33.060> better<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:34.110> there's<00:01:34.350> no<00:01:34.560> sugar<00:01:34.979> in

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
even better is that there's no sugar in

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.240 
even better is that there's no sugar in
this<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.970> has<00:01:36.150> two<00:01:37.140> grams<00:01:37.500> which<00:01:38.040> is

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
this and it has two grams which is

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.560 
this and it has two grams which is
equivalent<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.790> about<00:01:38.850> eight<00:01:39.150> percent<00:01:39.299> of

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
equivalent to about eight percent of

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.950 
equivalent to about eight percent of
your<00:01:39.659> daily<00:01:39.869> value<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.590> fiber<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.960> there's

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
your daily value of fiber so there's

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.810 
your daily value of fiber so there's
some<00:01:43.170> great<00:01:43.470> benefits<00:01:43.979> other<00:01:44.159> than<00:01:44.280> just<00:01:44.640> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
some great benefits other than just the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.270 
some great benefits other than just the
energy<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> biotin<00:01:45.990> which<00:01:46.380> some<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.070> you

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
energy and the biotin which some of you

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.160 
energy and the biotin which some of you
like<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.670> use<00:01:47.880> for<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.750> know<00:01:48.890> female<00:01:49.890> anyway

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
like to use for you know female anyway

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.770 
like to use for you know female anyway
for<00:01:52.170> hair<00:01:52.320> growth<00:01:52.880> but<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.000> also<00:01:54.329> good<00:01:54.750> for

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
for hair growth but it's also good for

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.020 
for hair growth but it's also good for
the<00:01:55.020> digestive<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.890> for<00:01:56.549> energy<00:01:56.909> and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
the digestive and for energy and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.810 
the digestive and for energy and
metabolism<00:01:57.710> I'm<00:01:58.710> gonna<00:01:58.860> use<00:01:59.070> some<00:01:59.100> frozen

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
metabolism I'm gonna use some frozen

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.749 
metabolism I'm gonna use some frozen
strawberries<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.659> have<00:02:00.960> here<00:02:01.759> probably
