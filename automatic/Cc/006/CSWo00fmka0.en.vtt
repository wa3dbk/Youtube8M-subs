00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.860
 plant students in the department 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.660
 to take advantage of communication 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.359
 continental as part of a study 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.070
 there is always a compulsory internship that 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:19.930
 is in the fourth semester for six months 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.120
 I'm actually on continental 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.120
 come because it is an international 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.980
 active company is and I plan 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.789
 my studies abroad already was 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.949
 six months 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.900
 and in any case do something 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.730
 I want to continue where I still English 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.069
 speak and just in the international 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.980
 environment can work a college 

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:41.440
 also works with continental 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.050
 so come with us regularly guest 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.929
 lecturers from continental for example 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.879
 those who work here achieve it 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:50.079
 For example we had the felix gress 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.690
 with us the head of the 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.940
 corporate communication in a pr 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.889
 lecture and that has worked out very well 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.829
 interesting listened like that 

00:00:56.889 --> 00:01:02.579
 communication at continental is and so 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.010
 I also got a few tips 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.479
 and that really makes me feel so 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.430
 motivated me to apply 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.350
 as an intern is actually very 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.909
 I was well integrated by mine 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.950
 actually faithful in all his 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.350
 taken meetings and first time one 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.409
 to get an overview because of the topic 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.060
 at the beginning of course 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.340
 I have less idea I first such a 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.270
 a lot of colleagues think a lot 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.859
 met 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.429
 it was very interesting too 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:30.319
 I was able to work with workshops at some point 

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:31.950
 international also the 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:34.200
 communication manager from others 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.700
 countries were present and one becomes 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.140
 actually in all topics like that 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.030
 completely involved that one also his 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.459
 opinion can always bring and if 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.219
 one has ideas for new projects then 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:46.380
 You can always do it with 1 3 after the 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.450
 internship I decided then 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.789
 as working students all continue 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.560
 especially because of the team 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.360
 next level good atmosphere is that is 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.890
 always very important to me 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.509
 also the topics very interesting 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.759
 that we do and that I do a lot 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.459
 Free work can be so the goods for 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.379
 me actually the main criteria why 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.209
 I decided to go with mine 

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:09.000
 I am now finished studying in summer 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.679
 and of course one then thinks about it 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.220
 slower what you do afterwards 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.870
 would like to 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.910
 Of course, the question always arises 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.190
 I go into business or in one 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.019
 agency for example and then also in 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.269
 which company continuously 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.340
 really like to stay because of me 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.040
 we really like this one 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.549
 yes, no pr for the mature 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:33.049
 directly what tire size there is 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.049
 but search next to stories behind it
