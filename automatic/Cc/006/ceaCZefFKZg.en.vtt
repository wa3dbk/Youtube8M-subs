00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.260
 it's a nice match anyway 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.850
 part of the team we had to do it 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.830
 still come back after a 2nd to 0 to 2 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.020
 to 2 like that it's still very beautiful 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.300
 yeah we had to do it we got the 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.680
 stamps 20 minutes where we were not 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.349
 in the match we were perhaps tense 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.540
 tense we made a big mistake after this 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.009
 that he called flatten type I know 

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.509
 nothing and after we had bad luck 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.610
 car but we started playing our 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:33.030
 game we created situations we are 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.020
 and we came back to the score before the break 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.820
 it was important 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.530
 and then after we went people have 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.820
 given what they had to give they 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.019
 are well beaten and it's great 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.019
 pole ok i thank m 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.769
 you did the game you needed 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.760
 so we felt that a moment you have 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.559
 did the game you had to do 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.760
 are let loose maybe that be led two 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.460
 to zero it allowed you to be 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.219
 let go yes it's true that at 2 du rhÃ´ne has 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.690
 we dropped the horses and then I 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.089
 pity as did this start where we 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.379
 makes the efforts maybe that's good 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.940
 we could have but tonight but 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.350
 but if we could not have been 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.119
 led 2 0 might not have reacted 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.960
 like that so no no it's good 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.330
 have not lost 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.740
 this is especially against paris after being 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.210
 led 2 0 it takes it all goes on like 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.680
 that's ok there's ambition side 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.759
 Stephane finish the funny you are 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.350
 had denoted tonight that you finish 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.610
 maybe in the first three yeah 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.149
 it's good it's true we're doing a 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.729
 super season 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.319
 here we are in 2013 year we are undefeated 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.850
 so we want to do something 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.710
 good this year to us to continue 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.700
 to play well like that bravo to all 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.700
 thank you case I will see sirigu 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.430
 we made a big fat part 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.210
 however, we had the impression that 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.890
 led 2 to 0 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.500
 you had done the hardest tonight and 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.090
 it was not true me I think that all 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.140
 the two teams today they have 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.480
 showed very well fuck very well game 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.720
 football today either we felt 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.120
 his also it's normal we had to 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.160
 to afford today but we are 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.840
 really disappointed for what happened and 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.840
 do not forget some things 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.200
 because today I think that we 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.710
 could win and we took a goal a 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.929
 little 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.910
 it's very very serious I think is 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.989
 also kept the relations with the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.760
 referees he has to change because they 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.739
 always leave on Thursday do not even 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.709
 talk is very very guys we forgot 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.660
 do not forget who is a player of 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.450
 saint-etienne he even broke the leg 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.459
 yes there are some reindeer periods here 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.270
 so you have to see even these things because 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.060
 that if thiago he goes out and the wounded 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.980
 it's a problem that's the goal too and 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.500
 be told thiago that the wounded then 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.480
 she is still in being it still badly 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.610
 it's not fair they end up they 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.110
 were going to arbitrate their hilarity touch 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.690
 also who sees moving on 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.200
 when they are with their time it is 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.700
 serious 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.810
 you think the game was played out there 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.940
 on it you still think there was a 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.050
 badly mad to mingle football you know them 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.400
 episodes facts is sometimes 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.350
 today an episode he has us 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.030
 condemned and so that's it then me I 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.680
 know the dick because he did not see the 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.210
 notice of the keys either and then that's 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.010
 impressive that he can not see 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.940
 one thing he broke out we all got 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.940
 ok thank you
