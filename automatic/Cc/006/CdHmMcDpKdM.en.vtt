2<00:00:16.139> 3<00:00:16.619> 4<00:00:17.070> 5<00:00:17.730> 6<00:00:18.150> 7<00:00:18.600> 8<00:00:18.779> 9<00:00:19.109> 10<00:00:19.800> 11<00:00:20.189> 12<00:00:20.760> 13<00:00:21.060> 14<00:00:21.420> 15<00:00:22.140> 16<00:00:22.710> 17

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.410 
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
18<00:00:24.230> so<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.769> 24<00:00:26.220> packs<00:00:26.460> 18<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.029> them<00:00:27.119> that's

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
18 so in the 24 packs 18 of them that's

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.439 
18 so in the 24 packs 18 of them that's
three<00:00:28.380> out<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.529> every<00:00:28.650> four<00:00:28.769> boxes<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.939> that's

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
three out of every four boxes so that's

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.269 
three out of every four boxes so that's
pretty<00:00:30.599> good<00:00:30.830> it<00:00:31.830> seems<00:00:32.009> like<00:00:32.070> that's

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
pretty good it seems like that's

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.590 
pretty good it seems like that's
actually<00:00:32.579> pretty<00:00:32.669> common<00:00:32.969> for<00:00:33.120> most<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
actually pretty common for most of the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.110 
actually pretty common for most of the
rares<00:00:33.780> like<00:00:34.079> chaos<00:00:34.320> hunter<00:00:34.620> as<00:00:34.710> well<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:34.920> think

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
rares like chaos hunter as well I think

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.660

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
24 so exactly one of it for every single

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.609 
24 so exactly one of it for every single

guess I won't go through the rest

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.780 
guess I won't go through the rest
because<00:02:35.299> majority<00:02:35.989> of<00:02:36.170> them<00:02:36.319> like<00:02:36.790> photon

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.550 
because majority of them like photon
Thrasher<00:02:38.269> Jean<00:02:38.540> warp<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:38.989> could<00:02:39.170> expect<00:02:39.409> the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
Thrasher Jean warp you could expect the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.930 
Thrasher Jean warp you could expect the
same<00:02:39.709> thing<00:02:39.950> I<00:02:39.980> did<00:02:40.159> count<00:02:40.489> them<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:40.819> they're

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
same thing I did count them and they're

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.670 
same thing I did count them and they're
all<00:02:41.060> based<00:02:41.299> basically<00:02:41.720> every<00:02:42.260> card<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.560> get

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
all based basically every card you get

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.190 
all based basically every card you get
the<00:02:42.829> rid<00:02:42.950> of<00:02:43.040> every<00:02:43.220> four<00:02:43.489> so<00:02:43.790> if<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:44.900> put<00:02:45.049> do

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
the rid of every four so if you put do

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.660 
the rid of every four so if you put do
buy<00:02:45.349> a<00:02:45.379> box<00:02:45.620> of<00:02:45.859> a<00:02:45.980> pretty<00:02:46.190> good<00:02:46.340> chance<00:02:46.489> of

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
buy a box of a pretty good chance of

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.300 
buy a box of a pretty good chance of
getting<00:02:46.760> one<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.090> every<00:02:47.359> good<00:02:47.660> card<00:02:48.250> I'm<00:02:49.250> a

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
getting one of every good card I'm a

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.770 
getting one of every good card I'm a
decent<00:02:49.609> card<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.090> then<00:02:50.180> now<00:02:50.299> I<00:02:50.329> guess<00:02:50.629> we'll

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
decent card and then now I guess we'll

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.900 
decent card and then now I guess we'll
move<00:02:50.870> on<00:02:51.019> to<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.530> really<00:02:51.739> good<00:02:51.829> cards<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:52.849> we

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
move on to the really good cards so we

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.729 
move on to the really good cards so we
got<00:02:53.030> forbidden<00:02:53.359> Lance<00:02:53.599> we<00:02:53.870> pulled<00:02:54.109> one<00:02:54.319> two

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
got forbidden Lance we pulled one two

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.660 
got forbidden Lance we pulled one two

think<00:03:03.709> did<00:03:04.099> pull<00:03:04.340> one<00:03:04.519> so<00:03:04.700> that's<00:03:04.790> 18<00:03:05.180> eight<00:03:05.329> of

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
think did pull one so that's 18 eight of

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.410 
think did pull one so that's 18 eight of
24<00:03:05.629> again<00:03:06.170> so<00:03:06.680> three<00:03:06.950> of<00:03:07.040> every<00:03:07.250> four<00:03:07.420> place

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
24 again so three of every four place

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.970

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
cards in this set and I don't think any

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.540 
cards in this set and I don't think any
of<00:05:17.080> you<00:05:17.229> want<00:05:17.380> to<00:05:17.470> see<00:05:17.590> like<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:18.040> tally<00:05:18.340> of

of you want to see like the tally of

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.070 
of you want to see like the tally of
horn<00:05:18.790> of<00:05:18.880> the<00:05:18.940> phantom<00:05:19.300> beast<00:05:19.419> or<00:05:19.750> pot<00:05:19.960> of

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
horn of the phantom beast or pot of

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.480 
horn of the phantom beast or pot of
greed<00:05:20.290> or<00:05:20.320> something<00:05:20.620> like<00:05:20.680> that<00:05:20.740> but

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
greed or something like that but

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.409 
greed or something like that but
hopefully<00:05:21.729> you<00:05:22.300> guys<00:05:22.419> get<00:05:22.780> a<00:05:23.430> gist<00:05:24.430> of<00:05:24.639> exactly

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
hopefully you guys get a gist of exactly

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.469 
hopefully you guys get a gist of exactly
what<00:05:25.690> you're<00:05:25.780> going<00:05:25.900> to<00:05:25.960> get<00:05:26.880> basically<00:05:27.880> every

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
what you're going to get basically every

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.480 
what you're going to get basically every
single<00:05:28.810> card<00:05:29.080> besides<00:05:29.500> the<00:05:29.710> god<00:05:29.860> cards<00:05:30.310> and

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
single card besides the god cards and

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.040 
single card besides the god cards and
mega<00:05:30.850> lo<00:05:31.030> you'll<00:05:31.330> get<00:05:31.510> three<00:05:31.750> out<00:05:31.870> of<00:05:31.900> every

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
mega lo you'll get three out of every

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.340 
mega lo you'll get three out of every
four<00:05:32.169> boxes<00:05:33.510> and<00:05:34.510> do<00:05:34.810> a<00:05:34.840> you're<00:05:35.229> almost

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
four boxes and do a you're almost

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.900 
four boxes and do a you're almost
guaranteed<00:05:35.620> one<00:05:36.100> for<00:05:36.280> box<00:05:36.460> I<00:05:36.610> don't<00:05:36.760> think

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
guaranteed one for box I don't think

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:37.969 
guaranteed one for box I don't think
there<00:05:37.030> was<00:05:37.090> a<00:05:37.150> box<00:05:37.390> where<00:05:37.540> I<00:05:37.600> didn't<00:05:37.780> put

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
there was a box where I didn't put

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.780 
there was a box where I didn't put
duality<00:05:38.979> and<00:05:39.010> therefore<00:05:39.310> boxes<00:05:39.640> where<00:05:39.760> I

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
duality and therefore boxes where I

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.770 
duality and therefore boxes where I
pulled<00:05:40.000> multiples<00:05:40.450> so<00:05:40.919> it's<00:05:41.919> really<00:05:42.070> good

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
pulled multiples so it's really good
