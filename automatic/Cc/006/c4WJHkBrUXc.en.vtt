00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.799
 Hi, good people, it's good, I had both. 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.450
 and videos in the car 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.380
 Today I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.730
 work to this sequence by doing with the 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.310
 students who keep asking me 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.010
 about the course of dentistry that are 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.609
 undecided between principal not odonto tÃ¡ 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.769
 so I made a first video that I 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.130
 I talked about how much it costs 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.969
 about a dental course 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.219
 It is so including housing tuition 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.100
 bill of materials 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.149
 So, it's in the first video of the car. 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.040
 The second video I talked about 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.480
 that what is studied within a course 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.120
 dentistry as it is more or less okay 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.610
 and today this is the third video I 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.640
 I'll talk about the job market 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.440
 I think it 's a very worry 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.199
 important of the students and to think 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.439
 will be after graduation 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.790
 if you have a rich family 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:12.030
 this problem is not very difficult 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.790
 is easier to solve because there the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.250
 Your parents will fund you. 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.680
 able to take its first steps 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.420
 or be or if you decide to set up a 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.490
 Odontological office 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.360
 Are you going to have your parents to 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.549
 this fund your venture or 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.500
 you decide for the academic career the 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.840
 Your parents will also fund 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.210
 so then all this all that I'm 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.299
 talking that it is much easier but 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.060
 this is not the great majority then 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.490
 You're like me who did not come from the family. 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.720
 rich then you will have to turn around 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.300
 on its own 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.000
 the work is greater but the satisfaction 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.970
 very great to have won with their 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.630
 Her own legs are very good to have. 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.280
 purchased instrument or instrumentation 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.820
 have paid all installments of the 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.630
 history funding is very cool 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.890
 also 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.110
 good is difficult but it is rewarding for 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.940
 It seems incredible to put together a 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.850
 dental office is not the 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.700
 first choice for new graduates're 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.680
 then most of the dentists they 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.170
 they end up opting for public tenders 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:28.930
 to work prefecture posts 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:30.400
 health because you will have a salary 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.220
 fixed right 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.970
 you will have vacation you will get 13 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.510
 stability but may at first appear 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.220
 that the salary of the congo of the fixed salary is 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.010
 interesting but if you will think 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.260
 then the profits you have in 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.220
 private dental office are 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.260
 best 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.970
 another option that does not require a 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.510
 investment as large as one 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.790
 but it requires as much 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.190
 a public tender is not to follow the 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:05.380
 egas school academic career stay in 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.970
 universities in colleges to follow the 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.790
 academic career then they do 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.180
 master's doctorate 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.989
 and then you will continue a routine well 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.230
 faculty even though it is very similar to 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.959
 course, but more focused 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.230
 You can not work, right? 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.570
 very hard, you maybe one or two 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.840
 days at the most 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.660
 you will receive from the research bodies 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.930
 to develop their work 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.400
 scientists 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.320
 at first I just until uncertain are not 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.660
 all who get bag 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.120
 if you are going to think about the scenario 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.940
 of the part 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.950
 the government cut a percentage 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.760
 very high of bags so nobody is 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:58.440
 receiving in itself I speak from experience 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.849
 very close to colleagues who had their 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.250
 bags cut 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.920
 It's then and the situation gets very complicated. 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.650
 if you do not have the backing of your parents 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.129
 to keep your spending and you're going 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.959
 studying and it 's unfair because you're 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:17.280
 doing research you are generating 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.519
 content for the government is not 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.380
 gaining nothing but everything is good scenery 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.560
 of our country then you need to have in 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.979
 mind that maybe this stock exchange salary 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.080
 not sure but is an area 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:33.389
 Wonderful, I admire a lot and I 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.419
 I would also like to continue in this area 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:40.050
 had no way I had to work 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:43.620
 I think it's great to be there studying if 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.710
 dedicating doing research is very cool 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.630
 another detail also who chooses the 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.849
 academic career 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.520
 Make sure you stay away from the 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:56.280
 clinical care is has no way 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.880
 to reconcile the two is very difficult 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:02.760
 area that is little explored but I have 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.430
 had a lot of contact lately 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.160
 with dentists who work in 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.920
 dental materials companies 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:15.160
 she has a dentist there 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.770
 and is hired by the company so she 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.200
 presents the products to colleagues 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.910
 she participates in congresses as is 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.490
 dentist is very important for business 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.640
 because the company develops materials 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.740
 she needs dentists 

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.270
 working with her to understand better 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.060
 How is ours? 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:36.100
 our scenario for your very legal business 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.110
 So you can be a dentist. 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.340
 contractor of a materials company 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.320
 dental 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.300
 I've been having a lot of contact with 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.000
 dentists working in these companies 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.310
 It's very interesting, however, so they travel. 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.910
 enough time to attend congresses 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.540
 need to have an excellent training 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.070
 Specialization 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.590
 Then we have that too. 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:01.530
 dentists who work in the organs of 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:05.790
 our class same ro federal council 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:09.010
 it's also an area you can think of 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:13.000
 to go to the office 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:15.430
 is to ride everybody. 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.590
 you know about the expenses, then who 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.750
 to interest you, there is a series that 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.850
 My channel just how to put one together 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:23.350
 dental office then there already 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.510
 it would be for the ones who are doing it 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.720
 college this video more to who's 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:32.860
 does or does not mature then another 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:36.210
 option is you to specialize 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:39.480
 're in the office and work colleagues 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:42.430
 in its specialty for example has a 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.740
 dentist who implantodontista and he does 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:47.230
 breast implants have 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:49.840
 autistic garden can do orthodontics 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.700
 in several offices and so goes to a 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:54.790
 another option also for those who do not want 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.860
 riding office and still want 

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.990
 good work whatever your 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.150
 option for after college 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.370
 up to you to choose your routine 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.100
 day by day you will want the 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:06.830
 rest 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.260
 life or you have also chosen a 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.580
 routine and you do not like it, you do not like 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.190
 stay there working inside the 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.620
 and only noticed this and then 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:19.150
 you can start trying with these 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:21.380
 other areas that I have for you is 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.570
 keep studying 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:27.050
 Academic pursuit wants tranquility. 

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:29.050
 security makes a public tender 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.570
 the adventures of running a business 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:36.740
 mount the clinic or a clinic this 

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:39.070
 is good is an even adventure and not 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:42.350
 also forget about remuneration 

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:45.200
 of each of these options offers 

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:47.420
 because a salary may look good for a 

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.460
 newly formed may not be sufficient 

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.570
 to a person responsible for a 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.400
 family, right? 

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.440
 so now that you've just graduated 

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.270
 probably you are single is 

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.940
 dating lives with the parents then that 

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:00.860
 salary is more than enough but 

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.320
 think you need to improve because 

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.930
 you will probably have more expenses 

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:08.660
 in the future I hope you like it 

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:11.870
 want more videos of you in the car to 

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:14.290
 Student, send me the questions, it's okay. 

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.290
 bye Bye
