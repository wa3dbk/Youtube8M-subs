you<00:03:57.750> can<00:03:58.350> kind<00:03:58.620> of<00:03:58.709> see<00:03:58.890> like<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.190> lines<00:03:59.489> for

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
you can kind of see like the lines for

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.920 
you can kind of see like the lines for
the<00:03:59.820> edge<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.180> map<00:04:00.359> because<00:04:00.660> you<00:04:00.840> know

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
the edge of the map because you know

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.750 
the edge of the map because you know
this<00:04:01.109> is<00:04:01.230> just<00:04:01.410> like<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.590> box<00:04:01.890> with<00:04:02.070> just<00:04:02.280> walls

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
this is just like a box with just walls

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.200 
this is just like a box with just walls
on<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.060> side<00:04:03.239> and<00:04:03.590> that's<00:04:04.590> my<00:04:04.769> friend

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210

really<00:04:09.740> you<00:04:10.010> know<00:04:10.100> just<00:04:10.250> for<00:04:10.400> a<00:04:10.460> really<00:04:10.820> early

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
really you know just for a really early

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.480

game you know i'll actually got a
quickly<00:04:13.760> swap<00:04:13.940> to<00:04:14.090> a<00:04:14.120> controller<00:04:14.480> and<00:04:15.170> see<00:04:15.320> if

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
quickly swap to a controller and see if

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.490 
quickly swap to a controller and see if
i<00:04:15.440> do<00:04:15.530> any<00:04:15.710> better<00:04:15.830> so<00:04:16.220> I'll<00:04:16.340> be<00:04:16.520> right<00:04:16.640> back<00:04:17.500> or

I k i'm back and i'm using the xbox 360

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.870 
I k i'm back and i'm using the xbox 360
controller<00:04:21.140> and<00:04:22.010> i<00:04:22.100> must<00:04:22.280> say<00:04:22.370> it<00:04:22.550> is<00:04:22.610> much

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
controller and i must say it is much

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.060 
controller and i must say it is much
easier<00:04:22.910> and<00:04:23.570> if<00:04:24.020> you're<00:04:24.140> gonna<00:04:24.680> be<00:04:24.890> enough

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
easier and if you're gonna be enough

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.360 
easier and if you're gonna be enough
time<00:04:25.250> Oh<00:04:25.430> know<00:04:26.590> if<00:04:27.590> you<00:04:27.710> remember<00:04:28.070> me<00:04:28.100> saying

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
time Oh know if you remember me saying

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.760 
time Oh know if you remember me saying
that<00:04:28.880> it's<00:04:29.330> much<00:04:29.450> easier<00:04:29.480> of<00:04:29.810> a<00:04:29.930> joystick<00:04:30.620> you

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
that it's much easier of a joystick you

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.250 
that it's much easier of a joystick you
know<00:04:30.890> it's<00:04:31.340> just<00:04:31.460> left<00:04:31.760> trigger<00:04:31.910> to<00:04:32.180> go<00:04:32.600> right

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
know it's just left trigger to go right

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.020 
know it's just left trigger to go right
stick<00:04:33.500> to<00:04:33.620> move<00:04:33.800> this<00:04:34.010> way<00:04:34.280> whatever<00:04:34.580> this<00:04:34.820> way

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
stick to move this way whatever this way

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.840 
stick to move this way whatever this way
is<00:04:35.210> ah<00:04:35.680> that's<00:04:36.680> what<00:04:36.800> it<00:04:36.860> is<00:04:36.980> it's<00:04:37.430> deep<00:04:37.610> out<00:04:37.820> of

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
is ah that's what it is it's deep out of

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.400 
is ah that's what it is it's deep out of
course<00:04:38.150> so<00:04:38.570> you<00:04:38.660> can<00:04:38.750> also<00:04:38.840> use<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.140> arrows

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
course so you can also use the arrows

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.840 
course so you can also use the arrows
