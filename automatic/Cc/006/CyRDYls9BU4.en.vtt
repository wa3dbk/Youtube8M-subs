00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:02.110
 Hello, friends 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.110
 the day of the premiere the same yes 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.610
 images are 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.219
 good is that the pokémon is 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:11.059
 electric type of seron 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.419
 and is to introduce in the fourth generation 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:16.419
 this pokémon tm excellent defensive statistics 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:19.259
 well I consider this 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.029
 mopsik since this pokémon also has good statistical schools in 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.239
 special attack 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.390
 we could sign the substitute attack to avoid some damage 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.289
 at least one 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.199
 in that turn we can know lightning load since this attack has 70% of 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:37.350
 probability 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.330
 that increases the special attack 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.610
 the weakness 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.170
 we will use it for zero types 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.540
 this ability of spasticity attacks what today evil eye 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.790
 since they do not allow to escape cook also to the world amount 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.110
 nor in account as long as it is of type zero 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.840
 this is good since in physical attacks of type to be a hospital 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.800
 much to the margin are 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.810
 this makes it relatively unlikely that the substitute will break 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.790
 this is where the hidden power attack comes from fire type 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.550
 since aesthetic with zero types 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.370
 and this would serve much 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.770
 the pokémon more castro psoe 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.250
 I do not know I locked myself in the sun 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.030
 and enciso another option is the hidden power of ice 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.590
 this attack is 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.690
 if maybe it could be stopped 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.760
 dragon team that get used a lot in the times 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.230
 a lot this too 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.730
 well for the land types that is very effective is more than the goblins 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.900
 a little more than double the year ground team 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.390
 so it is that 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.600
 if it is effective against this type of 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.700
 good this pokemones 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.700
 kouri a 22 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.450
 of objects I recommend putting leftover hong I'm not going to it 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.450
 my house arrived the epu average globovisión 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.149
 with the balloon it no more painful land-type attacks 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.109
 in principle you do not believe it 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.469
 and remains 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.649
 life points 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:19.449
 In nature 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:22.629
 and that is that activity of preference 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:23.719
 i 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:26.169
 the crosshairs in killers 

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:28.289
 the celtics 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:33.889
 in 38 the special part maxi is crossed out 52 and less about 220 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.279
 good common instincts and number 462 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.069
 the in this final 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.159
 Well, I think this is all 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.829
 say enough euros lie 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.669
 and what I hope is that you liked 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.939
 soon I will bring you more 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.429
 smart 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:56.689
 i well 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.689
 but come I like the video if you do not like it because 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.819
 what you want to say your cousins ​​want 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.939
 I see series klein 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:10.889
 until another less
