I<00:02:10.220> don't<00:02:10.490> know<00:02:10.550> what<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.000> proper<00:02:11.240> term<00:02:11.570> for

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
I don't know what the proper term for

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.870 
I don't know what the proper term for
that<00:02:11.900> is<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:12.650> then<00:02:13.070> they're<00:02:13.310> like<00:02:13.640> these

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
that is and then they're like these

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.180 
that is and then they're like these
three<00:02:15.910> dials<00:02:16.910> inside<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:18.110> a<00:02:18.530> little<00:02:18.650> square

here<00:02:19.940> which<00:02:20.240> is<00:02:20.750> not<00:02:21.050> accurate<00:02:21.350> because<00:02:21.770> I

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
here which is not accurate because I

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.730 
here which is not accurate because I
tend<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.030> pull<00:02:23.330> this<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:24.020> save<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.470> battery

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
tend to pull this to save it battery

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.500

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
life let me just show you how it looks

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.380 
life let me just show you how it looks
in<00:02:27.070> comparison<00:02:28.070> to<00:02:28.100> my<00:02:28.460> tortoise<00:02:28.850> watch<00:02:29.120> which

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
in comparison to my tortoise watch which

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.890 
in comparison to my tortoise watch which
is<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.600> smaller<00:02:30.260> version<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:31.420> this<00:02:32.420> the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
is a smaller version and this the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.890 
is a smaller version and this the
tourist<00:02:33.230> watch<00:02:33.410> is<00:02:33.740> a<00:02:33.800> smaller<00:02:34.430> face<00:02:34.820> so<00:02:35.630> it's

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
tourist watch is a smaller face so it's

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.980 
tourist watch is a smaller face so it's
not<00:02:36.050> significantly<00:02:36.950> larger<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:38.120> just<00:02:38.720> really

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
not significantly larger I just really

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.260 
not significantly larger I just really
prefer<00:02:39.710> this<00:02:39.980> one<00:02:40.340> better<00:02:40.700> because<00:02:41.240> even

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
prefer this one better because even

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.930 
prefer this one better because even
though<00:02:41.690> I<00:02:41.720> have<00:02:41.990> a<00:02:42.020> small<00:02:42.440> wrist<00:02:42.800> it<00:02:43.520> still

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
though I have a small wrist it still

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.310 
though I have a small wrist it still
looks<00:02:44.150> very<00:02:44.270> appealing<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:45.470> nice<00:02:45.800> and<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:47.150> do

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
looks very appealing and nice and I do

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.650 
looks very appealing and nice and I do
prefer<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.500> thicker<00:02:48.530> band<00:02:49.160> so<00:02:49.640> I<00:02:49.850> really

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
prefer the thicker band so I really

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.840 
prefer the thicker band so I really
really<00:02:50.780> like<00:02:51.050> that<00:02:51.080> I<00:02:51.590> do<00:02:51.650> have<00:02:52.010> to<00:02:52.130> take<00:02:52.280> off<00:02:52.520> a

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
really like that I do have to take off a

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.330 
really like that I do have to take off a
little<00:02:53.810> bit<00:02:54.050> more<00:02:54.320> lengths<00:02:54.770> because<00:02:54.920> I<00:02:55.160> do

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
little bit more lengths because I do

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.110 
little bit more lengths because I do
have<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:56.240> super<00:02:57.230> tiny<00:02:57.590> wrist<00:02:58.010> so<00:02:58.670> if<00:02:58.940> you're

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
have a super tiny wrist so if you're

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.660
