00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
real or not that's just a thing like I

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.520 
real or not that's just a thing like I
didn't<00:02:07.469> have<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.590> chance<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:08.009> ask<00:02:08.129> him<00:02:08.459> if<00:02:08.729> he

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
didn't have a chance to ask him if he

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.070 
didn't have a chance to ask him if he
you<00:02:10.530> know<00:02:10.649> if<00:02:10.890> he<00:02:11.160> made<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.700> if<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.629> know<00:02:12.750> he

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
you know if he made this if you know he

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.850 
you know if he made this if you know he
found<00:02:13.379> a<00:02:13.560> picture

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
found a picture

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.400 
found a picture
Google<00:02:14.640> or<00:02:14.940> if<00:02:15.210> he<00:02:15.360> found<00:02:15.570> in<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.840> files<00:02:16.110> I

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
Google or if he found in the files I

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.520 
Google or if he found in the files I
mean<00:02:16.560> my<00:02:17.010> my<00:02:17.460> guess<00:02:17.520> is<00:02:17.880> that<00:02:17.970> he<00:02:18.090> probably

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
mean my my guess is that he probably

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.110 
mean my my guess is that he probably
either<00:02:19.530> made<00:02:19.890> himself<00:02:20.370> or<00:02:20.640> found<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.940> picture

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
either made himself or found a picture

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.310 
either made himself or found a picture
of<00:02:21.270> it

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
of it

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.020 
of it
he<00:02:22.620> wanted<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:22.980> take<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.280> credit<00:02:23.430> for<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:23.820> so

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
he wanted to take the credit for it so

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.030 
he wanted to take the credit for it so
it's<00:02:24.480> probably<00:02:24.780> his<00:02:24.930> own<00:02:25.050> creation<00:02:25.620> but<00:02:25.830> I

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
it's probably his own creation but I

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.950 
it's probably his own creation but I
mean<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.640> thing<00:02:26.820> is<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:27.120> deceiving<00:02:27.450> about<00:02:27.780> it

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
mean the thing is so deceiving about it

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.770 
mean the thing is so deceiving about it
is<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.440> looks<00:02:29.010> like<00:02:29.250> it's<00:02:29.430> actually<00:02:29.780> you

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
is that it looks like it's actually you

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.270 
is that it looks like it's actually you
know<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.900> tapped<00:02:31.290> out<00:02:31.440> building<00:02:31.860> like<00:02:31.950> it's<00:02:32.130> got

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
know a tapped out building like it's got

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.310 
know a tapped out building like it's got
that<00:02:32.460> tapped<00:02:32.760> out<00:02:32.970> look<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.630> it<00:02:33.810> where<00:02:34.140> it

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
that tapped out look to it where it

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.870 
that tapped out look to it where it
seems<00:02:34.590> like<00:02:34.770> yeah<00:02:35.100> I<00:02:35.130> can<00:02:35.400> believe<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:35.760> this

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880
