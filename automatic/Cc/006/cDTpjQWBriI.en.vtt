happened how much does it help that

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.709 
happened how much does it help that
power<00:00:11.400> inside<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:11.940> seems<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.210> have<00:00:12.330> that<00:00:12.509> same

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
power inside it seems to have that same

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.419 
power inside it seems to have that same
understanding<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.559> what<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.040> guys<00:00:14.130> want<00:00:14.370> to

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
understanding of what you guys want to

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.430 
understanding of what you guys want to
do<00:00:14.519> on<00:00:14.639> offense<00:00:14.820> well<00:00:15.660> no<00:00:15.839> it's<00:00:16.020> great<00:00:16.199> you

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
do on offense well no it's great you

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.439 
do on offense well no it's great you
know<00:00:16.500> it's<00:00:16.680> uh<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.820> makes<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.090> game<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.270> lot

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
know it's uh it makes a game a lot

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.570 
know it's uh it makes a game a lot
easier<00:00:18.660> obviously<00:00:19.529> gonna<00:00:19.920> have<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> big<00:00:20.400> that

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
easier obviously gonna have a big that

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.439 
easier obviously gonna have a big that
can<00:00:20.670> catch<00:00:20.880> complete<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.570> make<00:00:21.720> plays<00:00:21.990> and

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
can catch complete and make plays and

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.019 
can catch complete and make plays and
all<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.600> our<00:00:24.689> bigs<00:00:24.990> can<00:00:25.170> do<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.529> but<00:00:26.189> we're

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
all of our bigs can do that but we're

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.019 
all of our bigs can do that but we're
extremely<00:00:27.810> well-versed<00:00:28.760> I'm<00:00:29.760> playing

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
extremely well-versed I'm playing

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.759 
extremely well-versed I'm playing
against<00:00:30.269> teams<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.630> doubling<00:00:31.170> zone<00:00:31.500> and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
against teams that doubling zone and

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.459 
against teams that doubling zone and
things<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:33.050> no<00:00:34.050> we've<00:00:34.200> seen<00:00:34.380> him

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
things like that so no we've seen him

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.100 
things like that so no we've seen him
before<00:00:34.910> took<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.180> right<00:00:36.329> Kobe<00:00:36.809> he<00:00:36.930> talked

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
before took on the right Kobe he talked

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.330 
before took on the right Kobe he talked
about<00:00:37.230> ron's<00:00:37.469> progression<00:00:38.070> during<00:00:38.250> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
about ron's progression during the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.979 
about ron's progression during the
playoffs<00:00:38.520> started<00:00:39.149> with<00:00:39.300> kind<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.719> locking

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
playoffs started with kind of locking

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.170 
playoffs started with kind of locking
down<00:00:40.110> Kevin<00:00:40.440> Durant<00:00:40.710> now<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.489> seems<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.850> sound

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
down Kevin Durant now it seems to sound

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.940 
down Kevin Durant now it seems to sound
his<00:00:42.329> shot<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:43.110> know<00:00:43.200> really<00:00:43.230> finding<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
his shot and you know really finding a

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.150 
his shot and you know really finding a
place<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:44.789> team<00:00:45.200> well<00:00:46.200> yeah<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.590> think<00:00:47.010> for

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
place on this team well yeah I think for

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.119 
place on this team well yeah I think for
him<00:00:47.340> he<00:00:47.370> was<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:47.820> getting<00:00:48.090> his<00:00:48.300> rhythm<00:00:48.629> and

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
him he was just getting his rhythm and

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.470 
him he was just getting his rhythm and
settling<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.550> think<00:00:50.879> once<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> playoffs

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
settling in I think once the playoffs

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.049 
settling in I think once the playoffs
came<00:00:51.660> around<00:00:52.100> he<00:00:53.100> probably<00:00:53.430> put<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.699> little<00:00:53.879> too

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
came around he probably put a little too

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.119 
came around he probably put a little too
much<00:00:54.239> pressure<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.719> himself<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:55.559> know<00:00:55.649> to

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
much pressure on himself you know to

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.510 
much pressure on himself you know to
produce<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.879> perform<00:00:57.030> i<00:00:57.510> think<00:00:58.410> i<00:00:58.920> just

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
produce and to perform i think i just

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.299 
produce and to perform i think i just
had<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.420> settle<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.440> just<00:01:01.800> play<00:01:01.980> like<00:01:02.160> he

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
had to settle in and just play like he

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.080 
had to settle in and just play like he
uh<00:01:02.660> is<00:01:03.660> play<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:04.080> he's<00:01:04.229> used<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.500> boy<00:01:04.939> on<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
uh is play like he's used to boy on the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.510 
uh is play like he's used to boy on the
left<00:01:06.740> Kolb<00:01:08.869> Kobe<00:01:11.869> yeah<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.740> squadron<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.340> don't

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
Farmar you know he's he came in and you

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.800 
Farmar you know he's he came in and you
know<00:01:41.860> made<00:01:42.040> a<00:01:42.070> big<00:01:42.340> three<00:01:42.580> fourth<00:01:42.850> and<00:01:43.480> you

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
know made a big three fourth and you

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.270 
know made a big three fourth and you
know<00:01:43.900> got<00:01:44.050> a<00:01:44.080> big<00:01:44.350> deflection<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:44.980> a<00:01:45.040> steel

know got a big deflection and a steel

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.760 
know got a big deflection and a steel
force<00:01:45.640> and<00:01:45.940> yeah<00:01:46.120> that<00:01:46.570> changed<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.410> momentum

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
force and yeah that changed the momentum

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.710 
force and yeah that changed the momentum
of<00:01:48.010> the<00:01:48.400> game<00:01:48.430> up<00:01:48.850> until<00:01:49.120> that<00:01:49.180> point<00:01:49.330> they<00:01:49.690> had

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
of the game up until that point they had

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.380 
of the game up until that point they had
all<00:01:50.050> the<00:01:50.170> momentum<00:01:50.290> and<00:01:50.940> you<00:01:51.940> know<00:01:52.300> he

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
all the momentum and you know he

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.970 
all the momentum and you know he
single-handedly<00:01:52.780> was<00:01:53.320> responsible<00:01:53.860> for

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
single-handedly was responsible for

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.370 
single-handedly was responsible for
change<00:01:54.310> that<00:01:54.520> started<00:01:54.940> for<00:01:55.200> code<00:01:56.200> we<00:01:56.350> talk

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
change that started for code we talk

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.170
