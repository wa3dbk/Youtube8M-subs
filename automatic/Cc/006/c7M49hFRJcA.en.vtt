Adams sort of come in this weekend and

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.180 
Adams sort of come in this weekend and
being<00:00:39.629> caught<00:00:39.809> up<00:00:39.840> speed<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.950> know<00:00:41.070> we

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
being caught up speed and you know we

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.340 
being caught up speed and you know we
were<00:00:41.250> lucky<00:00:41.370> enough<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.670> fly<00:00:41.940> out<00:00:42.090> bit<00:00:43.050> earlier

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
were lucky enough to fly out bit earlier

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.930 
were lucky enough to fly out bit earlier
so<00:00:43.440> we<00:00:43.680> had<00:00:43.770> at<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.950> time<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.309> climate<00:00:44.670> eyes<00:00:44.760> go

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
so we had at a time the climate eyes go

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.910 
so we had at a time the climate eyes go
over<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> jet<00:00:45.329> lag<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:46.320> would<00:00:46.860> be

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
over the jet lag and it would be

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.479 
over the jet lag and it would be
straining<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:48.000> awareness<00:00:48.510> there<00:00:48.780> that

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
straining the awareness there that

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.740 
straining the awareness there that
whales<00:00:50.489> haven't<00:00:50.850> won<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.149> Australia<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:51.660> a

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
whales haven't won in Australia for a

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.869 
whales haven't won in Australia for a
long<00:00:51.960> long<00:00:52.170> time<00:00:52.230> yeah<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.309> think<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:53.730> been

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
long long time yeah I think it's been

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.040 
long long time yeah I think it's been
drummed<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.300> every<00:00:54.539> time<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.719> play<00:00:54.899> any

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.260 
just hope enough slightly better
conditions<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.229> heart<00:01:34.530> game<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.710> think

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
conditions and the heart game I think

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.510 
conditions and the heart game I think
unless<00:01:36.560> they<00:01:37.560> Austria<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:38.100> changed<00:01:38.400> eight

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
unless they Austria have changed eight

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.399 
unless they Austria have changed eight
or<00:01:38.670> nine<00:01:38.820> boys<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.450> game<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.290> gonna

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
or nine boys in that game so it's gonna

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.539 
or nine boys in that game so it's gonna
be<00:01:40.590> slightly<00:01:40.799> different<00:01:41.040> team<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.430> think

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
be slightly different team I think

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.340 
be slightly different team I think
should<00:01:42.180> go<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.360> your<00:01:42.540> half<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.780> Scotland<00:01:42.990> they

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
should go to your half a Scotland they

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.679 
should go to your half a Scotland they
played<00:01:43.530> really<00:01:43.710> well<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.100> game<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.689> you

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
played really well on that game and you

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.749 
played really well on that game and you
know<00:01:45.810> certainly<00:01:46.200> aspects<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.920> their<00:01:47.430> fourth

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
know certainly aspects of their fourth

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.249 
know certainly aspects of their fourth
will<00:01:48.060> have<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.360> rely<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.570> like<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.020> know<00:01:49.170> we're

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
will have to rely on like you know we're

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.840 
will have to rely on like you know we're
gonna<00:01:49.380> be<00:01:49.530> under<00:01:49.860> under<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> cosh<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> little

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
gonna be under under the cosh a little

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.520 
gonna be under under the cosh a little
bit<00:01:50.939> like<00:01:51.090> they<00:01:51.210> were<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.540> lot<00:01:51.960> big<00:01:52.110> fast<00:01:52.320> that

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
bit like they were a lot big fast that

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.440 
bit like they were a lot big fast that
gave<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.829> we<00:01:52.950> can<00:01:53.070> defend<00:01:53.310> as<00:01:53.970> well<00:01:54.210> as<00:01:54.299> they

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
gave and we can defend as well as they

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.030 
gave and we can defend as well as they
did<00:01:54.659> then<00:01:54.899> also<00:01:55.259> they<00:01:55.470> put<00:01:55.649> us<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.799> good<00:01:55.920> stead

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
did then also they put us in good stead

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.499 
did then also they put us in good stead
and<00:01:56.219> you'd<00:01:56.340> like<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.579> think<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.479> know

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
and you'd like to think that you know

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.389 
and you'd like to think that you know
the<00:01:57.750> skill<00:01:58.020> our<00:01:58.320> backs<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.950> know<00:01:59.070> they<00:01:59.219> can

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
the skill our backs you know they can

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.310 
the skill our backs you know they can
hopefully<00:01:59.729> cause<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> bit<00:02:00.210> more<00:02:00.299> damage<00:02:00.479> I'm

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
hopefully cause a bit more damage I'm

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.469 
hopefully cause a bit more damage I'm
very<00:02:01.680> aware<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.040> course<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.430> Australia<00:02:03.299> have

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
very aware of course that Australia have

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.959 
very aware of course that Australia have
this<00:02:03.740> great<00:02:04.740> strength<00:02:05.130> in<00:02:05.340> depth<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.850> they

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
this great strength in depth that they

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:06.399 
this great strength in depth that they
can<00:02:06.119> pick

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
can pick

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.130 
can pick
teams<00:02:06.590> from<00:02:06.969> from<00:02:07.969> a<00:02:08.060> vast<00:02:08.330> array<00:02:08.599> of<00:02:08.720> players

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
teams from from a vast array of players

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.890 
teams from from a vast array of players
and<00:02:09.410> very<00:02:09.619> skillful<00:02:10.069> players<00:02:10.450> they<00:02:11.450> are<00:02:11.599> there

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
and very skillful players they are there

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.339 
and very skillful players they are there
you<00:02:12.680> look<00:02:12.830> at<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.040> size<00:02:13.550> playing<00:02:13.910> Super<00:02:14.150> 15

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
you look at that size playing Super 15

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.520 
you look at that size playing Super 15
yeah

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
yeah

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.410 
yeah
pretty<00:02:15.739> impressive<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.099> watch<00:02:16.129> and<00:02:16.580> that's

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
pretty impressive to watch and that's

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.550 
pretty impressive to watch and that's
what<00:02:17.510> made<00:02:17.629> such<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:17.870> good<00:02:17.989> league<00:02:18.170> I<00:02:18.319> suppose

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
what made such a good league I suppose

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.320 
what made such a good league I suppose
and<00:02:18.799> and<00:02:19.340> you've<00:02:19.519> seen<00:02:19.670> those<00:02:19.819> guys<00:02:19.970> coming

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
and and you've seen those guys coming

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.089 
and and you've seen those guys coming
through<00:02:20.569> and<00:02:20.930> playing<00:02:21.349> for<00:02:21.470> Australia<00:02:21.890> now<00:02:22.069> I

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
through and playing for Australia now I

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.100 
through and playing for Australia now I
think<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:23.150> team<00:02:23.330> they've<00:02:23.510> put<00:02:23.720> out<00:02:23.750> now<00:02:23.989> is

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
think the team they've put out now is

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.300 
think the team they've put out now is
probably<00:02:24.319> pretty<00:02:24.709> much<00:02:24.799> their<00:02:25.040> full<00:02:25.220> strength

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
probably pretty much their full strength

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.119 
probably pretty much their full strength
side<00:02:25.730> for<00:02:26.450> Saturday<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:27.019> that's<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.830> way<00:02:27.920> one

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
side for Saturday so that's the way one

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.140 
side for Saturday so that's the way one
it<00:02:28.250> you<00:02:28.310> know<00:02:28.400> we<00:02:28.489> want<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.700> play<00:02:28.819> against<00:02:29.060> the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
it you know we want to play against the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.820 
it you know we want to play against the
best<00:02:29.209> if<00:02:29.480> you<00:02:29.540> come<00:02:29.720> down<00:02:29.900> here<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.560> get<00:02:30.680> away

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
best if you come down here and get away

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.690 
best if you come down here and get away
and<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.040> want<00:02:31.129> to<00:02:31.250> make<00:02:31.370> sure<00:02:31.400> you've<00:02:31.580> earned

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
and you want to make sure you've earned

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.699 
and you want to make sure you've earned
it<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.360> that<00:02:32.540> win<00:02:32.780> in<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.260> first<00:02:33.470> match

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
it and that win in the first match

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.369 
it and that win in the first match
should<00:02:34.610> set<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.540> whole<00:02:35.690> series<00:02:36.049> up<00:02:36.170> for<00:02:36.349> a

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
should set the whole series up for a

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:37.690 
should set the whole series up for a
very<00:02:36.680> very<00:02:36.950> interesting<00:02:37.160> series

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
very very interesting series

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.210 
very very interesting series
look<00:02:38.660> at<00:02:38.780> me<00:02:38.870> goodness<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:39.560> suppose<00:02:40.040> when<00:02:40.160> I've

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
look at me goodness I suppose when I've

look at me goodness I suppose when I've
played<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.690> Test<00:02:41.690> match<00:02:41.870> series<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.470> it<00:02:43.370> is<00:02:43.489> a

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
played the Test match series and it is a

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.750 
played the Test match series and it is a
new<00:02:43.700> experience<00:02:43.819> it's<00:02:44.920> any<00:02:45.920> any<00:02:46.190> one-off<00:02:46.519> test

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
new experience it's any any one-off test

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.680 
new experience it's any any one-off test
match<00:02:46.910> you<00:02:47.060> were<00:02:47.150> going<00:02:47.329> to<00:02:47.390> win<00:02:47.510> but

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
match you were going to win but

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.789 
match you were going to win but
particularly<00:02:47.989> in<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:48.230> three<00:02:48.379> most<00:02:48.560> series

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
particularly in the three most series

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.110 
particularly in the three most series
you<00:02:48.890> get<00:02:49.069> our<00:02:49.190> foot<00:02:49.370> on<00:02:49.400> your<00:02:49.670> belt<00:02:49.879> then<00:02:50.030> it

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
you get our foot on your belt then it

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.460 
you get our foot on your belt then it
just<00:02:50.239> takes<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.720> pressure<00:02:50.780> off<00:02:51.049> a<00:02:51.140> little<00:02:51.349> bit

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
just takes the pressure off a little bit

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.830 
just takes the pressure off a little bit
and<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:52.579> know<00:02:52.700> you<00:02:52.790> can<00:02:52.940> go<00:02:53.329> into<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.599> rest<00:02:53.780> of

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
and you know you can go into the rest of

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.880 
and you know you can go into the rest of
the<00:02:53.930> tour<00:02:54.140> yeah

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
the tour yeah

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.480 
the tour yeah
slightly<00:02:55.700> more<00:02:55.879> enjoyable<00:02:56.060> yes
