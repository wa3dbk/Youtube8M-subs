the<00:01:56.420> quality<00:01:56.930> of<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.080> down<00:01:57.260> is<00:01:57.440> very

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
the quality of the down is very

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.920 
the quality of the down is very
important<00:01:58.430> there<00:01:58.970> are<00:01:59.090> two<00:01:59.270> main<00:01:59.510> things<00:01:59.840> to

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
important there are two main things to

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.170 
important there are two main things to
look<00:02:00.110> out<00:02:00.290> for<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:01.010> down<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.430> feather<00:02:01.670> ratio

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
look out for the down to feather ratio

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.270 
look out for the down to feather ratio
anything<00:02:02.840> above<00:02:03.080> 90<00:02:03.440> percent<00:02:03.470> down<00:02:03.980> is<00:02:04.220> very

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
anything above 90 percent down is very

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.670 
anything above 90 percent down is very
high<00:02:04.760> and<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.300> fill<00:02:05.510> power<00:02:05.780> which<00:02:06.230> is

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
high and the fill power which is

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.920 
high and the fill power which is
confusing<00:02:07.130> so<00:02:07.880> this<00:02:08.060> is<00:02:08.210> roughly<00:02:08.450> how<00:02:08.750> it's

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
confusing so this is roughly how it's

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.680 
confusing so this is roughly how it's
calculated<00:02:09.490> basically<00:02:10.490> a<00:02:10.640> specific<00:02:11.510> weight

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
calculated basically a specific weight

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.780 
calculated basically a specific weight
of<00:02:11.720> down<00:02:12.080> is<00:02:12.290> measured<00:02:12.620> out<00:02:12.770> is<00:02:13.250> then<00:02:13.520> placed

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
of down is measured out is then placed

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.940 
of down is measured out is then placed
in<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:14.060> cylinder<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.780> specific<00:02:15.350> volume<00:02:15.800> and

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
in a cylinder of a specific volume and

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.010 
in a cylinder of a specific volume and
the<00:02:16.310> amount<00:02:16.340> of<00:02:16.820> space<00:02:17.150> that<00:02:17.210> that<00:02:17.630> weight<00:02:17.840> of

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
the amount of space that that weight of

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.050 
the amount of space that that weight of
down<00:02:18.200> takes<00:02:18.500> up<00:02:18.740> is<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.160> Downs<00:02:19.370> loft<00:02:19.760> a

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
down takes up is the Downs loft a

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.210 
down takes up is the Downs loft a
specific<00:02:20.990> pressure<00:02:21.290> is<00:02:21.500> then<00:02:21.650> applied<00:02:21.770> to<00:02:22.040> the

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
specific pressure is then applied to the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.640 
specific pressure is then applied to the
down<00:02:22.460> and<00:02:22.700> its<00:02:22.970> fill<00:02:23.240> power<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:23.690> calculated<00:02:24.500> by

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
down and its fill power is calculated by

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.230 
down and its fill power is calculated by
the<00:02:24.710> amount<00:02:25.100> of<00:02:25.280> space<00:02:25.580> that<00:02:25.610> that<00:02:25.880> way<00:02:26.180> to

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
the amount of space that that way to

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.120 
the amount of space that that way to
down<00:02:26.570> takes<00:02:26.870> up<00:02:27.110> when<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.680> pressure<00:02:27.890> is

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
down takes up when the pressure is

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.220 
down takes up when the pressure is
removed<00:02:28.430> basically<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.630> more<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.050> down

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
removed basically the more the down

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.550 
removed basically the more the down
springs<00:02:30.620> back<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.340> greater<00:02:31.700> its<00:02:32.000> fill<00:02:32.210> power

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
springs back the greater its fill power

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.170
