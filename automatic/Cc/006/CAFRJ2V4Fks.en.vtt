 for 8 years and I started skating 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.350
 freedom that gave us this in our 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.350
 era of youth 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:52.250

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.909
 I've been skating for two years 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.979
 because it's a very good sport to move away from 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.219
 many vices entertains is very good 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.219
 exercise 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.940

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:33.220
 ten years and we are skating and it is 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.490
 my passion because there I met my friends 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.490
 why 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:46.880
 the global level study in 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.580
 half of contests but we had not 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.850
 fact 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.440
 what we did on the streets and a 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.680
 showing how many people just wanted 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.680

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.700
 I'm four and a half years skating 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.430
 that I'm passionate about the script is that 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.380
 try to skate with your friends try 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:15.750
 new things but more than anything is the 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:18.600
 coexistence and the first thing is to be like that 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.040
 we go out to the streets to skate but 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.310

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.740
