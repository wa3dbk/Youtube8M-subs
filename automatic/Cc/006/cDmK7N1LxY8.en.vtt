00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.140
 to the kids with today as 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.850
 can see in the title of the video I'm going to 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.049
 be making a video of those that 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.509
 I have always told them that I am terrible and 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.540
 this is a cooking video it's because 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.790
 about a week ago I reached 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.340
 20,000 subscribers who taught all the 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.020
 number to believe and so I decided to do 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.570
 this video I hope you like it so much 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.160
 like me and I love them very much and we 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.079
 we see the next you have a nice day 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.270
 the ingredients that they will need 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.210
 to make these wonderful brownies 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.690
 they are a ready mix of brownies in 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.999
 eggs boxes 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.760
 Vanilla extract cream cheese or me 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:50.950
 I used sugar philadelphia cheese or in my 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.140
 case spices and butter 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.150
 before starting the first thing you want 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.640
 to do is to heat tube furnace to 180 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.800
 degrees then you will melt your 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.079
 butter and either in the microwave or 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.900
 in a stove 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.610
 I recommend cutting the butter 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.850
 in small pieces so that it 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:14.970
 melt faster in a bowl add the 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.970
 brownies mix add an egg 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.420
 two tablespoons of vanilla extract 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.640
 the melted butter 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.460
 how 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.470
 and finally a little water 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.890
 Beat well until you create a mixture 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.890
 homogeneous 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.750
 once the mixture is ready in a mold 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.310
 20 x 20 company so that it does not stay 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.310
 stuck and poured the whole mixture 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:12.410
 in a smaller container add 225 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:15.550
 grams of philadelphia cheese and 84 grams 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.550
 of sugar 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:28.320
 also add an egg yolk and a 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.320
 spoonful of vanilla extract 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.280
 i 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.140
 stir until the ingredients have been 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.140
 mixed and there are no lumps 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.250
 kind 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.269
 pour this mixture on top of the previous one 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.310
 and start creating figures with a 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.150
 knife or with any artifact that 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.150
 have at hand 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.750
 Y 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.439
 yes 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.070
 the button 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.370
 Y 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.810
 we discovered that it was better if a 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.440
 date of the figures we returned to cover 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.440
 with a spatula 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.900
 good 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.510
 to finish I put the mixture in the 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.510
 oven and I left it 135 minutes 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.630
 and this was the result I hope that you 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.780
 have liked and see you in the next 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.780
