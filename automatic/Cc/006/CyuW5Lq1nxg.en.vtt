00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
what's in the in the box for anyone

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.660 
what's in the in the box for anyone
that's<00:00:16.320> on<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.529> Nikon<00:00:16.890> before<00:00:17.279> it's<00:00:17.520> pretty

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
that's on the Nikon before it's pretty

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:34.100 
that's on the Nikon before it's pretty
familiar<00:00:17.880> manuals<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.109> software<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.930> it's

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
familiar manuals and software and it's

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.220 
familiar manuals and software and it's
actually<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> little<00:00:34.920> bit<00:00:35.219> smaller<00:00:35.640> than<00:00:35.940> a

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
actually a little bit smaller than a

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.500 
actually a little bit smaller than a
d5000<00:00:37.790> it<00:00:38.790> looks<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.149> slightly<00:00:39.629> thicker<00:00:40.160> so

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
d5000 it looks the slightly thicker so

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.119 
d5000 it looks the slightly thicker so
might<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> lot<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.170> do<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.440> screen<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:43.980> as

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
might have a lot to do the screen but as

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.590 
might have a lot to do the screen but as
you<00:00:44.250> can<00:00:44.340> see<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> screen<00:00:44.910> as<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.149> flip-out

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
you can see the screen as a flip-out

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.350 
you can see the screen as a flip-out
this<00:00:45.840> time<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:46.559> from<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.010> side<00:00:47.360> it's

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
this time but it's from the side it's

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.479 
this time but it's from the side it's
also<00:00:48.570> about<00:00:48.840> three<00:00:49.320> times<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.739> resolution<00:00:50.129> of

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
also about three times the resolution of

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.180 
also about three times the resolution of
what<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> D<00:00:50.879> 5000<00:00:51.539> screen<00:00:51.750> was<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.680> it's<00:00:52.829> much

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
what the D 5000 screen was so it's much

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.850 
what the D 5000 screen was so it's much
much<00:00:53.370> better<00:00:53.579> much<00:00:53.879> higher<00:00:54.059> quality<00:00:54.239> to

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
much better much higher quality to

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.150 
much better much higher quality to
921,000<00:00:55.860> dot<00:00:55.890> screen<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.420> layout<00:00:57.780> of

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
921,000 dot screen on the layout of

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.080 
921,000 dot screen on the layout of
everything<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.280> very<00:00:59.430> similar<00:00:59.640> they<00:00:59.879> had<00:01:00.000> to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
everything is very similar they had to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.670 
everything is very similar they had to
move<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.510> lot<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.809> buttons<00:01:01.109> because<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
move a lot of the buttons because of the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.460 
move a lot of the buttons because of the
back<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> screen<00:01:02.280> obviously<00:01:03.229> so<00:01:04.229> a<00:01:04.260> lot<00:01:04.439> of

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
back of the screen obviously so a lot of

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.960 
back of the screen obviously so a lot of
the<00:01:04.589> buttons<00:01:04.860> are<00:01:04.949> now<00:01:05.070> moved<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.369> either<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the buttons are now moved to either the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.640 
the buttons are now moved to either the
top<00:01:06.210> where<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.930> your<00:01:07.020> record<00:01:07.409> button

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
top where you have your record button

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.929 
top where you have your record button
which<00:01:07.740> really<00:01:08.100> makes<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.369> whole<00:01:08.520> lot<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.790> sense

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
which really makes a whole lot of sense

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.580 
which really makes a whole lot of sense
you<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> record<00:01:09.780> button<00:01:10.020> right<00:01:10.049> here<00:01:10.200> to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
you have a record button right here to

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.010 
you have a record button right here to
go<00:01:11.040> into<00:01:11.100> live<00:01:11.430> view<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:12.450> just<00:01:12.630> simply<00:01:12.900> use

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
go into live view you just simply use

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.789 
go into live view you just simply use
the<00:01:13.200> lever<00:01:13.640> like<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.790> would<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> d7000<00:01:16.080> on

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the lever like we would on the d7000 on

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.999 
the lever like we would on the d7000 on
the<00:01:16.979> D<00:01:17.100> 3100<00:01:18.530> great<00:01:19.530> little<00:01:19.740> bodies<00:01:19.979> very

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the D 3100 great little bodies very

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.890 
the D 3100 great little bodies very
solid<00:01:20.840> doesn't<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:22.020> quite<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:23.900> capability

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
solid doesn't have quite the capability

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.840 
solid doesn't have quite the capability
as<00:01:25.020> far<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.409> d7000<00:01:26.250> but<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> sensor

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
as far as the d7000 but the sensor

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.800 
as far as the d7000 but the sensor
that's<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.180> there<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.420> actually<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
that's in there is actually the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.319 
that's in there is actually the
identical<00:01:28.229> sensor<00:01:28.740> different<00:01:29.700> processor<00:01:30.150> but

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
identical sensor different processor but

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.289 
identical sensor different processor but
it<00:01:30.420> does<00:01:30.570> do<00:01:30.840> 14<00:01:31.290> bit<00:01:31.470> raw<00:01:31.650> full<00:01:32.400> 1080p<00:01:32.909> video

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299
