00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.410
 our professionalism has been very much 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.349
 sport has gone from being absolutely 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.970
 amateur to a professional sport and it 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:35.739
 implies as I say a requirement 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.780
 important in our case depends on the 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.269
 season depends on the moment depends on 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.620
 the short-term objectives are produced 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.680
 more or less training sessions at 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.510
 day is usually one or two sessions 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.600
 technical or physical tactics depending 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.070
 of the day of the week normally our 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.140
 case in elpozo we train the day of the 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.550
 tomorrow here at the sports palace and 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.649
 in case of doubling session it is usually at 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.030
 five in the afternoon in between then good 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.890
 you have time for the family you have 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.449
 theme by type of activities even in 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.309
 some cases to combine the 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.090
 sports activity with another type of 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.070
 activities such as studies 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.009
 well many times we associate the achievement to 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.310
 the victory and maybe sometimes it should not be 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.560
 thus we associate victory to success and 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.759
 failure to defeat and surely not 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.770
 it is always so in the case of 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.990
 Futsal I think we've had 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.789
 got many small achievements many 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.289
 small projects but I think that a 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.509
 achievement in history that everyone 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.399
 we marked in red I had the fortune of 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.049
 to live in the first person the future life 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.850
 Live and was the first championship 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.069
 of the world that final of guatemala in the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.409
 dome that December 3, 2000 as the 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.819
 sports gold was evidently the point 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.079
 inflection of our sport was the 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.090
 moment when he figured room was made 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.349
 visible in the eyes of the whole world and 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.659
 It was a time when we really believed 

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:46.890
 that was in Spain could be something more 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.170
 that fashionable sport like in that 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.849
 era was said today an absolute reality 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.289
 surely somehow we 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.509
 we advance in that golden age of 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.129
 Spanish sport getting what I think 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.000
 that for all is the great achievement of 

00:01:56.129 --> 00:02:00.370
 indoor football 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.630
 Therefore both collectively and to 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.890
 personal level is seen very 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.170
 different it is true that the moment 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.510
 concrete to get that victory from 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.009
 that final is such an intense challenge that 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.170
 surely many times they are blurred 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.460
 the memories are not erased a little bit 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.950
 you do not see it clearly what in that 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.690
 Exact moment you are living above all 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.010
 the World Championship Guatemala 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.340
 where I was much younger was the 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.430
 little guy was just 22 years old it was good 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.740
 logically the child of the group who 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.360
 least he played, it was good to be trying 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.800
 absorb everything that was 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.180
 happening around me 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.860
 maybe he was not entirely conscious not 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.410
 surely the perspective the time the 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.970
 distance is giving you somehow 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.950
 the knowledge of what there was there 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.530
 occurred guatemala as we have commented 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.810
 it was the great achievement of the sport 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.980
 Spanish was what we had dreamed of and 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.900
 we speak with segi for so long 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.480
 how close we were to other 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.280
 times and we could get it 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.410
 maybe china was it was different taipei 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.750
 it was the revalidation, we were not going like 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.090
 favorites with many difficulties to 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.590
 personal level had a much more role 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.870
 protagonist with the responsibility I 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.410
 it also implies and fortunately it was 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.750
 was to get something that surely nobody 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.980
 in Guatemala everyone thought that 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.660
 it could have been an accident 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.430
 nobody thought that we could achieve it 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.980
 again four years later what 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.360
 we get and I think on a personal level 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.480
 and at the collective level it was something that we 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.610
 will remain in the memory for all 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.540
 I always do a reflection as soon as 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.390
 to the type of individual recognitions 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.220
 is that in a collective sport such as 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.420
 ours as is futsal the 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.069
 recognized individuals are very 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.200
 relative, you are not nobody in your 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.190
 comrades you are nobody in your team and 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.200
 therefore any recognition 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.209
 individual that you obviously receive 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.920
 like everyone we like but 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.690
 I think it's important to have the 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.069
 knowledge what it means and what 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.480
 means to share it with your people not 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.370
 share it with who really makes you 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.510
 worthy of it in the people that you 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.920
 surrounds me I always say that I have the 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.690
 fortune to play with and against 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.799
 better and those people are the ones who have 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.370
 allowed to get those acknowledgments 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.930
 Individuals obviously like you 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.129
 like to be respected maybe the most 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.079
 nice that one can get in his 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.480
 profession that value what it does is that 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:02.239
 they show you affection that fortunately 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.670
 I was very lucky to get it and it's 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:08.030
 something that one that one takes with a lot 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.310
 I 'll get to enjoy it and when no 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.739
 be playing football-room obviously 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.420
 means that people value what 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.990
 you do the people recognize what 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.850
 others been able to do 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.170
 people see what you are good at 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.040
 somehow the values ​​that do not 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.450
 you try to prove you try good from 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.430
 somehow they understand what the 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.280
 soccer-room means beyond what 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.440
 it's a sport a game just like to 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.790
 everyone we like people in 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.470
 a pavilion like recently in my 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.540
 farewell the selection meets to 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.880
 some dwelling show your support or 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.230
 chant your name and much more in the 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.760
 sports palace good I always 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.200
 I say that success failure does not 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.700
 it depends only on you not but the 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.200
 path that one chooses for it if there 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.400
 certain values ​​that are absolutely and 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.680
 negotiable within what it means 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.840
 the sport promise or respect the 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.250
 Honesty with your sport with yourself 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.890
 with your group with your people 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.900
 the rival I always try to transmit 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.520
 that kind of values ​​to my colleagues are 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.320
 much younger they have less travel 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.420
 that I know that success and 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.680
 failure victory defeat depends 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.850
 of many circumstances and many days 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.950
 escape to what you are capable of 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.840
 but the path that one chooses to arrive 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.760
 to both yes that it depends on you is not 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.260
 difficult to give a single advice is not 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.060
 difficult to give a path because surely 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.920
 each one for its conditions by the 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.210
 context needs one thing or another to 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.220
 get success 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.750
 it is difficult to know what is the way 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.819
 correct for each one but if it is 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.440
 there are certain things common places that 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:30.330
 one should not forget and the passion for 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.280
 what one does the daily work 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.449
 obviously but that passion that point 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.220
 to enjoy what one is 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.289
 doing every day is absolutely 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.250
 fundamental and beyond that beyond 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.090
 of your values ​​that are obviously 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.979
 fundamental to success 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.990
 to get dedicated to pressure 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.099
 I think sport is important with 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.180
 the knowledge of the game the 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.139
 knowledge of what one does not 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.210
 only what is happening 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.759
 on the court but why is it 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.680
 happening is getting to know is 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.210
 get to go a little bit beyond what 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.150
 what the game means is fundamental 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.620
 to get good goals so 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.960
 important and as beautiful as when 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.669
 one is a child in being able to be professional and 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.030
 when I have the great fortune I could 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:08.030
 get
