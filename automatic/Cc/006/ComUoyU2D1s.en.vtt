00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hi all our xbox i hope that 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.460
 you're fine I'm not going too much so 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.350
 as you have seen since 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.480
 some time the rhythm of the videos a 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.389
 little down I do only one rto 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.799
 messiah a week at worst frankly 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.450
 if you do not want to listen to my worries 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.010
 you cut the sound and you look 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.050
 just the video it's like you 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.260
 so I wanted to have a lot of kids 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.050
 worries that it's family relational 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.310
 so with my girlfriend it was almost 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.680
 two and a half years we were together 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.480
 so we split all that so good 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.009
 that's happening it's things that 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.690
 come in and I've had some stuff 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.719
 so finally short here it's just 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.850
 story to tell you I'm sorry 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.190
 but youtube know it's not the most 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.980
 important that I love you all certainly 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.020
 but there is something before the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.760
 Old and virtual life is there queen 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.280
 pass before all else my partial 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.510
 finally I had old notes 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.699
 so that's not the big form 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.280
 it's not great shape and it's okay 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.579
 I resist it is a fault it is a 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.760
 not a bad pass and it will end up 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.409
 by alice i do not care about it okay 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.750
 it comes like that so we 're going 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.020
 iron a little bit about it a little bit 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.520
 principal here is the other but so 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.200
 again as usual 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.369
 money players so I will tell you 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.369
 a bit like stakes research 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.810
 how I researched simple past 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.520
 there for example it's players that 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.990
 because I know a lot of 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.659
 players in mine of nothing on the database 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.250
 and all that so it's players who 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.710
 are either Brazilian failed either that 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.509
 are in a popular league either 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.079
 that they have a nationality that pleasure 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.570
 Brazil 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.189
 or so it's players who are very 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.790
 rare at their position kind eg 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.549
 this is van rij rich of ajac if it is 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.920
 the best Dutch right back 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.860
 so money so that's why 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.659
 so after that it's foxes and foxy 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.369
 talent and when they are rare it's 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.219
 that they really kind of good 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.960
 stats or while they're pretty unique 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.570
 so for example for then for 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.159
 to find out at what price I have to put back 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.920
 selling a player with after I have 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.420
 buy it is simple I'm doing a 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.520
 search this is about the player I have 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.530
 targeted so can search on was ted 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.049
 and or on ultimate 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.189
 nl ultimate database finally there will be 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.379
 two links in the description and you 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:21.109
 can look for players are their 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.150
 price and all that so that's it's 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:26.180
 players that I know and then by 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.099
 example fabiÃ¡n here is a mc I 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.299
 sought after already looked a little at what 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.370
 asking price is every day get 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.069
 was selling about 20,000 credit so 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.599
 after that you can fall to 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.620
 moments when players are selling a little 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.680
 more expensive for example than hybrids 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.389
 shirts i bought at tim hill game 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.340
 the snatch managed to resell it at 11500 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:45.560
 I believe now he goes to 8000 in 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.680
 82 So this is what is really 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.030
 questions 1 question of luck and that's it 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.739
 so it happens to make small 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.299
 losses for now I yes it's me 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.680
 happened that to make some losses on 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.840
 one or two players but good as a butt 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.639
 of the account there are thirty players in all 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.609
 down it equilibrium and there is not too much 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:03.409
 worry with that so the 6th and something 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.200
 who was a little weird I got a pack 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:08.599
 you will see it at the end of episode one 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.460
 game I open a pack so I do not know 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.590
 why there is 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.470
 there is a pact that was offered to me this is 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.970
 no season finally ultimate ultimate 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.110
 edition 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.310
 we do not know why I open them to you 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.200
 do not worry I had that shit 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.360
 so I do not think I'll have 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.280
 others it was surely a bug not 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.440
 this is van rij here I am I 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.830
 recovers to 400 for who will be about to 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.230
 2000 credit and then the fabiano 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:36.590
 best Brazilian silver goalkeeper with 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.580
 donnie and dida I think but good ones 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.020
 two others are sold a little 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.130
 more expensive 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.830
 camara here we like it then they 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.920
 love them mdc basic it's a 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.320
 good deal that's nice 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.650
 good as the bac as usual the 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.500
 sweden central defender bruges 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.970
 that's really a good one 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.340
 good deal for buying resale i 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.020
 actively advise matthews lo 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.730
 celtic players also really 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.860
 way to do two there really way 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.210
 way to do good business 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:11.390
 matthews kayal brown izaguirre and micoud 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:13.730
 stokes end frankly there is also the 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.810
 keeper foster who is really very 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.489
 very good for resale purchase 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.080
 so I think I 'll do an episode where 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.310
 but the thing is they are 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.810
 certainly very good for the relentlessness of 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.930
 his celtic players but they are 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.850
 quite rare so it's more complicated to 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.550
 find good deals 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.520
 syria anyway bones and that's that 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.409
 so the atm card goes up and all that 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.250
 frankly 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:35.050
 normally he should not need this 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.879
 price there because in 82 they have about 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.009
 4000 atm credit at these costs 3000 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:40.810
 credit it's just that there are some 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.310
 flemmards on earth who ignites 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.770
 to buy your words that's all 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.110
 shell ajax purpose as there 94 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.780
 in speed 4 3 and 4 and a gesture 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.220
 technical forgiveness is pretty good 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.110
 barreto the scorer of guinness and who has 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.069
 been transferred from elsewhere to torino it is 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.830
 for that it will be a little more 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:59.229
 rare it is it is useful because good 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.360
 some use it in pairs with di 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.819
 natal and to make hybrids so 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.139
 this is serving and finally marcus beasley 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:06.789
 left winger 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.870
 that's a bit more expensive than 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.830
 that a middle left or others for 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.000
 to register credit so here it is to little 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.889
 near all the players that I resold 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.319
 so we left with a budget of 600 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.719
 9,000 credit for nothing to come on 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:21.159
 approach of 2 but if I have to 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.659
 should I go Czech are caught 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:24.449
 but I think it will be soon 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:26.379
 about one million credits 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.490
 so that's it's all the players that 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:31.150
 I recovered to see how many 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.409
 profits I did but that's okay 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.380
 be as usual about between 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:37.150
 30000 and 50000 credit so that's all and 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.500
 resold on and you see the age in the 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.729
 shop I had a thing so I got 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.340
 or kate fox 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.150
 So here is everything for the gbc the price 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.130
 two straws 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.190
 I lowered the price of bis is 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.539
 finally also we are left bound I 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.120
 lowered the price a little bit in the tray 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.259
 100 credits is who else they 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.190
 aguirre sold right away 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:54.669
 I should have put a little more expensive 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.169
 too bad 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.069
 he is cured the frankly it's ya 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.340
 way to do good business on 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:03.250
 on him because he is selling 38 credit 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.409
 while finally it's a player not 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.580
 huge I find a game to test them it's 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:09.909
 not the best player of the game along the 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.800
 but here's an episode 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:13.409
 of nothing but I'm going to do I'm going to do 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.599
 rather good deals 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:19.360
 then down I 'll open a pack but hey 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:21.639
 there will be nothing nothing very conclusive I 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.729
 think I do not know you tell me if 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:27.960
 you want me to open the packs to 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:31.300
 every time in your messi 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:33.219
 because if it makes good if as 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.360
 main account because it's on the 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:36.490
 same console maybe I'm going to have 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.110
 some dices 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.759
 packs all and every monday so 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.190
 good I believe it means I would have 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:43.539
 wanted to check all this but but here 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.849
 we will listen to the friends I have one arrives 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:47.410
 quietly but surely at the end of 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:48.910
 these peaks of this episode so we did 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:52.479
 casually anyway 48,000 credit of 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.860
 benefits it's pretty good so bah 

00:06:52.479 --> 00:06:55.660
 I put everything on sale 1 it's 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.970
 always some credits earned it's 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.370
 always better than a quick sale 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:02.050
 we talked about old players I do not like 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.449
 why I listed morals and even 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.150
 not the players but good but bob 

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:08.949
 meyboom it's like that so here are the 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.659
 friends so you do not care if the 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:13.659
 rhythm of the videos drawings little bit like that 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:17.500
