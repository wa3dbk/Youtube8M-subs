00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
fit into the blank and then I take my

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.520 
fit into the blank and then I take my
band<00:00:34.210> saw<00:00:34.480> and<00:00:34.749> just<00:00:34.800> cut<00:00:35.800> to<00:00:36.010> the<00:00:36.039> line<00:00:37.530> now

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
band saw and just cut to the line now

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.200 
band saw and just cut to the line now
it's<00:00:39.069> always<00:00:39.219> good<00:00:39.460> to<00:00:39.489> remember<00:00:39.579> that<00:00:39.909> band

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
it's always good to remember that band

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.899 
it's always good to remember that band
saws<00:00:40.649> cut<00:00:41.649> more<00:00:41.890> quickly<00:00:42.129> than<00:00:42.339> a<00:00:42.429> table<00:00:42.729> saw

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:42.909 
saws cut more quickly than a table saw

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:43.919 
saws cut more quickly than a table saw
so<00:00:43.120> watch<00:00:43.300> where<00:00:43.510> you're<00:00:43.600> putting<00:00:43.719> your

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:43.929 
so watch where you're putting your

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:46.649 
so watch where you're putting your
fingers<00:00:44.309> now<00:00:45.309> once<00:00:45.550> I<00:00:45.670> have<00:00:45.850> the<00:00:46.030> blank

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:46.659 
fingers now once I have the blank

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:48.270 
fingers now once I have the blank
rounded<00:00:47.229> down<00:00:47.379> and<00:00:47.620> it<00:00:47.710> doesn't<00:00:47.949> have<00:00:48.069> to<00:00:48.100> be

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
rounded down and it doesn't have to be

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.250 
rounded down and it doesn't have to be
perfect<00:00:48.670> it<00:00:48.760> just<00:00:48.789> has<00:00:49.089> to<00:00:49.210> be<00:00:49.329> close<00:00:49.569> I'm

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
perfect it just has to be close I'm

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.379 
perfect it just has to be close I'm
gonna<00:00:50.679> take<00:00:50.889> a<00:00:50.920> magic<00:00:51.370> marker<00:00:51.579> and<00:00:51.940> scribe<00:00:52.359> a

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:52.389 
gonna take a magic marker and scribe a

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:55.259 
gonna take a magic marker and scribe a
line<00:00:52.569> on<00:00:53.170> the<00:00:53.289> side<00:00:53.559> of<00:00:53.589> that<00:00:53.889> bowl<00:00:54.100> blank<00:00:54.429> all

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
line on the side of that bowl blank all

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.930 
line on the side of that bowl blank all
approximately<00:00:55.929> an<00:00:56.379> inch<00:00:56.620> down<00:00:56.920> it<00:00:57.639> doesn't

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
approximately an inch down it doesn't

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.969 
approximately an inch down it doesn't
have<00:00:58.059> to<00:00:58.209> be<00:00:58.329> exact<00:00:58.780> and<00:00:58.989> this<00:00:59.559> will<00:00:59.739> be

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
have to be exact and this will be

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:01.979 
have to be exact and this will be
determined<00:01:00.129> somewhat<00:01:00.819> by<00:01:00.999> the<00:01:01.569> shape<00:01:01.780> of<00:01:01.899> the

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
determined somewhat by the shape of the

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.310 
determined somewhat by the shape of the
bowl<00:01:02.139> that<00:01:02.170> you're<00:01:02.499> making<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:03.760> I<00:01:03.940> take<00:01:04.320> my

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
bowl that you're making but I take my

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.510 
bowl that you're making but I take my
bowl<00:01:05.530> blank<00:01:07.320> take<00:01:08.320> my<00:01:08.500> magic<00:01:08.829> marker<00:01:09.219> scribed

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
bowl blank take my magic marker scribed

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.010 
bowl blank take my magic marker scribed
a<00:01:09.670> line<00:01:09.850> and<00:01:10.180> you<00:01:10.270> notice<00:01:10.539> that<00:01:10.570> I'm<00:01:10.719> tilting

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
a line and you notice that I'm tilting

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.139 
a line and you notice that I'm tilting
the<00:01:11.259> table<00:01:11.619> this<00:01:11.740> is<00:01:11.920> approximately<00:01:12.610> a<00:01:12.670> 45

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
the table this is approximately a 45

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:14.490 
the table this is approximately a 45
degree<00:01:13.299> angle<00:01:13.509> doesn't<00:01:14.020> have<00:01:14.259> to<00:01:14.350> be<00:01:14.469> a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
degree angle doesn't have to be a

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.959 
degree angle doesn't have to be a
perfect<00:01:14.770> again<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.310> you<00:01:15.369> can<00:01:15.490> adjust<00:01:15.609> this

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:15.969 
perfect again and you can adjust this

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:17.459 
perfect again and you can adjust this
depending<00:01:16.390> upon<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.689> size<00:01:16.869> and<00:01:17.109> shape<00:01:17.320> of

depending upon the size and shape of
your<00:01:17.619> bowl<00:01:17.829> you<00:01:18.070> could<00:01:18.939> just<00:01:19.180> freehand<00:01:19.420> this

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
your bowl you could just freehand this

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
going to cut to the line and that's

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.139 
going to cut to the line and that's
going<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.409> help<00:01:29.530> reduce<00:01:29.679> the<00:01:29.920> mass<00:01:30.340> it<00:01:31.060> will

going to help reduce the mass it will

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:32.609 
going to help reduce the mass it will
make<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.390> turning<00:01:31.750> easier<00:01:32.109> they'll<00:01:32.289> be<00:01:32.409> less

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
make the turning easier they'll be less

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.770 
make the turning easier they'll be less
cleanup<00:01:32.950> and<00:01:33.159> less<00:01:33.340> mess<00:01:33.640> it's<00:01:34.270> just<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:34.539> great
