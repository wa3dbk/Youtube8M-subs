00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
be much surer than the normal reviews

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.229 
be much surer than the normal reviews
because<00:00:37.500> you've<00:00:37.800> already<00:00:37.980> seen<00:00:38.309> our<00:00:38.489> analysis

you remove were already seen our outline
of<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.219> episode<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.790> there's<00:00:41.940> no<00:00:42.059> point<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.420> me

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
of the episode so there's no point of me

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.680 
of the episode so there's no point of me
going<00:00:42.570> over<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.140> again<00:00:43.550> since<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.670> took<00:00:44.789> us<00:00:44.940> 37

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
a good guy Wyoming and Wyoming and I

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.300 
a good guy Wyoming and Wyoming and I
think<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.450> was<00:01:12.570> maybe<00:01:13.140> just<00:01:13.439> Wyoming<00:01:13.920> i<00:01:14.010> forget

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
think it was maybe just Wyoming i forget

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.740 
think it was maybe just Wyoming i forget
i<00:01:14.340> think<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.850> was<00:01:14.909> either<00:01:15.030> Wyoming<00:01:15.479> or<00:01:15.600> some

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
i think it was either Wyoming or some

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.390 
i think it was either Wyoming or some
other<00:01:15.869> guy<00:01:16.110> but<00:01:16.350> Wyoming<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.159> with<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
other guy but Wyoming is in with the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.420 
other guy but Wyoming is in with the
director<00:01:17.880> because<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.380> gamma<00:01:20.040> or

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
director because it is a I gamma or

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.670 
director because it is a I gamma or
gamma<00:01:20.759> was<00:01:21.420> helped<00:01:21.689> torturing<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.229> Alpha<00:01:22.530> so

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
gamma was helped torturing the Alpha so

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.850 
gamma was helped torturing the Alpha so
Wyoming's<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> director<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.860> you're

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
Wyoming's with the director and you're

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.429 
Wyoming's with the director and you're
pretty<00:01:26.729> much<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.270> think<00:01:27.330> text<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.170> trying<00:01:28.380> to

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
pretty much I think text is trying to

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.249 
pretty much I think text is trying to
break<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.130> steal<00:01:29.610> e<00:01:29.670> alpha<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.840> way<00:01:31.079> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
break in to steal e alpha that way the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.600 
break in to steal e alpha that way the
Alpha<00:01:31.500> doesn't<00:01:31.770> have<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.979> go<00:01:32.130> through<00:01:32.400> more

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
Alpha doesn't have to go through more

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.819 
Alpha doesn't have to go through more
suffering<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.259> director<00:01:34.710> has

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
suffering that that the director has

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.710 
suffering that that the director has
caused<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.400> directors<00:01:35.820> entire<00:01:36.119> goal<00:01:36.390> was<00:01:36.570> to

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
caused the directors entire goal was to

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.679 
caused the directors entire goal was to
retreat<00:01:37.110> Allison<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.240> you<00:01:39.240> know<00:01:39.329> that's<00:01:39.540> why

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
retreat Allison and you know that's why

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.980 
retreat Allison and you know that's why
there's<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.880> each<00:01:41.880> remote<00:01:42.390> each<00:01:42.720> AI

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
there's a is and each remote each AI

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.300 
there's a is and each remote each AI
emotion<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> representation<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:46.310> himself

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
emotion is a representation of himself

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.260 
emotion is a representation of himself
okay<00:01:47.729> I'm<00:01:47.850> getting<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.210> confuse<00:01:48.509> anyway<00:01:48.840> uh<00:01:49.020> so

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
okay I'm getting to confuse anyway uh so

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.399
