okay next up we're going to show some
size<00:00:01.979> spins<00:00:02.520> on<00:00:02.850> how<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.179> spin<00:00:03.600> Seth<00:00:04.339> now

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
size spins on how to spin Seth now

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.070 
size spins on how to spin Seth now
spinning<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.109> side<00:00:07.379> um<00:00:08.690> when<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:09.780> use<00:00:09.929> the

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
spinning the side um when you use the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.560 
spinning the side um when you use the
weapon<00:00:10.410> in<00:00:10.650> general<00:00:11.429> it<00:00:11.670> looks<00:00:12.000> like<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.450> a

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
weapon in general it looks like it's a

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.350 
weapon in general it looks like it's a
spin<00:00:12.840> anyway<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:13.769> we'll<00:00:14.070> go<00:00:14.219> over<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.790> bunch<00:00:15.210> of

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
spin anyway so we'll go over a bunch of

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.320 
spin anyway so we'll go over a bunch of
different<00:00:15.719> ways<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.870> spin<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.440> side<00:00:17.330> we

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
different ways to spin the side we

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.420 
different ways to spin the side we
already<00:00:18.539> went<00:00:18.779> over<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.680> one<00:00:19.920> it's

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
already went over to the the one it's

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.990 
already went over to the the one it's
just<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.820> basic<00:00:21.510> flip<00:00:21.840> out<00:00:22.250> and<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.789> looks<00:00:23.939> like

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
just a basic flip out and it looks like

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.470 
just a basic flip out and it looks like
a<00:00:24.300> spin<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.470> we're<00:00:26.189> going<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.400> bring<00:00:27.330> those

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
a spin so we're going to bring those

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.650 
a spin so we're going to bring those
fingers<00:00:28.109> over<00:00:28.460> straight<00:00:29.460> out<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.880> back

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
fingers over straight out and back

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.709 
fingers over straight out and back
that's<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.439> basic<00:00:31.910> now<00:00:32.910> we're<00:00:33.570> going

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
that's the basic now we're going

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.600 
that's the basic now we're going
straight<00:00:34.020> over<00:00:35.270> and<00:00:36.620> back<00:00:37.649> that's<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.129> faster

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
straight over and back that's a faster

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.030 
straight over and back that's a faster
one<00:00:38.820> okay

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
one okay

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.760

all fingers straight over and out and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.040 
all fingers straight over and out and
back<00:00:44.960> now<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> more<00:00:46.320> advanced<00:00:46.860> way<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.460> spinning

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
back now a more advanced way of spinning

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.819 
back now a more advanced way of spinning
we've<00:00:49.050> done<00:00:49.680> everything<00:00:50.000> going<00:00:51.530> inside<00:00:52.530> out

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
we've done everything going inside out

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.860 
we've done everything going inside out
now<00:00:53.190> we're<00:00:53.370> go<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.550> go<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> OPP's<00:00:54.120> way<00:00:54.360> outside

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
now we're go to go the OPP's way outside

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.650 
now we're go to go the OPP's way outside
to<00:00:55.110> end<00:00:55.370> so<00:00:56.370> we're<00:00:56.910> going<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.109> bring<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.350> side
