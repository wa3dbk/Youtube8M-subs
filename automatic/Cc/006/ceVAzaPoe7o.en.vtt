00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
collision guys will hustle hard after

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.849 
collision guys will hustle hard after
the<00:00:34.940> ball<00:00:35.090> they'll<00:00:35.300> scramble<00:00:35.629> they'll<00:00:36.350> dive

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:36.859 
the ball they'll scramble they'll dive

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.400 
the ball they'll scramble they'll dive
hit<00:00:37.160> the<00:00:37.249> floor<00:00:37.489> for<00:00:37.699> a<00:00:37.730> loose<00:00:37.940> ball<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:39.230> balls

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
hit the floor for a loose ball the balls

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.660 
hit the floor for a loose ball the balls
heading<00:00:39.649> out<00:00:39.739> of<00:00:39.769> balance<00:00:40.100> will<00:00:40.280> die<00:00:40.429> for<00:00:40.489> that

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
heading out of balance will die for that

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.250 
heading out of balance will die for that
save<00:00:41.210> it<00:00:41.239> and<00:00:41.420> bounce<00:00:41.539> back<00:00:41.960> to<00:00:41.989> their

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
save it and bounce back to their

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.079 
save it and bounce back to their
teammates<00:00:42.649> and<00:00:42.890> what<00:00:43.640> that<00:00:43.760> does<00:00:43.909> is<00:00:43.969> it

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
teammates and what that does is it

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.090 
teammates and what that does is it
really<00:00:44.390> allows<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:45.260> game<00:00:45.440> to<00:00:45.499> flow<00:00:46.039> more

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
really allows the game to flow more

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.459 
really allows the game to flow more
naturally<00:00:46.730> leads<00:00:47.629> to<00:00:47.749> a<00:00:47.809> lot<00:00:47.929> more<00:00:48.109> exciting

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
naturally leads to a lot more exciting

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:49.660 
naturally leads to a lot more exciting
place<00:00:48.679> but<00:00:48.890> at<00:00:48.980> the<00:00:49.069> end<00:00:49.100> of<00:00:49.249> those<00:00:49.339> hustle

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
place but at the end of those hustle

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.309 
place but at the end of those hustle
players<00:00:49.850> usually<00:00:50.149> get<00:00:50.449> a<00:00:50.480> nice<00:00:50.659> fast<00:00:50.960> break

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:51.319 
players usually get a nice fast break

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:53.200 
players usually get a nice fast break
and<00:00:51.350> at<00:00:52.100> least<00:00:52.190> to<00:00:52.370> a<00:00:52.399> nice<00:00:52.519> dunk<00:00:52.819> or<00:00:52.999> something

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
and at least to a nice dunk or something

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.329 
and at least to a nice dunk or something
like<00:00:53.269> that<00:00:53.359> so<00:00:53.780> we<00:00:54.589> feel<00:00:54.800> it's<00:00:54.890> really<00:00:55.129> strong

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
like that so we feel it's really strong

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.930 
like that so we feel it's really strong
aspect<00:00:55.969> of<00:00:56.059> the<00:00:56.120> game<00:00:56.149> played<00:00:56.510> like<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.929> shoe

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.350 

in<00:01:01.480> NBA<00:01:01.750> live<00:01:01.930> 09<00:01:02.070> dribble<00:01:03.070> moves<00:01:03.190> were<00:01:03.460> kind

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
in NBA live 09 dribble moves were kind

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.030 
in NBA live 09 dribble moves were kind
of<00:01:04.449> stagnant<00:01:04.750> a<00:01:04.960> little<00:01:05.170> bit<00:01:05.259> robotic<00:01:05.590> but<00:01:05.920> in

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
of stagnant a little bit robotic but in

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.100 
of stagnant a little bit robotic but in
NBA<00:01:06.310> live<00:01:06.490> 10<00:01:06.520> Jubal<00:01:07.210> moves<00:01:07.390> were<00:01:07.570> a<00:01:07.810> huge

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
NBA live 10 Jubal moves were a huge

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.840 
NBA live 10 Jubal moves were a huge
priority<00:01:08.320> for<00:01:08.619> us<00:01:08.799> and<00:01:09.130> we<00:01:09.400> introduced<00:01:09.759> this

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
priority for us and we introduced this

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.030 
priority for us and we introduced this
concept<00:01:09.909> called<00:01:10.420> size<00:01:10.930> ups<00:01:11.170> which<00:01:11.440> is<00:01:12.009> a

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
concept called size ups which is a

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.440 
concept called size ups which is a
really<00:01:12.250> simple<00:01:12.520> mechanic<00:01:12.940> you<00:01:13.000> just<00:01:13.150> hold<00:01:13.299> on

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
really simple mechanic you just hold on

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.090 
really simple mechanic you just hold on
a<00:01:13.479> button<00:01:13.720> and<00:01:14.049> your<00:01:14.440> players<00:01:14.619> will<00:01:14.830> start<00:01:15.040> to

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
a button and your players will start to

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.130 
a button and your players will start to
do<00:01:15.190> this<00:01:15.369> really<00:01:15.520> nice<00:01:15.790> in<00:01:16.180> place<00:01:16.780> dribble

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
do this really nice in place dribble

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.080 
do this really nice in place dribble
moves<00:01:17.290> that<00:01:17.619> will<00:01:17.890> kind<00:01:18.130> of<00:01:18.190> set<00:01:18.850> up<00:01:18.970> your

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
moves that will kind of set up your

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.999 
moves that will kind of set up your
defender<00:01:19.540> to<00:01:19.720> take<00:01:20.080> him<00:01:20.200> off<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.350> dribble<00:01:20.470> and

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
defender to take him off the dribble and

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.410 
defender to take him off the dribble and
one<00:01:21.220> of<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.369> great<00:01:21.520> things<00:01:21.549> about<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:22.210> size

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
one of the great things about the size

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.330 
one of the great things about the size
of<00:01:22.509> mechanic<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.320> size<00:01:23.680> of<00:01:23.799> animations

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
of mechanic and the size of animations

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.219 
of mechanic and the size of animations
are<00:01:24.520> that<00:01:24.700> we<00:01:25.330> really<00:01:25.540> differentiate<00:01:26.110> between

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
are that we really differentiate between

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.440 
are that we really differentiate between
the<00:01:26.470> different<00:01:26.890> players<00:01:27.100> so<00:01:27.520> LeBron<00:01:28.030> James

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
the different players so LeBron James

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.389 
the different players so LeBron James
who<00:01:28.659> likes<00:01:28.869> to<00:01:29.020> do<00:01:29.140> kind<00:01:29.680> of<00:01:29.740> edge<00:01:29.860> bouncing

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
who likes to do kind of edge bouncing

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.550 
who likes to do kind of edge bouncing
size<00:01:30.729> of<00:01:30.880> triple<00:01:31.119> mehdi<00:01:31.270> has<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:31.810> then<00:01:32.440> the

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
size of triple mehdi has and then the

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.690 
size of triple mehdi has and then the
other<00:01:32.619> end<00:01:32.860> of<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:32.979> spectrum<00:01:33.070> you<00:01:33.460> have<00:01:33.490> your

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
other end of the spectrum you have your

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.520 
other end of the spectrum you have your
bigs<00:01:33.940> who<00:01:34.210> don't<00:01:34.750> have<00:01:34.899> the<00:01:35.050> best<00:01:35.200> handle

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
bigs who don't have the best handle

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.469 
bigs who don't have the best handle
sometimes<00:01:35.710> so<00:01:36.130> that<00:01:36.310> it's<00:01:36.670> a<00:01:36.729> lot<00:01:36.909> more<00:01:36.940> simple

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
sometimes so that it's a lot more simple

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.870 
sometimes so that it's a lot more simple
just<00:01:37.720> slower<00:01:37.929> crossovers<00:01:38.649> but<00:01:39.610> they<00:01:39.700> really

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
just slower crossovers but they really

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.309 
just slower crossovers but they really
start<00:01:40.179> to<00:01:40.420> really<00:01:40.690> differentiate<00:01:41.110> the

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:41.319 
start to really differentiate the

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.139 
start to really differentiate the
