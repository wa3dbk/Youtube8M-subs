00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.499
 here we are going to make the alhuÃ© change 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.499
 see 32 36 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.080
 progressive webber 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.750
 to 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.750
 more than 2200 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.900
 take away his old 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.900
 carburetor 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.800
 to make modifications as you can him 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.700
 the system d 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.700
 escape 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.550
 we are removing the plate 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.790
 the plate is removed 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.610
 it was checked in hoses 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.610
 which ones are going to be debugged 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.530
 here we proceed to withdraw 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.210
 connections 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.210
 electric that go to the carburetor 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.390
 up to the satin 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.490
 Good Morning 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.490
 we are removing all that what 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.090
 that no longer 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.939
 is going to be used 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.360
 due to the changes that are made with 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.360
 the webber carburetor 32 36 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.090
 the containers 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.780
 well you have to remove these four 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.780
 screws 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.350
 to be able to put the other four that 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.980
 they come in the kit 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.980
 from wever 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.060
 well here we have to make a 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.770
 modification in what has been the 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.770
 base you have to make a modification 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.690
 this corner so that between this 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.670
 hose 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.510
 because that way the hose can not enter 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.510
 let's make that modification 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.940
 already modified the base is placed 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.870
 we are checking the progress 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.240
 that comes from here and is placed in the 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.960
 part 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.960
 doors 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.190
 and it's going to be placed in the advance 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:18.930
 in the cameras 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.889
 and good that the combustion chamber 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:43.330
 well this is a void 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:45.889
 this is a vacuum for a recovery 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.150
 gas recovery from the bases 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:53.380
 of gasoline and down here below 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:55.480
 in this part that recovers 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.050
 compensation of a compensation of 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.230
 empty 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.850
 vacuum compensation 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.360
 in the combustion chamber for the 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.360
 combustion chamber 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.990
 there we go, it's over 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:30.979
 well here we have this spring 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.660
 is the spring that goes to the part of 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:36.880
 down 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.880
 to return the accelerator 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:46.260
 we have finished with the conversion of 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.260
 Web 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.449
 let's see here back 

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:13.169
 excellent work
