00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.040
 hello everyone with you dmitry melowne and 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:13.139
 Today I want to tell you about 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:23.550
 camp kitchen for 2 persons at the base 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:27.270
 army pot lower part 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.850
 are mini windproof stove so 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.430
 called immediately tell 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.210
 idea is not my idea looked in the open spaces 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.250
 the internet 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:44.810
 Many thanks to the author who shared 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:48.030
 with the public its groundwork is 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:51.390
 new stove 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.280
 I did just in time for this season 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:59.360
 the stove, I have already order under worn out 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:03.379
 Here I did from such a thin metal 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:07.590
 Here and there were aluminum zaklepochki 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:10.829
 who quickly broke down here everything 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:16.469
 already screwed metal 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:19.350
 used here from brazier brazier 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:22.259
 so durable enough 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.840
 thick metal that's kinda like heat resistant 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.939
 must be that is we will see in general 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.590
 how much heat resistant can I say 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.749
 what in practice she herself very well 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:37.649
 recommended and that is sticks of sliver 

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:40.219
 very pretty well she warms 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:43.979
 boils fast in general I recommend 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:48.659
 checked good stuff besides here 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:52.579
 You can essentially put a gas burner 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.319
 which has such hoses here 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.270
 separate 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:02:01.849
 quite to myself how wind protection works 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.849
 well and in this mode also verified 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:10.310
 so so 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.569
 I want to say right away that the pen 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.200
 I did not alter left everything as it is on 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.900
 I'm quite happy with the same 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.239
 as in general and our other army 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.260
 bowlers there is a thoughtful engineering 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.810
 decision 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.319
 here it is here that with one cut that with 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.030
 the other hand lets say so 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.109
 covers 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.069
 be mounted on top and 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:43.970
 to be fixed 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:46.959
 handle that is convenient for carrying and so 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.720
 so here it all looks 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:53.209
 ladle I do not know the husband will seem to someone 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.969
 fetish in practice is very convenient for me 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.819
 because well scoop it all look 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:03:00.639
 ellochka spoon is not very convenient to tilt 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.739
 bowler and pour out of it too uncomfortable 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:06.439
 Well, in general, disgusting on 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.260
 as usual I donâ€™t know a ladle 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.909
 conveniently on the pilgrim usual bought in 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.260
 hardware store plastic 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:16.489
 Cheap sawn pen size to 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.019
 quietly installed on gas 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:27.949
 preheated compressed this way for such 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:32.389
 form to easily enter the pot here and 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:39.069
 scooped from it well so it means that 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:46.250
 such a thing here is welding 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:47.139
 here calyx 033 or liters so it 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.169
 matches 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:52.790
 This is for brewing tea but also fetish 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.780
 but it is no less convenient sometimes 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.790
 tea leaves did not swim such a thing 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.229
 practically pretty mean that 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.989
 it represents all this economy is 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:09.939
 such a glass with a lid of 0 5 liters 500 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:12.590
 milliliters is convenient to brew tea 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:15.109
 the lid did not close the pieces splashed like 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.400
 glass you use moreover yet 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:20.670
 The moment is that in this configuration 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:30.420
 this is a thermoglass 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:37.770
 so, too, we are the choice so the knife is quite 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:42.770
 ordinary folding salt this means salt 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:44.280
 Further spoon clear dining usually 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.890
 tea spoon 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.290
 Well, again, a teaspoon is a husband too 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.960
 seem fetish but nonetheless sometimes 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.700
 convenient in general, in principle, I am two dining 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.520
 always drive just somewhere alone 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:01.170
 protrapilas up to manned her 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:06.000
 let's say so ordinary tea spoon so 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:09.180
 further such a bet here is this 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.560
 capacity as it was called at the store 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.900
 for bulk products 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.800
 she was pretty so tall there 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.200
 in my opinion as much as one and a half or 2 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.280
 liters that does not remember you and a half liters 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.230
 I have sawed off a piece 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.020
 otherwise why did I take such 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:28.590
 healthy because only her size 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:31.200
 fit the size of the chick and I 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.540
 it turned out like this 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.470
 plate here from bonuses is still on the side 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:40.400
 there is a dimensional 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:45.800
 peaceful risks hand keeps well quite 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:51.210
 an interesting piece for 2 persons 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:54.090
 so this thing is chopping 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:57.450
 dosochka well, it seems fetish 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.340
 of course but excellent from my practice from 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.470
 carving dosochki well is awkward 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:06.320
 that is, lettuce chop the mushrooms 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:10.560
 cut another feature 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:14.030
 small modding since this thing she 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:18.090
 bluntly told the butt to intermeddle 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:23.010
 Here is a regular bowler, but this is the top 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:25.220
 part of the bent inside I'm pliers 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:28.890
 flare top 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.009
 to a reasonable size so that the top 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:38.449
 cap 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:40.639
 calmly dressed at the same time 

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:44.210
 plastic plastic crap here 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:46.220
 In general , this option was inserted 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:50.060
 on the army base to ti. 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:52.669
 that is, it is enough for two people I 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:57.620
 I use it in practice 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:59.289
 convenient for yourself thanks for watching put
