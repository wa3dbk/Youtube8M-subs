00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
marshmallow large marshmallow it's

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.340 
marshmallow large marshmallow it's
definitely<00:05:57.520> not<00:05:57.730> a<00:05:57.790> graham<00:05:58.240> cracker<00:05:58.270> like<00:05:59.140> you

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
definitely not a graham cracker like you

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.890 
definitely not a graham cracker like you
would<00:05:59.500> expect<00:06:00.000> it's<00:06:01.000> a<00:06:01.240> different<00:06:01.690> texture<00:06:02.110> a

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
would expect it's a different texture a

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.370 
would expect it's a different texture a
little<00:06:04.900> more<00:06:05.260> straight<00:06:05.710> ahead<00:06:05.890> sweetness<00:06:07.380> and

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
little more straight ahead sweetness and

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.290 
little more straight ahead sweetness and
of<00:06:08.620> course<00:06:08.860> Hershey's<00:06:09.400> chocolate<00:06:09.580> is

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
of course Hershey's chocolate is

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.860 
of course Hershey's chocolate is
probably<00:06:10.750> the<00:06:10.840> best<00:06:11.110> chocolate<00:06:11.710> in<00:06:11.740> the<00:06:11.890> world

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
probably the best chocolate in the world

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.810 
probably the best chocolate in the world
so<00:06:13.870> it's<00:06:14.080> a<00:06:14.200> very<00:06:14.440> good<00:06:14.710> combination<00:06:15.340> and<00:06:15.640> I

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
so it's a very good combination and I

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.500 
so it's a very good combination and I
actually<00:06:16.030> found<00:06:16.570> out<00:06:18.030> afterward<00:06:19.030> that<00:06:19.300> you

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
actually found out afterward that you

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.130 
actually found out afterward that you
can<00:06:19.750> ask<00:06:20.020> to<00:06:20.290> have<00:06:20.320> your<00:06:21.120> s'mores<00:06:22.120> pie<00:06:22.570> heated

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.140 
can ask to have your s'mores pie heated

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.820 
can ask to have your s'mores pie heated
up<00:06:23.290> in<00:06:23.530> the<00:06:23.680> fire<00:06:23.950> so<00:06:24.400> it's<00:06:24.550> just<00:06:24.760> like<00:06:24.970> a<00:06:25.000> real

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
up in the fire so it's just like a real

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.370 
up in the fire so it's just like a real
campfire<00:06:26.830> smores<00:06:27.430> experience<00:06:28.420> so<00:06:29.350> I

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
campfire smores experience so I

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.770 
campfire smores experience so I
definitely<00:06:29.740> recommend<00:06:30.340> you<00:06:30.670> try<00:06:30.970> that<00:06:31.300> and<00:06:31.600> I

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.140 
definitely recommend you try that and I
will<00:06:31.990> try<00:06:32.470> that<00:06:32.500> the<00:06:32.920> next<00:06:32.950> time<00:06:33.370> I<00:06:33.430> stopped<00:06:33.880> by

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
will try that the next time I stopped by

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.710 
will try that the next time I stopped by
but<00:06:34.480> it<00:06:35.350> certainly<00:06:35.830> was<00:06:36.100> plenty<00:06:36.490> good<00:06:36.720> without

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
but it certainly was plenty good without

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.400 
but it certainly was plenty good without
the<00:06:37.960> extra<00:06:38.440> fire<00:06:38.710> on<00:06:39.070> it<00:06:39.600> so<00:06:40.600> overall<00:06:41.020> I'd

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:41.410 
the extra fire on it so overall I'd

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.700 
the extra fire on it so overall I'd
recommend<00:06:42.070> if<00:06:42.970> you're<00:06:43.450> in<00:06:43.630> the<00:06:43.780> area<00:06:43.990> or<00:06:44.530> if
