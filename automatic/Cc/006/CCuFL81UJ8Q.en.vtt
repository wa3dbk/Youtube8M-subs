let me tell you that thing is a
quad-core<00:02:43.030> processor<00:02:43.840> there's<00:02:44.020> many<00:02:44.200> laptops

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
quad-core processor there's many laptops

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.140 
quad-core processor there's many laptops
out<00:02:45.040> there<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.400> don't<00:02:45.520> even<00:02:45.760> have<00:02:45.880> quad

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
out there that don't even have quad

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.990 
out there that don't even have quad
cores<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.570> them<00:02:46.690> yet<00:02:46.870> okay<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:48.220> got<00:02:48.460> a

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
cores in them yet okay you got a

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.360 
cores in them yet okay you got a
quad-core<00:02:49.450> GPU<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.530> GPU<00:02:50.860> is<00:02:50.980> going<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.250> be<00:02:51.340> a

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
quad-core GPU and a GPU is going to be a

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.220 
quad-core GPU and a GPU is going to be a
graphics<00:02:51.940> processing<00:02:52.390> unit<00:02:52.810> which<00:02:52.930> is<00:02:53.080> your
