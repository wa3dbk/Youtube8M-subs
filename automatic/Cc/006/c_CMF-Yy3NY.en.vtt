round has gone on for an unusually long
period<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:14.910> time<00:00:15.059> for<00:00:15.330> Berlin<00:00:15.750> round<00:00:17.930> and<00:00:18.930> once

now<00:00:23.840> all<00:00:24.840> right<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.050> think<00:00:25.170> I'm<00:00:25.289> just<00:00:25.410> gonna<00:00:25.590> go

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
now all right I think I'm just gonna go

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.820 
now all right I think I'm just gonna go
for<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.130> opportunity<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.150> I've<00:00:27.269> got<00:00:27.449> now<00:00:27.859> to

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
for the opportunity that I've got now to

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.319 
for the opportunity that I've got now to
try<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.890> get<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.250> there<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.520> make<00:00:32.640> one<00:00:32.940> assault

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
try to get in there and make one assault

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.750 
try to get in there and make one assault
actually<00:00:34.260> what<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.440> probably<00:00:34.770> should<00:00:35.730> have

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
actually what I probably should have

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.619 
actually what I probably should have
done<00:00:36.030> was<00:00:37.940> okay<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:38.969> guess<00:00:39.149> there's<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.420> tank

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
done was okay I guess there's a tank

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.760 
done was okay I guess there's a tank
after<00:00:39.989> me<00:00:41.930> yeah<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.079> was<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.230> little<00:00:43.350> bit<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.680> a

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
after me yeah that was a little bit of a

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.310 
after me yeah that was a little bit of a
reload<00:00:44.190> bug<00:00:44.460> there<00:00:44.730> if<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.390> get<00:00:45.539> knocked<00:00:46.079> up

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
reload bug there if you get knocked up

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.660 
reload bug there if you get knocked up
into<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.620> air<00:00:46.770> while<00:00:47.190> you're<00:00:47.370> trying<00:00:47.579> to

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
into the air while you're trying to

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.080 
into the air while you're trying to
reload<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.530> reset<00:00:52.760> actually<00:00:53.760> an<00:00:53.820> engineer

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
reload the reset actually an engineer

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:04.130 
reload the reset actually an engineer
trying<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.800> knock<00:00:55.800> me<00:00:56.039> out<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.340> x-pac<00:01:03.140> all

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
trying to knock me out with it x-pac all

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.609 
trying to knock me out with it x-pac all
right<00:01:04.379> well<00:01:04.589> we've<00:01:05.369> now<00:01:05.720> gotten<00:01:06.720> ticket<00:01:07.140> Leary

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
right well we've now gotten ticket Leary

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.740 
right well we've now gotten ticket Leary
inflicted<00:01:08.159> against<00:01:08.549> us<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:09.000> think<00:01:09.630> it's

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
inflicted against us I think it's

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.899 
inflicted against us I think it's
probably<00:01:10.020> way<00:01:10.770> too<00:01:10.830> late<00:01:11.340> for<00:01:11.369> them<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.790> have

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
probably way too late for them to have

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.590 
probably way too late for them to have
done<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.270> against<00:01:12.750> us<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.670> I<00:01:14.670> really<00:01:15.390> doubt

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
done this against us and I really doubt

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.969 
done this against us and I really doubt
if<00:01:15.780> they'll<00:01:15.930> be<00:01:16.080> able<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.290> hold<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.770> really

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
if they'll be able to hold up a really

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.010 
if they'll be able to hold up a really
solid<00:01:17.189> defense<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:18.030> this<00:01:18.180> flag<00:01:18.450> maybe<00:01:18.810> they'll

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
solid defense of this flag maybe they'll

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.320 
solid defense of this flag maybe they'll
repulse<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.740> couple<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.340> attacks<00:01:20.670> against<00:01:21.180> it

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
repulse a couple of attacks against it

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.899 
repulse a couple of attacks against it
but<00:01:22.140> they<00:01:22.259> probably<00:01:22.439> won't<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.799> able<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.130> do

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
but they probably won't be able to do

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.410 
but they probably won't be able to do
much<00:01:24.060> more<00:01:24.270> than<00:01:24.330> that

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.179 

too<00:01:27.540> many<00:01:27.720> Russian<00:01:28.200> soldiers<00:01:28.680> right<00:01:29.040> out

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
too many Russian soldiers right out

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:38.780 
too many Russian soldiers right out
across<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.759> mouth<00:01:37.250> well<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.310> was<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> rare

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
across the mouth well I was a rare

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.760 
across the mouth well I was a rare
occasion<00:01:39.270> where<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.479> actually<00:01:39.720> had<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.409> take

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
occasion where I actually had to take

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.730 
occasion where I actually had to take
out<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> pistol<00:01:41.490> you'll<00:01:41.640> notice<00:01:41.970> how<00:01:42.740> what

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
out the pistol you'll notice how what

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.770 
out the pistol you'll notice how what
I'm<00:01:43.860> playing<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.340> an<00:01:44.490> engineer<00:01:45.030> particularly

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
I'm playing is an engineer particularly

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.370 
I'm playing is an engineer particularly
but<00:01:45.960> even<00:01:46.860> as<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> medic<00:01:47.869> it's<00:01:48.869> not<00:01:49.140> that

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
but even as a medic it's not that

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.529 
but even as a medic it's not that
uncommon<00:01:49.740> for<00:01:50.100> me<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.220> take<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> pistol<00:01:51.030> out<00:01:51.330> and

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
uncommon for me to take a pistol out and

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.270 
uncommon for me to take a pistol out and
finish<00:01:51.960> off<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.320> enemy<00:01:52.619> because<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.920> run<00:01:53.130> out

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
finish off the enemy because I run out

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.130 
finish off the enemy because I run out
of<00:01:53.310> bullets<00:01:53.640> per<00:01:53.820> clip<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:54.600> really

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
of bullets per clip the one really

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.570 
of bullets per clip the one really
useful<00:01:55.500> thing<00:01:55.680> about<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> assault<00:01:56.310> gun

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
useful thing about the assault gun

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.690 
useful thing about the assault gun
especially<00:01:57.390> on<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.869> Russian<00:01:58.259> side<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.799> having

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
especially on the Russian side is having

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.719 
especially on the Russian side is having
those<00:01:59.819> extra<00:02:00.090> bullets<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.619> clip<00:02:01.729> 47

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
those extra bullets in the clip 47

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.090 
those extra bullets in the clip 47
instead<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.179> 30<00:02:03.450> or<00:02:03.780> 32<00:02:04.229> or<00:02:04.409> whatever<00:02:04.830> it<00:02:05.009> is

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
instead of 30 or 32 or whatever it is

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.410 
instead of 30 or 32 or whatever it is
just<00:02:06.890> having<00:02:07.890> enough<00:02:08.369> bullets<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.850> finish<00:02:09.239> off

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
just having enough bullets to finish off

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:17.780 
just having enough bullets to finish off
that<00:02:09.450> one<00:02:09.899> extra<00:02:10.049> enemy<00:02:15.950> I've<00:02:16.950> taken<00:02:17.190> quite<00:02:17.730> a

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
that one extra enemy I've taken quite a

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.059 
that one extra enemy I've taken quite a
bit<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.060> damage<00:02:18.239> from<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.780> heat<00:02:19.410> as<00:02:19.650> the

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
bit of damage from the heat as the

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.660 
bit of damage from the heat as the
bazooka<00:02:20.730> shot<00:02:20.970> went<00:02:21.209> over<00:02:21.420> me<00:02:21.569> I<00:02:22.489> can't<00:02:23.489> heal

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
bazooka shot went over me I can't heal

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.500 
bazooka shot went over me I can't heal
it<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.450> should<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:24.900> dead<00:02:25.140> there<00:02:25.350> we<00:02:25.440> go<00:02:26.510> but

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
it so I should be dead there we go but

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.270 
it so I should be dead there we go but
on<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.780> second<00:02:28.290> life<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.650> had<00:02:28.799> where<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.010> took

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
on that second life I had where I took

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.050 
on that second life I had where I took
the<00:02:29.549> flag<00:02:30.000> at<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.209> beginning<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.810> round

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
the flag at the beginning of the round

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.130 
the flag at the beginning of the round
it<00:02:33.060> was<00:02:33.120> just<00:02:33.329> amazing<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.750> didn't<00:02:33.930> have<00:02:34.049> to

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
it was just amazing I didn't have to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.569 
it was just amazing I didn't have to
reload<00:02:34.560> at<00:02:34.709> all<00:02:34.829> and<00:02:35.010> usually<00:02:35.340> when<00:02:35.489> you

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
reload at all and usually when you

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.160 
reload at all and usually when you
reload<00:02:35.970> that's<00:02:36.239> when<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.510> get<00:02:36.660> killed<00:02:36.870> by<00:02:37.109> the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
reload that's when you get killed by the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:45.000 
reload that's when you get killed by the
extra<00:02:37.590> enemies

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.830 

but<00:02:46.010> other<00:02:46.189> than<00:02:46.430> that<00:02:46.609> one<00:02:46.879> advantage<00:02:47.329> I

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
but other than that one advantage I

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.899 
but other than that one advantage I
really<00:02:48.349> don't<00:02:48.530> see<00:02:48.620> any<00:02:48.950> use<00:02:49.219> for<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.579> assault

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
really don't see any use for the assault

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:57.520 
really don't see any use for the assault
gun<00:02:50.150> I<00:02:54.280> guess<00:02:55.280> I<00:02:55.430> felt<00:02:55.700> kind<00:02:55.939> of<00:02:55.999> a<00:02:56.120> need<00:02:56.359> to<00:02:56.749> do

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
gun I guess I felt kind of a need to do

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.229 
gun I guess I felt kind of a need to do
at<00:02:57.650> least<00:02:57.799> something<00:02:58.219> with<00:02:58.519> the<00:02:58.639> assault<00:02:58.909> gun

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
at least something with the assault gun

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.720 
at least something with the assault gun
on<00:02:59.569> this<00:02:59.840> game<00:03:00.109> because<00:03:00.500> I've<00:03:00.650> done<00:03:00.889> I<00:03:01.159> haven't

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.530 

well<00:03:24.130> I<00:03:24.160> do<00:03:24.280> have<00:03:24.460> to<00:03:24.520> give<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.850> enemy<00:03:25.000> credit

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
well I do have to give the enemy credit

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.870 
well I do have to give the enemy credit
for<00:03:25.840> at<00:03:25.930> least<00:03:26.050> hanging<00:03:26.680> on<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:27.250> control<00:03:27.640> of

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
for at least hanging on to control of

for at least hanging on to control of
the<00:03:28.000> Panzer<00:03:28.510> tank<00:03:28.890> for<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:29.920> good<00:03:30.760> percentage<00:03:31.270> of

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
the Panzer tank for a good percentage of

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.510 
the Panzer tank for a good percentage of
this<00:03:31.540> round<00:03:31.810> it's<00:03:32.260> that<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:32.710> spawns<00:03:33.280> to<00:03:33.430> the

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
this round it's that it spawns to the

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.770 
this round it's that it spawns to the
flag<00:03:33.730> that<00:03:33.940> I<00:03:33.970> just<00:03:34.210> left<00:03:35.790> but<00:03:36.790> usually<00:03:37.450> once

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780

flag that I just left but usually once
that's<00:03:38.140> been<00:03:38.260> broken<00:03:38.770> up<00:03:39.040> it's<00:03:39.400> very

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
that's been broken up it's very

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.150 
that's been broken up it's very
difficult<00:03:40.270> for<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.660> enemy<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.770> Germans

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
difficult for the enemy to the Germans

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.960 
difficult for the enemy to the Germans
to<00:03:43.110> you<00:03:44.110> know<00:03:44.200> hang<00:03:44.530> around<00:03:44.710> that<00:03:45.280> one<00:03:45.550> flag

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
to you know hang around that one flag

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.200 
to you know hang around that one flag
and<00:03:46.300> keep<00:03:46.450> waiting<00:03:46.660> for<00:03:47.020> it<00:03:47.080> to<00:03:47.110> respawn<00:03:47.710> in<00:03:51.210> so

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
and keep waiting for it to respawn in so

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.640 
and keep waiting for it to respawn in so
over<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.600> course<00:03:52.810> of<00:03:53.050> the<00:03:53.140> round<00:03:53.350> one

over the course of the round one

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.680 
over the course of the round one
advantage<00:03:54.010> you<00:03:54.250> see<00:03:54.460> the<00:03:54.690> Russians

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
advantage you see the Russians

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.390 
advantage you see the Russians
continually<00:03:56.440> get<00:03:56.680> is<00:03:56.950> they'll<00:03:57.220> get

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
continually get is they'll get

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.480 
continually get is they'll get
superiority<00:03:58.270> in<00:03:58.450> tanks<00:03:59.070> but<00:04:00.070> I<00:04:00.100> haven't

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
superiority in tanks but I haven't

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.980 
superiority in tanks but I haven't
really<00:04:00.670> seen<00:04:00.880> that<00:04:01.060> as<00:04:01.210> being<00:04:01.390> too<00:04:01.600> much<00:04:01.720> of<00:04:01.780> a

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
really seen that as being too much of a

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:08.700 
really seen that as being too much of a
factor<00:04:06.480> if<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.600> Germans<00:04:08.020> do<00:04:08.170> feel<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.680> need

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
factor if the Germans do feel the need

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.130 
factor if the Germans do feel the need
to<00:04:08.890> spawn<00:04:09.550> in<00:04:09.730> as<00:04:09.880> a<00:04:09.910> bazooka<00:04:10.360> troop<00:04:10.720> like<00:04:10.930> that

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
to spawn in as a bazooka troop like that

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.050 
to spawn in as a bazooka troop like that
guy<00:04:11.320> did<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:12.430> that's<00:04:12.640> just<00:04:12.820> another

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
guy did and that's just another

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:23.860 
guy did and that's just another
advantage<00:04:13.570> for<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.810> Russians

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.840 

I've<00:04:24.870> definitely<00:04:25.140> been<00:04:25.800> on<00:04:26.040> the<00:04:26.430> receiving

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
I've definitely been on the receiving

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.930 
I've definitely been on the receiving
end<00:04:27.120> of<00:04:27.360> a<00:04:27.480> lot<00:04:27.510> more<00:04:27.660> deaths<00:04:28.340> than<00:04:29.340> normal

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
end of a lot more deaths than normal

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.130 
end of a lot more deaths than normal
part<00:04:30.180> of<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.390> is<00:04:30.510> just<00:04:30.540> playing<00:04:30.930> as<00:04:31.110> the

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
part of that is just playing as the

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.990 
part of that is just playing as the
assault<00:04:31.530> part<00:04:31.890> of<00:04:31.980> it's<00:04:32.100> just<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.430> fast

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
assault part of it's just the fast

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.189 
assault part of it's just the fast
urban<00:04:33.390> combat<00:04:34.020> action<00:04:34.710> of<00:04:34.920> Berlin

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.359 

but<00:04:41.199> it'll<00:04:41.379> be<00:04:41.469> interesting<00:04:41.679> to<00:04:41.949> see<00:04:42.189> how<00:04:42.309> many

00:04:42.359 --> 00:04:42.369 
but it'll be interesting to see how many

00:04:42.369 --> 00:04:44.369 
but it'll be interesting to see how many
kills<00:04:42.879> I've<00:04:43.089> tallied<00:04:43.330> up<00:04:43.599> because<00:04:44.080> this<00:04:44.229> is

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:44.379 
kills I've tallied up because this is

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:46.889 
kills I've tallied up because this is
just<00:04:44.559> such<00:04:44.739> a<00:04:44.800> really<00:04:45.699> long<00:04:45.909> episode<00:04:46.749> of

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:46.899 
just such a really long episode of

just such a really long episode of
Berlin

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.320 

and<00:04:58.919> we've<00:04:59.100> actually<00:04:59.220> got<00:04:59.520> all<00:04:59.699> three<00:05:00.030> flocks

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
and we've actually got all three flocks

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.680 
and we've actually got all three flocks
now<00:05:00.660> that's<00:05:00.930> pure<00:05:01.259> luck<00:05:05.180> the<00:05:06.180> main<00:05:06.360> thing<00:05:06.569> of

now that's pure luck the main thing of

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.580 
now that's pure luck the main thing of
course<00:05:06.930> I<00:05:07.050> don't<00:05:07.110> know<00:05:07.229> if<00:05:07.319> we're<00:05:07.410> gonna<00:05:07.470> be

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
course I don't know if we're gonna be

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.080 
course I don't know if we're gonna be
able<00:05:07.770> to<00:05:07.919> hold<00:05:08.069> this<00:05:08.220> upper<00:05:08.550> cap<00:05:08.759> amount

able<00:05:20.340> to<00:05:20.490> get<00:05:20.639> right<00:05:21.030> inside<00:05:21.240> the<00:05:21.599> radius<00:05:21.900> soon

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229

enough

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
enough

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.999 
enough
yes<00:05:23.699> okay<00:05:24.030> they<00:05:24.180> didn't<00:05:24.479> have<00:05:25.289> their<00:05:25.710> ten

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:27.529 
yes okay they didn't have their ten
consecutive<00:05:26.220> seconds<00:05:27.060> there<00:05:27.270> so<00:05:27.449> they

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
consecutive seconds there so they

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.570 
consecutive seconds there so they
weren't<00:05:27.690> able<00:05:27.840> to<00:05:27.990> capture<00:05:28.229> that<00:05:28.470> flag<00:05:28.710> if

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
weren't able to capture that flag if

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.310 
weren't able to capture that flag if
we're<00:05:29.729> able<00:05:29.789> to<00:05:29.970> hold<00:05:30.120> on<00:05:30.330> at<00:05:30.509> that<00:05:30.660> flag<00:05:31.110> just

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
we're able to hold on at that flag just

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.379 
we're able to hold on at that flag just
to<00:05:31.500> the<00:05:31.590> north<00:05:31.919> then<00:05:32.610> that's<00:05:32.849> gonna<00:05:33.030> be<00:05:33.240> it<00:05:33.360> for

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
to the north then that's gonna be it for

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.570 
to the north then that's gonna be it for

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
make it difficult for them to captain

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:50.550 
make it difficult for them to captain
flag

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.810 

okay<00:05:51.560> that's<00:05:51.740> a<00:05:51.890> kill<00:05:52.130> that<00:05:52.340> should<00:05:52.520> be<00:05:52.640> the

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
okay that's a kill that should be the

00:05:52.820 --> 00:06:05.180 
okay that's a kill that should be the
guy<00:05:53.120> who<00:05:53.180> was<00:05:53.360> trying<00:05:53.570> to<00:05:53.630> attack<00:05:53.900> this

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:07.320 

presumably<00:06:06.190> they're<00:06:06.430> heading<00:06:06.700> to<00:06:06.820> that<00:06:06.910> flag

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
presumably they're heading to that flag

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.000 
presumably they're heading to that flag
in<00:06:07.510> the<00:06:07.600> north<00:06:07.870> south<00:06:08.470> west<00:06:10.470> and<00:06:11.470> there<00:06:11.740> we<00:06:11.860> go

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
in the north south west and there we go

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.090 
in the north south west and there we go
I<00:06:12.040> guess<00:06:12.400> we<00:06:12.790> did<00:06:12.940> get<00:06:13.120> a<00:06:13.150> cap<00:06:13.420> out<00:06:13.660> here<00:06:13.930> a<00:06:14.110> lot

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
I guess we did get a cap out here a lot
