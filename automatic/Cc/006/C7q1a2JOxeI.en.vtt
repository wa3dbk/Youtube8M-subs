is usually our and I just want a little
touch<00:00:39.410> of<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:39.980> corner<00:00:40.520> of<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:41.480> other<00:00:41.660> side<00:00:42.020> to

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
touch of the corner of the other side to

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.790 
touch of the corner of the other side to
get<00:00:42.950> the<00:00:43.010> Burgundy<00:00:44.050> now<00:00:45.050> this<00:00:45.290> is<00:00:45.440> going<00:00:45.590> to<00:00:45.649> be

get the Burgundy now this is going to be
on<00:00:45.950> paper<00:00:46.399> so<00:00:47.300> it<00:00:47.629> probably<00:00:47.870> will<00:00:48.320> drag<00:00:48.649> I

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
on paper so it probably will drag I

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.750 
on paper so it probably will drag I
should<00:00:49.100> probably<00:00:49.250> get<00:00:49.430> some<00:00:50.050> floating<00:00:51.050> medium

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
should probably get some floating medium

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.299 
should probably get some floating medium
to<00:00:52.760> help<00:00:52.969> it<00:00:53.200> not<00:00:54.200> drag<00:00:54.500> put<00:00:54.739> it<00:00:54.829> on<00:00:54.920> there<00:00:55.129> it's

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
to help it not drag put it on there it's

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.090 
to help it not drag put it on there it's
just<00:00:55.489> clear<00:00:55.910> medium<00:00:56.710> put<00:00:57.710> it<00:00:57.800> on<00:00:57.890> this<00:00:58.039> side

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
just clear medium put it on this side

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.200 
just clear medium put it on this side
with<00:00:58.550> my<00:00:58.789> Burgundy<00:00:59.750> to<00:01:00.620> help<00:01:00.800> it<00:01:00.949> flow<00:01:01.250> better

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
okay I'm get it well loaded and then

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.800 
okay I'm get it well loaded and then
I'll<00:01:07.340> come<00:01:07.580> over<00:01:07.610> to<00:01:08.000> my<00:01:08.119> design<00:01:08.509> and<00:01:08.750> I'm

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
I'll come over to my design and I'm

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.960 
I'll come over to my design and I'm
going<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:08.990> start<00:01:09.200> on<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.440> bottom<00:01:09.729> or<00:01:10.729> it<00:01:10.820> would

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
going to start on the bottom or it would

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.030 
going to start on the bottom or it would
be<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.150> inside<00:01:11.750> of<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.229> petal<00:01:12.590> and<00:01:12.740> I'm<00:01:12.860> going

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
be the inside of the petal and I'm going

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
be the inside of the petal and I'm going
to<00:01:13.100> run<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:13.700> burgundy<00:01:14.630> edge<00:01:15.790> along<00:01:16.790> the

to run the burgundy edge along the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.109 
to run the burgundy edge along the
outside<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:18.229> pull<00:01:18.470> it<00:01:18.619> up<00:01:18.799> let<00:01:19.670> me<00:01:19.700> draw<00:01:19.970> it<00:01:20.000> a

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
outside and pull it up let me draw it a

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:20.980 
outside and pull it up let me draw it a
little<00:01:20.150> bit<00:01:20.510> right<00:01:20.659> there

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
little bit right there

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.370 
little bit right there
and<00:01:22.090> that<00:01:23.090> orange<00:01:23.450> didn't<00:01:23.780> fill<00:01:23.960> in<00:01:24.110> there<00:01:24.350> I

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
and that orange didn't fill in there I

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.990 
and that orange didn't fill in there I
was<00:01:24.590> try<00:01:24.710> not<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:24.979> push<00:01:25.220> too<00:01:25.250> hard<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:25.909> I'll

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000

was try not to push too hard so I'll
just<00:01:26.240> touch<00:01:27.140> it<00:01:27.170> in<00:01:27.439> there<00:01:27.650> with<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.070> edge<00:01:28.159> of

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
just touch it in there with the edge of

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.960

way I did before little touch that
burgundy<00:01:34.759> on<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:34.880> edge<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.780> little<00:01:36.500> tiny<00:01:36.740> touch

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
burgundy on the edge a little tiny touch

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.910 
burgundy on the edge a little tiny touch
of<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:40.390> floating<00:01:41.390> medium<00:01:41.600> and<00:01:42.200> then<00:01:42.740> we're

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
of the floating medium and then we're

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.399 
of the floating medium and then we're
going<00:01:43.040> to<00:01:43.070> do<00:01:43.250> this<00:01:43.549> edge<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.360> you<00:01:44.990> see<00:01:45.229> that's

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
going to do this edge and you see that's

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.630 
going to do this edge and you see that's
the<00:01:45.560> top<00:01:45.799> edge<00:01:47.380> same<00:01:48.380> way<00:01:48.680> the<00:01:49.130> burgundy

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
the top edge same way the burgundy

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.270 
the top edge same way the burgundy
towards<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:51.250> outer<00:01:52.250> edge<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:54.130> we'll<00:01:55.130> just

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
towards the outer edge and we'll just

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.679 
towards the outer edge and we'll just
take<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:55.880> up<00:01:57.579> go<00:01:58.579> around<00:01:59.170> where<00:02:00.170> that<00:02:01.689> stamen

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
take it up go around where that stamen

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.620 
take it up go around where that stamen
will<00:02:02.869> be<00:02:03.460> for<00:02:04.460> where<00:02:04.640> that

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
will be for where that

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.180 
will be for where that
and<00:02:07.630> there<00:02:08.020> you<00:02:08.170> have<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.440> then<00:02:08.710> you<00:02:08.740> can<00:02:08.980> kind

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
and there you have it then you can kind

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.810 
and there you have it then you can kind
of<00:02:09.250> clean<00:02:09.460> up<00:02:09.490> edges<00:02:09.850> that<00:02:10.330> have<00:02:11.020> gotten<00:02:11.820> rough

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
of clean up edges that have gotten rough

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:19.320 
of clean up edges that have gotten rough
there<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:17.560> make<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:18.010> little<00:02:18.190> lines<00:02:18.550> or

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
there and to make the little lines or

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.510 
there and to make the little lines or
like<00:02:19.600> I<00:02:20.200> guess<00:02:20.530> I'll<00:02:20.680> use<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.100> yellow<00:02:21.250> you

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
like I guess I'll use the yellow you

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.040 
like I guess I'll use the yellow you
could<00:02:21.640> use<00:02:21.850> a<00:02:21.910> creamy<00:02:22.420> color<00:02:22.600> but<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:22.930> have

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
could use a creamy color but I have

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.080 
could use a creamy color but I have
yellow<00:02:23.260> available<00:02:23.800> here<00:02:24.040> I'm<00:02:24.640> not<00:02:24.820> cleaning

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090

of the yellow on it blend it in and then

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.280 
of the yellow on it blend it in and then
just<00:02:31.870> kind<00:02:32.320> of<00:02:32.380> drag<00:02:32.710> up<00:02:32.920> on<00:02:33.070> the<00:02:33.160> chisel<00:02:33.550> edge

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
just kind of drag up on the chisel edge

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.820 
just kind of drag up on the chisel edge
and<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.560> makes<00:02:35.800> kind<00:02:36.070> of<00:02:36.220> some<00:02:36.400> lines<00:02:36.700> in<00:02:37.830> there

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
and it makes kind of some lines in there

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.180 
and it makes kind of some lines in there
to<00:02:38.950> give<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.130> some<00:02:39.400> texture<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.210> there's<00:02:41.190> the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
to give it some texture and there's the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.340 
to give it some texture and there's the
flower<00:02:42.580> now<00:02:43.300> I'm<00:02:43.390> going<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.630> shadow<00:02:43.900> just<00:02:44.200> a

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
flower now I'm going to shadow just a

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.610 
flower now I'm going to shadow just a
little<00:02:44.710> bit<00:02:44.950> with<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.370> Burgundy<00:02:46.200> right<00:02:47.200> under

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
little bit with the Burgundy right under

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.590 
little bit with the Burgundy right under
where<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:47.830> stamen<00:02:48.400> touches<00:02:48.910> just<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.330> give<00:02:49.480> it

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
where the stamen touches just to give it

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.650 
where the stamen touches just to give it
some<00:02:50.190> shading<00:02:51.190> I'm<00:02:51.550> just<00:02:51.760> going<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:52.000> tap<00:02:52.330> it<00:02:52.360> in

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
some shading I'm just going to tap it in

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.930 
some shading I'm just going to tap it in
there<00:02:52.840> a<00:02:52.870> little<00:02:52.990> bit<00:02:53.400> this<00:02:54.400> had<00:02:54.640> gotten<00:02:54.760> a

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
there a little bit this had gotten a

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.300 
there a little bit this had gotten a
little<00:02:55.060> bit<00:02:55.360> and<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:55.990> gives<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.130> little

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
little bit and so gives a little

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.500 
little bit and so gives a little
shadowing<00:02:57.970> right<00:02:58.960> there<00:03:00.210> now<00:03:01.210> I'm<00:03:01.300> going<00:03:01.450> to

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
shadowing right there now I'm going to

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.360 
shadowing right there now I'm going to
clean<00:03:01.690> up<00:03:01.720> my<00:03:01.990> brush<00:03:02.380> or<00:03:02.680> put<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:02.980> in<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.100> water

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
clean up my brush or put it in the water

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.540 
clean up my brush or put it in the water
because<00:03:03.610> I'm<00:03:03.790> going<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.000> switch<00:03:04.300> to<00:03:04.810> another

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
because I'm going to switch to another

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.550 
because I'm going to switch to another
brush<00:03:06.550> I<00:03:08.310> think<00:03:09.660> well<00:03:10.660> let's<00:03:10.840> try<00:03:11.020> this<00:03:11.290> six

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
brush I think well let's try this six

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.310 
brush I think well let's try this six
round<00:03:11.860> I<00:03:12.040> probably<00:03:12.250> could<00:03:12.520> do<00:03:12.670> it<00:03:12.820> with<00:03:13.090> me

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
round I probably could do it with me

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.590 
round I probably could do it with me
another<00:03:14.320> flat<00:03:14.940> but<00:03:15.940> I<00:03:15.970> have<00:03:16.150> this<00:03:16.300> round

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
another flat but I have this round

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
another flat but I have this round
available<00:03:17.200> or<00:03:17.770> filbert<00:03:18.220> I<00:03:18.310> should<00:03:18.490> say<00:03:18.670> I<00:03:19.620> do

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
available or filbert I should say I do

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.590 
available or filbert I should say I do
have<00:03:20.830> a<00:03:20.860> round<00:03:21.220> I<00:03:21.430> could<00:03:21.580> try<00:03:21.790> but<00:03:21.820> let's<00:03:22.480> go

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
have a round I could try but let's go

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.420 
have a round I could try but let's go
ahead<00:03:22.780> with<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.020> filbert<00:03:23.380> now<00:03:23.980> I'm<00:03:24.160> getting

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
ahead with the filbert now I'm getting

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.160 
ahead with the filbert now I'm getting
two<00:03:24.610> colors<00:03:24.940> of<00:03:25.090> green<00:03:25.330> I'm<00:03:25.600> getting<00:03:25.840> a<00:03:25.900> dark

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
two colors of green I'm getting a dark

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:34.940 
two colors of green I'm getting a dark
green<00:03:27.330> on<00:03:28.330> my<00:03:28.390> palate<00:03:29.110> and<00:03:29.350> a<00:03:30.510> foliage<00:03:31.510> green

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.449 

and<00:03:35.970> I'm<00:03:36.970> going<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:38.130> double<00:03:39.130> load<00:03:39.280> my<00:03:39.430> brush

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
and I'm going to double load my brush

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.479 
and I'm going to double load my brush
same<00:03:40.000> way<00:03:40.230> edges<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:43.630> I<00:03:44.470> may<00:03:44.650> do<00:03:45.040> this<00:03:45.190> over

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
same way edges and I may do this over

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.110 
same way edges and I may do this over
because<00:03:45.550> I<00:03:45.700> may<00:03:45.850> not<00:03:46.000> like<00:03:46.239> it<00:03:47.070> let's<00:03:48.070> see<00:03:48.400> and

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
because I may not like it let's see and

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.860 
because I may not like it let's see and
I'm<00:03:49.690> going<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:49.900> lead<00:03:50.140> with<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:50.470> lighter<00:03:50.709> edge

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
I'm going to lead with the lighter edge

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.780 
I'm going to lead with the lighter edge
and<00:03:52.870> I'm<00:03:53.140> just<00:03:53.410> going<00:03:53.650> to<00:03:53.770> bring<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:54.580> to<00:03:54.730> a

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
and I'm just going to bring it to a

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.400 
and I'm just going to bring it to a
point

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.700 

so<00:03:59.410> I<00:03:59.470> do<00:03:59.620> its<00:03:59.920> I<00:04:00.040> press<00:04:00.460> and<00:04:01.200> twist<00:04:02.200> and<00:04:02.440> lift

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:02.710 
so I do its I press and twist and lift

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.450 
so I do its I press and twist and lift
press<00:04:03.430> twist<00:04:04.090> and<00:04:04.360> lift<00:04:04.710> press<00:04:05.710> twist<00:04:06.250> and

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 
press twist and lift press twist and

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.400 
press twist and lift press twist and
lift<00:04:07.710> and<00:04:08.710> basically<00:04:09.250> that<00:04:09.550> gives<00:04:09.820> me<00:04:10.410> the

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
lift and basically that gives me the

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.070 
lift and basically that gives me the
statement<00:04:11.770> on<00:04:12.040> there<00:04:12.310> now<00:04:12.570> this<00:04:13.570> brush<00:04:13.840> does

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
statement on there now this brush does

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.720 
statement on there now this brush does
not<00:04:14.230> have<00:04:14.410> a<00:04:14.440> good<00:04:14.710> chiseled<00:04:15.070> edge<00:04:15.190> so<00:04:15.520> I'm<00:04:15.610> not

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
not have a good chiseled edge so I'm not

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.099 
not have a good chiseled edge so I'm not
going<00:04:15.880> to<00:04:15.940> do<00:04:16.090> this<00:04:16.180> stem<00:04:16.480> with<00:04:16.690> it<00:04:16.840> I'm<00:04:16.989> going

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
going to do this stem with it I'm going

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.560 
going to do this stem with it I'm going
to<00:04:17.140> go<00:04:17.260> ahead<00:04:17.380> and<00:04:17.620> do<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:17.859> stem<00:04:18.239> with<00:04:19.239> a<00:04:19.269> liner

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
to go ahead and do the stem with a liner

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.740 
to go ahead and do the stem with a liner
brush<00:04:20.340> don't<00:04:21.340> forgive<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:22.000> traffic<00:04:22.600> noise
