00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
into a five gallon container and I'm

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.400 
into a five gallon container and I'm
going<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.470> notice<00:00:17.180> or<00:00:18.180> I'm<00:00:18.660> starting<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.230> learn

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
going to notice or I'm starting to learn

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.060 
going to notice or I'm starting to learn
something<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:20.689> think<00:00:21.689> that<00:00:21.779> I<00:00:21.960> don't<00:00:22.800> like<00:00:23.039> to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
something I think that I don't like to

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.790 
something I think that I don't like to
plant<00:00:23.609> in<00:00:24.240> one<00:00:24.750> hundred<00:00:24.990> percent<00:00:25.019> compost

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
plant in one hundred percent compost

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.859 
plant in one hundred percent compost
because<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:27.180> pump<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.930> compost<00:00:28.470> get<00:00:29.810> dry<00:00:30.810> too

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
because the pump the compost get dry too

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.490 
because the pump the compost get dry too
quickly<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.730> it's<00:00:32.730> not<00:00:32.940> good<00:00:33.300> for<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.960> plant

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
quickly and it's not good for the plant

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.440 
quickly and it's not good for the plant
and<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.430> prefer<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.940> mix

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.600 

compost<00:00:39.450> with<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.960> little<00:00:40.800> bit<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:40.950> garden<00:00:41.400> soil

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
compost with a little bit of garden soil

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.600 
compost with a little bit of garden soil
so<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.570> way<00:00:42.890> how<00:00:43.890> does<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.190> dry<00:00:44.400> out<00:00:44.430> too

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
so that way how does it dry out too

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.270 
so that way how does it dry out too
quickly<00:00:45.110> but<00:00:46.110> here<00:00:46.380> you<00:00:46.590> looking<00:00:46.830> at<00:00:47.010> my<00:00:49.280> two

and<00:01:08.480> if<00:01:09.480> you're<00:01:09.660> hesitant<00:01:10.050> to<00:01:10.200> plant<00:01:10.470> things

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
and if you're hesitant to plant things

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.590 
and if you're hesitant to plant things
from<00:01:11.010> seeds<00:01:11.340> because<00:01:11.730> you<00:01:12.510> don't<00:01:12.840> think<00:01:13.170> that

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
from seeds because you don't think that

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.680 
from seeds because you don't think that
this<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:15.870> will<00:01:16.050> grow<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:17.100> two<00:01:19.340> original

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
this we will grow to two original

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.850 
this we will grow to two original
variety<00:01:23.570> you<00:01:24.570> would<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:24.840> surprised<00:01:25.260> that

variety you would be surprised that

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.770 
variety you would be surprised that
actually<00:01:27.320> start<00:01:28.320> roots<00:01:29.120> the<00:01:30.120> most<00:01:30.360> common

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
actually start roots the most common
