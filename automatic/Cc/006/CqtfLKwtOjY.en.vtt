00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.120 
all one piece frames they're basically
done<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:24.910> same<00:02:25.209> way<00:02:25.510> they're<00:02:26.500> much<00:02:26.680> harder<00:02:26.860> to

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
done the same way they're much harder to

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.820 
done the same way they're much harder to
clean<00:02:27.310> for<00:02:27.580> some<00:02:27.730> reason<00:02:28.120> but<00:02:28.570> when<00:02:29.470> we<00:02:29.590> dip

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
clean for some reason but when we dip

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.100 
clean for some reason but when we dip
these<00:02:30.070> because<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.090> all<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.360> holes<00:02:31.900> and

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
these because of all the holes and

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.199 
these because of all the holes and
cracks<00:02:34.140> around<00:02:35.140> your<00:02:35.590> edges<00:02:36.040> they<00:02:37.000> take<00:02:37.180> a

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
cracks around your edges they take a

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.270 
cracks around your edges they take a
little<00:02:37.420> more<00:02:37.540> time<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:37.989> effort<00:02:38.140> but<00:02:38.800> they're

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
little more time and effort but they're

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.870 
little more time and effort but they're
done<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.580> same<00:02:39.760> way<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.760> dip<00:02:43.000> on<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:45.640> shake

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
done the same way the dip on the shake

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.180 
done the same way the dip on the shake
it<00:02:46.330> takes<00:02:46.840> much<00:02:47.140> longer<00:02:47.350> because<00:02:47.920> you<00:02:48.010> have

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
it takes much longer because you have

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.160 
it takes much longer because you have
more<00:02:48.430> wax<00:02:48.730> dripping<00:02:49.209> because<00:02:49.540> of<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.810> excess

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
more wax dripping because of the excess

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.460 
more wax dripping because of the excess
wax<00:02:50.350> that<00:02:50.680> stays<00:02:50.980> in<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.250> in<00:02:51.430> your<00:02:52.470> reporting

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
wax that stays in the in your reporting

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:03.780 
wax that stays in the in your reporting
holes<00:03:01.350> they<00:03:02.350> cool<00:03:02.620> just<00:03:02.920> as<00:03:03.040> fast

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
holes they cool just as fast

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:20.100 
holes they cool just as fast
they're<00:03:04.660> just<00:03:04.840> warm

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.800 

and<00:03:21.110> you<00:03:22.069> get<00:03:22.189> a<00:03:22.220> nice<00:03:22.489> thick<00:03:22.519> coat<00:03:23.510> of<00:03:23.689> wax

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
and you get a nice thick coat of wax

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.720 
and you get a nice thick coat of wax
that<00:03:24.379> the<00:03:24.470> bees<00:03:24.620> would<00:03:24.799> roll<00:03:25.010> out<00:03:25.159> very

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
that the bees would roll out very

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.580 
that the bees would roll out very
quickly<00:03:28.360> and<00:03:29.360> that's<00:03:29.540> all<00:03:29.720> I<00:03:29.780> can<00:03:29.900> think<00:03:29.959> of<00:03:30.319> I

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
quickly and that's all I can think of I

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.929 
quickly and that's all I can think of I
hope<00:03:30.859> this<00:03:31.040> helps<00:03:32.799> go<00:03:33.799> to<00:03:33.890> Georgia<00:03:34.250> bees<00:03:34.430> calm

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:34.939 
hope this helps go to Georgia bees calm

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:38.049 
hope this helps go to Georgia bees calm
