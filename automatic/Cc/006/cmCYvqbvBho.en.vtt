you want to arms monitors whatever the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.100 
you want to arms monitors whatever the
tool<00:01:01.220> radius<00:01:01.670> of<00:01:01.880> the<00:01:02.000> jib<00:01:02.210> fully<00:01:02.540> extended<00:01:02.960> is

tool radius of the jib fully extended is

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.679 
tool radius of the jib fully extended is
1.2<00:01:03.829> meters<00:01:04.189> it's<00:01:04.820> not<00:01:04.970> a<00:01:05.000> lot<00:01:05.239> you<00:01:05.509> can

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
1.2 meters it's not a lot you can

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.809 
1.2 meters it's not a lot you can
actually<00:01:06.049> I'm<00:01:06.380> standing<00:01:06.649> in<00:01:06.770> a<00:01:06.799> room<00:01:07.009> here<00:01:07.399> and

00:01:07.809 --> 00:01:07.819 
actually I'm standing in a room here and

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:11.020 
actually I'm standing in a room here and
I<00:01:08.299> think<00:01:08.359> the<00:01:08.600> total<00:01:08.929> with<00:01:09.799> the<00:01:10.100> jib<00:01:10.609> is<00:01:10.759> around

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
I think the total with the jib is around

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.510 
I think the total with the jib is around
2<00:01:11.240> meters<00:01:11.359> and<00:01:11.780> it's<00:01:11.899> not<00:01:12.079> even<00:01:12.409> close<00:01:13.249> of

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
2 meters and it's not even close of

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.190 
2 meters and it's not even close of
being<00:01:13.789> a<00:01:13.999> nuisance<00:01:14.659> to<00:01:14.899> anything<00:01:15.289> the<00:01:15.979> total

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
being a nuisance to anything the total

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.469 
being a nuisance to anything the total
vertical<00:01:18.340> travel<00:01:19.340> distance<00:01:19.700> is<00:01:19.880> 2<00:01:20.179> meters

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
vertical travel distance is 2 meters

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.179 
vertical travel distance is 2 meters
from<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:20.899> bottom<00:01:21.289> to<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.799> top<00:01:21.829> and<00:01:23.950> of<00:01:24.950> course

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
from the bottom to the top and of course

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:27.399 
from the bottom to the top and of course
you<00:01:25.310> can<00:01:25.460> pull<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.240> extensions<00:01:26.749> in<00:01:26.929> make<00:01:27.289> it

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
you can pull the extensions in make it

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.050 
you can pull the extensions in make it
even<00:01:27.679> smaller<00:01:27.950> depending<00:01:28.939> on<00:01:29.179> your<00:01:29.329> needs

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
even smaller depending on your needs

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.480 
even smaller depending on your needs
the<00:01:32.060> tip<00:01:32.299> only<00:01:32.600> travels<00:01:33.200> vertically<00:01:33.889> the

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
the tip only travels vertically the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.669 
the tip only travels vertically the
camera<00:01:34.819> will<00:01:35.030> stay<00:01:35.299> horizontal<00:01:35.689> so<00:01:36.319> it<00:01:36.439> will

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
camera will stay horizontal so it will

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.800 
camera will stay horizontal so it will
not<00:01:36.829> tilt<00:01:37.249> there's<00:01:37.579> no<00:01:37.789> tilting<00:01:38.299> system<00:01:38.659> on

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
not tilt there's no tilting system on

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.649 
not tilt there's no tilting system on
this<00:01:38.929> thing<00:01:39.200> so<00:01:39.859> if<00:01:40.039> you<00:01:40.249> want<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:40.700> tilt<00:01:40.909> you

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
this thing so if you want to tilt you

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.719 
this thing so if you want to tilt you
have<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:41.959> improvise<00:01:42.259> and<00:01:42.709> do<00:01:42.859> it<00:01:43.039> with<00:01:43.280> a<00:01:43.310> video

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
have to improvise and do it with a video

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.340 
have to improvise and do it with a video
here<00:01:43.999> two<00:01:44.179> separate<00:01:44.539> video<00:01:44.780> head<00:01:44.929> which<00:01:45.200> you

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
here two separate video head which you

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.590 
here two separate video head which you
attach<00:01:45.439> to<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.829> base<00:01:45.950> which<00:01:46.789> can<00:01:46.819> get<00:01:47.329> a<00:01:47.389> bit

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
attach to the base which can get a bit

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.449 
attach to the base which can get a bit
tricky<00:01:47.630> but<00:01:48.229> once<00:01:48.380> you<00:01:48.529> get<00:01:48.679> the<00:01:48.829> hang<00:01:48.859> of<00:01:49.130> it<00:01:49.249> I

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459 
tricky but once you get the hang of it I

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:52.940 
tricky but once you get the hang of it I
know<00:01:49.520> you<00:01:49.789> can<00:01:49.969> make<00:01:50.600> something

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
know you can make something

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.320 
know you can make something
apart<00:01:53.950> from<00:01:54.010> the<00:01:54.130> head<00:01:54.280> I<00:01:54.310> find<00:01:54.580> it's<00:01:54.730> pretty

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
apart from the head I find it's pretty

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.630 
apart from the head I find it's pretty
smooth<00:01:55.720> but<00:01:56.110> you<00:01:56.470> get<00:01:56.590> it<00:01:56.710> balanced<00:01:57.100> out<00:01:57.250> right

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
smooth but you get it balanced out right

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.460 
smooth but you get it balanced out right
it<00:01:58.210> travels<00:01:59.080> very<00:01:59.230> very<00:01:59.710> decently<00:02:01.230> the<00:02:02.230> clip

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
it travels very very decently the clip

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.020 
it travels very very decently the clip
just<00:02:02.740> seeing<00:02:03.610> right<00:02:03.820> now<00:02:03.850> is<00:02:04.300> a<00:02:05.610> 50<00:02:06.610> mark<00:02:06.760> free

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
just seeing right now is a 50 mark free

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.640 
just seeing right now is a 50 mark free
camera<00:02:07.540> with<00:02:08.020> the<00:02:08.170> 2470<00:02:09.160> 2.8<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.940> new<00:02:10.090> one<00:02:10.300> and

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
camera with the 2470 2.8 the new one and

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.140 
camera with the 2470 2.8 the new one and
I<00:02:11.650> think<00:02:11.890> I<00:02:11.920> waited<00:02:12.190> in<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.460> round<00:02:12.670> one<00:02:12.910> point

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
I think I waited in the round one point

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.010 
I think I waited in the round one point
eight<00:02:13.270> kilos

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
eight kilos

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.990 
eight kilos
I<00:02:14.050> did<00:02:14.800> try<00:02:15.160> this<00:02:15.220> out<00:02:15.820> with<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.510> Sony<00:02:17.320> fs100

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
I did try this out with a Sony fs100

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.490 
I did try this out with a Sony fs100
with<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.090> speed<00:02:19.330> booster<00:02:19.750> with<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.200> Canon

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
with the speed booster with the Canon

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.070 
with the speed booster with the Canon
lens<00:02:20.709> with<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.550> base<00:02:21.730> plate<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.870> think

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
lens with the base plate and I think

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.750 
lens with the base plate and I think
that<00:02:23.200> total<00:02:23.500> up<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.620> around<00:02:23.980> three<00:02:24.370> point<00:02:24.610> six

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
that total up to around three point six

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.720 
that total up to around three point six
kilos<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.930> had<00:02:26.110> it<00:02:26.200> on<00:02:26.290> full<00:02:26.590> extended<00:02:27.160> and

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
kilos and I had it on full extended and

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.820 
kilos and I had it on full extended and
what<00:02:28.240> you<00:02:28.360> will<00:02:28.540> notice<00:02:28.780> if<00:02:29.410> you're<00:02:29.620> not

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
what you will notice if you're not

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.280 
what you will notice if you're not
smooth<00:02:30.640> enough<00:02:30.790> is<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:31.780> when<00:02:31.900> you're<00:02:32.020> doing

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
smooth enough is that when you're doing

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.870 
smooth enough is that when you're doing
your<00:02:33.090> ascending<00:02:34.200> travels<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.980> will<00:02:36.220> bounce<00:02:36.550> a

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
your ascending travels it will bounce a

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.590 
your ascending travels it will bounce a
bit<00:02:37.120> once<00:02:37.420> you<00:02:37.570> come<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.410> halt<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:39.600> of

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
bit once you come to a halt and of

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.960 
bit once you come to a halt and of
course<00:02:40.870> this<00:02:41.140> is<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.530> price<00:02:41.830> of<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.790> know

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
course this is the price of you know

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.860 
course this is the price of you know
using<00:02:43.209> something<00:02:43.750> lightweight<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:46.420> will<00:02:46.630> get

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
using something lightweight it will get

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.479 
using something lightweight it will get
a<00:02:46.900> bit<00:02:47.110> bouncy<00:02:47.290> so<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:47.950> really<00:02:48.280> have<00:02:48.400> to

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
a bit bouncy so you really have to

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.940 
a bit bouncy so you really have to
practice<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.270> get<00:02:49.450> those<00:02:49.720> travel<00:02:50.170> smooth<00:02:50.560> and

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
practice and get those travel smooth and

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.890 
practice and get those travel smooth and
precise<00:02:52.830> but<00:02:53.830> I<00:02:54.160> think<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.790> five<00:02:55.209> kilo<00:02:55.540> is<00:02:55.720> an

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
precise but I think the five kilo is an

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.199 
precise but I think the five kilo is an
absolutely<00:02:56.560> absolute<00:02:57.430> maximum<00:02:57.880> that<00:02:58.030> you<00:02:58.090> can

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
absolutely absolute maximum that you can

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.110 
absolutely absolute maximum that you can
use<00:02:58.420> on<00:02:58.600> this<00:02:58.750> chip<00:02:59.100> which<00:03:00.100> is<00:03:00.130> a<00:03:00.820> footage

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
use on this chip which is a footage

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.780 
use on this chip which is a footage
onwards

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
onwards

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.190 
onwards
of<00:03:03.790> course<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.239> will<00:03:04.390> probably<00:03:04.720> get<00:03:04.959> a<00:03:05.019> bit

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
of course it will probably get a bit

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.660 
of course it will probably get a bit
more<00:03:05.320> steady<00:03:05.590> if<00:03:05.739> you<00:03:05.830> pull<00:03:06.010> this<00:03:06.160> extension

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
more steady if you pull this extension

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.630 
more steady if you pull this extension
and<00:03:06.910> then<00:03:07.090> only<00:03:07.330> use<00:03:07.540> two<00:03:08.230> links<00:03:08.530> here<00:03:08.769> it<00:03:09.459> will

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
and then only use two links here it will

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.479 
and then only use two links here it will
probably<00:03:10.209> be<00:03:10.630> a<00:03:10.660> bit<00:03:10.690> smoother<00:03:11.080> but<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.010> think

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
probably be a bit smoother but I think

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.580 
probably be a bit smoother but I think
it's<00:03:12.610> okay<00:03:12.910> and<00:03:13.150> as<00:03:13.840> you<00:03:13.870> can<00:03:14.080> see<00:03:14.290> it's

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
it's okay and as you can see it's

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.930 
it's okay and as you can see it's
travels<00:03:14.950> fine<00:03:15.220> both<00:03:15.519> panning<00:03:17.100> yeah<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.519> as

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
travels fine both panning yeah and as

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.740 
travels fine both panning yeah and as
you<00:03:19.090> see<00:03:19.239> I'm<00:03:19.390> not<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.630> best<00:03:19.840> trainer<00:03:20.709> yet<00:03:21.100> so

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
you see I'm not the best trainer yet so

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.330 
you see I'm not the best trainer yet so
even<00:03:22.750> though<00:03:22.870> I<00:03:22.900> did<00:03:23.110> try<00:03:23.320> do<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.739> tilt<00:03:24.010> while

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
even though I did try do the tilt while

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.180 
even though I did try do the tilt while
craning<00:03:24.880> it's<00:03:25.060> a

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
craning it's a

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.580 
craning it's a
it<00:03:26.790> can<00:03:27.150> get<00:03:27.270> better<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:27.960> think<00:03:28.020> it's<00:03:28.260> it's

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
it can get better and I think it's it's

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.470 
it can get better and I think it's it's
perfectly<00:03:29.010> usable<00:03:29.310> especially<00:03:29.820> for<00:03:29.970> DSLRs

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
perfectly usable especially for DSLRs

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.510 
perfectly usable especially for DSLRs
and<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.110> price<00:03:31.350> point<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.710> unbeatable<00:03:32.130> at

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
and the price point is unbeatable at

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.440 
and the price point is unbeatable at
this<00:03:32.760> point<00:03:33.470> so<00:03:34.470> yeah<00:03:34.740> at<00:03:35.460> the<00:03:35.580> moment<00:03:35.700> I<00:03:36.240> would

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
this point so yeah at the moment I would

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.710 
this point so yeah at the moment I would
recommend<00:03:36.900> this<00:03:37.550> ship<00:03:38.550> must<00:03:39.120> be<00:03:39.240> cost<00:03:39.510> at<00:03:39.660> the

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
recommend this ship must be cost at the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.150 
recommend this ship must be cost at the
price<00:03:39.960> and<00:03:40.320> because<00:03:40.530> it's<00:03:40.740> so<00:03:40.950> damn

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
price and because it's so damn

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.460 
price and because it's so damn
lightweight<00:03:41.610> you<00:03:41.970> can<00:03:42.060> actually<00:03:42.330> go<00:03:43.200> hiking

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
lightweight you can actually go hiking

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.680 
lightweight you can actually go hiking
with<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.160> whatever<00:03:44.730> kind<00:03:45.210> of<00:03:45.330> if<00:03:45.510> you<00:03:45.600> are

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
with it and whatever kind of if you are

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.530 
with it and whatever kind of if you are
a<00:03:45.720> nature<00:03:45.930> photographer<00:03:46.560> or<00:03:46.680> videographer<00:03:46.920> I

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
a nature photographer or videographer I

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.330 
a nature photographer or videographer I
would<00:03:48.540> reckon<00:03:48.840> this<00:03:48.990> would<00:03:49.170> be<00:03:49.320> a<00:03:49.350> very<00:03:50.070> nice

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
would reckon this would be a very nice

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.750 
would reckon this would be a very nice
addition<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.060> your<00:03:51.210> kid<00:03:52.340> but<00:03:53.340> apart<00:03:53.580> from<00:03:53.640> that

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
addition to your kid but apart from that

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.690 
addition to your kid but apart from that
yeah<00:03:54.420> check<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:54.810> out<00:03:55.020> I<00:03:55.200> footage<00:03:55.530> you<00:03:56.310> can<00:03:56.490> get

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
yeah check it out I footage you can get

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.990 
yeah check it out I footage you can get
it<00:03:56.820> I<00:03:57.270> got<00:03:57.810> mine<00:03:58.020> a<00:03:58.050> pro<00:03:58.320> AV<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:58.890> know<00:03:59.880> you<00:03:59.940> can

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
it I got mine a pro AV and know you can

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.300 
it I got mine a pro AV and know you can
get<00:04:00.210> it<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:00.420> lot<00:04:00.600> more<00:04:00.840> of<00:04:00.960> places

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
get it a lot more of places

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.100 
get it a lot more of places
I<00:04:02.340> think<00:04:02.790> it's<00:04:02.910> been<00:04:03.060> on<00:04:03.150> notice<00:04:03.480> because<00:04:03.840> it
