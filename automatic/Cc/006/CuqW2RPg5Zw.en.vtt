00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.130 
the apexes daly zone of Frostfire Ridge
that<00:01:40.680> means<00:01:40.920> he<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.610> level<00:01:42.119> 100<00:01:42.329> rare<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.079> you

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
that means he is a level 100 rare so you

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.289 
that means he is a level 100 rare so you
cannot<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.799> if<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.070> are<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.250> level<00:01:44.610> 99<00:01:45.090> and

cannot do this if you are a level 99 and

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.850 
cannot do this if you are a level 99 and
some<00:01:45.479> people<00:01:45.720> may<00:01:45.810> not<00:01:45.990> even<00:01:46.049> be<00:01:46.439> able<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.680> do

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
some people may not even be able to do

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.370 
some people may not even be able to do
this<00:01:47.040> if<00:01:47.189> they<00:01:47.310> are<00:01:47.340> level<00:01:47.640> 100<00:01:48.240> just<00:01:48.869> because

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
this if they are level 100 just because

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.319 
this if they are level 100 just because
I<00:01:49.619> doubt<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.130> could<00:01:50.460> do<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.670> if<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:50.909> was<00:01:51.030> level

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329
