00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
very well done rather than in games like

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.850 
very well done rather than in games like
League<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.509> Legends<00:01:18.900> where<00:01:19.080> some<00:01:19.320> items<00:01:19.650> can

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.770 
League of Legends where some items can
literally<00:01:20.430> take<00:01:20.580> forever<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.030> build<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.509> some

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
literally take forever to build and some

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.100 
literally take forever to build and some
are<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:21.990> too<00:01:22.439> expensive<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:23.040> really<00:01:23.369> go<00:01:23.759> into

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
are just too expensive to really go into

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.420 
are just too expensive to really go into
matches<00:01:25.110> tend<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.350> be<00:01:25.439> shorter<00:01:25.650> overall<00:01:26.100> as

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
matches tend to be shorter overall as

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.490 
matches tend to be shorter overall as
well<00:01:26.700> compared<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.240> other<00:01:27.390> MOBAs<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.259> like

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
well compared to other MOBAs so I like

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.219 
well compared to other MOBAs so I like
that<00:01:28.909> but<00:01:29.909> let's<00:01:30.090> talk<00:01:30.240> about<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:30.720> really

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
that but let's talk about one really

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.080 
that but let's talk about one really
awesome<00:01:31.259> feature<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.460> pretty<00:01:32.729> much<00:01:32.850> one

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
awesome feature this is pretty much one

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.730 
awesome feature this is pretty much one
of<00:01:33.119> their<00:01:33.299> main<00:01:33.600> mechanics<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.320> game<00:01:34.350> and

of their main mechanics of the game and
what<00:01:35.220> they<00:01:35.310> did<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.579> they<00:01:35.610> design<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> map

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
what they did is they design the map

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.539 
what they did is they design the map
basically<00:01:37.439> two<00:01:37.650> lanes<00:01:37.950> instead<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.430> your

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
basically two lanes instead of your

basically two lanes instead of your
usual<00:01:38.970> three<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.509> they<00:01:40.170> added<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.920> extra

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
usual three and they added for extra

destroy towers oh by the way towers

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.160 
destroy towers oh by the way towers
respawn<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.340> that's<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.700> thing<00:01:53.880> anyways<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.020> as

respawn so that's a thing anyways so as
you<00:01:55.350> go<00:01:55.530> through<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.009> destroy<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.430> towers

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
you go through and destroy the towers

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.910 
you go through and destroy the towers
you<00:01:56.969> gain<00:01:57.210> access<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.869> can<00:01:57.990> conquer<00:01:58.500> these

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
you gain access and can conquer these

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.609 
you gain access and can conquer these
different<00:01:59.399> resource<00:02:00.030> nodes<00:02:00.450> doing<00:02:01.439> that

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
different resource nodes doing that

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.910 
different resource nodes doing that
gives<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.460> more<00:02:02.640> ambient<00:02:03.180> vim<00:02:03.390> gain<00:02:03.719> also<00:02:04.680> as

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
gives you more ambient vim gain also as

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.730 
gives you more ambient vim gain also as
you<00:02:04.950> conquer<00:02:05.490> different<00:02:05.790> lanes<00:02:06.200> your<00:02:07.200> creeps

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
you conquer different lanes your creeps

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.130 
you conquer different lanes your creeps
get<00:02:08.340> buffed<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.209> get<00:02:09.330> stronger<00:02:09.629> creeps

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
get buffed and you get stronger creeps

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.990 
get buffed and you get stronger creeps
so

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
so

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.960 
so
it<00:02:11.480> is<00:02:11.660> similar<00:02:12.020> in<00:02:12.230> ways<00:02:12.530> to<00:02:12.590> other<00:02:13.070> MOBAs<00:02:13.520> but

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
it is similar in ways to other MOBAs but

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.940 
it is similar in ways to other MOBAs but
the<00:02:14.090> slight<00:02:14.360> twist<00:02:14.660> make<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.200> difference<00:02:15.680> and

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
the slight twist make a difference and

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.650 
the slight twist make a difference and
it<00:02:16.070> makes<00:02:16.250> matches<00:02:16.670> really<00:02:17.000> fun<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:17.630> can

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
it makes matches really fun and you can

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.690 
it makes matches really fun and you can
really<00:02:18.050> change<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.470> tide<00:02:18.680> especially<00:02:19.580> with

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
really change the tide especially with

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.760 
really change the tide especially with
the<00:02:19.790> ability<00:02:20.210> for<00:02:20.240> towers<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.840> respawn<00:02:21.170> you

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
the ability for towers to respawn you

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.200 
the ability for towers to respawn you
never<00:02:21.950> know<00:02:22.010> what<00:02:22.250> can<00:02:22.310> happen<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.970> can<00:02:23.120> go

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
never know what can happen it can go

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.850 
never know what can happen it can go
either<00:02:23.240> way<00:02:23.510> but<00:02:26.080> overall<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.380> gameplay

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
either way but overall the gameplay

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.500 
either way but overall the gameplay
feels<00:02:28.160> really<00:02:28.670> slow<00:02:28.970> especially<00:02:29.180> at<00:02:29.420> the

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
feels really slow especially at the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.090 
feels really slow especially at the
beginning<00:02:29.570> of<00:02:29.840> matches<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.709> movement

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
beginning of matches and the movement

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.120 
beginning of matches and the movement
speed<00:02:31.310> overall<00:02:31.730> is<00:02:32.110> really<00:02:33.110> slow<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:34.010> map

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
speed overall is really slow and the map

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.770 
speed overall is really slow and the map
is<00:02:34.310> not<00:02:34.430> that<00:02:34.550> big<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:35.090> if<00:02:35.390> you're<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.570> fan<00:02:35.750> of
