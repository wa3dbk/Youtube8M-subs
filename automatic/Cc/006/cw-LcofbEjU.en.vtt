00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.130

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.080
 should and again to the channel and to a 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.420
 pokemon information even a 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.009
 Corocoro magazine has already come out today or I think 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.880
 that has leaked and I do not know but we already 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.610
 has brought a little more information 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.679
 about something related to the world of 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.000
 Pokemon has not brought us any information 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.590
 about the new games for this 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.330
 year 2015 because infer that they are 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.770
 doing that they do not take out the new 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.570
 game I hope the game is a post 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.880
 because of what they are taking in 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.770
 a certain must be something incredible or what 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.860
 better do not get any games this year and 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.630
 I would be a total but good Lord 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.860
 apart from that they do not bring us a 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.330
 new information but it has brought us 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.010
 information about the new movie 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:42.290
 of pokemon cupa and a historical flight 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.980
 squat and they believe is something like this is in 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.739
 English 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.329
 and that information brings us something very 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.400
 small actually and a little more 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.770
 psg information and other other game 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.720
 from pokémon 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.760
 but basically the most important thing here 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.130
 is that I galateo if I galaxies 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.770
 will appear in the new movie add 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.860
 two new megs 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.489
 out things will come megawatts and I 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.979
 galaxies 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.329
 this expresses pretty well enough 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.700
 the goddess is same as a favorite together 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.259
 with sneijder and you see that on that scale 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.330
 you are seeing that it was already mounted 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.430
 in the god is the god because the god 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.520
 his eyes are red and beating 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.020
 it has yellow ones 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.939
 then it will be a participation 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.799
 quite important I think I beat if the 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.530
 what does he do in the movie 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.330
 I think it's pretty cool now what 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.700
 I do not know if what I do not know is that if you are 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.009
 are lips or stella aunts are the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.810
 same data from the movie number 50 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.670
 pokemon heroes that are the ones that you've 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.080
 I knew because I show that they are the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.119
 same as the known but leads 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.909
 as you know there are more there may be more than 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.130
 a legendary in contempt can be seen 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.549
 more than one lips as you can see more 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.560
 of a youtube if in addition to a youtube it is 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.850
 something completely crazy but it has 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.470
 demonstrated that there may be more than one 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.759
 only legendary in the pokemon world 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.520
 then maybe these dairy or 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.920
 latinas sean 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.539
 not those who know them is more likely than 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.979
 be of other dimensions something like this 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.620
 seems to exceed those of the rings 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.830
 three-dimensional play and super weird 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.510
 Well, I do not expect anything to be incredible, I have 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.490
 I want to know more information but 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.100
 I hope you will tell us a little more about 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.690
 information but progressed has been all 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.880
 mega dairy and media will appear 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.530
 along with the typical ones and surely 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.790
 they will be friends and such but it is that 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.200
 would like the pokemon that appear 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.180
 are the same as we have seen by 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.340
 example files that are recipes 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.840
 false I do not think there's more than one 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.130
 it has to be the one you've met in 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.560
 the movie number three were made 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.720
 friends of that oreiro don that that is not 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.120
 He knows and the rest of legendary Lucia 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.810
 for example if known and latina 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.450
 as well 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.010
 and I think very little they want was more with 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.560
 that the finger and the rest but there are good 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.670
 many of genres that do know a 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.849
 austria so they interact from a 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.980
 pretty pretty pretty cool way 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.840
 not because we eat the youtube movie 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.459
 that minute he appeared did not know 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.349
 absolutely nothing will be completely 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.720
 unknown which was very wrong 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.819
 because it exposes more you know u2 and such and 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.380
 it was crazy I hope that in this case 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.510
 is not the same because those beings just 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.599
 added a little more physics in my 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.310
 opinion and also puts us to the 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.750
 cost a couple of episodes of what's going 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.130
 to be the special thing about guilt in the anime 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.110
 they are going to be special that are going to come out in 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.760
 from these weeks I do not continue with 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.220
 the next but good are special 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.340
 that are like those of the days and such but 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.049
 are going to be about 46 reasons have been everything 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.540
 related to the juba movie 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.939
 he does not show them to us 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.620
 the way how to get ajupal in 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.079
 Japanese the flag will get blamed on 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.450
 the blond pokémon game that you already know is 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:40.500
 being at fault for events and talking 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.500
 with a type 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.230
 in the store in which market and this 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.700
 man will give us the vessel of punishment and 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.770
 You can change your way of saying 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.900
 basically then it also shows us the 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.460
 way to occupy in the recreational of 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.170
 pokemon watring that is a perspective 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.180
 that only leaves positive as the 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.640
 operational where we have basically and there 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.520
 is right then in its form a bounce 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.500
 also what I see is something of demand not 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.910
 is that image is like a manga and such 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.980
 is some special command process also 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.320
 I would like to read it and finally we 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.720
 shows information about new letters 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.790
 for the future version x 67 in the ts that 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.680
 Detraen pokemon load letters 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.290
 will be three that have been announced spit 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.640
 excluded cup existed exculpated that 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.070
 a bon is transformed and we can see that 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.050
 has a very interesting skill that 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.460
 allows you to search three ex cards in your 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.370
 shuffle in the turn that you put a 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.750
 game and in addition to a very good card 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.390
 called fence dimension the change 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.980
 discard two energy cards 100 ago 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.020
 damage points to any pokemon in 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.580
 ateval the other two letters of lü jia and 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.990
 they want they are from the same connection 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.720
 but we 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.760
 I have not seen your skill in particular 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.400
 they were also revealed by a pair of passwords 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:49.460
 in the containment of the frac and of minor and 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:52.430
 a couple of other things and basically it 's 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.930
 all the information that are not healthy the 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.660
 brought the magazine corocoro very little 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.460
 We sincerely hope that more will come out 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.520

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.290
