00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
full for a number of reasons let's say

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.730 
full for a number of reasons let's say
you<00:01:05.309> just<00:01:05.640> let<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.180> run<00:01:06.360> constantly<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.320> it

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
you just let it run constantly and it

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.890 
you just let it run constantly and it
just<00:01:07.950> keeps<00:01:08.100> backing<00:01:08.369> up<00:01:08.670> stuff<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.270> it's

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
just keeps backing up stuff so it's

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.960 
just keeps backing up stuff so it's
obviously<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.590> get<00:01:10.740> full<00:01:10.979> or<00:01:11.220> let's<00:01:11.790> say

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
obviously going to get full or let's say

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.640 
obviously going to get full or let's say
if<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.180> plug<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.630> an<00:01:12.750> external<00:01:12.840> hard<00:01:13.380> drive

if you plug in an external hard drive

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.490 
if you plug in an external hard drive
that's<00:01:14.100> full<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.520> files<00:01:14.960> forget<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.290> time

it's<00:01:23.250> going<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.610> start<00:01:23.790> backing<00:01:24.000> up<00:01:24.240> those

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
it's going to start backing up those

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.390 
it's going to start backing up those
files<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.320> going<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.500> need<00:01:25.710> space<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.070> do

so so that's one of the reasons why your

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.749 
so so that's one of the reasons why your

disc can be comfortable now in leopard

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.090 
disc can be comfortable now in leopard
you<00:01:33.030> could<00:01:33.210> be<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:34.409> could<00:01:34.439> select<00:01:34.860> an<00:01:34.979> option

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
you could be you could select an option

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.910 
you could be you could select an option

to be warned when old backups would be

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.440 
to be warned when old backups would be
deleted<00:01:38.490> meaning<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.090> could<00:01:39.240> stop<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:40.220> so

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
deleted meaning you could stop it so

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.580 
deleted meaning you could stop it so
here<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.659> see<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.079> says<00:01:43.290> notify<00:01:43.799> after
