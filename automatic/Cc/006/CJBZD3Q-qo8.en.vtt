the rate of fire stability and reload is

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.420 
the rate of fire stability and reload is
insanely<00:00:57.510> high<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:58.109> see<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> soft<00:00:59.070> ballistic

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
insanely high you see a soft ballistic

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.880 
insanely high you see a soft ballistic
seat<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.910> be<00:01:00.090> ballistics<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.840> then<00:01:01.410> finally

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
seat to be ballistics and then finally

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.100 
seat to be ballistics and then finally
it's<00:01:02.039> very<00:01:02.219> last<00:01:02.520> one<00:01:02.699> aggressive<00:01:03.600> ballistics

it's very last one aggressive ballistics
which<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.379> all<00:01:04.559> pretty<00:01:04.890> good<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:06.119> has<00:01:06.270> snapshot

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
which is all pretty good it has snapshot

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.390 
which is all pretty good it has snapshot
as<00:01:07.049> well<00:01:07.229> which<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.560> faster<00:01:07.920> Amy<00:01:08.159> which

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
as well which is it faster Amy which

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.130 
as well which is it faster Amy which
isn't<00:01:08.610> really<00:01:08.640> useful<00:01:09.060> on<00:01:09.119> this<00:01:09.270> field<00:01:09.810> scalp

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
isn't really useful on this field scalp

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.990 
isn't really useful on this field scalp
which<00:01:10.380> does<00:01:10.619> give<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.890> an<00:01:10.979> extrovert<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.670> more

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
which does give it an extrovert and more

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.460 
which does give it an extrovert and more

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
one and perfect balance which isn't very

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.490 
one and perfect balance which isn't very
noticeable<00:01:15.659> during<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.049> Greek<00:01:16.229> wheels

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
noticeable during the Greek wheels

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.260 
noticeable during the Greek wheels
pretty<00:01:16.710> low<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.250> finally<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.640> shock<00:01:17.909> rounds

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
pretty low it finally a shock rounds

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.370 
pretty low it finally a shock rounds
which<00:01:18.360> lets<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.659> bullets<00:01:18.990> bounce<00:01:19.229> off

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
which lets the bullets bounce off

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.230 
which lets the bullets bounce off
surfaces<00:01:19.860> which<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.369> pretty<00:01:20.549> common<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.150> then
