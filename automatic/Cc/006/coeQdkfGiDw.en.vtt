00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
 harare 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.170
 aarau 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.880
 we stop we are in one of the laboratories of the European center 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.589
 diabetes study by my side the teacher by young 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.589
 then sugar to fight against diabetes it seems 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:15.529
 it sounds weird 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:17.630
 absolutely not on the contrary 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.359
 you have to remember 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.279
 already that sugar 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.220
 The main rallying of any thought of a cell works with 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.159
 sugar with oxygen of course to consume it sweetening 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.330
 with a little bit but 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.120
 uses four years makes sense 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.580
 sugar to work and even when you're born 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.990
 useless at the time of his mother 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.920
 we only work with sugar he actually pointed out where his growth 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.370
 future with sugar the sequel so it's really our huge in need 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.890
 secondly what's important is that for this sugar 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.430
 I must not have the cells it must be in the direction 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.240
 of a concentration given that one gram per liter 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.850
 5 liters of blood for us before the usual mans in the blood 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.440
 so there is always a woman of sugar that is made in the sense 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.490
 that are used in cells and they believe products 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.120
 so of the outfit 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.010
 and all the first triplette of the necessary regulation of life 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.630
 and all that he does a past margin of an ethics desessard then 1,5006 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.040
 believe against diabetes are the goals of this operation 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.630
 she was looking for the goal here is to fund la rochelle to help the 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.329
 research 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.369
 to bring then I still remember a stable fourteen editions 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.060
 previous we can bring a total of seven hundred thousand euros to our team 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.220
 research that is absolutely 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.640
 phenomenal as brings 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.900
 squeezed from dada carry that money also 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.680
 we do not cotton 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.960
 that is, any operation costs almost nothing 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.560
 to be bored on its bottom is not because we laugh 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.100
 the leaders are scattered in all that it costs nothing and the 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.430
 volunteers by definition does not cost anything 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.790
 and so c I would say almost 700 thousand euros net for research then seven 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.950
 hundred thousand euros in 14 years for research how to go down where this 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:01.619
 research 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.920
 looking for the fed 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.920
 in fact considerable progress 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.270
 in our field the individuals named it the largest lake the most 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.219
 important it is an act development 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:16.169
 in the canton of duras which made its own, that is to say of a system in which 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.069
 we can put pancreatic cells 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.329
 the masters and remove the high school students planted systems in humans without 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.019
 have rejection phenomena so we can really propose to 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.489
 diabetics very long-term treatment 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.139
 totally effective 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.139
 and no problem of anti-rejection treatment 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.650
 today we have no longer demonstrated the effectiveness on the small animal on 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.750
 their scale we are in the process of finalizing the project for the biggest and 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:43.419
 even the port 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:46.089
 we are very optimistic that in the future 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:48.149
 this system can be 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:49.349
 proposed to the man 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.270
 very well thank you very much believe that some games 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.229
 thank you 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:56.139
 now the operation looked like sugar will be able to fight against diabetes will not be able 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.340
 to do without volunteers 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.650
 we met with us explains the why of his commitment 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:04.109
 well it's going to be 14 years this year percent 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:04.930
 it is that 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.570
 already started to volunteer 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.239
 in europe the teacher pagÃ© 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.989
 he searched so the campaign was launched with the little pieces of 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.149
 sugar at the time 

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:17.149
 but because this year we have small clement land 

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:18.620
 and as I was 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.049
 and I like to work more and better so I was free in 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.219
 half day 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.699
 ellen ask nicely if I could 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:28.479
 but be part of his gold team as a volunteer 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.529
 so I did not hesitate as soon as I had a history in the 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:31.980
 family 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.269
 and I have friends 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.639
 and now so% there are a lot of kids too 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.659
 and it's true that people 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:44.829
 it is not obvious he did not believe too high and ports when they 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.829
 says it's a serious illness because it does not hurt 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.419
 the often advanced to make fun of us 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.829
 and is now and yet become aware of the fact 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.399
 we have a nice shot a lot of kids and 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:58.369
 there are more and more young 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:00.889
 so I have the honor to have by my side sir who love the 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.549
 draftsman you are the godfather of the operation are the sugars to fight 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.649
 against diabetes for 14 years explain to us the why of this 

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:09.729
 commitment 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:11.650
 and played well when you make nickel-plated feet 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.149
 small drawings of little things 

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.259
 and when you realize that these little drawings can be used for something 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.959
 I think it's good mood and then a pleasure and it justifies 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.059
 the existence 

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:25.889
 since we have arrived after fourteen years the canning it 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.150
 now know this meaning 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.150
 is that humor is not a canning it is also a way to live and 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.740
 and and just live so I'm also very happy very happy 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.990
 because this presents she insisted 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.550
 I think that as much as I miss today if I do not expect anything 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.180
 to blame our companies is that we go very quickly and everything from 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.509
 it must be a success 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:50.199
 whereas the notion of effort is not a sin, it is on the contrary very 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.749
 friendly when this effort translates a success it's still a reason 

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:58.080
 to live is important so in simic maker and is very happy to 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.180
 participate in adventures that goes beyond it in which I make myself a 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.479
 pleasure to participate 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.300
 so for this fourteenth year and a new series of 5,200 a little 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.659
 word about 5 5 of st 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:09.499
 to raise the alert on the platform 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:12.269
 that I asked this year the theme today that you wish to treat 

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:13.559
 source 

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:16.899
 all these little c because the space is not very big can count something 

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:20.349
 to see I had been told about judo dance it would seem that several associations 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:23.809
 judo and the eu's defense against diabetes 

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:27.610
 but is also to get to do everything on stage the little I 

00:05:27.609 --> 00:05:30.309
 will pass one of judo taken elsewhere that does not understand 

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:31.490
 much 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.789
 and I embarked on this terrible adventure I chose my own text 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:36.340
 I thought that time 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.310
 their skin is still a beautiful feeling after four hours 14 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.740
 years 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.259
 so the only heart and skirts silk the physical plane also the conditions 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.770
 of existence to beat me at the right time 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.540
 and then in a society that I would tenditenu at age like a little 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:53.820
 selfish i think the ccc club the other car-sharing 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.759
 and it seems to me important moments of the kiss time is to share with the 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:58.400
 other 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.509
 it is clear that the donors can colored in red 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:04.669
 so as the coach did not want to do I actually believe that in addition 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.610
 that elsewhere sharing in creation 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.400
 I had planned this little red heart but it was not done so everyone 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.389
 my two red in the heart to participate in this beautiful adventure
