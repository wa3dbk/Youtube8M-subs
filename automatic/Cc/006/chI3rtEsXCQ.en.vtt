00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.730
 hello welcome to a new tutorial in 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.100
 which we are going to learn to reduce the 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.690
 noise of the images for that we're going to 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.269
 use a tool that incorporates 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.009
 the photoshop called mini bridge the 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.769
 you can find giving window 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:18.110
 extensions and minority directly 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.270
 clicking on the icon that puts mb 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.100
 a new window will open where 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.410
 you can find the image you want 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.460
 modify in this case I already had it 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.820
 searched and it appears directly to me but 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.990
 to you if it appears to us it would be to go 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.120
 moving through the different menus 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.700
 and find it 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.290
 good 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.850
 It should be noted that you do not have to open the 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.440
 image in the photoshop as it opens 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.240
 directly with the mini bridge if not 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.520
 it will work 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.490
 once we have the desired image 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.200
 click on it and click on the button 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.690
 right mouse where it starts to open in 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.829
 raw camera 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.230
 we give it and the image will disappear with 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.530
 different parameters that you can 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.960
 modify to change the values and 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.360
 different aspects of photography the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.190
 point that we care about is the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.560
 icon 3 third where detail 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.770
 in this icon when in this section 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.420
 As you can see there is a part where he puts 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.950
 noise reduction 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.120
 these are the parameters that we have to 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:29.340
 touch up to eliminate noise 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.950
 in particular the luminance and the tea of 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.900
 Luminance the luminance as you can see 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.920
 eliminates noise but at higher luminance 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.240
 less detail the key is to do 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.510
 a balance between the values of 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.370
 luminance and luminance 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.130
 so you do not miss the detail of the 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.160
 photography in this case I'm going to 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:54.610
 they used a luminance of 80 a 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.610
 luminance detail of 65 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.500
 in your photographs, it would be to go 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.830
 playing with the values ​​until you find 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.930
 ones that fit 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.390
 nation of noise that you more or less 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.970
 consider acceptable you can also 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.260
 touch the luminance contrast to 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.630
 have a little more detail 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.630
 I'm going to leave it at 70 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.370
 and so we would leave the photograph 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.380
 You can also modify the color and the 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.450
 color detail me in this case not what 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.160
 I'm going to use it because as you can see we 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.240
 that affects too much the photograph by a 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.180
 the best in yours that influences 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.320
 it would be there playing with these values 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.690
 good other aspects that you can also 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:42.080
 touching on the raw camera are for example 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:44.030
 the contrast the brightness the exposure 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.010
 good different values ​​that can 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.810
 add more or less good can do the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.150
 photo more attractive in this case what 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.120
 leave as I was since they do not give me 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.340
 nothing 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.750
 once you have done this what 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.150
 you have to do to save the image 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.629
 is going to this part from here to the 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.000
 left and give save image here 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.470
 you can choose a name in the extension 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.989
 of document 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.659
 quality and so on, I'm going to keep it in 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:14.120
 the same place where he had it and now 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.120
 let's see the difference 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.640
 well here we have the sea you have to be 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.640
 the program because if not 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.700
 here we have what the image would be 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.700
 original 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.420
 and here we are 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.220
 and here the retouched image good as 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.580
 you can see the noise has been reduced 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.580
 quite 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.180
 Y 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.739
 I do not know, I think the quality of 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.970
 photography has improved 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.420
 It's not important either 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:05.299
 miracles but good both is better then 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:09.430
 I hope nothing has helped you 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.430
 and nothing else is always all
