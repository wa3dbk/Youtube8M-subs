original and a percent sure I might have

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.109 
original and a percent sure I might have
seen<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.430> somewhere<00:01:08.549> but<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.880> don't<00:01:08.909> remember

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
card and uh it's actually this is more

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.030 
card and uh it's actually this is more
now<00:01:42.930> because<00:01:43.079> I've<00:01:43.320> performed<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.740> stroke<00:01:43.920> so

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
now because I've performed a stroke so

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.380 
now because I've performed a stroke so
much<00:01:44.189> at<00:01:44.310> school<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.820> actually<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.119> was<00:01:45.210> trying

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
much at school and actually I was trying

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.260 
much at school and actually I was trying
to<00:01:45.450> get<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.920> video<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.670> upload<00:01:48.000> I

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
to get a video of that to upload I

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.590 
to get a video of that to upload I
probably<00:01:48.630> get<00:01:48.840> one<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:49.200> monday<00:01:49.560> or<00:01:49.770> something

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
probably get one on monday or something

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.870 
probably get one on monday or something
but<00:01:51.979> yeah<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.130> doesn't<00:01:53.310> have<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.610> be<00:01:53.640> extremely

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
but yeah it doesn't have to be extremely

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.060 
but yeah it doesn't have to be extremely
sticky<00:01:54.590> obviously<00:01:55.590> because<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:55.829> one<00:01:55.950> is

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
sticky obviously because this one is

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.160 
sticky obviously because this one is
really<00:01:56.340> worn<00:01:56.610> down<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.060> still<00:01:57.299> works<00:01:57.479> so

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
really worn down and still works so

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.450 
really worn down and still works so
basically<00:01:58.469> for<00:01:58.560> your<00:01:58.799> setup<00:01:59.040> your<00:01:59.070> intake

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
basically for your setup your intake

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.550 
basically for your setup your intake
when<00:01:59.729> he<00:01:59.820> do<00:01:59.969> pits<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:01.200> you're<00:02:01.229> going<00:02:01.469> to

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
when he do pits and you're going to

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.200 
when he do pits and you're going to
place<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.490> back<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.759> your<00:02:02.969> fourth

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
place it on the back of your fourth

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.499 
place it on the back of your fourth
guard<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:04.680> then<00:02:04.920> years<00:02:05.159> going<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.520> crimp<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.479> a

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
guard and then years going to crimp it a

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.279 
guard and then years going to crimp it a
puppet<00:02:06.930> make<00:02:07.229> sure<00:02:07.259> it's<00:02:07.680> stuck<00:02:08.119> and<00:02:09.119> then<00:02:09.780> you

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
puppet make sure it's stuck and then you

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.320 
puppet make sure it's stuck and then you
can<00:02:10.470> put<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:10.890> bottom<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.610> can<00:02:11.640> put<00:02:12.000> it

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
can put it on bottom you can put it

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.880 
can put it on bottom you can put it
top<00:02:12.570> can<00:02:12.900> do<00:02:13.050> whatever<00:02:13.500> you<00:02:13.620> want<00:02:15.080> but<00:02:16.080> as<00:02:16.470> long

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
top can do whatever you want but as long

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.220 
top can do whatever you want but as long
as<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.550> make<00:02:17.820> sure<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.360> get<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.600> 7<00:02:18.780> face<00:02:19.080> up

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
as you make sure you get the 7 face up

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.320 
as you make sure you get the 7 face up
in<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.350> middle<00:02:19.530> afterwards<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:21.000> what<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.210> mean

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
in the middle afterwards and what I mean

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.900 
in the middle afterwards and what I mean
by<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.720> like<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:23.160> can<00:02:23.310> just<00:02:23.340> say<00:02:23.610> okay

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
by that is like you can just say okay

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.990 
by that is like you can just say okay
let's<00:02:24.090> use<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.210> bottom<00:02:24.420> card<00:02:24.830> or<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:26.520> can<00:02:26.700> cut

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
let's use the bottom card or you can cut

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.960 
let's use the bottom card or you can cut
the<00:02:27.120> deck<00:02:27.320> and<00:02:28.320> do<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.530> riffle<00:02:28.920> force<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.550> then

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
the deck and do a riffle force and then

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.910 
the deck and do a riffle force and then
just<00:02:30.210> show<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.600> bottom<00:02:30.870> right<00:02:31.020> here<00:02:33.590> or<00:02:34.590> you

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
just show the bottom right here or you

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.770 
just show the bottom right here or you
can<00:02:35.070> put<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.340> on<00:02:35.430> top<00:02:35.670> if<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.030> wanted<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.750> eat

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
can put it on top if you wanted to eat

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.910 
can put it on top if you wanted to eat
and<00:02:37.140> then<00:02:38.130> do<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.400> roof<00:02:38.580> force<00:02:38.880> that<00:02:39.090> way<00:02:39.920> and

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
and then do a roof force that way and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.400 
and then do a roof force that way and
you<00:02:40.980> could<00:02:41.700> play<00:02:42.060> but<00:02:42.390> place<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.960> on<00:02:43.080> a<00:02:43.110> table

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
you could play but place it on a table

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.490 
you could play but place it on a table
and<00:02:43.710> flip<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.100> deck<00:02:44.220> over<00:02:44.550> so<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:46.350> next

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
and flip the deck over so that the next

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.040 
and flip the deck over so that the next
move<00:02:46.770> will<00:02:46.920> work<00:02:47.130> oh<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.660> other<00:02:48.810> five

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
move will work oh and the other five

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.490 
move will work oh and the other five
parts<00:02:49.410> goes<00:02:49.590> on<00:02:49.740> top<00:02:49.890> of<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.040> deck<00:02:51.500> or

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
parts goes on top of the deck or

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.580 
parts goes on top of the deck or
actually<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.370> don't<00:02:53.490> really<00:02:53.730> need<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.380> if<00:02:55.380> you

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
actually you don't really need to if you

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.050 
actually you don't really need to if you
wanted<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.160> could<00:02:56.250> put<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.610> five<00:02:56.790> parts

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
wanted to you could put the five parts

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.440 
wanted to you could put the five parts
on<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.240> middle<00:02:57.420> adapt<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:58.790> that's<00:02:59.790> not<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.090> huge

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
on the middle adapt to that's not a huge

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.810 
on the middle adapt to that's not a huge
issue<00:03:00.630> I<00:03:01.220> really<00:03:02.220> thought<00:03:02.370> about<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.610> until

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
issue I really thought about it until

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.820 
issue I really thought about it until
right<00:03:02.970> now<00:03:04.250> so<00:03:05.250> we're<00:03:05.610> in<00:03:05.670> do<00:03:05.820> with<00:03:06.180> your<00:03:06.830> your

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
right now so we're in do with your your

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.560 
right now so we're in do with your your
force<00:03:08.070> card<00:03:08.280> with<00:03:08.640> that's<00:03:09.000> double<00:03:09.390> stick<00:03:09.540> tape

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
force card with that's double stick tape

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.330 
force card with that's double stick tape
to<00:03:09.870> your<00:03:09.930> duplicate<00:03:10.410> you're<00:03:11.040> just<00:03:11.130> going<00:03:11.280> to

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
to your duplicate you're just going to

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.160 
to your duplicate you're just going to
flip<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.580> over<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:11.940> you<00:03:12.030> can<00:03:12.360> you<00:03:12.780> can<00:03:12.930> hold<00:03:13.050> us

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
flip it over and you can you can hold us

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.340 
flip it over and you can you can hold us
pretty<00:03:13.350> much<00:03:13.440> normal<00:03:13.740> since<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.640> table<00:03:14.970> stick

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
pretty much normal since the table stick

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.350 
pretty much normal since the table stick
search<00:03:16.350> so<00:03:16.530> flip<00:03:16.800> that<00:03:16.920> over<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.340> you're<00:03:18.269> an

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
search so flip that over and you're an

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.040 
search so flip that over and you're an
act<00:03:18.570> like<00:03:18.750> you're<00:03:18.870> going<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.050> double<00:03:19.470> lift<00:03:20.000> so

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
act like you're going to double lift so

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.790 
act like you're going to double lift so
pretend<00:03:22.050> like<00:03:22.170> you're<00:03:22.260> doing<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.560> strike

pretend like you're doing a strike

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.930 
pretend like you're doing a strike
double<00:03:22.980> lift<00:03:23.220> you're<00:03:23.430> just<00:03:23.519> going<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.760> squeeze

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
double lift you're just going to squeeze

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.610 
double lift you're just going to squeeze
the<00:03:24.120> pack<00:03:24.300> a<00:03:24.330> little<00:03:24.450> bit<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.810> run<00:03:25.470> your

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
the pack a little bit and run your

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.110 
the pack a little bit and run your
finger<00:03:25.860> up<00:03:25.890> alongside<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.610> count<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:26.910> cards

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
finger up alongside to count the cards

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.870 
finger up alongside to count the cards

and you should be able to feel where
they<00:03:30.120> break<00:03:30.420> off<00:03:30.660> from<00:03:31.050> the<00:03:31.530> tape<00:03:31.739> I<00:03:32.040> see<00:03:32.880> that

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
they break off from the tape I see that

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.490 
they break off from the tape I see that
like<00:03:33.239> right<00:03:33.420> there<00:03:34.340> yeah<00:03:35.989> so<00:03:36.989> you're<00:03:37.350> going<00:03:37.440> to

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
like right there yeah so you're going to

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.880 
like right there yeah so you're going to
peel<00:03:37.800> off<00:03:37.830> from<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.850> tape<00:03:39.030> like<00:03:39.269> that<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.890> as

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
peel off from the tape like that and as

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.490 
peel off from the tape like that and as
you're<00:03:41.100> turning<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.489> over<00:03:41.610> as<00:03:42.480> you<00:03:42.540> pull<00:03:43.380> it

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
you're turning it over as you pull it

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.270 
you're turning it over as you pull it
away<00:03:43.560> turn<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:43.980> deck<00:03:44.190> over<00:03:44.540> so<00:03:45.540> that's<00:03:45.750> like

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
away turn the deck over so that's like

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.680 
away turn the deck over so that's like
if<00:03:47.280> you're<00:03:47.459> just<00:03:47.580> doing<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.880> basic<00:03:48.030> double<00:03:48.540> lift

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
if you're just doing a basic double lift

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.930 
if you're just doing a basic double lift
on<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.650> bottom<00:03:50.100> and<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.430> want<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.670> hide<00:03:50.760> the

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
on the bottom and you want to hide the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.140 
on the bottom and you want to hide the
facedown<00:03:51.150> card<00:03:52.220> you<00:03:53.220> just<00:03:53.670> turn<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:54.000> deck

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
facedown card you just turn the deck

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.690 
facedown card you just turn the deck
away<00:03:54.360> as<00:03:54.510> you're<00:03:54.660> doing<00:03:54.840> it<00:03:55.220> so<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.370> simple

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
away as you're doing it so the simple

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.479 
away as you're doing it so the simple
little<00:03:56.820> thing<00:03:57.380> so<00:03:58.380> then<00:03:58.590> once<00:03:58.860> you<00:03:58.980> place<00:03:59.220> this

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
little thing so then once you place this

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.860 
little thing so then once you place this
part<00:03:59.730> down<00:03:59.850> which<00:04:00.090> they<00:04:00.239> think<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.570> seven<00:04:00.810> of

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
part down which they think the seven of

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.040 
part down which they think the seven of
diamonds<00:04:01.019> it<00:04:01.320> will<00:04:01.410> be<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.769> five<00:04:01.950> parts<00:04:03.050> you

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
diamonds it will be the five parts you

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.390 
diamonds it will be the five parts you
have<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.350> seven<00:04:04.650> diamonds<00:04:04.800> face<00:04:05.100> up<00:04:05.250> on<00:04:05.340> the

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
have the seven diamonds face up on the

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.970 
have the seven diamonds face up on the
bottom<00:04:05.930> so<00:04:06.930> you<00:04:06.959> can<00:04:07.230> give<00:04:07.350> the<00:04:07.440> deck<00:04:07.590> fault<00:04:07.830> of

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
bottom so you can give the deck fault of

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.670 
bottom so you can give the deck fault of
a<00:04:08.070> false<00:04:08.400> cottage<00:04:08.730> want<00:04:09.380> but<00:04:10.380> don't<00:04:10.470> be<00:04:10.650> too

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
a false cottage want but don't be too

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.150 
a false cottage want but don't be too
fancy<00:04:11.010> because<00:04:11.640> then<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:12.090> might<00:04:13.040> sound<00:04:14.040> here

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
fancy because then you might sound here

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.160 
fancy because then you might sound here
nor<00:04:14.340> did<00:04:14.489> I<00:04:14.610> just<00:04:14.790> did<00:04:14.970> so<00:04:15.360> that's<00:04:16.109> tough

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
nor did I just did so that's tough

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.320 
nor did I just did so that's tough
you<00:04:18.040> don't<00:04:18.220> want<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.400> get<00:04:18.490> too<00:04:18.640> fancy<00:04:18.820> with<00:04:19.030> it

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
you don't want to get too fancy with it

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.800 
you don't want to get too fancy with it
or<00:04:19.510> you<00:04:19.810> might<00:04:20.100> flush<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.280> bottom<00:04:21.580> so<00:04:22.570> just<00:04:22.720> be

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
or you might flush the bottom so just be

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.030 
or you might flush the bottom so just be
careful<00:04:22.930> about<00:04:23.260> that<00:04:24.510> so<00:04:25.510> then<00:04:25.770> again<00:04:26.770> you<00:04:26.920> can

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
careful about that so then again you can

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.690 
careful about that so then again you can
force<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:28.200> you<00:04:29.200> can<00:04:29.350> force<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.740> five<00:04:29.950> if<00:04:30.490> you

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
force the you can force the five if you

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.750 
force the you can force the five if you
want<00:04:30.880> using<00:04:31.240> a<00:04:31.420> riffle<00:04:31.960> force<00:04:32.340> or<00:04:33.340> from<00:04:33.550> I<00:04:33.580> do<00:04:33.640> a

on<00:05:31.030> top<00:05:31.210> of<00:05:31.240> the<00:05:31.360> five<00:05:33.840> so<00:05:34.840> like<00:05:35.410> it<00:05:35.620> might

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
on top of the five so like it might

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.380 
on top of the five so like it might
it'll<00:05:36.400> stand<00:05:36.610> out<00:05:36.760> a<00:05:36.790> little<00:05:36.970> bit<00:05:37.150> but<00:05:37.330> they

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
it'll stand out a little bit but they

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.640 
it'll stand out a little bit but they
shouldn't<00:05:37.570> be<00:05:37.690> too<00:05:37.810> much<00:05:37.930> problem<00:05:38.380> and<00:05:38.560> then

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
just give a little bit of pressure and

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.780 
just give a little bit of pressure and
the<00:05:40.600> Cardinal<00:05:40.930> stick<00:05:41.310> so<00:05:42.310> at<00:05:42.370> this<00:05:42.460> point<00:05:42.640> you
