00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
the one for the crate and it's actually

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.850 
the one for the crate and it's actually
in<00:02:15.790> quite<00:02:15.970> good<00:02:16.000> shape<00:02:16.450> but<00:02:17.019> here<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.620> color

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.589 

scratch<00:02:24.040> here<00:02:24.459> but<00:02:24.819> in<00:02:24.910> general<00:02:24.970> it's<00:02:25.420> quite

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
scratch here but in general it's quite

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.770 
scratch here but in general it's quite
good<00:02:25.860> when<00:02:26.860> we<00:02:26.980> go<00:02:27.099> to<00:02:27.129> the<00:02:27.310> back<00:02:27.569> so<00:02:28.569> you<00:02:28.660> got

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
good when we go to the back so you got
