00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
days because I was trying to trying to

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.319 
days because I was trying to trying to
figure<00:02:22.799> that<00:02:22.920> out<00:02:22.980> luckily<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.670> was<00:02:23.790> only<00:02:23.819> the

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
figure that out luckily it was only the

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:25.819 
figure that out luckily it was only the
solid<00:02:24.629> state<00:02:24.780> drive<00:02:25.079> I<00:02:25.109> was<00:02:25.409> really<00:02:25.799> nervous

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
solid state drive I was really nervous

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.589 
solid state drive I was really nervous
that<00:02:26.280> my<00:02:26.400> motherboard<00:02:26.909> was<00:02:27.060> trying<00:02:27.329> to<00:02:27.390> take<00:02:27.569> a

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
that my motherboard was trying to take a

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.660 
that my motherboard was trying to take a
crap<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:28.920> would<00:02:29.280> have<00:02:29.310> been<00:02:29.489> a

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
crap and that would have been a

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.759 
crap and that would have been a
worst-case<00:02:30.180> scenario<00:02:30.720> because<00:02:30.930> those<00:02:31.470> are

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
worst-case scenario because those are

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.550 
worst-case scenario because those are
not<00:02:32.040> pretty<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.579> fix<00:02:33.060> those<00:02:33.299> are<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.780> pretty<00:02:34.379> big

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
not pretty to fix those are a pretty big

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.530 
not pretty to fix those are a pretty big
hassle<00:02:34.799> especially<00:02:35.189> because<00:02:35.790> in<00:02:36.030> those

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
hassle especially because in those

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.030 
hassle especially because in those
situations<00:02:37.109> a<00:02:37.200> lot<00:02:37.349> of<00:02:37.500> times<00:02:37.680> they<00:02:37.829> get<00:02:37.950> the

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
situations a lot of times they get the

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.710 
situations a lot of times they get the
operating<00:02:38.519> system<00:02:38.849> to<00:02:38.970> reinstall<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.569> have

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
operating system to reinstall you have

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.210 
operating system to reinstall you have
to<00:02:39.870> go<00:02:40.019> back<00:02:40.200> in<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.920> have<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.129> actually

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
to go back in and you have to actually

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.610 
to go back in and you have to actually
call<00:02:41.609> windows<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.299> to<00:02:42.780> verify<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.590> are
