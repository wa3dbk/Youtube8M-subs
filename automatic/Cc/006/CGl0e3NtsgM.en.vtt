halfpipe<00:00:19.680> split<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.160> wood<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.699> first

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
halfpipe split this wood is the first

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.019 
halfpipe split this wood is the first
one<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:22.470> works<00:00:22.680> pretty<00:00:22.920> well<00:00:23.070> we<00:00:23.760> really

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
one and it works pretty well we really

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.910 
one and it works pretty well we really
well<00:00:24.269> actually<00:00:24.359> worked<00:00:24.689> really<00:00:24.779> good<00:00:25.080> but

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
well actually worked really good but

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.859 
well actually worked really good but

two and five-eighths so this is the PCP

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.180 
two and five-eighths so this is the PCP
pine<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.570> again<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.780> remember<00:00:55.289> once<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.010> buy

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
you work these molds ok this is the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.929 
you work these molds ok this is the
piece<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.850> got<00:01:31.159> if<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.280> look<00:01:32.430> at<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.729> get

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
piece that I got if you look at it I get

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.219 
piece that I got if you look at it I get
I<00:01:32.970> gave<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.360> little<00:01:33.509> flat<00:01:33.750> spot<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.110> this

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
I gave it a little flat spot on this

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.590 
I gave it a little flat spot on this
side<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.860> side<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.430> round<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.450> it's

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
side and this side is round so it's

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.030 
side and this side is round so it's
round<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:36.990> got<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> flatten<00:01:37.470> around<00:01:37.740> I'm<00:01:37.890> not

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
round so I got a flatten around I'm not

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.280 
round so I got a flatten around I'm not
sure<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.689> wasn't<00:01:39.689> sure<00:01:39.780> if<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:39.960> was<00:01:40.020> going<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.229> do

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
sure I wasn't sure if I was going to do

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.289 
sure I wasn't sure if I was going to do
that<00:01:40.439> or<00:01:40.560> not<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:40.920> decided<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:41.850> that's

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
that or not but I decided to so that's

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.170 
that or not but I decided to so that's
the<00:01:42.450> way<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.140> one<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.880> not<00:01:44.880> sure<00:01:45.030> what

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the way that this one is not sure what

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.580 
the way that this one is not sure what
I'm<00:01:45.270> going<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.420> call<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.780> one<00:01:45.930> yet<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.500> just

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
I'm going to call this one yet it's just

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.859 
I'm going to call this one yet it's just
probably<00:01:46.920> be<00:01:47.100> my<00:01:47.369> first<00:01:47.820> half<00:01:48.119> pipe<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.659> just

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
probably be my first half pipe so I just

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.810 
probably be my first half pipe so I just
call<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.140> half<00:01:49.259> pipe<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.979> or<00:01:50.430> something<00:01:50.759> like

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
call it half pipe a or something like

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.380 
call it half pipe a or something like
that<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.030> don't<00:01:51.119> know<00:01:51.470> but<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.970> it's<00:01:53.970> pretty

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
that I don't know but it is it's pretty

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.840 
that I don't know but it is it's pretty

mold you have to shake it and the reason
for<00:02:26.450> shaking<00:02:26.690> is<00:02:26.930> get<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.200> air<00:02:27.320> bubbles<00:02:27.740> out

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
for shaking is get the air bubbles out

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.170 
for shaking is get the air bubbles out
of<00:02:27.890> there<00:02:28.130> because<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.850> want<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.060> air

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
of there because you want the air

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.180 
of there because you want the air
bubbles<00:02:29.510> all<00:02:29.630> come<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.960> the<00:02:30.050> top<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:30.410> sit<00:02:31.160> there

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
bubbles all come to the top so sit there

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.900 
bubbles all come to the top so sit there
do<00:02:31.580> this<00:02:31.790> for<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:34.130> shake<00:02:34.400> shake<00:02:34.610> shake<00:02:34.880> shake
