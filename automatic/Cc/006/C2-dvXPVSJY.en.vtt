in 2011 and i just thought i'd share
with<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.220> CT<00:00:35.550> setup<00:00:36.050> you<00:00:37.050> know<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.260> can

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
with you the CT setup you know you can

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.010 
there's a lot of dummies out there but i
just<00:00:41.610> thought<00:00:41.700> i'd<00:00:41.820> go<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.360> explain<00:00:42.780> as

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
just thought i'd go in and explain as

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.320 
just thought i'd go in and explain as
the<00:00:43.710> kind<00:00:43.830> of<00:00:44.040> elements<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.820> tactic<00:00:45.180> and

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.330 
the kind of elements of this tactic and

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.530 
the kind of elements of this tactic and
why<00:00:45.450> i<00:00:45.480> think<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:45.780> great<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.290> yeah<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.880> hey

why i think it's great and yeah so hey

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.420 
why i think it's great and yeah so hey
this<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:49.110> tactic<00:00:49.470> is<00:00:49.560> based<00:00:49.800> off<00:00:50.010> three

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
this this tactic is based off three

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.880 
this this tactic is based off three
cults<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:51.030> know<00:00:51.630> for<00:00:51.900> cult<00:00:52.110> story<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.470> one<00:00:52.590> over

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
he just sits waiting to if anyone

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.539 
he just sits waiting to if anyone
Russia's<00:01:28.710> he<00:01:28.829> can<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.069> drop<00:01:29.219> this<00:01:29.340> flash

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
Russia's he can just drop this flash

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.289 
Russia's he can just drop this flash
bang<00:01:29.729> all<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.479> one<00:01:30.630> here<00:01:31.909> like<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.060> I

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
bang all this one here like that I

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.749 
bang all this one here like that I
learned<00:01:33.840> existence<00:01:34.499> he<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.280> comes<00:01:35.490> here<00:01:35.670> and

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
learned existence he just comes here and

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.440 
learned existence he just comes here and
waits<00:01:35.939> like<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.509> now<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.759> presume<00:01:38.759> what<00:01:39.420> I

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
waits like this and now I presume what I

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.120 
waits like this and now I presume what I
think<00:01:39.869> why<00:01:40.259> they're<00:01:40.439> doing<00:01:40.469> this<00:01:40.679> is<00:01:40.920> a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
think why they're doing this is a

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.819 
think why they're doing this is a
they're<00:01:41.609> countering<00:01:41.999> a<00:01:42.149> rush<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.600> be<00:01:43.289> what

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
they're countering a rush and be what

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.950 
they're countering a rush and be what
they're<00:01:43.979> doing<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.909> lot<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.359> the<00:01:45.479> team's<00:01:45.719> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
they're doing is a lot of the team's a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.450 
they're doing is a lot of the team's a
lot<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.229> teams<00:01:46.469> or<00:01:46.649> try<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:46.979> flash<00:01:47.219> take

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
lot of teams or try and flash take

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.029 
lot of teams or try and flash take
banana<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.780> think<00:01:49.259> what<00:01:49.590> they're<00:01:49.679> doing<00:01:49.740> is

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:50.039 
banana so I think what they're doing is

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:51.679 
banana so I think what they're doing is
