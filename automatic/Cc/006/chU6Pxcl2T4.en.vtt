00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 then tomorrow is finally the play 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.810
 offs los home game against the kÃ¶lner sharks 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.510
 how are you so one day before the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.250
 playoffs more I'm fine, of course 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.880
 Of course, the tension increases hourly 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.519
 too hour 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.320
 and I think we players are the same 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.850
 Hot on the first game like all fans 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.590
 and of course hope that you are good 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.820
 start catching the series are two 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.710
 balanced teams there 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.269
 successive reunion are little things 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.800
 will make the difference 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.359
 but I also think that the goalkeepers 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.670
 really a significant role in this 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.410
 playing series, they will be better 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.000
 will not refute instantly 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.530
 have piano playing the same important 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.690
 any change every second on most 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.860
 or hard-hitting around at the end then 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.809
 as winner to go from the ice 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.399
 you have four in the running 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.410
 achieve the holy season, game were 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.170
 very balanced short duels up 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.329
 what is coming now is of course one 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.670
 Hot hot train in Cologne in case of emergency 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.260
 seven games and I just believe 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.699
 that you just hit every game hard 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.289
 that the cologne every game remember 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.930
 that leaves him in my game 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.450
 and that is that I then through hard 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.159
 checks and hard way of playing that one 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.659
 cologne maybe a bit like that 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.860
 you can pull teeth you are last 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.020
 year also with the home advantage in the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.369
 Playoffs started when you first 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.650
 remember playing back against wolfsburg 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.939
 it was not so good then think 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.920
 you that there is still a little bit in the 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.170
 Heads also from the players, yes 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.270
 clear in the mind is not so 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.229
 long time ago say 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.030
 Of course we want to see that one 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.560
 that yes that a bit further this time 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.350
 is as I said I think the opportunities 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.520
 fifty-fifty are against cologne 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.990
 and we just hope that one 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.020
 with our home advantage with the fans in the 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.740
 maybe one percent more 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.500
 have like the cologne 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.100
 is there any possibilities this 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.630
 to completely ignore that completely 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.220
 you have to believe it is hidden 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.710
 not it believes in me, the play-off 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.649
 I am currently stadien the pressure 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.600
 it's fun with 52 season games on 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.740
 Let's go and tomorrow it's finally time 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:02.280
 loose and sweaty hands smaller 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.990
 Much success for tomorrow 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.250
 on sunday finally the play offs go 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.329
 Let's go over it again 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.110
 The last game in Schwenningen 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.179
 speak 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.120
 it was hard-fought until the end 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.230
 very exciting how do you have 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.659
 all the last minutes in 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.970
 schwenningen you experience first, was the 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:22.549
 an absolute top game i believe that 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:24.200
 have brought so many fans and that 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.569
 we also showed our strength on 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.849
 end when we needed it necessary tor 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.760
 have also been the support of 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:35.060
 our fans always believe that 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.870
 we can shoot the 33 but still 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.700
 there and wagner 1 1 long shot of the 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.650
 blue line 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.200
 yes that was only on the train where I 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.280
 That was relatively difficult because I was 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.540
 was on the live ticker and you have too 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.810
 different positions of different 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.569
 have had opponents although our game 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.030
 was not over and the boys have 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.209
 also found a way home 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.970
 to be able to get rights against it and it 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.709
 was a lot of emotions 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.269
 that is said i started with that 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.510
 Heimrecht in the series against the cologne 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.340
 sharks 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.109
 how would you like both teams? 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.280
 assess moment now before the playoff 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:18.410
 I believe that in the play offs both 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.060
 Teams actually have that 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.790
 same break had the notes for 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.280
 start from zero 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.129
 What for two weeks was the first 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.349
 wonderful it is all past 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:35.900
 we have to look that we are the first 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:39.410
 change again our game finds and 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.370
 that is that is a very hard against 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.319
 cologne we know that 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.730
 many always speak of an advantage 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.590
 if you enter the series with the Heimrecht 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.160
 starts you had last year but you had 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.269
 even as we know we believe the end of the 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.099
 history in any case 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.750
 since the end therefore the first game 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.859
 lost against wolfsburg do you believe that 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.970
 this is still the case with the players 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:59.510
 also a bit in the mind 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.340
 i think everyone could play something 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.669
 what are you doing in the playoffs of the 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.590
 Player side is an experience and is 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:11.160
 there and for that there are positive and 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:15.180
 have negative experiences at home and 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.489
 that is an advantage and especially if 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.560
 but going from the seventh play him 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.989
 and the first game is always the 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.670
 heaviest because you want you want it 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.130
 on one side you will get everything right 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.020
 make and another page hangs in 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.890
 head you will not make mistakes and there 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.340
 we have to 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:35.010
 I'll say in the first third innovex 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:40.250
 find five changes our way of playing 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:42.390
 and and that we have over 60 minutes in the end 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.310
 can really succeed 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.990
 two very balanced teams 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.760
 the four also balanced on each other 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.710
 There are rows on small things 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.630
 definitely arrive but i think so too 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.860
 especially the goalkeeper definitely in the 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.710
 will you see that? 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.800
 even so 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:03.360
 I see that another because I 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:05.000
 believe that and the battles will be and 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:10.700
 will make the difference 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:14.130
 be special in front of the gate that is 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.170
 We need to find the ways that we can 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.000
 which can get additional because we 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.120
 Both goalie start take the first one 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.670
 Committee when the see it that way ie 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.830
 the offensive side also has a lot of traffic 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.050
 hungry for the followers again 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:31.050
 go and at the same time in ours 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:34.590
 thirds ahead of our goalkeepers have to 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:37.830
 we look that we are in front of stores 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.870
 can clean up and leave our 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.790
 Tormann see the disc and have to 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.350
 we play the game in this small area 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.640
 control and I believe who and 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.030
 very well that translates 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.990
 who in the end wins the games in the 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.950
 Main rounds were all very 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.570
 balanced 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.570
 how are they that can crack 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:07.160
 Patience also experience that everyone 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.160
 know that it's a game is 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:14.400
 we have a short time to play 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:17.680
 process and I believe who is best 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:21.040
 really the balance takes place between 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:24.400
 is not so high is not as deep 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:26.290
 win constant you have as ex-profi yes 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.690
 already played some playoffs and 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.670
 you can tell us what to say 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.290
 I'll be there two days before the start 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.200
 playoffs in the minds of the guys 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:39.010
 I think that's always something 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:41.670
 You always want to break sleep 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.660
 a little nervous 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:46.720
 you're actually trying everything 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.380
 to figure out you really have to try 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.720
 to focus on your task though 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:55.240
 so if you lie in bed that is 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.250
 It sometimes still heads 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.590
 under that you have to play as a player 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:03.340
 turn off that you need that 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:05.680
 rest you need the power and that 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.690
 it is nothing else of the game with the 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.810
 same skate of the game with the 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.310
 same racket remains the ice surface 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:17.800
 the same thing stays the same 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:19.320
 the same try only to implement what 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.420
 you could control that 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:25.420
 attitude fighting spirit and woman's team 

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.600
 to play and trust as the other 

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.940
 yours 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.660
 We also hope colleagues will do that 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.520
 that the crew needed 

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.070
 fighting spirit on sunday to the day lays 

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.970
 and hopefully music in this round 

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.970
 start thank you
