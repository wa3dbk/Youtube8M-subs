00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.790
 new variant the royalties not the 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.860
 volume number 2 you know that I take the 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.870
 volume number one records the 27 sm1 and a 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.040
 heap more because these are the volume 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.840
 number 2 what are you seeing now 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.210
 same on screen what peculiarity has 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.770
 these weapons the recharge is faster 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.840
 it's worth the previous volume what I had 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.250
 it was an additional loader to the elites 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.140
 normal because this one has a 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.570
 faster recharge speed no 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.860
 I hope to have explained to me well it is worth 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.140
 weapons that I'm living on screens 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.930

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.780
 volume two of royalty weapons 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.960
 they have that peculiarity that they recharge more 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.270
 fast the weapons in volume 1 was the 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.130
 additional charger that's why we're going 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.620

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.630

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.220
 same day on 23 June and is what 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.840
 you are watching right now on screen 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.900
 they will give us experience points 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.360
 elite every time we get an exo 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.350
 full suit is to say helmet that suit 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.790
 boots chest high 28 pieces 9 pieces 7 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.440
 pieces usually haunt everyone out there 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.540
 experience points will remain 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.580
 additional to what you get 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.560
 selling things are the games and other 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.869
 I'm going to put you right now on screen 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.090
 what are the sets that are going to give these 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.830
 experience points with the pieces that 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.720
 are included as some put 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.570
 including the glasses including I do not know 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.479
 what are they going to give those extra rewards not 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.460
 for what is said they will give you 5% more than 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.679
 experience points in items not 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.030
 as an extra bonus which 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.800
 You will get them if you have all the 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.660
 exo suit but I still do not know how it will work 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.070
 this exactly but good , and 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.230
 we will see is a new way to win 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.150
 experience points this I think happens 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.430
 Well, people who have little space 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.430
 in the arsenal 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.689
 Sometimes they fuck him selling things or good 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.370
 if you are in more all vestige I do not think 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:28.349
 that hurts but the people that like 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.510
 feel like climbing level fast 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.790
 it's just a nuisance to erase 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.019
 pieces but well there you have the picture 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.150
 you are not seeing it on the screen now 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.920
 therefore therefore good with 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.969
 keep those pieces or once 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.250
 both the experience points to 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:42.930
 sell it I guess it will work well 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.760
 I do not know how it will work exactly but 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.500
 well there we have a new way of 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.629
 get experience points in call 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.760
 of duty advanced warfare and the new 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.349
 Volume 2 royalty weapons that are 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.659

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.709

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.909
 of experience for all 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.280

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:01.319

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.019

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.349
