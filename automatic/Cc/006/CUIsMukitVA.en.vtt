00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
rice when they were teenagers and at

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.710 
rice when they were teenagers and at
home<00:02:20.440> because<00:02:20.830> they<00:02:21.310> ate<00:02:22.120> her<00:02:22.239> out<00:02:22.269> of<00:02:22.540> house

home because they ate her out of house

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.600 
home because they ate her out of house
and<00:02:22.750> home<00:02:23.019> she's<00:02:23.440> dead<00:02:23.620> so<00:02:23.950> that<00:02:23.980> was<00:02:24.250> one<00:02:24.459> way

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
and home she's dead so that was one way

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.539 
and home she's dead so that was one way
to<00:02:24.670> get<00:02:24.880> them<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:26.110> fill<00:02:26.350> up<00:02:26.560> without<00:02:26.830> having<00:02:27.310> to

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
to get them to fill up without having to

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.180 
to get them to fill up without having to
um<00:02:28.060> because<00:02:28.630> rice<00:02:28.989> is<00:02:29.200> cheaper<00:02:29.530> obviously<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
um because rice is cheaper obviously the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.280 
um because rice is cheaper obviously the
neat<00:02:30.400> and<00:02:30.670> so<00:02:31.480> they<00:02:31.600> could<00:02:31.780> fill<00:02:31.959> up<00:02:32.110> on<00:02:32.260> the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
neat and so they could fill up on the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.250 
neat and so they could fill up on the
rice<00:02:32.560> instead<00:02:33.010> of<00:02:33.130> just<00:02:33.370> on<00:02:33.549> the<00:02:33.670> meat<00:02:34.260> she

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
rice instead of just on the meat she

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.430 
rice instead of just on the meat she
wouldn't<00:02:35.440> have<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.709> make<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.160> much<00:02:36.390> so

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
wouldn't have to make so much so

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.420
