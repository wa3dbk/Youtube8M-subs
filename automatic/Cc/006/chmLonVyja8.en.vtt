different<00:00:26.230> just<00:00:26.380> with<00:00:26.529> the<00:00:26.740> bend<00:00:26.950> and<00:00:27.160> release

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
different just with the bend and release

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.280 
different just with the bend and release
on<00:00:27.550> the<00:00:27.640> second<00:00:28.029> bend<00:00:28.240> but<00:00:28.510> essentially<00:00:29.020> it's

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290 
on the second bend but essentially it's

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:35.160 
on the second bend but essentially it's
the<00:00:29.380> same<00:00:29.710> rhythm<00:00:30.270> one<00:00:31.290> two<00:00:32.340> three<00:00:33.340> four<00:00:34.170> one

refers to first half the riff so once

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.689

finger<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:21.120> pull<00:02:21.840> off<00:02:22.610> fret<00:02:23.610> 7th<00:02:24.269> fret<00:02:24.689> 5<00:02:25.400> pull

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
finger so pull off fret 7th fret 5 pull

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.000 
finger so pull off fret 7th fret 5 pull
off<00:02:27.620> then<00:02:28.620> fret<00:02:29.069> 7<00:02:29.970> on<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.239> D<00:02:31.230> on<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.739> fourth

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
off then fret 7 on the D on the fourth

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.509 
off then fret 7 on the D on the fourth
string<00:02:32.099> and<00:02:32.489> then<00:02:32.640> back<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.560> fret<00:02:34.560> 5<00:02:34.920> on<00:02:35.220> the

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
string and then back to fret 5 on the

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:45.740 
string and then back to fret 5 on the
3rd<00:02:35.819> string<00:02:40.519> so<00:02:42.290> that's<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:44.099> little<00:02:45.060> bit<00:02:45.239> tricky

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
3rd string so that's a little bit tricky

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.440 
3rd string so that's a little bit tricky
often<00:02:46.170> people<00:02:46.319> find<00:02:46.799> pull<00:02:47.549> offs<00:02:47.730> harder<00:02:48.269> than

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
often people find pull offs harder than

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.449 
often people find pull offs harder than
hammer<00:02:48.810> ons<00:02:49.109> because<00:02:49.650> you've<00:02:50.010> got<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.280> get

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
hammer ons because you've got to get

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.390 
hammer ons because you've got to get
this<00:02:50.579> finger<00:02:51.329> in<00:02:51.590> position<00:02:52.590> before<00:02:52.829> pulling

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
this finger in position before pulling

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.970 
this finger in position before pulling
off<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:54.540> all<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.900> those<00:02:54.989> notes<00:02:55.319> are<00:02:55.590> actually

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
off and all of those notes are actually

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.039 
off and all of those notes are actually
the<00:02:56.099> same<00:02:56.129> length<00:02:56.819> they're<00:02:57.510> all<00:02:57.629> what<00:02:57.780> we<00:02:57.870> call

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
the same length they're all what we call

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:16.849 
the same length they're all what we call
half<00:02:58.290> beat<00:02:58.500> notes<00:02:58.709> or<00:02:58.859> fast<00:02:59.190> notes<00:02:59.959> 1<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:15.859> so

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
half beat notes or fast notes 1 and so

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.330 
half beat notes or fast notes 1 and so
in<00:03:17.459> order<00:03:17.639> to<00:03:17.819> get<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.540> sort<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:18.959> smooth<00:03:19.410> flow<00:03:20.280> to

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
in order to get a sort of smooth flow to

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.849 
in order to get a sort of smooth flow to
that<00:03:20.569> you<00:03:21.569> need<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.870> be<00:03:21.900> comfortable<00:03:22.290> with<00:03:22.680> you

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
that you need to be comfortable with you

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.680 
that you need to be comfortable with you
pull<00:03:23.220> off<00:03:23.250> so<00:03:23.730> it's<00:03:23.879> good<00:03:24.030> good<00:03:24.180> ones<00:03:24.329> practice

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
pull off so it's good good ones practice

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.199 
pull off so it's good good ones practice
this<00:03:24.980> one<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.250> two<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.609> three<00:03:26.699> and<00:03:26.879> four<00:03:27.060> and

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
this one and two and three and four and

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.629 
this one and two and three and four and
that<00:03:27.660> is<00:03:27.840> all<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.199> third<00:03:28.500> bar<00:03:28.829> and<00:03:29.129> literally

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
that is all the third bar and literally

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.860 
that is all the third bar and literally
the<00:03:29.790> fourth<00:03:30.090> bar<00:03:32.030> we<00:03:33.030> finished<00:03:33.389> there<00:03:33.599> and

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
the fourth bar we finished there and

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.759 
the fourth bar we finished there and
then<00:03:34.709> we<00:03:34.859> just<00:03:35.099> play<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:36.090> is<00:03:36.269> in<00:03:36.389> fact<00:03:36.769> the

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
then we just play that is in fact the

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.150 
then we just play that is in fact the
sea<00:03:38.660> that's<00:03:39.660> in<00:03:39.840> fact<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.109> cenote<00:03:40.530> there<00:03:40.769> one

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
sea that's in fact the cenote there one

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.400 
sea that's in fact the cenote there one
two<00:03:41.340> three<00:03:41.370> four<00:03:41.849> five<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.720> we're<00:03:43.230> just<00:03:43.319> going

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
two three four five and we're just going

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.309 
two three four five and we're just going
to<00:03:43.560> finish<00:03:43.739> on<00:03:43.949> another<00:03:44.220> sea<00:03:44.519> rat<00:03:45.329> ate<00:03:45.569> on<00:03:45.900> the

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
to finish on another sea rat ate on the

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.470 
to finish on another sea rat ate on the
top<00:03:46.500> string<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:47.669> in<00:03:47.819> this<00:03:47.940> case<00:03:48.150> again<00:03:48.419> I'm

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
top string and in this case again I'm

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.670 
top string and in this case again I'm
just<00:03:48.599> gonna<00:03:48.690> use<00:03:48.840> my<00:03:48.959> little<00:03:49.169> finger<00:03:49.349> again

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
just gonna use my little finger again

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:57.289 
just gonna use my little finger again
for<00:03:50.280> a<00:03:50.310> on<00:03:50.609> string<00:03:50.940> 1<00:03:51.180> 1<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.199> 2<00:03:52.949> and<00:03:53.310> 3<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:54.060> 4<00:03:56.299> 12

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
for a on string 1 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 12

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.140 
for a on string 1 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 12
and<00:03:57.629> and<00:03:58.620> I've<00:03:59.099> hit<00:03:59.310> that<00:03:59.519> again<00:03:59.639> on<00:04:00.000> the

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
and and I've hit that again on the

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.460 
and and I've hit that again on the
offbeat<00:04:01.489> so<00:04:02.489> that<00:04:03.449> is<00:04:03.629> the<00:04:03.810> second<00:04:04.169> half<00:04:04.319> of

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
offbeat so that is the second half of

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.960 
offbeat so that is the second half of
the<00:04:04.650> riff<00:04:04.829> probably<00:04:05.609> a<00:04:05.639> little<00:04:05.699> bit<00:04:05.849> easier

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
the riff probably a little bit easier

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.030 
the riff probably a little bit easier
than<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.329> first<00:04:06.510> half<00:04:06.840> there's<00:04:07.799> only<00:04:07.919> one

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
than the first half there's only one

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.839 
than the first half there's only one
note<00:04:08.489> in<00:04:08.669> the<00:04:08.790> fourth<00:04:09.090> bar<00:04:10.010> so<00:04:11.010> we've<00:04:11.190> got<00:04:11.400> one

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
note in the fourth bar so we've got one

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:23.080 
note in the fourth bar so we've got one
two<00:04:12.229> and<00:04:13.229> three<00:04:14.010> and<00:04:15.560> two<00:04:16.560> three

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.890 

12<00:04:24.090> pounds<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.470> if<00:04:26.460> you<00:04:26.639> want<00:04:26.849> you<00:04:27.030> can<00:04:27.419> loop

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
12 pounds and if you want you can loop

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.409 
12 pounds and if you want you can loop
that<00:04:28.110> round<00:04:28.379> you<00:04:29.159> can<00:04:29.340> you<00:04:29.520> can<00:04:29.699> play<00:04:29.939> it<00:04:30.090> twice

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
that round you can you can play it twice

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.939 
that round you can you can play it twice
you<00:04:31.379> can<00:04:31.699> slide<00:04:32.699> off<00:04:32.969> that<00:04:33.360> last<00:04:34.020> note<00:04:34.259> just<00:04:34.740> as

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
you can slide off that last note just as

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.850 
you can slide off that last note just as
you<00:04:35.069> slide<00:04:35.340> down<00:04:35.400> you<00:04:35.939> can<00:04:36.289> just<00:04:37.289> release<00:04:37.620> the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
you slide down you can just release the

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.040 
you slide down you can just release the
pressure<00:04:38.099> so<00:04:39.000> you've<00:04:39.150> killed<00:04:39.449> the<00:04:39.599> note<00:04:39.780> and

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
pressure so you've killed the note and

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.589 
pressure so you've killed the note and
in<00:04:40.560> that<00:04:40.710> case<00:04:40.979> you<00:04:41.669> might<00:04:42.030> want<00:04:42.240> to<00:04:42.300> slide

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
in that case you might want to slide

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:44.600 
in that case you might want to slide
back<00:04:43.050> into<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.650> riff<00:04:43.800> at<00:04:43.979> the<00:04:44.069> start<00:04:44.400> either
