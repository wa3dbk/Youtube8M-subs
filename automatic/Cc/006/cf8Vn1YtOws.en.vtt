someone else's q action into the shop

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:23.960 
someone else's q action into the shop
and<00:00:14.389> overlay<00:00:15.389> them<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:16.379> see<00:00:16.590> comparison<00:00:22.970> for

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.090 

first<00:01:04.660> of<00:01:04.780> all<00:01:04.809> that's<00:01:04.989> not<00:01:05.080> my<00:01:05.290> normal<00:01:05.590> tempo

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
first of all that's not my normal tempo

without their favorite ones so what we
can<00:01:24.609> see<00:01:24.820> here<00:01:24.850> is<00:01:25.329> my<00:01:26.109> previous<00:01:26.770> q<00:01:27.759> action<00:01:28.149> is

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
can see here is my previous q action is

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:36.890 
can see here is my previous q action is
yellow

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:44.720 

orange<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:40.090> my<00:01:40.960> previous<00:01:42.570> profile<00:01:43.570> is

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
orange so my previous profile is

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:59.340 
orange so my previous profile is
controlled<00:01:45.730> max<00:01:53.880> was<00:01:54.880> demonstrating<00:01:55.630> yeah<00:01:58.350> so

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
controlled max was demonstrating yeah so

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.080 
controlled max was demonstrating yeah so
I've<00:01:59.440> let's<00:01:59.680> spend<00:02:00.040> plenty<00:02:00.250> of<00:02:00.430> time<00:02:00.520> at<00:02:00.790> few

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
I've let's spend plenty of time at few

I've let's spend plenty of time at few
will<00:02:01.210> call<00:02:01.240> back<00:02:01.690> swing<00:02:01.990> control<00:02:02.500> backswing

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
will call back swing control backswing

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.030 
will call back swing control backswing
gear<00:02:04.060> change<00:02:04.420> in<00:02:04.660> the<00:02:04.750> back<00:02:05.009> according<00:02:06.009> to

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
gear change in the back according to

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.100 
gear change in the back according to
your<00:02:06.220> own<00:02:06.310> personal<00:02:06.610> tempo<00:02:07.300> it's<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.540> personal

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
your own personal tempo it's a personal

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.900 
your own personal tempo it's a personal
thing<00:02:08.200> Rubo<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.800> then<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:12.370> gradual

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
thing Rubo and then a gradual

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.120 
thing Rubo and then a gradual
acceleration<00:02:15.300> compared<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:17.530> first<00:02:17.770> the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
acceleration compared to the first the

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.400 
acceleration compared to the first the
shot<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.490> I<00:02:18.610> played<00:02:18.850> here<00:02:19.090> which<00:02:19.300> was<00:02:19.540> very

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
shot that I played here which was very

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.130 
shot that I played here which was very
short<00:02:20.800> backswing<00:02:21.340> very<00:02:22.000> shocked<00:02:22.420> transition

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
short backswing very shocked transition

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.740 
short backswing very shocked transition
between<00:02:23.380> back<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:23.950> delivery<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.600> can

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
between back and delivery and you can

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.449 
between back and delivery and you can
read<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.989> accelerations<00:02:26.680> promise<00:02:27.100> they<00:02:27.250> don't

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
read of accelerations promise they don't

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.229 
read of accelerations promise they don't
miss<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.630> do<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.340> will<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.459> it<00:02:30.580> but<00:02:30.760> it's<00:02:30.940> it

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
miss to do it you will it it but it's it

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.449 
miss to do it you will it it but it's it
is<00:02:31.540> shot<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:32.260> even<00:02:32.470> sharp<00:02:32.860> on<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.040> shot<00:02:33.340> if

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
is shot it is even sharp on the shot if

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.160 
is shot it is even sharp on the shot if
I<00:02:33.520> type<00:02:33.760> here<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:34.120> is<00:02:34.270> actually<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.750> bit<00:02:34.900> sharp

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
I type here it is actually a bit sharp

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.080 
I type here it is actually a bit sharp
and<00:02:35.739> see<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:35.950> shard<00:02:36.250> of<00:02:36.370> looking<00:02:36.700> action

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
and see a shard of looking action

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.610 
and see a shard of looking action
alliance<00:02:38.970> two<00:02:39.970> were<00:02:40.209> you<00:02:40.390> start<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:41.019> few<00:02:41.260> Indian

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
alliance two were you start a few Indian

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.000 
alliance two were you start a few Indian
yes<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.760> delivery<00:02:43.480> will<00:02:44.110> not<00:02:44.230> played<00:02:44.530> smooth

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
yes the delivery will not played smooth

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.270 
yes the delivery will not played smooth
I<00:02:46.500> played<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.650> shot<00:02:47.860> smoother<00:02:48.310> initially

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
I played the shot smoother initially

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.360 
I played the shot smoother initially
I<00:02:49.340> found<00:02:49.850> this<00:02:50.030> Universal<00:02:50.930> if<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.680> player<00:02:51.980> plays

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
I found this Universal if a player plays

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.070 
I found this Universal if a player plays
a<00:02:52.400> short<00:02:52.850> more<00:02:53.030> smoothly<00:02:53.480> they<00:02:53.840> stabilize<00:02:56.080> if

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
a short more smoothly they stabilize if

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.900 
a short more smoothly they stabilize if
they<00:02:57.290> stay<00:02:57.620> more<00:02:57.830> relaxed<00:02:58.280> you<00:02:58.340> tend<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:58.790> have

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
they stay more relaxed you tend to have

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.480 
they stay more relaxed you tend to have
more<00:02:59.150> follow<00:02:59.600> through<00:02:59.990> because<00:03:00.950> you're<00:03:01.310> not

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
more follow through because you're not

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:15.399 
more follow through because you're not
pushing<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.180> brakes

00:03:15.399 --> 00:03:15.409 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.440 

so<00:03:16.409> the<00:03:16.560> shark<00:03:16.920> shot<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:17.909> I<00:03:17.969> played<00:03:18.269> in<00:03:18.390> the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
so the shark shot that I played in the

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.229 
so the shark shot that I played in the
beginning<00:03:18.870> had<00:03:19.079> a<00:03:19.109> delivery<00:03:19.980> of<00:03:20.280> 143

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
beginning had a delivery of 143

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.910 
beginning had a delivery of 143
millimeters<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:24.000> previous<00:03:24.989> shot<00:03:25.349> by<00:03:25.590> faith

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
millimeters the previous shot by faith

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.349 
millimeters the previous shot by faith
which<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.370> I'll<00:03:26.670> show<00:03:26.939> you<00:03:27.000> what<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.180> looks

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
which is I'll show you what that looks

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:32.240 
which is I'll show you what that looks
like<00:03:29.569> its<00:03:30.569> previous<00:03:31.139> shot<00:03:31.349> that<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.590> had<00:03:31.889> stored

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
like its previous shot that I had stored

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.569 
like its previous shot that I had stored
in<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.459> machine<00:03:32.819> was<00:03:33.000> more<00:03:33.209> like<00:03:33.389> this<00:03:37.579> then

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
in the machine was more like this then

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:41.839 
in the machine was more like this then
that's<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:39.680> yeah<00:03:40.680> I'm<00:03:40.920> more<00:03:41.129> relaxed<00:03:41.250> because

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
that's a yeah I'm more relaxed because

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.720 
that's a yeah I'm more relaxed because
of<00:03:42.180> that<00:03:42.389> with<00:03:43.170> my<00:03:43.379> own<00:03:43.530> personal<00:03:44.129> tempo<00:03:44.700> I

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
of that with my own personal tempo I
