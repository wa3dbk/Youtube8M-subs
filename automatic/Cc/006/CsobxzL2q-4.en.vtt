00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
intimidating for Montreal but I think

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.110 
intimidating for Montreal but I think

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
it's going to be a very difficult

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.589 
it's going to be a very difficult
challenge<00:03:44.159> as<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.269> said<00:03:45.329> I<00:03:45.840> but<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:46.970> had<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.150> bet<00:03:48.389> I

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599
