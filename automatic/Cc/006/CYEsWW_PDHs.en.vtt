00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.630 
truth about the m16a3 seeing guys would
like<00:03:26.290> us<00:03:26.500> to<00:03:26.620> believe<00:03:26.709> that<00:03:26.890> is<00:03:27.100> just<00:03:27.250> a<00:03:27.340> simple

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
like us to believe that is just a simple

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.180 
like us to believe that is just a simple
weapon<00:03:28.000> but<00:03:28.390> it's<00:03:28.540> not<00:03:28.750> in<00:03:29.050> fact<00:03:29.530> it's<00:03:29.830> a<00:03:29.920> fully

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
weapon but it's not in fact it's a fully

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.850 
weapon but it's not in fact it's a fully
loaded<00:03:30.519> Apache<00:03:31.120> chopper<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:32.140> also<00:03:32.530> shoots

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
loaded Apache chopper that also shoots

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.970 
loaded Apache chopper that also shoots
out<00:03:33.070> ferocious<00:03:33.760> Lions<00:03:34.330> that<00:03:34.840> are<00:03:35.050> nuclear<00:03:35.680> and

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
out ferocious Lions that are nuclear and

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.070 
out ferocious Lions that are nuclear and
radioactive<00:03:36.400> so<00:03:37.300> every<00:03:37.630> time<00:03:37.660> you<00:03:37.870> use<00:03:37.989> the

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
radioactive so every time you use the

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.180 
radioactive so every time you use the
m16a3<00:03:38.890> it<00:03:39.430> looks<00:03:39.820> like<00:03:40.000> this
