00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
remember when we first started with the

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.500 
remember when we first started with the
floppy<00:00:27.240> noodles<00:00:27.740> well<00:00:28.910> do<00:00:29.910> we<00:00:30.060> do<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.359> know

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
floppy noodles well do we do you know

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.690 
floppy noodles well do we do you know
where<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.779> inception<00:00:31.140> how<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.710> noodle<00:00:32.579> was

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
where the inception how the noodle was

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.880 
where the inception how the noodle was
ever<00:00:32.850> created<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.480> bet<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.809> don't

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
ever created I bet you don't

ever created I bet you don't
story<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.969> that<00:00:36.450> years<00:00:37.320> ago<00:00:38.480> some<00:00:39.620> soldiers<00:00:40.620> on

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
story is that years ago some soldiers on

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.840 
story is that years ago some soldiers on
base<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:43.350> think<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.739> was<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> base<00:00:44.610> in

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
base on a I think it was a base in

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.510 
base on a I think it was a base in
California<00:00:45.770> they<00:00:46.770> were<00:00:47.070> primarily

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
California they were primarily

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.459 
California they were primarily
responsible<00:00:47.730> for<00:00:48.180> unpacking<00:00:48.870> artillery

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
responsible for unpacking artillery

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.049 
responsible for unpacking artillery
shells<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.600> this<00:00:51.600> styrofoam<00:00:52.050> long

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
shells and this styrofoam long

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.840 
shells and this styrofoam long
cylindrical<00:00:54.079> piece<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.770> material<00:00:55.949> was<00:00:56.550> used

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
cylindrical piece of material was used

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.510 
cylindrical piece of material was used
for<00:00:57.329> packing<00:00:58.260> as<00:00:58.410> packing<00:00:58.949> material<00:00:59.280> for

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
for packing as packing material for

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.000 
for packing as packing material for
artillery<00:01:00.120> shells<00:01:00.359> well<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.199> guess<00:01:01.559> they<00:01:01.770> felt

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
artillery shells well I guess they felt

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.759 
artillery shells well I guess they felt
since<00:01:02.760> they<00:01:03.359> knew<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.870> was<00:01:04.080> made<00:01:04.530> out<00:01:04.559> of

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
since they knew it was made out of

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.429 
since they knew it was made out of
styrofoam<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:06.119> was<00:01:06.270> soft<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.350> touch

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
styrofoam and it was soft to the touch

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.310 
styrofoam and it was soft to the touch
they<00:01:08.400> thought<00:01:08.610> well<00:01:09.119> take<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.780> home<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.140> see

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
if since they were tossing it out they'd

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.940

Randall<00:01:48.090> developed<00:01:48.630> something<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.140> little<00:01:49.409> bit

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
Randall developed something a little bit

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.469 
Randall developed something a little bit
different<00:01:49.950> she<00:01:50.220> made<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.729> noodle<00:01:51.000> rigid<00:01:51.329> and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
different she made the noodle rigid and

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.950 
different she made the noodle rigid and
I<00:01:52.110> can't<00:01:52.680> tell<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.100> how<00:01:53.700> much<00:01:54.030> more<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.750> has

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
I can't tell you how much more this has

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.770 
I can't tell you how much more this has
increased<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.770> use<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.520> capacity<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.540> being

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
increased the use and capacity of being

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.280 
increased the use and capacity of being
able<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.110> work<00:01:58.380> with<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.829> plain<00:01:59.250> old<00:01:59.490> noodle<00:02:00.290> you

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
able to work with a plain old noodle you

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.080 
able to work with a plain old noodle you
can<00:02:01.439> use<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.890> water<00:02:02.130> as<00:02:02.610> far<00:02:02.939> as

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
can use it in the water as far as

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.390 
can use it in the water as far as
resistance

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
resistance

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.640 
resistance
I<00:02:05.470> just<00:02:06.470> heard<00:02:06.710> that<00:02:07.900> it's<00:02:08.900> possible<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.530> us

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:09.650
