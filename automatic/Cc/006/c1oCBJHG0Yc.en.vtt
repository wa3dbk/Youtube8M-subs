don't<00:03:53.340> eat<00:03:53.489> until<00:03:53.670> 2pm<00:03:54.290> then<00:03:55.290> eat<00:03:55.620> for<00:03:55.920> about<00:03:56.100> a

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
don't eat until 2pm then eat for about a

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.280 
don't eat until 2pm then eat for about a
six-hour<00:03:56.580> feeding<00:03:57.090> window<00:03:57.390> one<00:03:58.080> of<00:03:58.200> the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
six-hour feeding window one of the

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.350 
six-hour feeding window one of the
really<00:03:58.650> really<00:03:59.100> cool<00:03:59.400> bio<00:03:59.700> hacks<00:04:00.030> when<00:04:00.269> you

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
really really cool bio hacks when you

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.960 
really really cool bio hacks when you
start<00:04:00.600> delving<00:04:00.840> down<00:04:01.170> into<00:04:01.470> this<00:04:01.590> is<00:04:01.970> so

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
start delving down into this is so

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.030 
start delving down into this is so
there's<00:04:03.150> this<00:04:03.269> process<00:04:04.080> called<00:04:04.260> autophagy

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
there's this process called autophagy

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.670 
there's this process called autophagy
it's<00:04:05.610> basically<00:04:06.000> when<00:04:06.239> your<00:04:06.360> body<00:04:06.540> starts

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
it's basically when your body starts

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.170 
it's basically when your body starts
repairing<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.830> recovering<00:04:08.250> but<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.030> thing

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
repairing and recovering but the thing

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.910 
repairing and recovering but the thing
is<00:04:09.209> autophagy<00:04:09.989> stops<00:04:10.290> when<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:10.620> start

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
is autophagy stops when you start

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.250 
is autophagy stops when you start
getting<00:04:11.030> nutrients<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.209> because<00:04:12.959> it's<00:04:13.110> simple

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
getting nutrients in because it's simple

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.020 
getting nutrients in because it's simple
like<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:13.739> don't<00:04:13.950> need<00:04:14.070> to<00:04:14.190> scavenge<00:04:14.610> my<00:04:14.790> body

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
like I don't need to scavenge my body

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.880 
like I don't need to scavenge my body
for<00:04:15.360> waste<00:04:15.540> products<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.200> use<00:04:16.380> those<00:04:16.620> to

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
for waste products and use those to

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.219 
for waste products and use those to
build<00:04:17.100> one<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:17.970> can<00:04:18.209> actually<00:04:18.479> just<00:04:18.810> taken<00:04:19.140> the

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
build one I can actually just taken the

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.380 
build one I can actually just taken the
food<00:04:19.410> that's<00:04:19.560> coming<00:04:19.950> in<00:04:20.100> but<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.150> thing<00:04:21.359> is

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
food that's coming in but the thing is

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.810 
food that's coming in but the thing is
what<00:04:22.109> stops<00:04:22.410> autophagy<00:04:23.220> for<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:23.490> most<00:04:23.640> part

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
what stops autophagy for the most part

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.129 
what stops autophagy for the most part
seems<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.240> me<00:04:24.360> carbohydrates<00:04:25.080> and<00:04:25.260> protein

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
seems to me carbohydrates and protein

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:29.189 
seems to me carbohydrates and protein
bad<00:04:27.229> for<00:04:27.590> whatever<00:04:28.039> reason<00:04:28.520> don't<00:04:28.789> know<00:04:28.909> why

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
bad for whatever reason don't know why

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.480 
bad for whatever reason don't know why
doesn't<00:04:30.199> seem<00:04:30.349> to<00:04:30.530> stop<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:30.979> process<00:04:31.189> of

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
doesn't seem to stop the process of

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.309 
doesn't seem to stop the process of
autophagy<00:04:32.120> which<00:04:32.479> means<00:04:32.719> you<00:04:32.900> can<00:04:33.020> pretty

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:33.319 
autophagy which means you can pretty

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.140 
autophagy which means you can pretty
much<00:04:33.409> have<00:04:33.710> your<00:04:33.889> cake<00:04:34.099> or<00:04:34.520> Frank<00:04:34.789> only<00:04:34.999> have

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
much have your cake or Frank only have

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.179 
much have your cake or Frank only have
your<00:04:35.300> butter<00:04:35.599> and<00:04:35.960> eat<00:04:36.199> it<00:04:36.349> too<00:04:36.529> you<00:04:36.860> can<00:04:37.039> wake

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:37.189 
your butter and eat it too you can wake

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:38.769 
your butter and eat it too you can wake
up<00:04:37.370> in<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:37.580> morning<00:04:37.909> you<00:04:37.939> can<00:04:38.120> have<00:04:38.330> fat

00:04:38.769 --> 00:04:38.779 
up in the morning you can have fat

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:40.959 
up in the morning you can have fat
throughout<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.349> day<00:04:39.499> get<00:04:40.129> pretty<00:04:40.639> much<00:04:40.789> all

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:40.969 
throughout the day get pretty much all

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.450 
throughout the day get pretty much all
the<00:04:41.210> benefits<00:04:41.689> for<00:04:41.900> airman<00:04:42.229> fasting<00:04:42.770> without

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
the benefits for airman fasting without

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.969 
the benefits for airman fasting without
actually<00:04:44.090> having<00:04:44.210> to<00:04:44.419> fast<00:04:44.749> and<00:04:45.080> this

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
actually having to fast and this

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.219 
actually having to fast and this
particularly<00:04:46.789> works<00:04:47.150> great<00:04:47.479> for<00:04:47.659> the<00:04:47.930> women

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
particularly works great for the women

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:50.890 
particularly works great for the women
out<00:04:48.379> there<00:04:48.550> because<00:04:49.550> if<00:04:50.300> you<00:04:50.479> think<00:04:50.539> about<00:04:50.719> it

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
out there because if you think about it

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.589 
out there because if you think about it
women<00:04:51.289> well<00:04:51.650> they<00:04:51.979> were<00:04:52.039> designed<00:04:52.599> water

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
women well they were designed water

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.439 
women well they were designed water
waster<00:04:54.139> the<00:04:54.590> reproductive<00:04:55.159> hosts<00:04:55.669> so<00:04:56.270> they

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
waster the reproductive hosts so they

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:58.330 
waster the reproductive hosts so they
don't<00:04:56.629> handle<00:04:56.990> that<00:04:57.169> same<00:04:57.560> level<00:04:57.889> of<00:04:57.979> stress

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
don't handle that same level of stress

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.670 
don't handle that same level of stress
as<00:04:58.520> men<00:04:58.909> men<00:04:59.509> were<00:04:59.689> pretty<00:04:59.990> much<00:05:00.080> evolutions

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
as men men were pretty much evolutions

playthings<00:05:00.979> we<00:05:01.669> lose<00:05:01.909> a<00:05:01.939> lot<00:05:02.210> of<00:05:02.330> fuss<00:05:02.509> it's

playthings we lose a lot of fuss it's

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.300 
playthings we lose a lot of fuss it's
frankly<00:05:03.379> not<00:05:03.529> going<00:05:03.770> to<00:05:03.830> matter<00:05:03.979> all<00:05:04.279> that
