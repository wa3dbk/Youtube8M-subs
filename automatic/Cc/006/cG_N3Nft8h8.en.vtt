00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.889
 those who visit the web repair yourself 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.080
 this video that is dedicated to the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.200
 detection of whether the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.180
 bearings of our washing machine or the 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.619
 they are failing the first 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.960
 check that you have to perform is 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.960
 remove the back cover of the machine 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.119
 and we would see if in the central axis of 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.119
 the machine on the steering wheel 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.690
 on its back 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.340
 we have some added the remains of 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.519
 fat oil or crap that may have 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.530
 leave if the bearings are wrong one of 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.360
 the first symptoms that appear 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.510
 they are spots on the back of the 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.160
 machine and in this area here in the 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:57.079
 lower part of the mouse engine 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.199
 we would see dark brown remains 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.380
 generated by water with soap plus 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.290
 subtract the gauze from the machine 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.230
 in this case we have it as you see these 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.240
 bearings and really is also the 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.760
 second check to resist slack 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:18.750
 is grabbing the steering wheel from him 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.950
 of the drum as we would see himself to 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.950
 determine if who slack 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.460
 no ground and not initially move 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.040
 these cushions would be fine 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.290
 the third check would be to do 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.240
 turn the wheel to see if the same 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.150
 rotate smoothly 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.070
 we do not see that it rotates aborted 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.140
 we always want a boost has to 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.000
 take a few more turns and then 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.940
 would stop 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.670
 in this case it would be fine and the third 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.120
 check would be from the front of 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.000
 the machine 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.780
 check the hype to see if it has 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.780
 oscillation 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.490
 the last check that we can 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.440
 perform from the front of the machine 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.239
 to determine if the bearings are 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.879
 bad is 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:15.230
 introducing the hand between the rubber and the 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:17.020
 metallic part see if the steel drum 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.940
 stainless 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.990
 have some slack or have some 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.210
 movement as we can see in this case 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.420
 we can move the drum but it does not sound 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:30.060
 no kind of clack nor do we see any 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.730
 jump of the drum because the 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.170
 bearings are wrong in this case the 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.170
 Bearings are in good condition 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.930
 how we see the drum 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.689
 and we see that the same 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.579
 they move without any problem and do not 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.579
 it produces any kind of excessive noise
