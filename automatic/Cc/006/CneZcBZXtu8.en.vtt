00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
matter what type of paper I use graph

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.380 
matter what type of paper I use graph
paper<00:00:46.710> because<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.340> much<00:00:47.460> easier<00:00:47.489> but

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
paper because it's much easier but

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.500 
paper because it's much easier but
instead<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:49.079> doing<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.920> one<00:00:50.070> pixel<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.700> did

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
instead of doing for one pixel I did

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.500 
instead of doing for one pixel I did
four<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.770> these<00:00:53.070> little<00:00:53.309> squares<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.210> made

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
four of these little squares so I made

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.200 
four of these little squares so I made
it<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:55.110> around<00:00:55.230> one<00:00:55.649> inch<00:00:55.800> by<00:00:55.980> one<00:00:56.010> inch<00:00:56.210> so

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
it like around one inch by one inch so

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.240 
it like around one inch by one inch so
as<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.660> see<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.870> already<00:00:58.079> cut<00:00:58.379> out<00:00:58.500> my<00:00:58.770> the

now<00:02:24.319> actually<00:02:26.530> right<00:02:27.530> now<00:02:27.680> I'm<00:02:27.860> going<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.340> glue

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640

it down as you can see that's how thick

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.660 
it down as you can see that's how thick
it'll<00:02:31.220> be<00:02:31.900> so<00:02:33.280> we'll<00:02:34.280> make<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.430> nice<00:02:34.900> pickaxe

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
it'll be so we'll make a nice pickaxe

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.490 
it'll be so we'll make a nice pickaxe
I'm<00:02:37.670> gonna<00:02:37.820> glue<00:02:37.940> it<00:02:38.030> down<00:02:38.180> now<00:02:38.360> all<00:02:39.290> right<00:02:39.410> as

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
I'm gonna glue it down now all right as

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.380 
I'm gonna glue it down now all right as
you<00:02:39.620> can<00:02:39.709> see<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.160> one<00:02:40.430> is<00:02:40.610> covered<00:02:40.910> in<00:02:41.120> glue

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
you can see this one is covered in glue

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.060 
you can see this one is covered in glue
and<00:02:41.660> these<00:02:41.900> two<00:02:42.110> are<00:02:42.320> partially<00:02:42.860> glued

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
and these two are partially glued

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.400 
and these two are partially glued
together<00:02:43.300> so<00:02:44.300> I'm<00:02:44.390> now<00:02:44.540> going<00:02:44.600> to<00:02:44.870> place<00:02:45.140> this

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
together so I'm now going to place this

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.090 
together so I'm now going to place this
one

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.410 

this<00:02:52.100> doesn't<00:02:52.430> going<00:02:52.610> to<00:02:52.670> be<00:02:52.760> perfect<00:02:53.239> it<00:02:53.390> just

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
this doesn't going to be perfect it just

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.590 
this doesn't going to be perfect it just
needs<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.870> hold<00:02:54.050> together<00:02:55.269> because<00:02:56.269> we're

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
needs to hold together because we're

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:04.270 
needs to hold together because we're
going<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:56.930> be<00:02:56.989> taking<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:01.540> wrapping<00:03:02.540> it<00:03:03.040> so<00:03:04.040> it

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
going to be taking and wrapping it so it

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.819 
going to be taking and wrapping it so it
stays<00:03:04.519> on<00:03:04.700> there<00:03:04.880> really<00:03:05.180> tightly<00:03:05.590> as<00:03:06.590> you<00:03:06.650> can

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
stays on there really tightly as you can

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.640 
stays on there really tightly as you can
see<00:03:07.130> I<00:03:07.370> am<00:03:07.519> done<00:03:07.850> I<00:03:08.299> have<00:03:09.140> taped<00:03:09.410> everything

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
see I am done I have taped everything

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.170 
see I am done I have taped everything
down<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.160> glued<00:03:10.370> everything<00:03:10.489> down<00:03:10.730> so<00:03:11.150> I

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
down and glued everything down so I

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.509 
down and glued everything down so I
rounded<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.900> edges<00:03:11.930> out<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:12.799> you<00:03:13.220> can<00:03:13.340> see

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
rounded the edges out and you can see

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.030 
rounded the edges out and you can see
here<00:03:13.760> that<00:03:13.970> it's<00:03:14.720> pretty<00:03:15.230> smooth<00:03:15.500> very

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
here that it's pretty smooth very

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.949 
here that it's pretty smooth very
durable<00:03:17.470> pretty<00:03:18.470> strong<00:03:18.769> actually<00:03:19.570> so<00:03:20.570> you

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
durable pretty strong actually so you

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.650 
durable pretty strong actually so you
know<00:03:21.079> I'm<00:03:21.350> going<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:21.620> stretch<00:03:21.890> process<00:03:22.370> of

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
know I'm going to stretch process of

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:48.400 
know I'm going to stretch process of
making<00:03:23.660> square<00:03:24.230> so<00:03:24.590> I<00:03:24.650> know<00:03:24.739> where<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.190> paint

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.680 

all<00:03:48.950> right<00:03:49.100> as<00:03:49.520> you<00:03:49.580> can<00:03:49.850> see<00:03:50.090> I<00:03:50.120> just<00:03:50.330> finished

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
all right as you can see I just finished

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.230 
all right as you can see I just finished
drawing<00:03:51.290> everything<00:03:51.650> that<00:03:51.950> took<00:03:52.070> a<00:03:52.190> while<00:03:52.340> I

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
drawing everything that took a while I

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.780 
drawing everything that took a while I
had<00:03:53.720> to<00:03:54.070> erase<00:03:55.070> a<00:03:55.100> few<00:03:55.370> times<00:03:55.580> because

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
had to erase a few times because

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.330 
had to erase a few times because
everything<00:03:56.180> wasn't<00:03:56.440> exactly<00:03:57.440> dramatically

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
everything wasn't exactly dramatically

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.360 
everything wasn't exactly dramatically
