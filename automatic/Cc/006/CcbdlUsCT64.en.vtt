in<00:00:00.299> this<00:00:00.810> video<00:00:01.140> I'm<00:00:01.469> going<00:00:01.770> to<00:00:01.860> do<00:00:02.010> a<00:00:02.040> quick

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
in this video I'm going to do a quick

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.300 
in this video I'm going to do a quick
comparison<00:00:02.370> between<00:00:03.170> the<00:00:04.170> original<00:00:04.950> iPhone

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
comparison between the original iPhone

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.169 
comparison between the original iPhone
3G<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.150> new<00:00:06.690> iPhone<00:00:07.200> 4s<00:00:08.120> now<00:00:09.120> the

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
3G and the new iPhone 4s now the

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.990 
3G and the new iPhone 4s now the
differences<00:00:09.870> are<00:00:10.200> definitely<00:00:10.800> drastic<00:00:11.370> but<00:00:11.969> I

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
differences are definitely drastic but I

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.660 
differences are definitely drastic but I
thought<00:00:12.300> it'd<00:00:12.420> be<00:00:12.450> interesting<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:13.349> see

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
thought it'd be interesting to see

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.390 
thought it'd be interesting to see
performance<00:00:14.670> wise<00:00:15.289> how<00:00:16.289> far<00:00:16.590> Apple<00:00:17.010> has<00:00:17.130> come

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
performance wise how far Apple has come

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.519 
performance wise how far Apple has come
with<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.699> new<00:00:17.820> iPhone<00:00:18.180> 4s<00:00:18.449> on<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.050> outsides

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
with the new iPhone 4s on the outsides

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.740 
with the new iPhone 4s on the outsides
you<00:00:19.800> can<00:00:19.980> see<00:00:20.130> organically<00:00:21.060> they're<00:00:21.330> fairly

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
you can see organically they're fairly

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.060 
you can see organically they're fairly
similar

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
similar

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.160 
similar
it<00:00:23.340> hasn't<00:00:23.550> changed<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:24.029> lot<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.600> course<00:00:24.930> these

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
it hasn't changed a lot of course these

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.740 
it hasn't changed a lot of course these
were<00:00:25.380> good<00:00:25.680> enough<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.789> know<00:00:26.910> Apple

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
were good enough that you know Apple

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.330 
were good enough that you know Apple
thought<00:00:27.930> let's<00:00:28.230> continue<00:00:28.560> doing<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> same

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
thought let's continue doing it the same

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.209 
thought let's continue doing it the same

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
5 and to prove that it is a 4s I'll

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.789 
5 and to prove that it is a 4s I'll
activate<00:01:11.369> Siri<00:01:12.229> which<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:13.500> see<00:01:13.650> right

activate Siri which you can see right

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.330 
activate Siri which you can see right
there<00:01:14.900> now<00:01:15.900> I'm<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.799> do<00:01:16.920> some<00:01:17.130> quick

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
there now I'm going to do some quick

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.120 
there now I'm going to do some quick
tests<00:01:17.850> for<00:01:18.119> example<00:01:18.259> let's<00:01:19.259> try<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.650> open<00:01:19.860> up

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
tests for example let's try and open up

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.920 
tests for example let's try and open up
for<00:01:20.520> example<00:01:22.790> stocks<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.119> haven't<00:01:24.509> run<00:01:24.689> those

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
for example stocks I haven't run those

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:32.270 
for example stocks I haven't run those
on<00:01:24.960> either<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:26.330> these<00:01:27.330> phones<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> 4s

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
on either of these phones so the 4s

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.770 
on either of these phones so the 4s
opens<00:01:32.759> up<00:01:32.939> significantly<00:01:33.600> faster<00:01:33.920> let's<00:01:34.920> try

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
let's try weather let us try let's see

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.940 
let's try weather let us try let's see
the<00:02:08.550> camera<00:02:09.030> now<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.110> even<00:02:10.679> more

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
the camera now this is even more

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.430 
the camera now this is even more
improved<00:02:11.550> on<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.060> 4s<00:02:12.420> than<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.810> iPhone<00:02:13.140> 4

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
improved on the 4s than the iPhone 4

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.550 
improved on the 4s than the iPhone 4
that<00:02:17.510> opens<00:02:18.510> up<00:02:18.660> significantly<00:02:19.260> faster

that opens up significantly faster
although<00:02:20.220> not<00:02:20.580> as<00:02:20.940> fast<00:02:21.180> as<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.870> would<00:02:21.959> expect

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
although not as fast as you would expect

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.000 
although not as fast as you would expect
compared<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.160> 3G<00:02:24.319> and<00:02:25.319> when<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.530> move<00:02:25.830> these

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
compared to the 3G and when I move these

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.500 
compared to the 3G and when I move these
around<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:26.879> see<00:02:27.090> kind<00:02:27.269> of<00:02:27.390> the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
around you can see kind of the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.620 
around you can see kind of the
choppiness<00:02:29.120> with<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.269> 3G<00:02:30.980> course<00:02:31.980> its<00:02:32.630> specs

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.000 
choppiness with the 3G course its specs
are<00:02:33.840> much<00:02:33.989> lower<00:02:36.049> lastly<00:02:37.049> let's<00:02:37.260> open<00:02:37.739> up

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
are much lower lastly let's open up
