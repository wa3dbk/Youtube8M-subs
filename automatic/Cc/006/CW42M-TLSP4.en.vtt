most the time that's the only

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.420 
most the time that's the only
acceleration<00:02:10.990> that<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.350> cast<00:02:11.560> basically

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
acceleration that that cast basically

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.220 
acceleration that that cast basically
it's<00:02:12.580> haven't<00:02:12.910> rubbish<00:02:13.270> when<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.840> show<00:02:13.960> gets

running a seven price game and that's

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.930 
running a seven price game and that's
very<00:04:03.640> hard<00:04:03.820> to<00:04:04.120> catch<00:04:04.810> up<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:05.670> so<00:04:06.670> that's<00:04:06.820> it

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
very hard to catch up to so that's it

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.730 
very hard to catch up to so that's it
for<00:04:07.060> tools

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
bicycles I tend to go through this deck

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.730 
bicycles I tend to go through this deck
very<00:04:23.090> quickly<00:04:23.450> since<00:04:23.780> almost<00:04:23.960> everything<00:04:24.560> can

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
very quickly since almost everything can

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.190 
very quickly since almost everything can
be<00:04:24.830> instant<00:04:25.130> played<00:04:25.720> when<00:04:26.720> Sid<00:04:26.870> was<00:04:27.020> on<00:04:27.140> the

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
field I can play tools like that there's

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.970 
field I can play tools like that there's
lots<00:04:29.720> of<00:04:29.810> basic<00:04:30.200> so<00:04:30.320> I<00:04:30.380> can<00:04:30.530> put<00:04:30.680> him<00:04:30.740> down<00:04:30.890> her

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:30.980 
lots of basic so I can put him down her

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.430 
lots of basic so I can put him down her
away<00:04:31.160> right<00:04:31.580> away<00:04:31.990> it's<00:04:32.990> a<00:04:33.020> problem<00:04:33.320> when<00:04:33.410> I

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440

it I've mostly ran this deck because I

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
didn't go up against one they're all

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.030 
didn't go up against one they're all
pretty<00:05:40.460> good<00:05:41.320> pretty<00:05:42.320> good<00:05:42.530> matchup<00:05:42.710> against

pretty good pretty good matchup against
the<00:05:43.100> deck<00:05:43.280> mostly<00:05:43.640> because<00:05:43.760> exas<00:05:44.770> if<00:05:45.770> they

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
the deck mostly because exas if they

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.580 
the deck mostly because exas if they
want<00:05:46.250> to<00:05:46.310> attack<00:05:46.490> me<00:05:47.000> they<00:05:47.690> need<00:05:47.870> to<00:05:47.930> get<00:05:48.110> lots
