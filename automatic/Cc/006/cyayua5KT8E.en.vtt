00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
but it's also my opinion the best gun in

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.620 
but it's also my opinion the best gun in
crossfire<00:00:34.850> don't<00:00:35.850> anything<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> while<00:00:36.329> so

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
crossfire don't anything in a while so

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.619 
crossfire don't anything in a while so
it<00:00:36.719> will<00:00:36.870> probably<00:00:37.079> like<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:38.280> f-14<00:00:39.149> probably

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
it will probably like the f-14 probably

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.560 
it will probably like the f-14 probably
but<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.379> definitely<00:00:40.620> one<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.100> best

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
but this is definitely one of the best

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.459 
but this is definitely one of the best
guns<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:43.879> that's<00:00:44.879> tracted<00:00:45.450> me<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.870> just<00:00:46.020> didn't

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
guns and that's tracted me I just didn't

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.680 
guns and that's tracted me I just didn't
know<00:00:46.530> what<00:00:46.649> happened<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.539> is<00:00:48.539> definitely

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
know what happened but it is definitely

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.729 
know what happened but it is definitely
one<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.200> best<00:00:49.379> guns<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.950> crossfire<00:00:50.460> by<00:00:51.360> far

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.009 

the<00:01:02.460> power<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.940> ridiculous<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the power is ridiculous it's a

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
know it's definitely three shot now it

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.270 
know it's definitely three shot now it
has<00:01:08.759> a<00:01:08.790> bit<00:01:09.030> more<00:01:09.060> damage<00:01:09.600> making<00:01:10.409> sure<00:01:10.890> that

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
has a bit more damage making sure that

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.060 
has a bit more damage making sure that
the<00:01:11.939> when<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.479> attack<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.740> got<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the when you attack you you got the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.930 
the when you attack you you got the
pretty<00:01:14.280> shot<00:01:16.009> so<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:17.310> see<00:01:17.520> what<00:01:17.789> much

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
pretty shot so as you can see what much

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.090 
pretty shot so as you can see what much
I<00:01:18.030> would<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.270> killed<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.659> guy<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.560> did<00:01:20.070> it

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
oh it has quite at the amount of recoil

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.870 
oh it has quite at the amount of recoil
action<00:01:28.430> sometimes<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.729> just<00:01:29.850> feels<00:01:29.970> as<00:01:30.420> though

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
action sometimes it just feels as though

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.749 
action sometimes it just feels as though
it<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.289> bit<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.679> other<00:01:34.860> way<00:01:35.130> when

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
like the spray pattern is beautiful

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.919 
like the spray pattern is beautiful
because<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.310> o<00:01:53.369> say<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.119> corner<00:01:54.659> that

00:01:54.919 --> 00:01:54.929 
because it o say in this corner that

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:56.449 
because it o say in this corner that
means<00:01:55.140> if<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.440> can<00:01:55.590> get<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.310> point

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
means if you can get it to the point

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.190 
means if you can get it to the point
where<00:01:56.759> you're<00:01:57.299> actually<00:01:57.390> feel<00:01:57.690> like<00:01:57.929> right

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
where you're actually feel like right

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.990 
where you're actually feel like right
here<00:01:58.440> I'll<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.860> hitting<00:01:59.100> him<00:01:59.340> in<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.610> chest

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
here I'll be hitting him in the chest

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.930 
here I'll be hitting him in the chest
and<00:02:00.330> he<00:02:01.200> can't<00:02:01.440> do<00:02:01.560> much<00:02:01.740> about<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:02.069> cuz<00:02:02.490> he's

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
and he can't do much about it cuz he's

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:14.440 
and he can't do much about it cuz he's
very<00:02:03.390> sniper<00:02:04.190> and<00:02:05.190> whatnot

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.760 

of<00:02:15.020> course<00:02:15.230> it's<00:02:15.379> different<00:02:15.470> when<00:02:15.739> you're

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
of course it's different when you're

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.030 
of course it's different when you're
moving<00:02:15.950> but<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.730> know<00:02:17.290> Rico<00:02:18.290> it's<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.680> bit<00:02:18.830> bad

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
moving but you know Rico it's a bit bad

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.910 
moving but you know Rico it's a bit bad
but<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.730> accuracy<00:02:19.970> is<00:02:20.390> just<00:02:20.480> phenomenal<00:02:21.290> if

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
but the accuracy is just phenomenal if

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.850 
but the accuracy is just phenomenal if
you<00:02:22.129> can<00:02:22.280> first<00:02:22.690> definitely<00:02:23.690> I<00:02:23.930> feel<00:02:24.500> I've

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
you can first definitely I feel I've

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.509 
you can first definitely I feel I've
studied<00:02:25.099> it<00:02:25.400> nervous<00:02:26.030> all<00:02:26.330> day<00:02:26.390> in<00:02:26.690> case<00:02:27.489> but<00:02:28.489> I

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
studied it nervous all day in case but I

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.790 
studied it nervous all day in case but I
