00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
emotion gesture or something I thought I

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.460

this<00:01:32.310> game<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.390> way<00:01:33.509> did<00:01:33.840> not<00:01:33.869> need<00:01:34.320> most

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
this game on the way did not need most

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.740 
this game on the way did not need most
controls<00:01:35.369> at<00:01:35.579> all<00:01:35.970> they<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.360> added<00:01:36.540> it

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
controls at all they just added it

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.270 
controls at all they just added it
because<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> platform<00:01:37.619> supported

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
because like the platform supported

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.429 
because like the platform supported
there<00:01:38.400> was<00:01:38.520> really<00:01:39.030> no<00:01:39.390> need<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:40.259> my

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
there was really no need for in my

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.710 
there was really no need for in my
opinion<00:01:40.979> but<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.430> mean<00:01:41.939> games<00:01:42.150> like<00:01:42.360> Skyward

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
opinion but I mean games like Skyward

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.300 
opinion but I mean games like Skyward
Sword<00:01:42.750> for<00:01:43.200> instance<00:01:43.500> what<00:01:43.710> are<00:01:43.740> which<00:01:44.159> are

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
Sword for instance what are which are

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.950 
Sword for instance what are which are
completely<00:01:44.579> designed<00:01:44.880> around<00:01:45.090> using<00:01:45.810> motion

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
completely designed around using motion

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.690 
completely designed around using motion
controls<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.500> stuff<00:01:46.649> like<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.340> that's

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
controls and stuff like that like that's

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.039 
controls and stuff like that like that's
perfectly<00:01:47.970> fine<00:01:48.210> if<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.509> ask<00:01:48.720> me<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
perfectly fine if you ask me like the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:49.880 
perfectly fine if you ask me like the
motion<00:01:49.170> controls<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.590> Skyward<00:01:49.860> Sword

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
motion controls in Skyward Sword

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.679 
motion controls in Skyward Sword
probably<00:01:50.790> some<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.119> best<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.509> way<00:01:51.659> I

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
probably some of the best on the way I

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.719 
probably some of the best on the way I
mean<00:01:51.810> occasionally<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.579> some

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
mean occasionally you can have some

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.980

need<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.140> recalibrate<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.890> every<00:01:56.070> now<00:01:56.219> and

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
need to recalibrate in every now and

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.850 
need to recalibrate in every now and
again<00:01:56.460> but<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.119> mean<00:01:57.420> from<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.600> most<00:01:57.810> part<00:01:58.110> it

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
again but I mean from the most part it

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.709 
again but I mean from the most part it
was<00:01:59.009> pretty<00:01:59.250> fluid<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.909> worked<00:02:00.090> pretty

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
was pretty fluid and it worked pretty

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.530 
was pretty fluid and it worked pretty
darn<00:02:01.049> well<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.680> mean<00:02:02.219> just<00:02:03.119> don't<00:02:03.270> get<00:02:03.420> him

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
darn well I mean just don't get him

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.149 
darn well I mean just don't get him
didn't<00:02:03.780> really<00:02:03.930> need<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.740> took<00:02:04.950> away

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
didn't really need it and it took away

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.410 
didn't really need it and it took away
from<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.460> experience<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.939> game<00:02:06.090> if<00:02:06.390> you

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
from the experience of the game if you

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.740 
from the experience of the game if you
had

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750

banana every banana counts man no banana
left<00:02:14.220> behind<00:02:14.520> I'm<00:02:14.850> pretty<00:02:15.090> sure<00:02:15.210> I've<00:02:15.330> already

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
left behind I'm pretty sure I've already

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.620 
left behind I'm pretty sure I've already
missed<00:02:15.810> quite<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.620> bit<00:02:16.860> of<00:02:17.010> bananas<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:17.850> those

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
coins as I can cuz like I said you can

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.870

use<00:02:27.270> them<00:02:27.450> in<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:28.100> cranky<00:02:29.100> shops<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.670> buy

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
use them in the cranky shops to buy

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.730 
use them in the cranky shops to buy
things<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.570> there's<00:02:30.959> one<00:02:31.200> thing<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.530> do<00:02:31.590> buy

it<00:02:31.770> in<00:02:32.040> each<00:02:32.250> world<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.760> think<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.180> actually

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
it in each world I think to actually

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.480 
it in each world I think to actually
access<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.959> certain<00:02:34.260> area<00:02:34.410> looks<00:02:35.100> like<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.280> key

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
access the certain area looks like a key

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.710 
access the certain area looks like a key
or<00:02:35.520> something<00:02:35.850> I<00:02:35.880> need<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.090> buy<00:02:36.300> if<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.510> remember

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
or something I need to buy if I remember

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.570 
or something I need to buy if I remember
correctly<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.230> we're<00:02:37.860> gonna<00:02:37.950> save<00:02:38.280> up<00:02:38.459> for

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
correctly so we're gonna save up for

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.800 
correctly so we're gonna save up for
those<00:02:38.700> I'm<00:02:38.880> not<00:02:38.910> sure<00:02:39.209> exactly<00:02:39.480> how<00:02:39.660> much

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
those I'm not sure exactly how much

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.080 
those I'm not sure exactly how much
those<00:02:39.989> cost<00:02:40.020> per<00:02:40.560> world<00:02:40.890> right<00:02:41.730> over<00:02:41.880> here
