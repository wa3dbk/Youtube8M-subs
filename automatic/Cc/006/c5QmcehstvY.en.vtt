not<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.800> doesn't<00:00:52.829> work<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:54.140> you<00:00:55.140> know

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
even when both of the games come out I

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.760 
even when both of the games come out I
don't<00:00:57.420> even<00:00:57.510> think<00:00:57.629> one<00:00:58.050> game<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.530> can

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
don't even think one game I can

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.220 
don't even think one game I can
definitively<00:00:59.100> say<00:00:59.489> will<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.230> massively

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
definitively say will be massively

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.590 
definitively say will be massively
better<00:01:01.530> than<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> other<00:01:01.949> game<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.699> that's<00:01:03.390> my

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
better than the other game so that's my

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.660 
better than the other game so that's my
opinion<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.350> I'm<00:01:04.830> sticking<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.400> and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
opinion on it and I'm sticking to it and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.820 
opinion on it and I'm sticking to it and
if<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.090> don't<00:01:06.270> agree<00:01:06.360> with<00:01:06.510> me<00:01:06.750> then<00:01:07.049> that's

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
if you don't agree with me then that's

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.320 
if you don't agree with me then that's
your<00:01:08.070> problem<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.500> have<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.740> few<00:01:10.979> criteria

is singular and plural it's the same
thing<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:19.259> think<00:01:19.350> criteria<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.490> or<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.090> it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180

there's<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.930> few<00:01:24.990> criterias<00:01:25.830> maybe<00:01:26.490> it's

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
there's a few criterias maybe it's

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.700 
there's a few criterias maybe it's
criterias<00:01:27.090> who<00:01:27.299> cares<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.750> few<00:01:28.380> things<00:01:28.530> that

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
criterias who cares a few things that

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.550 
criterias who cares a few things that
I'm<00:01:28.799> going<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:29.009> talking<00:01:29.250> about<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.560> first

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
I'm going to be talking about and first

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.649 
I'm going to be talking about and first
off<00:01:31.799> which<00:01:32.490> game<00:01:32.700> do<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:32.939> think<00:01:33.210> will<00:01:33.329> be<00:01:33.450> more

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
off which game do I think will be more

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.160 
off which game do I think will be more
fun<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:35.450> just<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.630> Tom<00:01:36.869> my<00:01:37.020> head

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
fun and I just have to Tom my head

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.390 
fun and I just have to Tom my head
looking<00:01:37.409> at<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.590> trailers<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.040> think<00:01:38.250> modern

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
looking at the trailers I think modern

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.060 
looking at the trailers I think modern
warfare<00:01:38.610> 3<00:01:38.790> will<00:01:39.180> be<00:01:39.320> just<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.409> little<00:01:40.439> more<00:01:40.680> fun

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
warfare 3 will be just a little more fun

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.969 
warfare 3 will be just a little more fun
for<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.700> few<00:01:41.970> reasons<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.750> first<00:01:43.170> off<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.740> maps

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
for a few reasons and first off the maps

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.770 
for a few reasons and first off the maps
are<00:01:44.189> more<00:01:44.369> condensed<00:01:44.880> they're<00:01:45.180> smaller<00:01:45.540> and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
are more condensed they're smaller and

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.200 
are more condensed they're smaller and
that<00:01:46.619> means<00:01:46.799> less<00:01:47.100> time<00:01:47.130> running<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.060> where

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
that means less time running to where

mono warfare 3 if you didn't know that

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.770 
mono warfare 3 if you didn't know that
already<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:05.759> know<00:02:05.880> there<00:02:06.210> isn't<00:02:06.600> any

kind<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.140> system<00:02:07.469> like<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:07.920> mont<00:02:08.160> and

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
kind of system like that in mont and

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.890 
kind of system like that in mont and
battlefield<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:10.020> may<00:02:10.200> think

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
battlefield so you may think

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.530 
battlefield so you may think
it's<00:02:12.900> just<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.260> little<00:02:13.590> less<00:02:14.550> fast-paced<00:02:15.300> in

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
it's just a little less fast-paced in

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.940 
it's just a little less fast-paced in
battlefield<00:02:15.989> because<00:02:16.140> you're<00:02:16.379> not<00:02:16.530> striving

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
battlefield because you're not striving

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.000 
battlefield because you're not striving
towards<00:02:17.430> some<00:02:18.239> kind<00:02:18.420> of<00:02:18.480> personal<00:02:19.050> point

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
towards some kind of personal point

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.130 
towards some kind of personal point
streak<00:02:20.489> but<00:02:21.090> you're<00:02:21.239> working<00:02:21.420> more<00:02:21.750> as<00:02:21.840> a<00:02:21.870> team

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
streak but you're working more as a team

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.690 
streak but you're working more as a team
which<00:02:22.379> isn't<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.709> bad<00:02:22.739> thing<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:23.370> praised

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
which isn't a bad thing I praised

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.030 
which isn't a bad thing I praised
battlefield<00:02:24.300> for<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.629> but<00:02:24.930> modern<00:02:25.860> warfare

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
battlefield for that but modern warfare

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.190 
battlefield for that but modern warfare
3<00:02:26.250> is<00:02:26.519> coming<00:02:26.760> back<00:02:26.910> with<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.390> new<00:02:27.599> system<00:02:28.019> of

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
3 is coming back with that new system of

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.440 
3 is coming back with that new system of
point<00:02:28.470> streak<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:29.090> what<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.239> does<00:02:30.390> is

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
point streak and what that does is

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.630 
point streak and what that does is
incorporates<00:02:31.170> your<00:02:32.030> objectives<00:02:33.030> with<00:02:33.840> your

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
incorporates your objectives with your

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.759 
incorporates your objectives with your
killing<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.989> every<00:02:36.989> time<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.349> kill<00:02:37.530> someone

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
killing and every time you kill someone

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.589 
killing and every time you kill someone
you<00:02:37.890> get<00:02:38.129> certain<00:02:38.370> amount<00:02:38.610> of<00:02:38.640> points<00:02:38.849> and

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
you get certain amount of points and

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.850 
you get certain amount of points and
every<00:02:39.750> time<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.930> capture<00:02:40.319> an<00:02:40.410> objective<00:02:40.830> you

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
every time you capture an objective you

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.140 
every time you capture an objective you
get<00:02:41.129> a<00:02:41.160> certain<00:02:41.340> amount<00:02:41.489> of<00:02:41.700> points<00:02:41.849> and<00:02:42.090> they

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
get a certain amount of points and they

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.640 
get a certain amount of points and they
all<00:02:42.330> build<00:02:42.510> up<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.810> points<00:02:43.230> drink<00:02:43.500> instead

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
all build up to a points drink instead

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.039 
all build up to a points drink instead
of<00:02:43.860> just<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.130> kill<00:02:44.340> streak<00:02:44.459> which<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.569> a<00:02:45.599> great

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
of just a kill streak which is a great

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.410 
of just a kill streak which is a great
system<00:02:46.500> i<00:02:46.650> praise<00:02:47.120> Infinity<00:02:48.120> Ward<00:02:48.299> and

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
system i praise Infinity Ward and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.610 
system i praise Infinity Ward and
sledgehammer<00:02:48.870> for<00:02:49.140> putting<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.410> into

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
sledgehammer for putting that into

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.220 
sledgehammer for putting that into
modern<00:02:49.860> warfare<00:02:50.010> 3<00:02:50.130> but<00:02:50.959> anyways<00:02:51.959> enough

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
modern warfare 3 but anyways enough

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.780 
modern warfare 3 but anyways enough
about<00:02:52.319> that<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.829> think<00:02:53.040> modern<00:02:53.190> warfare<00:02:53.400> 3<00:02:53.549> will

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
about that I think modern warfare 3 will

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.300 
about that I think modern warfare 3 will
be<00:02:53.849> a<00:02:53.940> little<00:02:54.090> more<00:02:54.239> fun<00:02:54.480> next<00:02:55.440> which<00:02:56.010> will<00:02:56.190> be

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
be a little more fun next which will be

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.400 
be a little more fun next which will be
the<00:02:56.430> better<00:02:56.610> game<00:02:56.819> in<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:57.000> long<00:02:57.150> run<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.540> I'm

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
the better game in the long run and I'm

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.280 
the better game in the long run and I'm
gonna<00:02:58.590> go<00:02:58.739> with<00:02:58.860> battlefield<00:02:59.220> 3<00:02:59.670> on<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.660> few

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
gonna go with battlefield 3 on a few

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.490 
gonna go with battlefield 3 on a few
reasons<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:02.209> modern<00:03:03.209> warfare<00:03:03.360> 3<00:03:03.510> first<00:03:04.349> of<00:03:04.470> all

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
reasons so modern warfare 3 first of all

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.530 
reasons so modern warfare 3 first of all
modern<00:03:04.769> warfare<00:03:04.890> two<00:03:05.190> had<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.489> ton<00:03:05.940> of<00:03:05.970> exploits

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
modern warfare two had a ton of exploits

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.300 
modern warfare two had a ton of exploits
the<00:03:06.720> Infinity<00:03:07.200> Ward<00:03:07.410> did<00:03:07.590> not<00:03:07.709> support<00:03:08.099> and

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
the Infinity Ward did not support and

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.449 
the Infinity Ward did not support and
they<00:03:08.489> wouldn't<00:03:08.790> support<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:10.129> they<00:03:11.129> just<00:03:11.280> had

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
they wouldn't support and they just had

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.339 
they wouldn't support and they just had
horrible<00:03:11.819> support<00:03:12.480> that's<00:03:12.750> that's<00:03:13.079> about<00:03:13.319> it

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
horrible support that's that's about it

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.870 
horrible support that's that's about it
and<00:03:13.829> those<00:03:14.819> exploits<00:03:15.299> made<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.780> game<00:03:15.959> unfun

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
and those exploits made the game unfun

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.900 
and those exploits made the game unfun
unfair<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:18.209> just<00:03:19.139> overall<00:03:19.910> extremely

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
unfair and just overall extremely

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.440 
unfair and just overall extremely
extremely<00:03:21.799> annoying<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:23.280> rage<00:03:23.670> inducing<00:03:23.910> and

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
extremely annoying and rage inducing and

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.349 
extremely annoying and rage inducing and
so<00:03:25.220> battlefield<00:03:26.220> bad<00:03:26.370> company<00:03:26.489> 2<00:03:26.819> does<00:03:27.150> have

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
so battlefield bad company 2 does have

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.640 
so battlefield bad company 2 does have
its<00:03:27.510> faults<00:03:27.690> but<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.470> lot<00:03:28.739> less<00:03:29.180> so<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.510> think<00:03:30.989> the

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
its faults but a lot less so I think the

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.449 
its faults but a lot less so I think the
trend<00:03:32.069> is<00:03:32.220> going<00:03:32.280> to<00:03:32.430> stay<00:03:32.639> the<00:03:32.730> same<00:03:32.940> and

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
trend is going to stay the same and

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.979 
trend is going to stay the same and
excuse<00:03:35.459> me<00:03:35.609> I<00:03:35.639> just<00:03:35.849> had<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:35.970> big<00:03:36.420> in<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.900> out

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
excuse me I just had a big in and out

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.589 
excuse me I just had a big in and out
burger<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:38.060> just<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.120> little<00:03:39.239> bit<00:03:39.480> of

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
burger and just a little bit of

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.520 
burger and just a little bit of
indigestion<00:03:40.410> going<00:03:41.340> on<00:03:41.430> anyway<00:03:41.819> so<00:03:42.169> yeah<00:03:43.169> I

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
indigestion going on anyway so yeah I

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.199 
indigestion going on anyway so yeah I
think<00:03:43.680> battlefield<00:03:44.310> 3<00:03:44.549> will<00:03:44.760> be<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.060> better

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
think battlefield 3 will be the better

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.470 
think battlefield 3 will be the better
game<00:03:45.480> in<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.810> long<00:03:45.989> run<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:47.090> next<00:03:48.090> which<00:03:48.269> game

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
game in the long run and next which game

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.809 
game in the long run and next which game
will<00:03:48.660> be<00:03:48.810> more<00:03:49.230> frustrating<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.609> want<00:03:50.790> to

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
will be more frustrating and I want to

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.460 
will be more frustrating and I want to
say<00:03:51.030> that<00:03:51.239> modern<00:03:51.480> warfare<00:03:51.630> 3<00:03:51.810> will<00:03:52.079> be<00:03:52.169> more

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
say that modern warfare 3 will be more

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.839 
say that modern warfare 3 will be more
frustrating<00:03:52.950> for<00:03:53.069> the<00:03:53.160> same<00:03:53.340> reason<00:03:53.370> and

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
frustrating for the same reason and

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.180 
frustrating for the same reason and
that's<00:03:54.450> because<00:03:54.660> of<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.169> exploits<00:03:55.829> and

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
that's because of the exploits and

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.400 
that's because of the exploits and
things<00:03:56.639> that<00:03:56.880> generally<00:03:57.239> Infinity<00:03:58.019> Ward<00:03:58.230> has

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
things that generally Infinity Ward has

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.470 
things that generally Infinity Ward has
a<00:03:58.440> horrible<00:03:58.889> track<00:03:59.190> record<00:03:59.400> for<00:03:59.639> and<00:04:00.090> they

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
a horrible track record for and they

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.289 
a horrible track record for and they
just<00:04:00.690> don't<00:04:00.900> support<00:04:01.380> their<00:04:01.590> games<00:04:01.799> and<00:04:02.299> you

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
just don't support their games and you

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.789 
just don't support their games and you
know<00:04:03.450> there's<00:04:03.660> supposed<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:03.930> be<00:04:03.989> a<00:04:04.079> trend<00:04:04.410> that

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
know there's supposed to be a trend that

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.580 
know there's supposed to be a trend that
they're<00:04:05.519> going<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:05.790> start<00:04:06.090> caring<00:04:06.840> about<00:04:06.989> the

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
they're going to start caring about the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.110 
they're going to start caring about the
game<00:04:07.889> after<00:04:08.700> launch<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:10.700> you<00:04:11.700> know<00:04:11.790> release

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
game after launch and you know release

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.080 
game after launch and you know release
patches<00:04:12.690> to<00:04:12.840> fix<00:04:13.139> stuff<00:04:13.859> and<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.609> know<00:04:14.639> get<00:04:14.940> to

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
patches to fix stuff and you know get to

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.000 
patches to fix stuff and you know get to
it<00:04:15.209> fast<00:04:15.419> like<00:04:15.870> treyarch<00:04:16.320> is<00:04:16.470> done<00:04:16.650> with<00:04:16.829> black

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
it fast like treyarch is done with black

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.810 
it fast like treyarch is done with black
ops<00:04:17.250> but<00:04:18.120> that<00:04:18.840> r<00:04:18.870> yet<00:04:19.709> remains<00:04:20.039> to<00:04:20.190> be<00:04:20.219> seen<00:04:20.519> so

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
ops but that r yet remains to be seen so

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.430 
ops but that r yet remains to be seen so
that's<00:04:20.969> why<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:21.209> think<00:04:21.570> battlefield<00:04:22.349> 3<00:04:22.590> will

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
that's why I think battlefield 3 will

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.590 
that's why I think battlefield 3 will
be<00:04:25.440> a<00:04:25.470> little<00:04:25.710> more<00:04:25.949> frustrating<00:04:26.610> I'm<00:04:27.060> sorry<00:04:27.539> a

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
be a little more frustrating I'm sorry a

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.779 
be a little more frustrating I'm sorry a
little<00:04:27.900> less<00:04:28.110> frustrating<00:04:28.800> than<00:04:28.919> modern

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
little less frustrating than modern

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.770 
little less frustrating than modern
warfare<00:04:29.970> 3<00:04:30.150> so<00:04:30.780> less<00:04:31.110> raging<00:04:31.650> more<00:04:31.979> plain<00:04:32.780> so

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
warfare 3 so less raging more plain so

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.010 
warfare 3 so less raging more plain so
yeah<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.979> next<00:04:35.310> which<00:04:35.789> game<00:04:36.090> do<00:04:36.539> I<00:04:36.569> think

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
yeah and next which game do I think

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.580 
yeah and next which game do I think
we'll<00:04:37.650> have<00:04:37.889> the<00:04:38.340> most<00:04:38.520> replay<00:04:38.940> value<00:04:39.090> and

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
we'll have the most replay value and

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.800 
we'll have the most replay value and
just<00:04:40.590> from<00:04:41.000> experiencing<00:04:42.000> both<00:04:42.180> battlefield

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
just from experiencing both battlefield

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.270 
just from experiencing both battlefield
bad<00:04:43.319> company<00:04:43.530> 2<00:04:43.979> and<00:04:45.860> I'll<00:04:46.860> just<00:04:47.009> give<00:04:47.160> you<00:04:47.190> my

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.029 
background of both of the game so far
probably<00:04:49.050> should<00:04:49.259> have<00:04:49.319> said<00:04:49.470> this<00:04:49.590> near<00:04:49.979> the

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
probably should have said this near the

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.080 
probably should have said this near the
beginning<00:04:50.220> but<00:04:50.639> oh<00:04:50.849> well<00:04:51.389> spilt<00:04:51.810> milk<00:04:52.020> anyways

as<00:05:23.220> far<00:05:23.370> as<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.580> replay<00:05:23.970> value<00:05:24.150> I've<00:05:25.020> played

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
as far as the replay value I've played

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.439 
as far as the replay value I've played
battlefield<00:05:26.069> 4<00:05:26.699> I<00:05:27.530> have<00:05:28.639> almost<00:05:29.639> two<00:05:30.000> days<00:05:30.210> of

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
battlefield 4 I have almost two days of

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.300 
battlefield 4 I have almost two days of
gameplay<00:05:30.840> on<00:05:31.080> battlefield<00:05:31.590> bad<00:05:31.740> company<00:05:31.919> 2

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
gameplay on battlefield bad company 2

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.850 
gameplay on battlefield bad company 2
whereas<00:05:33.150> I<00:05:33.330> play<00:05:33.570> basically<00:05:33.840> all<00:05:34.530> the<00:05:34.740> other

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
whereas I play basically all the other

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.300 
whereas I play basically all the other
cards<00:05:35.310> infinitely<00:05:36.000> a<00:05:36.300> ton<00:05:36.930> more<00:05:37.139> times<00:05:37.409> but

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
cards infinitely a ton more times but

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.189 
cards infinitely a ton more times but
not<00:05:38.699> infinitely<00:05:39.120> but<00:05:39.449> you<00:05:39.539> know<00:05:39.659> a<00:05:39.840> lot<00:05:40.139> more

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
not infinitely but you know a lot more

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.730 
not infinitely but you know a lot more
so<00:05:41.159> i<00:05:41.509> would<00:05:42.509> say<00:05:42.750> in<00:05:42.990> a<00:05:43.050> long<00:05:43.229> run<00:05:43.469> modern

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
so i would say in a long run modern

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.320 
so i would say in a long run modern
warfare<00:05:43.889> 3<00:05:44.070> will<00:05:44.520> have<00:05:44.699> a<00:05:44.729> little<00:05:45.000> bit<00:05:45.180> more

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
warfare 3 will have a little bit more

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.480 
warfare 3 will have a little bit more
replay<00:05:45.719> value<00:05:45.870> just<00:05:46.289> just<00:05:47.039> because<00:05:47.310> I<00:05:47.340> play

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
replay value just just because I play

blah<00:05:58.349> blah<00:05:58.530> blah<00:05:58.560> if<00:05:58.979> I'd<00:05:59.159> play<00:05:59.370> battlefield

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
blah blah blah if I'd play battlefield

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:01.129 
blah blah blah if I'd play battlefield
before<00:05:59.940> i'm<00:06:00.240> sure<00:06:00.449> my<00:06:00.599> opinion<00:06:00.960> would<00:06:01.080> be

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
before i'm sure my opinion would be

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.260 
before i'm sure my opinion would be
different<00:06:01.590> but<00:06:01.740> it<00:06:02.370> is<00:06:02.520> what<00:06:02.759> it<00:06:02.789> is<00:06:02.880> and

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
different but it is what it is and

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.930 
different but it is what it is and
that's<00:06:03.930> my<00:06:04.080> opinion<00:06:04.289> so<00:06:04.740> as<00:06:05.460> far<00:06:05.639> as<00:06:05.699> you<00:06:05.820> can

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
that's my opinion so as far as you can

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.180 
that's my opinion so as far as you can
tell<00:06:06.210> it's<00:06:06.930> split<00:06:07.169> down<00:06:07.289> the<00:06:07.349> middle<00:06:07.590> for<00:06:07.710> me<00:06:08.009> I

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
tell it's split down the middle for me I

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.709 
tell it's split down the middle for me I
think<00:06:08.639> modern<00:06:08.789> warfare<00:06:08.969> 3<00:06:09.150> will<00:06:09.389> be<00:06:09.479> a<00:06:09.509> little

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:09.719 
think modern warfare 3 will be a little

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:12.320 
think modern warfare 3 will be a little
more<00:06:09.840> fun<00:06:10.139> I<00:06:10.380> think<00:06:11.159> battlefield<00:06:11.669> 3<00:06:12.090> will<00:06:12.240> be

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
more fun I think battlefield 3 will be

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.300 
more fun I think battlefield 3 will be
the<00:06:12.449> better<00:06:12.599> game<00:06:12.930> in<00:06:12.960> the<00:06:13.259> long<00:06:13.440> run<00:06:13.469> and<00:06:14.219> I

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
the better game in the long run and I

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.070 
the better game in the long run and I
think<00:06:14.580> it'll<00:06:14.759> be<00:06:14.909> less<00:06:15.240> frustrating<00:06:15.960> than

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
think it'll be less frustrating than

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.529 
think it'll be less frustrating than
modern<00:06:16.349> warfare<00:06:16.469> 3<00:06:16.650> but<00:06:17.490> I<00:06:17.520> think<00:06:17.909> that<00:06:17.969> Morrow

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539 
modern warfare 3 but I think that Morrow

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:20.870 
modern warfare 3 but I think that Morrow
for<00:06:18.630> three<00:06:18.810> will<00:06:19.259> have<00:06:20.099> a<00:06:20.130> little<00:06:20.430> more<00:06:20.550> replay

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
for three will have a little more replay

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.399 
for three will have a little more replay
value<00:06:21.090> so<00:06:21.830> anyways<00:06:22.830> guys<00:06:22.979> I<00:06:23.370> also<00:06:24.060> think<00:06:24.630> I<00:06:25.020> am

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409 
value so anyways guys I also think I am

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:27.110 
value so anyways guys I also think I am
way<00:06:25.680> more<00:06:25.710> hyped<00:06:26.130> up<00:06:26.310> for<00:06:26.370> modern<00:06:26.789> warfare<00:06:26.940> 3

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
way more hyped up for modern warfare 3

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.300 
way more hyped up for modern warfare 3

i'm a fan of both games and i'm going to
buy<00:06:29.460> both<00:06:29.789> games<00:06:30.120> when<00:06:30.300> they<00:06:30.389> come<00:06:30.570> out<00:06:30.599> but

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
buy both games when they come out but

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.350 
buy both games when they come out but
modern<00:06:31.139> warfare<00:06:31.289> 3<00:06:31.500> has<00:06:31.800> l<00:06:31.979> i'm<00:06:32.729> so<00:06:33.180> excited

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
modern warfare 3 has l i'm so excited

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.500 
modern warfare 3 has l i'm so excited
for<00:06:33.779> it<00:06:34.050> in<00:06:34.310> comparison<00:06:35.310> to<00:06:35.610> battlefield<00:06:36.270> 3<00:06:36.479> i

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
for it in comparison to battlefield 3 i

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.129 
for it in comparison to battlefield 3 i
just<00:06:36.839> think<00:06:36.990> it's

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 
just think it's

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:38.689 
just think it's
game<00:06:37.319> that<00:06:37.499> you<00:06:37.560> can't<00:06:37.800> get<00:06:38.009> is<00:06:38.219> hyped<00:06:38.490> up

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:38.699 
game that you can't get is hyped up

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:41.989 
game that you can't get is hyped up
about<00:06:39.770> once<00:06:40.770> again<00:06:40.860> from<00:06:41.219> my<00:06:41.370> standpoint<00:06:41.729> I

00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:41.999 
about once again from my standpoint I

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:44.059 
about once again from my standpoint I
don't<00:06:42.180> think<00:06:42.330> I<00:06:42.509> get<00:06:42.870> as<00:06:42.960> hyped<00:06:43.530> up<00:06:43.680> about<00:06:43.800> it

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:44.069 
don't think I get as hyped up about it

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:46.399 
don't think I get as hyped up about it
just<00:06:44.219> because<00:06:44.430> it's<00:06:45.360> not<00:06:45.539> that<00:06:45.599> kind<00:06:45.870> of<00:06:45.960> kind

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:46.409 
just because it's not that kind of kind

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:48.860 
just because it's not that kind of kind
of<00:06:46.620> game<00:06:46.830> it's<00:06:47.129> not<00:06:47.310> extremely<00:06:48.120> action-packed
