 more affordable entry model called

 nintendo 2 of that on this occasion not 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.590
 It has the functionality of displaying 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.900
 three- dimensional images in your 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.700

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.700
 We will show the new model of 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.069
 Nintendo 2 console is the new 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.470
 member of the consoles family of 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.690
 nintendo 3ds that as you can see 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.150
 Well, it brings a lot of differences with 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.590
 with respect to the previous models and 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.420
 right now we are going to detail you as the 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.430
 first obviously and the one that jumps to 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.519
 the view is that it is a model of 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.840
 a single piece and that does not do not bend 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.090
 in half as was spoken in the 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.760
 previous models of console is 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.860
 all in one in the same piece 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.190
 top screen touch screen 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.910
 lower here in the crosshead that is the 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.110
 crosshead in the steering control 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.150
 buttons 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.940
 select button and be in this 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.060
 occasion is put here on the side 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.640
 power button the home button here 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.790
 down another change is maintained with 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.820
 with respect to the previous model that in this 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.340
 occasion only brings a speaker and sound 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.780
 it's the monkey if we want to enjoy 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.190
 stereo sound we have to make use of 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.500
 the headphone jack that we can 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.450
 find here at the bottom the 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.880
 triggers as you can see here 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.820
 are a little wider because the 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.510
 console goes like a wedge-shaped 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.670
 less to more in wedge shape and the 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.830
 buttons the linnets has here then a 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.240
 a little bit wider are pretty enough 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.710
 comfortable when using them 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.970
 on this side we can also 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.780
 find the stylus 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.780
 to the touch screen 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.690
 the sd card slot this time 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.099
 comes with a 4 gig card 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.620
 included and here then the port for 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.599
 nds 3ds cartridges in this 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.040
 occasion the console as it is totally 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:12.000
 compatible with all games 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.769
 nintendo 3ds with the difference that no 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.989
 they look in three dimensions as you can 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.570
 appreciate in the back includes the 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:20.579
 two cameras to take pictures in 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.389
 three dimensions even if they do not show 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.460
 in three dimensions 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.530
 loses the regulator evidently with 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.889
 with respect to the original 3ds model or the 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.050
 xl but lets allows us to take those 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.699
 photos in three dimensions is that the 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.389
 console since nintendo has put some 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:39.370
 official cases to wear it as 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.249
 You see, they're kind of a case 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.660
 cds case the size of one's own 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:45.460
 console 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.680
 and well they are very comfortable and in this 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.900
 highly recommended case to transport it 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.000
 because the screens are a little more 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.830
 exposed that in previous models that 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.340
 they went and they go closed set the 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:00.160
 console profile now 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.480
 the internet connection and so on is that 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.180
 We have a kind of small tutorial 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.240
 who can offer us advice 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.400
 on the console and others and has a mode 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.639
 sleep than in the previous model of 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.650
 console 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.479
 we did it by closing the console 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.270
 directly to put it in sleep mode 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.520
 we closed the console on this occasion to 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.689
 do not have a hinge we do it with this 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.059
 small button this small 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:27.769
 little button that you have here you will appreciate a 

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:32.629
 little difference in sizes of the 

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:35.739
 3ds xl screen in this case and the 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:35.739
 2 s model
