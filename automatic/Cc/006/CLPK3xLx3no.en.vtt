 hello again with you today we are going to 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.490
 prepare lemon chicken 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.090
 make the chicken we will need 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.630
 chicken 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.170
 a glass of chicken broth one 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.120
 teaspoon cornstarch 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.989
 flour 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.360
 sesame oil failing I go 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.540
 to put I have done a marinade with 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.780
 sesame and oil 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.630
 of sunflower we will also have 4 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.390
 teaspoons lemon juice 4 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.470
 teaspoons of sugar 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.530
 teaspoons of apple vinegar a 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.280
 little piece of salt cornstarch as a 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.940
 teaspoonful 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.530
 soybean with this we would have enough to 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.570
 make chicken in lemon 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.240
 first let's cut the chicken 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.990
 as in two we will open and cut 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.990
 with a patch 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.090
 and with this we are going to do two more 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.440
 well in half 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.329
 and in a container 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.329
 what we will do 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.740
 I'm fine is to be like two people 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.640
 approximately I will spend breast and 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.770
 half 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.780
 I'm going to put another little bit more so that 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.340
 make an idea you're breasts are very 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.869
 great as well as with one and a half 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.120
 we will have enough for two 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.120
 now we will put the soy sauce 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.469
 and we will put the oil with the seeds 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.359
 of sesame or sesame I also tell you that 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.340
 there is sesame oil that is already coming 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:25.930
 prepared is much easier but I 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.920
 I'm keeping something like a couple of days 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:33.000
 before and now we are going to put here 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.580
 we're going to let it marinate like a few 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.410
 20 or 30 euros 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.860
 after that time we go back and 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.860
 we follow 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.930
 now we removed this 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.810
 and we will remove the breast that we had 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.840
 macerating already for half an hour here what 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.840
 let's wrap 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.150
 with the tempura that we have already made 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.090
 and in a pan that we have already heated 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.489
 We'll fry the oil, I think the 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.780
 oil is already warm now now 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.780
 we put the chicken 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.220
 we will go and when it is golden we can 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.350
 remove 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.480
 ah 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.420
 once golden on both sides 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.930
 we removed it and we started making the sauce 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.930
 lemon 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.209
 for the sauce we're going to need 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.290
 the juice of half a lemon that are about 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.320
 four teaspoons 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:47.390
 also 4 teaspoons of sugar 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.390
 3 apple cider vinegar 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.860
 a pinch of salt 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.700
 yes 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.760
 and the teaspoon 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.400
 of cornstarch 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.400
 this is to thicken the sauce 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.810
 stir feel that you are 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.450
 Once we have it, we will explain how you are going 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:23.950
 and fighting a little less 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.950
 of sauce we want to make 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.759
 here we have the broth 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.009
 with these 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:33.009
 ah 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.080
 this is going to happen to a cazuelita and 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.970
 we are going to thicken it 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.069
 well then having been with 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.340
 the four minutes is the texture that 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:50.110
 we wish a little exquisite this what 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.400
 we can put in any kind of 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.530
 meat either today or pork or veal 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.300
 Well I hope you liked a 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.300
 kiss very strong chao
