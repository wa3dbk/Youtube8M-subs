back in the capital to recycle it not a
waster<00:05:38.830> waste<00:05:39.370> heat<00:05:39.670> I<00:05:39.940> look<00:05:40.540> back<00:05:40.630> at<00:05:40.720> the

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
waster waste heat I look back at the

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.630 
waster waste heat I look back at the
capital<00:05:41.080> so<00:05:41.350> it<00:05:41.530> takes<00:05:41.740> less<00:05:41.950> time<00:05:41.980> to<00:05:42.220> on<00:05:42.460> your

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
capital so it takes less time to on your

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.440 
capital so it takes less time to on your
kettle<00:05:42.910> next<00:05:43.120> time

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
kettle next time

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.030 
kettle next time
Seyed<00:05:43.810> energy<00:05:44.460> so<00:05:45.630> I'm<00:05:46.630> gonna<00:05:46.780> plunge<00:05:47.710> the

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
Seyed energy so I'm gonna plunge the

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.470 
Seyed energy so I'm gonna plunge the
plunger<00:05:48.580> down<00:05:48.610> on<00:05:48.880> the<00:05:48.940> cavity<00:05:49.360> air<00:05:49.800> slowly

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
plunger down on the cavity air slowly

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.140 
plunger down on the cavity air slowly
now<00:05:52.480> I<00:05:52.750> like<00:05:52.990> to<00:05:53.020> filter<00:05:53.380> my<00:05:53.850> cafeteria<00:05:54.850> coffee
