00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
of balls too so yeah overall I was very

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.979 
of balls too so yeah overall I was very
impressed<00:01:02.940> with<00:01:03.180> him<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.480> haven't<00:01:03.840> actually

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
impressed with him I haven't actually

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.230 
impressed with him I haven't actually
tried<00:01:04.409> out<00:01:04.619> Casillas<00:01:05.100> yes<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.760> can't<00:01:06.150> really

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
tried out Casillas yes so I can't really

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.300 
tried out Casillas yes so I can't really
give<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> comparison<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.560> honestly<00:01:07.830> can't

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
give a comparison but I honestly can't

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.859 
give a comparison but I honestly can't
imagine<00:01:08.400> Casillas<00:01:09.090> being<00:01:09.330> not<00:01:09.479> much<00:01:09.659> better

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
imagine Casillas being not much better

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.590 
imagine Casillas being not much better
just<00:01:10.080> because<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.530> how<00:01:10.710> good<00:01:11.240> courtois<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.420> and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
just because of how good courtois is and

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.240 
just because of how good courtois is and
if<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.780> haven't<00:01:13.020> tried<00:01:13.110> him<00:01:13.350> out<00:01:13.409> I'd<00:01:13.740> imagine

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
if you haven't tried him out I'd imagine

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.490 
if you haven't tried him out I'd imagine
he's<00:01:14.280> keeper<00:01:14.790> sorry<00:01:15.450> keeper<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.990> imagine<00:01:16.380> he's

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
he's keeper sorry keeper I imagine he's

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.370 
he's keeper sorry keeper I imagine he's
cheaper<00:01:16.920> than<00:01:17.100> Kurt<00:01:17.340> than<00:01:17.850> Casillas<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.170> if

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
cheaper than Kurt than Casillas so if

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.899 
cheaper than Kurt than Casillas so if
you<00:01:19.500> guys<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:20.189> know<00:01:20.310> are<00:01:20.340> looking<00:01:20.729> for<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
you guys you know are looking for a

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.230 
you guys you know are looking for a
cheaper<00:01:21.180> alternative<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.020> Liga<00:01:22.350> BBVA

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
cheaper alternative in the Liga BBVA

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.310 
cheaper alternative in the Liga BBVA
definitely<00:01:24.240> give<00:01:24.360> him<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.570> go<00:01:24.780> because<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.140> think

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
definitely give him a go because I think

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.109 
definitely give him a go because I think
it'd<00:01:25.439> actually<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.799> really<00:01:25.979> good<00:01:26.280> then<00:01:26.880> my<00:01:27.060> two

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
it'd actually be really good then my two

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.640 
it'd actually be really good then my two
centre-backs<00:01:27.540> are<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> real<00:01:28.200> madrid

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
centre-backs are the real madrid

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.469 
centre-backs are the real madrid
centre-backs<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.159> go<00:01:29.310> Sergio<00:01:29.549> Ramos<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.180> rain

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
centre-backs you go Sergio Ramos of rain

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.719 
centre-backs you go Sergio Ramos of rain
I<00:01:30.720> think<00:01:31.320> both<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:31.979> these<00:01:32.189> guys<00:01:32.430> are<00:01:32.610> my

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
I think both of these guys are my

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.190 
I think both of these guys are my
favorite<00:01:33.210> center<00:01:33.450> backs<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.930> league<00:01:33.960> of

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
favorite center backs in the league of

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.859 
favorite center backs in the league of
BBVA<00:01:34.500> again<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.610> haven't<00:01:35.970> tried<00:01:36.119> PK<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.810> I've

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
BBVA again I haven't tried PK and I've

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.630 
BBVA again I haven't tried PK and I've
heard<00:01:37.049> some<00:01:37.259> really<00:01:37.500> good<00:01:37.740> things<00:01:37.799> about<00:01:38.159> PK

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
heard some really good things about PK

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.340 
heard some really good things about PK
so<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.180> know<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.540> guess<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.110> can't<00:01:40.320> really

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
doesn't even jump he just stands there

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.070

chance<00:05:10.319> whatsoever<00:05:10.650> and<00:05:11.190> this<00:05:11.610> is<00:05:11.759> a<00:05:11.789> rare

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
chance whatsoever and this is a rare

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.790 
chance whatsoever and this is a rare
goal<00:05:12.419> that<00:05:12.599> you'll<00:05:12.719> see<00:05:12.900> from<00:05:13.080> Valbuena<00:05:13.560> but

striker benzema works really nicely with

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:01.700 
striker benzema works really nicely with
him<00:05:59.940> it<00:06:00.330> works<00:06:00.629> well<00:06:00.990> often<00:06:01.349> but<00:06:01.560> it's

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710 
him it works well often but it's

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.290

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:07.379 
Ibrahimovic does but that doesn't matter

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:09.200
