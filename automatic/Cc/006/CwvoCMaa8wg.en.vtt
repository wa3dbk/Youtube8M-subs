and knock it out with a shaft so I have

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.990 
and knock it out with a shaft so I have
this<00:04:47.370> old<00:04:48.229> old<00:04:49.229> water<00:04:49.500> pump<00:04:49.800> shaft<00:04:50.640> this

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
this old old water pump shaft this

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.510 
this old old water pump shaft this
actually<00:04:51.419> was<00:04:51.540> no<00:04:51.690> good<00:04:52.100> as<00:04:53.100> people<00:04:53.340> were

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
actually was no good as people were

riding<00:04:53.729> this<00:04:53.970> bike<00:04:54.240> with<00:04:54.450> the<00:04:54.680> water<00:04:55.680> pump<00:04:55.919> not

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
riding this bike with the water pump not

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.710 
riding this bike with the water pump not
even<00:04:56.310> connected<00:04:56.700> there<00:04:56.850> should<00:04:57.000> be<00:04:57.150> a<00:04:57.180> solid

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
even connected there should be a solid

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.469 
even connected there should be a solid
on<00:04:57.840> here<00:04:58.460> so<00:04:59.460> let's<00:04:59.490> fill<00:04:59.940> that<00:04:59.970> up<00:05:00.120> with
