00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.160
 hi everyone my name is kuprienko artem 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.990
 not now we learn to make a plan 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.120
 candles and so us for that 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.389
 need of course harvested 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.820
 model and conditions that will be 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.859
 stimulate evening lighting i.e. 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.930
 now without any additional 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.470
 light sources only with the game gen 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.609
 tramp on the moment we get such here 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.189
 effect that is the feeling that we 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:31.560
 we are somewhere in the evening and so 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.690
 what do we need for this in order 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.760
 to hand over the flame of a candle flame of a candle to us 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.899
 will need 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.730
 appropriate play which will be 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:44.180
 determine the approximate dimensions of this 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.379
 flame and so we build plain it is normal 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.250
 maybe a rectangle maybe 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.500
 square depending on which one 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.010
 you texture such aspect ratio 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.960
 your textures and set it to flame 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.559
 the corresponding position that is if u 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:06.740
 us the candle is in the popular camera 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:09.150
 in this way this square 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.390
 then we put this glue in the same way 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.939
 perpendicular to the camera if you don't know 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.400
 the accuracy of which side will be rendered 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.890
 your candle that is possible, or 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.920
 renders options from different angles then i 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.570
 I recommend to put 2 play on detailed 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.150
 at an angle of 90 degrees relative 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.850
 each other since tweens when in 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.079
 principle from almost any side with 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.810
 a side of your flame will 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.740
 seem correct volumetric and so 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.380
 set plain 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.070
 Now we create a shader which will be 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:47.750
 feign the flame of our candles so 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:49.820
 create a new king of intel and you need views 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.160
 put the appropriate texture me 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.240
 prepared texture 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.110
 has a flowing texture which 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.090
 simulates the flame of a candle 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.729
 apply this texture of course 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.880
 enable checker required 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:09.830
 we decompose it modifier movie wmf 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:15.550
 and it turns out such here such here 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:18.650
 flame simulation of course is not enough 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.050
 now it's just a bitmap need to suzy us 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.370
 need to do so that this candle burned 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:29.750
 and also we need to remove the highlight gives 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.560
 dark dark sides on the dark part 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.910
 of our 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:39.380
 our cards for this we exist 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:42.440
 the opacity map we turn on and use 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.770
 corresponding card that is we 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.900
 this card denotes what is white 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.730
 part of us will be rendered 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:58.030
 about the black part will be transparent 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:03:02.120
 absolutely get a picture like this 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.590
 but the candle is not ready now we need 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.959
 make it so that the candle burned 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.320
 because if i start rendering my 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:15.320
 image let's see for us 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:17.510
 just see a map so she could barely 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.810
 Noticeably but she still not shine 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.269
 now we clamp it and the next 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.049
 the way we use the sales card 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:29.420
 illuminations with multiplayer unit with 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.730
 meaning that is our candle night 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.049
 get burnt and as a map we 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.280
 use the same card which 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.280
 used hills 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.980
 let's see how it looks like 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.980
 renderer 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.350
 here there is such a flame again 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.600
 its not enough why because if we 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.730
 look at the prototype photo and 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.240
 candles we will be able to notice the fact that the light 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.730
 burning wick 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.510
 it spreads much more widely 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.720
 illuminates the object and nearby to the candle and 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.180
 directly highlight the wax itself 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.290
 what do i do for this i 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.350
 I will make an additional light source 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:21.020
 which will be presented in the form of a crown 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:27.890
 lite-on in sphere mode i will leave 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:32.230
 a small top which will illuminate 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:34.370
 my son is setting him up and her somewhere 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.080
 to the place where we wicks 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.210
 in contact with the flame that is 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.270
 the brightest point of light will be exactly 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.400
 here the size can be put a little 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.390
 more 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.030
 the intensity of me is high since 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.970
 radius is quite small temperature 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:54.470
 colors now me two thousand kelvins and 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:56.960
 I removed all the checkboxes of communication was that is 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:59.690
 so that this ball is not reflected anywhere 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.400
 refracted and was invisible and so 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.400
 we look at what we do with it 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:14.020
 here we can see what appears such 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.070
 ambient light which is generated 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.680
 precisely this sphere 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:21.390
 he highlights our surroundings and he 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:26.260
 highlights the candle wax and which we have 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:27.720
 essentially are with material in the crown 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.660
 still no 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.700
 simulated zoom effect sss we 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.580
 we get such a translucent effect to 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.480
 the scattering of light we actually get 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.380
 the candle itself is a flame burning on the wick and 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.940
 ambient light which 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.370
 light us additional objects 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.370
 what is it all hope you have a lesson 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.550
 helpful with you was bought to artem all 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.550
 until
