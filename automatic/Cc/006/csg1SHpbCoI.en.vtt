00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.969
 why not a little pack opening and 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.010
 when I came across these pale ones I 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.180
 am said ba and ba bingo we will do that 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.510

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.329
 2000 trial woman and I will open 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.430
 with my credits 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.440
 I do not put a lawsuit so that's it 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.730
 play it with my credits so there is 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.809
 two water packs available so there are 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.030
 not a lot but that's when 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.649
 even packs to 100 but credit was 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.390
 not given but here are packs 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.820
 really interesting because in there are 24 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.250
 elements that players all in gold and 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.720
 everything will really be there are big 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.610
 chances of falling on very good 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.439
 players so are busy bah here 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.040
 for this first video of this year 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.930
 2015 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.320
 a small pack opening hoping to fall 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.549
 on a really heavy player 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.189
 ramon very heavy it would be good for 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.549
 well begin his 17 years of this 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.840
 year forgiveness 2015 on machete it would be 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.619
 really impeccable so what are we going 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.350
 do we start 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.939
 it's gone right now go hop on 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.900
 lose no time the first park in 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.150
 hoping that there is really heavy 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.909
 frankly it would be they do for 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.990
 to start ward attention so the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.450
 I do not have the impression that there is 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.690
 heavy in this pack moncaut see david 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.810

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.310

 really not an exceptional pack the 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.310
 Guys here's when it's a 100 pack 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.250

 serious it's boring it's boring I admit 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.139
 I would have preferred to come across big 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:07.720
 heavy douala in big tariffs but 

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:09.400

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.590
