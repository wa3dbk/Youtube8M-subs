okay i'm finally I'm gonna make a video
on<00:00:03.389> my<00:00:03.540> solar<00:00:03.750> panel<00:00:04.140> stop<00:00:04.799> finally<00:00:05.069> was<00:00:05.220> able

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
on my solar panel stop finally was able

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.839 
on my solar panel stop finally was able
to<00:00:05.490> get<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.640> battery<00:00:05.879> in<00:00:06.270> charge<00:00:07.340> so<00:00:08.340> i<00:00:08.370> can<00:00:08.639> run

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
to get a battery in charge so i can run

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.690 
to get a battery in charge so i can run

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
eight solders 26 from brunton that I got

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.939 
eight solders 26 from brunton that I got
a<00:00:15.900> couple<00:00:16.680> years<00:00:16.890> back<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.660> a<00:00:18.660> 26<00:00:19.350> watt<00:00:19.529> panel

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
a couple years back is a 26 watt panel

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.670 
a couple years back is a 26 watt panel
in<00:00:20.340> full<00:00:20.580> Sun<00:00:20.880> which<00:00:21.359> right<00:00:21.750> now<00:00:21.869> has<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.380> lot<00:00:22.650> of

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
in full Sun which right now has a lot of

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.570 
in full Sun which right now has a lot of
Sun<00:00:23.300> blue<00:00:24.300> sky<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:25.010> use<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.250> charge

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
Sun blue sky I use this charge

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.919 
Sun blue sky I use this charge
controller<00:00:27.119> right<00:00:27.779> here<00:00:28.080> another<00:00:28.460> and<00:00:29.689> I<00:00:30.689> not

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
controller right here another and I not

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.150 
controller right here another and I not
this<00:00:31.109> charging<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.830> when<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.009> always

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
this charging and when it's always

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.479 
this charging and when it's always
charged<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:33.140> turned<00:00:34.140> green<00:00:34.260> right<00:00:34.620> there<00:00:37.489> I'm

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
charged it turned green right there I'm

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.860 
charged it turned green right there I'm
just<00:00:38.730> battery<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.210> got<00:00:39.480> other<00:00:39.629> ups<00:00:43.430> that<00:00:44.870> not

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
just battery I got other ups that not

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.760 
just battery I got other ups that not
sure<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.140> capacity<00:00:46.829> but<00:00:48.440> I'm<00:00:49.440> guessing

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
sure the capacity but I'm guessing

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.080 
sure the capacity but I'm guessing
around<00:00:50.010> 7am<00:00:50.579> powers<00:00:53.780> and<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:54.960> one<00:00:55.410> stored

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
around 7am powers and this one stored

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.849 
around 7am powers and this one stored
that<00:00:57.090> things<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.899> come<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.350> solar<00:00:58.590> panel

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
that things that come with a solar panel

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.630 
that things that come with a solar panel
the<00:00:59.489> solar<00:01:00.030> charger<00:01:00.480> gonna<00:01:00.719> come<00:01:01.140> back<00:01:01.640> but

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
the solar charger gonna come back but

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.390 
the solar charger gonna come back but
you<00:01:03.539> have<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.989> cigarette<00:01:04.409> lighter<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:05.129> goes

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
you have a cigarette lighter that goes

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.830 
you have a cigarette lighter that goes
and<00:01:07.460> you<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.580> actually<00:01:08.729> connect<00:01:09.150> up<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.330> 3ds

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and you can actually connect up the 3ds

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.200 
and you can actually connect up the 3ds
panels<00:01:10.229> together<00:01:10.409> or<00:01:10.909> different<00:01:11.909> brunton

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
panels together or different brunton

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.960 
panels together or different brunton
panels<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.170> cable<00:01:13.530> she<00:01:14.369> would<00:01:14.580> connect

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
panels with this cable she would connect

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.270 
panels with this cable she would connect
it<00:01:15.170> to<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:17.450> poor<00:01:18.450> right<00:01:18.630> there<00:01:19.040> so<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.100> can

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
it to that poor right there so you can

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.920 
it to that poor right there so you can
connect<00:01:20.580> two<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.909> them<00:01:22.400> and<00:01:23.400> which<00:01:24.330> argent<00:01:24.780> I

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
connect two of them and which argent I

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.289 
connect two of them and which argent I
decide<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.500> section<00:01:26.460> coupling<00:01:26.850> around<00:01:27.060> I

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
decide this section coupling around I

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.990 
decide this section coupling around I
used<00:01:27.540> to<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.140> window<00:01:28.320> right<00:01:28.829> here

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
used to have it in the window right here

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.350 
used to have it in the window right here
but<00:01:30.290> now<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.820> easier<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.060> having

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
but now that I easier and just having

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.390 
but now that I easier and just having
the<00:01:33.479> window<00:01:33.720> hold<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.310> so<00:01:36.170> the<00:01:37.400> Britons

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
the window hold it in so the Britons

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.840 
the window hold it in so the Britons
solar<00:01:39.060> solder<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:39.869> 26<00:01:40.380> panel<00:01:40.860> I'm<00:01:41.640> going<00:01:41.700> to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
solar solder is 26 panel I'm going to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.580 
solar solder is 26 panel I'm going to
have<00:01:41.939> later<00:01:42.180> videos<00:01:42.570> showing<00:01:42.840> things<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.439> could

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
have later videos showing things I could

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.990 
have later videos showing things I could
run<00:01:43.740> with<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.720> run<00:01:45.720> times<00:01:46.049> on<00:01:46.380> like<00:01:47.000> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
run with it I run times on like the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.830 
run with it I run times on like the
different<00:01:48.630> electronics<00:01:49.490> I'm<00:01:50.490> voltmeter<00:01:51.420> or

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
different electronics I'm voltmeter or

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.530 
different electronics I'm voltmeter or
multimedia<00:01:52.259> should<00:01:52.649> come<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> mail<00:01:53.130> today

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
multimedia should come in the mail today

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.420 
multimedia should come in the mail today
so<00:01:54.540> I'm<00:01:55.259> going<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.500> see<00:01:55.710> how<00:01:55.770> much<00:01:55.920> power

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
so I'm going to see how much power

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.980 
so I'm going to see how much power
output<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:57.060> gets<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.420> different<00:01:57.810> light

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
output it gets on different light

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.830 
output it gets on different light
conditions<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.950> show<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.719> thanks<00:02:00.719> for
