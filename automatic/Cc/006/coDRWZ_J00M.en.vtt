00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.449 
and the ECW World Championship in 2006
I'll<00:03:05.140> struggling<00:03:05.530> between<00:03:05.620> these<00:03:05.950> two<00:03:06.220> but

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
I'll struggling between these two but

incredibly<00:03:17.230> incredibly<00:03:17.709> better<00:03:18.400> and<00:03:18.930> if<00:03:19.930> you

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
incredibly incredibly better and if you

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.840
