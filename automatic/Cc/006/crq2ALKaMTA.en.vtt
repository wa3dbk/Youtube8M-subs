placed<00:00:46.440> down<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> plastic<00:00:47.550> tray<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.180> I've

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
placed down a plastic tray that I've

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.420 
placed down a plastic tray that I've
turned<00:00:48.570> sideways<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.590> will<00:00:49.770> use<00:00:50.129> as<00:00:50.370> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
turned sideways that I will use as a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.799 
turned sideways that I will use as a
marker<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.780> run<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.260> dog<00:00:52.469> over<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.399> then<00:00:54.149> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
straight over the tray and it will also

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.160 
straight over the tray and it will also
give<00:01:06.720> him<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.380> barrier<00:01:07.830> guideline<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.880> stop<00:01:09.810> in

place I will demonstrate with and
without<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.740> tray<00:01:20.479> there's<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.750> simulated

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
without the tray there's the simulated

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.039 
without the tray there's the simulated
shotgun<00:01:23.040> sound<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:25.080> retriever<00:01:25.500> launch

fortunately<00:01:28.049> for<00:01:28.290> me<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.680> landed<00:01:29.310> directly<00:01:29.970> in

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
fortunately for me it landed directly in

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.520 
fortunately for me it landed directly in
line<00:01:30.479> with<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.320> tray<00:01:31.650> if<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:33.570> didn't<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.170> would

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
line with the tray if it didn't I would

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.830 
line with the tray if it didn't I would
just<00:01:34.710> come<00:01:34.979> back<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.460> move<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.970> dog<00:01:36.150> over<00:01:36.810> a

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
just come back and move the dog over a

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.649 
just come back and move the dog over a
little<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:38.070> still<00:01:38.400> create<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:39.030> straight<00:01:39.390> line

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
little to still create a straight line

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.270 
little to still create a straight line
through<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.470> tray<00:01:41.450> this<00:01:42.450> exercise
