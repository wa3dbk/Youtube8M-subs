hand side this multicolored case so now
we're<00:02:08.489> going<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.640> take<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.910> for<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.090> spin<00:02:09.360> let's

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
we're going to take it for a spin let's

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.559 
we're going to take it for a spin let's
see<00:02:09.690> how<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.899> performance<00:02:10.080> does

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
see how the performance does

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.089 
see how the performance does
alright<00:02:12.409> so<00:02:12.709> let's<00:02:12.890> give<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.069> a<00:02:13.219> test<00:02:13.400> here<00:02:15.099> so

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
alright so let's give it a test here so

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.610 
alright so let's give it a test here so
scrolling<00:02:16.459> through<00:02:16.790> screens<00:02:17.230> it's<00:02:18.230> nice<00:02:18.409> and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
scrolling through screens it's nice and

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.759 
scrolling through screens it's nice and
fast<00:02:19.299> looks<00:02:20.299> like<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.629> processor<00:02:21.290> is<00:02:21.319> much

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
fast looks like the processor is much

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.780 
fast looks like the processor is much

regular iphone here you can see the size

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:29.979 
regular iphone here you can see the size
comparison<00:03:25.959> between<00:03:26.959> the<00:03:27.229> two<00:03:27.590> they're<00:03:28.989> very
