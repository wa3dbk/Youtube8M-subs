that's<00:00:34.890> why<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.040> show<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.280> what<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:35.550> built<00:00:35.790> you

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
that's why I show you what we built you

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.340 
that's why I show you what we built you
used<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.500> see<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.920> small<00:00:38.989> wood<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.230> was

used to see in the small wood that was
built<00:00:40.649> with<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.829> last<00:00:41.070> chainsaw<00:00:41.550> mill<00:00:41.730> these

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
built with the last chainsaw mill these

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.400 
built with the last chainsaw mill these

full length of the bridge here and those

full length of the bridge here and those
were<00:00:58.199> all<00:00:58.289> cut<00:00:58.559> was<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.890> Alaska<00:00:59.250> chainsaw

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
were all cut was that Alaska chainsaw

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.689 
were all cut was that Alaska chainsaw
mill<00:01:00.710> and<00:01:01.710> here's<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> other<00:01:02.190> side<00:01:02.460> right

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
mill and here's the other side right

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.299 
mill and here's the other side right
here

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.090 

see<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.060> length<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.420> those<00:01:06.740> that<00:01:07.740> Alaska

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
see the length of those that Alaska

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.420 
see the length of those that Alaska
chainsaw<00:01:08.490> mill<00:01:08.700> cut<00:01:09.030> those<00:01:09.060> perfect

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.290 

it'd<00:01:12.970> take<00:01:13.240> us<00:01:13.270> two<00:01:13.870> solid<00:01:14.380> days<00:01:14.500> of<00:01:14.740> cutting

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
it'd take us two solid days of cutting

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.830 
it'd take us two solid days of cutting
to<00:01:16.300> cut<00:01:16.480> those<00:01:16.630> out<00:01:16.810> of<00:01:16.990> douglas-fir<00:01:17.350> logs<00:01:18.840> but

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
to cut those out of douglas-fir logs but

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.970 
to cut those out of douglas-fir logs but
without<00:01:20.110> that<00:01:20.290> this<00:01:20.500> bridge<00:01:20.770> would<00:01:20.920> have

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
without that this bridge would have

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.770 
without that this bridge would have
never<00:01:21.160> been<00:01:21.370> reconstructed

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.870 

so<00:01:26.290> there's<00:01:26.530> more<00:01:26.740> than<00:01:26.800> just<00:01:27.040> making<00:01:27.460> lumber

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
so there's more than just making lumber

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.430 
so there's more than just making lumber
with<00:01:28.030> that<00:01:28.150> Alaska<00:01:28.570> chainsaw<00:01:28.990> mill<00:01:29.170> you<00:01:29.410> can

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
with that Alaska chainsaw mill you can

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.060 
with that Alaska chainsaw mill you can
do<00:01:29.620> all<00:01:29.770> kinds<00:01:30.130> of<00:01:30.160> projects<00:01:31.860> right<00:01:32.860> here<00:01:32.980> and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
do all kinds of projects right here and

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.170 
do all kinds of projects right here and
take<00:01:33.160> a<00:01:33.190> look<00:01:33.340> at<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.520> side<00:01:33.730> of<00:01:33.850> this<00:01:33.940> bridge

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
take a look at the side of this bridge

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.730 
take a look at the side of this bridge
it's<00:01:34.450> real<00:01:34.600> pretty<00:01:34.750> bridge

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:49.639 

Spray<00:01:40.280> all<00:01:40.430> of<00:01:40.580> it

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.950 

the<00:01:50.649> length<00:01:50.860> of<00:01:51.070> it<00:01:51.360> there's<00:01:52.360> a<00:01:52.450> creek<00:01:52.659> that<00:01:52.689> it

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
the length of it there's a creek that it

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:05.240 
the length of it there's a creek that it
covers<00:01:54.360> not<00:01:55.360> a<00:01:55.390> pretty<00:01:55.659> setting

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.900 

that's<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.760> horse<00:02:06.000> Falls<00:02:06.300> Creek<00:02:07.050> Bridge<00:02:07.910> but

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
that's the horse Falls Creek Bridge but

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.640 
that's the horse Falls Creek Bridge but
it<00:02:09.060> sets<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.420> Myrtle<00:02:09.750> Creek<00:02:10.640> Oregon
