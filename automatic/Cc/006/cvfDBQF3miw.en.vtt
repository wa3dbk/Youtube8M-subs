saving some seats for next year habanero
first<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.409> put<00:01:04.619> them<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.890> paper<00:01:05.159> towels<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.880> dry

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
first we put them on paper towels to dry

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.880 
first we put them on paper towels to dry
out<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.510> seeds<00:01:09.409> honestly<00:01:10.409> when<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.650> say

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
out the seeds honestly when I say

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.380 
out the seeds honestly when I say
peppers<00:01:11.280> knees<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.580> don't<00:01:11.760> really<00:01:12.060> worry<00:01:12.299> about

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
peppers knees I don't really worry about

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.359 
peppers knees I don't really worry about
getting<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.229> seeds<00:01:13.470> separated<00:01:14.070> from<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
getting the seeds separated from the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.899 
getting the seeds separated from the
other<00:01:14.780> stuff<00:01:16.369> because<00:01:17.369> when<00:01:17.520> they<00:01:17.640> dry<00:01:17.880> out

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
other stuff because when they dry out

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.219 
other stuff because when they dry out
then<00:01:18.810> they'll<00:01:19.020> fall<00:01:19.259> off<00:01:19.470> easy<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:21.200> do<00:01:22.200> you

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
then they'll fall off easy so do you

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.109 
then they'll fall off easy so do you
then<00:01:22.470> go<00:01:22.680> back<00:01:22.830> later<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.310> take<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.090> other

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
then go back later and take the other

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.359
