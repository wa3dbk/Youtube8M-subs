00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.969
 I'm going to run errands with my friend who is aggravating me with the computer 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.100
 I do not know how to move the mouse asitentes I will record with him 

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:12.989
 he does not talk much 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:28.679
 what has that been? 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.050
 my stomach 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.429
 sorry 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:32.850
 other than that 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.160
 I think I heard something else 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.630
 do not be silly 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.960
 I have not thrown any forgiveness 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.570
 for adepa 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.780
 what accident have we had 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.780
 that day the address 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.680
 what has that been? 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.680
 what are those things 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.680
 run run run run run 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.090
 we need a car 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.090
 let's steal 1 and still from here 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.440
 fuck where are we going 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.380
 although it is going wrong because I have kept quiet 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.280
 how will we go from that thing 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.820
 because my friend does not know how to move the mouse 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.990
 perhaps our destiny is to die kennedy smoked 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.280
 Well, a little bit of created 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.590
 because I have not seen the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.700
 a monster 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.720
 only attributing of invisible things 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.720
 that happens to you for watching the cloverfield movie 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.060
 what happens is that you have three arms and four legs 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.750
 maybe you are right 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.220
 but just in case we're going to swim in the water 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.750
 but first let's kill a lot of people that's always fun 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.799
 also the monster is going to eat them all so it does not matter 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.390
 hear you do not give me 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.430
 many truths 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.680
 curious 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.290
 at the trial I will say that you had me crm that I tried to retegui 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.030
 the monster does not follow 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.139
 we have to go faster 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.149
 for abbot 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:14.089
 a policeman dies 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:17.759
 we go to the water to swim that I have seen something strange and fixed that we commented 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:21.399
 because I will have at my expense in study 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.689
 water rubber ducks 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.969
 although cold they will be let's see if we see something weird 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.190
 it's hard to talk to him 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.909
 a laptop in his hand to 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.019
 please so I am very tired all 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.639
 we are moving far from the coast 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:44.789
 also his hallucinations and we will end up killing one of these days 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.349
 what is that 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.359
 the one 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.619
 I see nothing 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:52.129
 that light from heaven 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.129
 it shines more than the others evil is not the moon because it is there 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.269
 what the hell is that 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.749

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:02.659
