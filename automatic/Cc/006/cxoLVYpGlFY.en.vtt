00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.370 

we've<00:03:08.819> left<00:03:09.030> it<00:03:09.180> on<00:03:09.270> for<00:03:09.480> like<00:03:09.720> two<00:03:10.020> to<00:03:10.170> three

and you gotta be way careful when you

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.309 
and you gotta be way careful when you
handle<00:03:14.550> this<00:03:14.849> fish<00:03:15.120> shouldn't<00:03:15.630> break<00:03:15.930> off<00:03:16.170> an

handle this fish shouldn't break off an

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.470 
handle this fish shouldn't break off an
ideal<00:03:17.190> thing<00:03:17.670> would<00:03:17.880> be<00:03:18.030> something<00:03:18.239> like<00:03:18.360> a

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
ideal thing would be something like a

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.020 
ideal thing would be something like a
Tong<00:03:18.810> here<00:03:19.140> just<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.830> finish<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.280> off<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:20.670> also

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
Tong here just to finish it off and also

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.580 
Tong here just to finish it off and also
to<00:03:21.270> make<00:03:21.420> sure<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.840> coconut<00:03:22.200> milk<00:03:22.349> doesn't

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
curdle which is why we're putting in the

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.770 
curdle which is why we're putting in the
