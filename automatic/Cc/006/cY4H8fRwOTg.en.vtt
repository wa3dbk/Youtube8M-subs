I<00:02:22.790> usually<00:02:23.480> weigh<00:02:23.720> out<00:02:23.870> my<00:02:23.930> chicken<00:02:24.260> once<00:02:24.590> it's

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
I usually weigh out my chicken once it's

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.460 
I usually weigh out my chicken once it's
cooked<00:02:25.190> but<00:02:26.090> now<00:02:26.690> since<00:02:27.110> I'm<00:02:27.230> going<00:02:27.350> to<00:02:27.410> be

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
cooked but now since I'm going to be

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.020 
cooked but now since I'm going to be
having<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.860> breading<00:02:28.220> on<00:02:28.340> it<00:02:28.550> after<00:02:28.850> it's

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
having the breading on it after it's

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.670 
having the breading on it after it's
cooked

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
cooked

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.190 
cooked
weigh<00:02:29.950> it<00:02:30.069> out<00:02:30.159> raw<00:02:30.430> instead<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.329> want<00:02:31.930> six

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
weigh it out raw instead I want six

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.929 
weigh it out raw instead I want six
ounces<00:02:32.620> for<00:02:33.010> tonight<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:33.310> already<00:02:33.640> put<00:02:33.909> that

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
ounces for tonight I already put that

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.410 
ounces for tonight I already put that
into<00:02:34.180> my<00:02:34.299> macros<00:02:34.750> so<00:02:35.290> it's<00:02:35.590> about<00:02:35.739> six<00:02:36.010> ounces

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
into my macros so it's about six ounces

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.030 
into my macros so it's about six ounces
I've<00:02:37.599> put<00:02:37.840> all<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.049> seasonings<00:02:38.500> together<00:02:38.859> and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
I've put all the seasonings together and

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.470 
I've put all the seasonings together and
mix<00:02:39.189> that<00:02:39.400> up<00:02:39.430> so<00:02:40.329> now<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:42.370> these<00:02:42.670> are<00:02:42.939> wet

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
mix that up so now and these are wet

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.229 
mix that up so now and these are wet
because<00:02:43.930> they're<00:02:44.200> microwaved<00:02:44.620> all<00:02:44.859> the<00:02:45.239> ice

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
because they're microwaved all the ice

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.479 
because they're microwaved all the ice
came<00:02:46.719> off<00:02:46.900> of<00:02:46.930> them<00:02:47.319> from<00:02:48.250> when<00:02:48.370> they're

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
came off of them from when they're

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.849 
came off of them from when they're
frozen<00:02:48.760> so<00:02:49.689> you<00:02:49.719> don't<00:02:49.930> even<00:02:50.109> need<00:02:50.349> to<00:02:50.620> put

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
frozen so you don't even need to put

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.420 
frozen so you don't even need to put
like<00:02:51.129> an<00:02:51.250> egg<00:02:51.400> wash<00:02:51.639> or<00:02:52.090> anything<00:02:52.930> like<00:02:53.230> that

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
like an egg wash or anything like that

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.110 
like an egg wash or anything like that
on<00:02:54.430> them<00:02:55.889> they<00:02:56.889> really<00:02:57.099> soak<00:02:57.459> up<00:02:57.670> all<00:02:57.849> the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
on them they really soak up all the

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.250 
on them they really soak up all the
breading<00:02:58.359> by<00:02:58.900> themselves<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.930> just<00:03:02.109> get<00:03:02.230> a

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
breading by themselves so just get a

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.890 
breading by themselves so just get a
really<00:03:02.439> nice<00:03:02.709> good<00:03:03.040> coat<00:03:03.489> on<00:03:04.000> them<00:03:04.359> like<00:03:04.599> this

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
really nice good coat on them like this

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.619 
really nice good coat on them like this
and<00:03:05.230> you'll<00:03:05.980> place<00:03:06.220> them<00:03:06.459> all<00:03:06.579> on<00:03:07.120> a<00:03:07.150> foil

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
and you'll place them all on a foil

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.229 
and you'll place them all on a foil
lined<00:03:07.989> baking<00:03:08.290> pan<00:03:09.010> with<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.760> good<00:03:09.970> amount<00:03:10.209> of

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
lined baking pan with a good amount of

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:11.460 
lined baking pan with a good amount of
cooking<00:03:10.540> spray<00:03:10.780> on<00:03:10.930> there<00:03:11.109> so<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:11.379> they

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
cooking spray on there so that they

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.339 
cooking spray on there so that they
don't<00:03:11.650> stick<00:03:11.829> and<00:03:12.569> as<00:03:13.569> you<00:03:13.750> can<00:03:13.900> see<00:03:14.109> there's

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
don't stick and as you can see there's

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.259 
don't stick and as you can see there's
quite<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.620> bit<00:03:14.769> of<00:03:14.889> flour<00:03:15.069> left<00:03:15.400> over<00:03:15.790> after

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
quite a bit of flour left over after

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.319 
quite a bit of flour left over after
coating<00:03:16.599> those<00:03:16.900> three<00:03:17.230> chicken<00:03:17.680> strips<00:03:18.329> so

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
coating those three chicken strips so

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.149 
coating those three chicken strips so
for<00:03:19.540> me<00:03:19.659> I<00:03:19.689> could<00:03:20.079> have<00:03:20.169> probably<00:03:20.409> gotten<00:03:21.040> away

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
for me I could have probably gotten away

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.149 
for me I could have probably gotten away
with<00:03:21.310> using<00:03:21.909> a<00:03:22.000> quarter<00:03:22.419> cup<00:03:22.689> of<00:03:22.959> oats<00:03:23.620> rather

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159 
with using a quarter cup of oats rather

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:26.550 
with using a quarter cup of oats rather
than<00:03:24.519> a<00:03:24.549> half<00:03:24.819> a<00:03:24.909> cup<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.419> am<00:03:26.049> cooking<00:03:26.230> for<00:03:26.409> the

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
than a half a cup I am cooking for the

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.050 
than a half a cup I am cooking for the
rest<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.739> the<00:03:26.829> family<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.549> if<00:03:27.849> there's

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
rest of the family and if there's

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.970 
rest of the family and if there's
leftovers<00:03:28.629> later<00:03:29.019> for<00:03:29.200> lunch<00:03:29.230> tomorrow<00:03:29.530> so

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
leftovers later for lunch tomorrow so

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.039 
leftovers later for lunch tomorrow so
this<00:03:30.609> is<00:03:30.819> fine<00:03:31.090> but<00:03:31.329> if<00:03:31.450> you're<00:03:31.569> cooking<00:03:31.750> for

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
this is fine but if you're cooking for

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.509 
this is fine but if you're cooking for
yourself<00:03:32.409> and<00:03:32.650> you're<00:03:32.739> only<00:03:32.859> making<00:03:33.219> a<00:03:33.310> small

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
yourself and you're only making a small

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.619 
yourself and you're only making a small
amount<00:03:33.760> a<00:03:34.060> quarter<00:03:34.750> cup<00:03:35.049> goes<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.470> long<00:03:35.769> way

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
amount a quarter cup goes a long way

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:39.689 
amount a quarter cup goes a long way
once<00:03:37.629> you've<00:03:37.810> got<00:03:37.959> them<00:03:38.019> all<00:03:38.169> coated<00:03:38.699> stick

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
once you've got them all coated stick

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.030 
once you've got them all coated stick
them<00:03:39.879> on<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.269> pan<00:03:40.510> here<00:03:41.019> and<00:03:41.229> you'll<00:03:41.769> want<00:03:41.919> to

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
them on the pan here and you'll want to

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.670 
them on the pan here and you'll want to
spray<00:03:42.400> it<00:03:42.430> with<00:03:42.639> cooking<00:03:43.239> spray<00:03:43.419> I'm<00:03:44.260> using

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
spray it with cooking spray I'm using

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.210 
spray it with cooking spray I'm using
this<00:03:44.919> Crisco<00:03:45.489> canola<00:03:46.329> oil<00:03:46.739> you<00:03:47.739> want<00:03:47.889> to<00:03:48.010> spray

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
this Crisco canola oil you want to spray

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.899 
this Crisco canola oil you want to spray
them<00:03:48.400> pretty<00:03:48.699> generously<00:03:50.340> before<00:03:51.340> prepping

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
them pretty generously before prepping

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:58.229 
them pretty generously before prepping
them<00:03:54.359> and<00:03:56.250> prevents<00:03:57.250> them<00:03:57.430> from<00:03:57.489> sticking<00:03:58.030> in

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
them and prevents them from sticking in

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.249 
them and prevents them from sticking in
the<00:03:58.299> pan

00:03:59.249 --> 00:03:59.259 
the pan

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.469 
the pan
and<00:03:59.500> that<00:03:59.829> half<00:04:00.129> a<00:04:00.370> cup<00:04:00.639> of<00:04:00.909> oats<00:04:01.150> that<00:04:01.359> I

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:01.479 
and that half a cup of oats that I

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:04.170 
and that half a cup of oats that I
originally<00:04:02.229> made<00:04:02.409> covered<00:04:03.370> almost<00:04:03.609> all<00:04:03.819> of

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
originally made covered almost all of

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.300 
originally made covered almost all of
these<00:04:04.389> except<00:04:05.079> for<00:04:05.290> maybe<00:04:05.500> three

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
these except for maybe three

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.539 
these except for maybe three
so<00:04:06.819> again<00:04:07.090> 1/2<00:04:07.389> cup<00:04:07.689> goes<00:04:08.019> a<00:04:08.049> long<00:04:08.439> way<00:04:08.650> and

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
so again 1/2 cup goes a long way and

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.339 
so again 1/2 cup goes a long way and
then<00:04:09.759> you<00:04:09.970> want<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.209> stick<00:04:10.419> these<00:04:10.599> in<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:10.930> oven

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
then you want to stick these in the oven

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.670 
then you want to stick these in the oven
at<00:04:11.919> 400<00:04:12.370> degrees<00:04:12.759> and<00:04:13.540> they<00:04:14.079> will<00:04:14.199> cook<00:04:14.439> for

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
at 400 degrees and they will cook for

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.610 
at 400 degrees and they will cook for
about<00:04:14.889> 15<00:04:15.400> minutes<00:04:15.609> um<00:04:16.139> we'll<00:04:17.139> check<00:04:17.349> on<00:04:17.470> them

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
about 15 minutes um we'll check on them

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.310 
about 15 minutes um we'll check on them
in<00:04:17.650> a<00:04:17.799> little<00:04:17.919> bit<00:04:18.299> next<00:04:19.299> I'll<00:04:19.509> be<00:04:19.539> making<00:04:19.989> some

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
in a little bit next I'll be making some

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.080 
in a little bit next I'll be making some
homemade<00:04:20.709> honey<00:04:21.009> mustard<00:04:21.430> to<00:04:21.669> go<00:04:21.789> along<00:04:22.060> with

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
homemade honey mustard to go along with

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.930 
homemade honey mustard to go along with
these<00:04:22.630> chicken<00:04:22.960> tenders<00:04:23.759> traditional<00:04:24.759> honey

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
these chicken tenders traditional honey

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.060 
these chicken tenders traditional honey
mustard<00:04:25.270> is<00:04:25.479> really<00:04:25.870> high<00:04:26.020> in<00:04:26.169> fat<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:26.590> carbs

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
mustard is really high in fat and carbs

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.149 
mustard is really high in fat and carbs
so<00:04:27.639> this<00:04:27.789> is<00:04:27.970> a<00:04:28.000> great<00:04:28.720> alternative<00:04:28.960> that<00:04:29.740> I

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:30.159 
so this is a great alternative that I

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:31.399 
so this is a great alternative that I
think<00:04:30.370> pretty<00:04:30.610> much<00:04:30.669> fat-free

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:31.409 
think pretty much fat-free

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:36.839 
think pretty much fat-free
so<00:04:32.409> you<00:04:32.830> will<00:04:32.979> need<00:04:33.159> honey<00:04:33.669> in<00:04:34.740> one<00:04:35.740> serving<00:04:36.550> of

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
so you will need honey in one serving of

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:37.480 
so you will need honey in one serving of
this

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
this

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.880 
this
which<00:04:38.490> is<00:04:38.640> 1tbsp<00:04:39.000> it<00:04:39.750> has<00:04:39.900> 17<00:04:40.560> carbs<00:04:41.270> and<00:04:42.890> some

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890
