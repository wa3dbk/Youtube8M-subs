install<00:00:37.260> more<00:00:37.440> RAM<00:00:37.800> first<00:00:38.430> thing<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.790> want<00:00:38.969> to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
install more RAM first thing you want to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.819 
install more RAM first thing you want to
do<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.780> take<00:00:40.379> out<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.620> battery<00:00:42.559> so<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.590> just

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
do is take out the battery so you just

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.830 
do is take out the battery so you just
want<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.129> hold<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.789> back<00:00:45.149> because<00:00:45.629> that's

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
want to hold that back because that's

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
want to hold that back because that's
like<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.050> springy<00:00:46.500> lock<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:48.289> keep<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.559> out

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
like the springy lock and keep this out

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.310 
like the springy lock and keep this out
like<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:54.420> then<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.660> my<00:00:54.809> case<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.170> just

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
like that and then in my case it just

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.209 
like that and then in my case it just
slides<00:00:55.680> out<00:00:55.920> backwards<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.800> now<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.070> can

so when I open up and then we can get
busy<00:01:35.600> okay<00:01:36.600> now<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:36.869> taken<00:01:37.229> lists<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:38.310> Z

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
busy okay now have taken lists like Z

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.109 
busy okay now have taken lists like Z
panel<00:01:39.950> you<00:01:40.950> can<00:01:40.979> see<00:01:41.340> some<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> main

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
panel you can see some of the main

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.389 
panel you can see some of the main
components<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.380> see<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.740> hard<00:01:44.040> drive

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
components so you can see the hard drive

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.399 
components so you can see the hard drive
and<00:01:45.470> processor<00:01:46.470> cooling<00:01:47.040> unit<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.909> ramp

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
and processor cooling unit and the ramp

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.450 
and processor cooling unit and the ramp
but<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.770> bit<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:49.920> we<00:01:50.130> need<00:01:50.340> to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
but this is the bit that we need to

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.789 
but this is the bit that we need to
focus<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.299> let's<00:01:51.540> zoom<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.290> then<00:01:52.649> we

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
focus on so let's zoom in and then we

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.499 
focus on so let's zoom in and then we
can<00:01:53.070> install<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.299> new<00:01:56.270> for<00:01:57.270> bigger

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
can install the new for bigger

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.789 
can install the new for bigger
background<00:01:59.329> ok<00:02:00.329> now<00:02:00.540> we're<00:02:00.840> all<00:02:00.899> zoomed<00:02:01.560> in

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
background ok now we're all zoomed in

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.580 
background ok now we're all zoomed in
and<00:02:02.009> it's<00:02:02.430> easy<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:03.060> see<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.570> now<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.530> just

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
and it's easy to see and now it just

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.160 
and it's easy to see and now it just
focused<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:06.090> can<00:02:06.119> see<00:02:06.450> these<00:02:06.600> two<00:02:06.869> little

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
focused you can see these two little

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.760 
focused you can see these two little
arms<00:02:07.380> here<00:02:08.420> for<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.509> spare<00:02:09.840> piece<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.289> RAM<00:02:10.530> and

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
arms here for the spare piece of RAM and

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.230 
arms here for the spare piece of RAM and
the<00:02:11.190> pre-install<00:02:11.819> one<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.209> there

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
the pre-install one is there

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.070 
the pre-install one is there
