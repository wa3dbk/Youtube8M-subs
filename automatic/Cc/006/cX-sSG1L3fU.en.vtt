00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
really sure what that is I wouldn't

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.590 
really sure what that is I wouldn't
change<00:03:20.670> it<00:03:20.910> seems<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.690> be<00:03:21.750> working<00:03:21.930> fine<00:03:22.549> now

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
change it seems to be working fine now

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.449 
change it seems to be working fine now
and<00:03:24.600> then<00:03:24.989> if<00:03:25.079> you<00:03:25.170> did<00:03:25.350> no<00:03:25.560> damage<00:03:25.590> of<00:03:26.190> course

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
and then if you did no damage of course

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.440 
and then if you did no damage of course
it's<00:03:26.640> not<00:03:26.820> going<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.030> show<00:03:27.209> anything<00:03:27.620> I

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
it's not going to show anything I

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.770 
it's not going to show anything I
actually<00:03:30.450> would<00:03:30.750> change<00:03:30.989> that<00:03:31.320> to<00:03:31.709> false

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
actually would change that to false

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.259 
actually would change that to false
because<00:03:33.780> if<00:03:33.959> you're<00:03:34.079> in<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.230> pv<00:03:34.739> p<00:03:35.549> situation

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
because if you're in a pv p situation

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.650 
because if you're in a pv p situation
and<00:03:36.859> they<00:03:37.859> popped<00:03:38.250> something<00:03:38.760> in<00:03:39.030> Heroes<00:03:39.420> that

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
and they popped something in Heroes that

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.390 
and they popped something in Heroes that
allows<00:03:40.140> them<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.380> take<00:03:40.650> no<00:03:40.829> damage<00:03:41.070> I<00:03:41.370> would

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
allows them to take no damage I would

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.580 
allows them to take no damage I would
want<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.790> know<00:03:41.910> that<00:03:42.109> so<00:03:43.109> I<00:03:43.140> would<00:03:43.500> actually

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
want to know that so I would actually

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.610 
want to know that so I would actually
leave<00:03:44.010> this<00:03:44.190> I<00:03:44.250> would<00:03:44.640> turn<00:03:44.850> this<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.120> false

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
leave this I would turn this to false

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.710 
leave this I would turn this to false
mainly<00:03:46.620> if<00:03:46.680> you're<00:03:46.829> a<00:03:46.859> hero<00:03:47.100> server<00:03:47.540> which<00:03:48.540> I
