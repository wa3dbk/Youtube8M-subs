00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.839
 here is the usual combination lock we give you now 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.530
 show on video how it can be opened 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.519
 Soviet castle is very strong good 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.920
 4 drums difficult to crack a hot 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.619
 iron 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.270
 well I found it in the street 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.710
 Iâ€™m trying to video earlier 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.310
 hacked such did not try now 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.310
 set 0 and everywhere 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.029
 For example 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.660
 here's a hole everywhere 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.270
 here are tac toe and up to one 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.620
 what the hell 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.620
 what combination will 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.700
 So 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.860
 see this shackle 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.560
 she must move in every code 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:04.030
 the castle she moves and you too rite on 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:08.260
 video pull listen knock it all 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:12.430
 shadows and I invented my system on 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:15.790
 drummers stir and stir when 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.430
 pick a drummer when you hit 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.350
 the right figure for need drummers he 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:26.020
 stops moving it turns you 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:28.170
 guessed the figure here see now we will 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.170
 sample 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.870
 3 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.800
 then 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.650
 Here we try 0 units 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:43.110
 here is the line we need to enter 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:48.530
 code anna anna 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:51.190
 here we try the unit does not move 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.000
 try dvoechku 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.000
 stir 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.820
 top three 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.229
 also the show price is bad mean close 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.229
 four 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.590
 stir 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.590
 you see 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.880
 try five 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.880
 moving too 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.790
 here is 6 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.620
 about 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.909
 We guessed as follows 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.909
 pick up again 0 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.240
 set 0 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.690
 but everywhere we exhibit 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.829
 In principle, there is no difference how but I start 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.230
 from scratch because it's more convenient just here you are 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.840
 see yes 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.519
 we try 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:04.050
 six don't move on whether they move 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.050
 so on unit 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.100
 look 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.130
 about 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.180
 went matter the last two move like 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:20.140
 as if in the wind and the first are horses 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:23.970
 continue on like this 5 0 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.970
 make move 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.310
 everything keeps let's start with nines 1 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.379
 all for face 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.829
 hanging around too 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.950
 like but you do not see the moves 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.510
 need to pick up 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.860
 now this 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.860
 also start with nines 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.370
 here 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.739
 and when will you feel when 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:04.430
 correctness of the figures will be easier 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.430
 walk darling that's for face 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.849
 also 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.420
 to give too 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.430
 you see 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.060
 so unit tightly walks on not 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.340
 opens it means we made a mistake 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:35.720
 past beta 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.720
 61 71 let's try reverse whiskey 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.140
 so here all the numbers don't move 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:50.090
 and you saw 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.120
 opened up 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:58.430
 higher nifiga opened itself 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.139
 comic con 6181 speak immediately will stand 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.590
 the bike is gone on your fault 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:02.590
 all bye
