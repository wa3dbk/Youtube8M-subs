 Dr 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:19.849
 up to 73 thousand vehicles a day which daily through the construction site 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.159
 on the a 1 Bremen direction Hamburg 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:26.139
 special traffic regulations such as an absolute ban on overtaking and the 

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:30.989
 Staggered driving there are arranged by sign but hardly anyone seems 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.990
 to be interested in these rules I got through the car 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.960
 "I'm Wild RWO I was crazy for the rare as it was rare 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.960
 Car driver The Kurdish people are reading the no-passing ban 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.030
 The really important construction site also presented the car did not crash 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.740
 outdated and I do not understand 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.950
 that was too little and because the post office opened by the end of August 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.050
 all hunt the defendant 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.950
 and that 's how the mine is between Hamburg London and 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.940
 Bremen he should not Levin this not be torn up Dr everything they are 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.350
 should some what is the way done afterwards because the people are much faster 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.460
 We never knew what the first 20 kilometers of this victory would be 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.570
 Master of the 15 but not that is way because they believe him to the construction sites 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.460
 I was going to be in seven sections 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.659
 At 73 kilometers, the construction site is laid out piece by piece 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.759
 74 bridges are renewed the a1 between Bremen and Hamburg is probably the 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.729
 most dangerous section of the highway of the Republic there are other solutions 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.050
 be based 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.160
 leave like summer 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.190
 I dont know 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.420
 because at the moment I would say the elections are unemployed 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.780
 the distance 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.280
 be made big 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.810
 but if it often makes sense even nerds back the construction site percent 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.560
 Percent set up 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.070
 I dare to doubt 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.190
 the big special for the construction sites is now available in the current issue 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.500
