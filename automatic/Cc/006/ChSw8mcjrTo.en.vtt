00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello I conducted a bayonet test from 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.899
 SVT-40 rifles 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.290
 the bayonet was released around 1942 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.840
 year 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.480
 the bayonet was sharpened for a confident cut 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.150
 paper before this test first thing i 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.070
 tested the rifle cut 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.029
 car tire and a bit 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.029
 hurt wood 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.500
 then I tried to puncture the tire from 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.140
 truck well since the rifle itself 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.410
 SVT-40 I do not have something I just tied 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.750
 then bayonet shelves and very diligently 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.750
 tried to pierce him however 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.200
 then poked the bayonet of the tree and pierced 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.200
 old sneaker 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.230
 bayonet throw was able to hold on 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.450
 a distance of no more than two meters at 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.490
 increase the distance calculate the turnover 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.490
 I did not have such a lengthy measure 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.870
 chopped wood here hilt strongly 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.680
 scrolled arm and bayonet clearly not 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.680
 enough weight 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:21.479
 and at the end a bit of hardcore 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:45.250
 after the glass on the bayonet slightly engaged 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.150
 tip which I sweat very easily 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.940
 straightened 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:57.310
 and after the car a little bit 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:06:01.780
 the blade itself was twisted in relation to 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:03.039
 stick in my opinion bayonet excellent 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.610
 passed all the tests 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:10.020
 really real thing real 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.020
 unkillable weapons
