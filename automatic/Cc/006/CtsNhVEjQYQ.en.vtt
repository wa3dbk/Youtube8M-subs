00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:08.130
 How are you going to take it? 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:13.040
 today we are here doing the tests 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.040
 in my brother 's cls 2.0 man 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:21.300
 attempt to replace the 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.600
 mass of air that is this one has this 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.250
 inside the filter housing there. 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.289
 with air flow the vane moves and 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.090
 sends a signal to the control panel through 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.010
 of a resistive track that has 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:43.050
 of this sensor there as the return of the signal 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:47.430
 0 volts her case off around 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.969
 of a flight had 1.2 in the slow and four to 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.850
 five flights at most I noticed that 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.570
 this marketing sensor that is here 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:02.190
 that I to the gay in the in the outlet 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.110
 of vacuum actually taking the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.010
 the slow sensor will only remove 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.070
 take the test 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.350
 this sensor map here is the sensor - the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.320
 13 in the most modern reptiles with four 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.479
 pin which is a waco sensor in the case in 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.299
 form the central air flow 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.340
 through the collector vacuum signal 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.540
 and two more pins than the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.689
 Air temperature 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.850
 both work with the same type of 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.500
 signal 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:32.310
 despite the fact that the capital is a vacuum and that 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.790
 mass of art 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.360
 the two respond with the same 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.229
 according to the variation of the wako or 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.750
 flow 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.619
 so I decided to adapt it and call on 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.259
 whip 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.200
 both have power five flights one 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:53.790
 a negative feedback signal. 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:59.390
 temperature is a return signal of 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:02.240
 flow then as the acid map also 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:06.860
 works with the same signal I solved 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:08.539
 put him on the spot here for us and 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.750
 verified 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.390
 and it is a good idea to adapt this 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.730
 map in place of the gear sensor 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.920
 by the difficulty today and I was able to 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.099
 repair this sensor 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.379
 so I asked for the first mondal one 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.109
 start the car and we will observe 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.680
 the signal return and operation of the 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.349
 motor 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.079
 he just take a look downtown near 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.239
 of the legend because I'm without yours without the 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.760
 slow sensor connected because I 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.159
 I have temporarily used the 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.040
 slow sensor to take the test 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.989
 So I'm going to ask you to hold the league. 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.939
 car with half accelerated to the 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:51.889
 people can keep the engine running and 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:56.780
 observe the variation of the sensor here 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:59.230
 a feedback signal with acceleration may 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.230
 connect the capital 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.560
 now of the material to tim coc 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.219
 in general google 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:46.630
 Thank you, god, there you are. 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:50.230
 I still have a few tests I would have 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.420
 connect the map year if you make a 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.520
 hole in the sink here firm it 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.830
 definitely pass the whip as well 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:02.680
 here and reconnect the sensor in case the 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.480
 Actuator idle for us 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:09.940
 to walk with him to observe the reactions 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.490
 but I gave it to him now without breath 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:16.420
 It's complicated, we're not slow and 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:19.480
 boring can not speed up when it goes 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.870
 ironing machine machine gets boring but there 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.890
 so I was there for him 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.400
 We'll definitely do it again. 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.400
 closer
