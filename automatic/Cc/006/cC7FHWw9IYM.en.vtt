00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 nice all guys and welcome back in 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.750
 this second episode of potentials 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.910
 trans for fifa 15 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.340
 first of all I want to thank you for 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.040
 all the support and in any case the fact 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.020
 that you enjoyed the first one tonight 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.240
 episode that has also received so much 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.710
 support and so I like and I like 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.060
 so I wanted to thank you 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.320
 initially and then I wanted immediately 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.140
 invite you to sharm el I like it that way 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.029
 we can get at least 400 like 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.289
 for this episode because last 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.840
 episode received them 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.180
 so I think we can do it 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.760
 also this time therefore we go to 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.950
 immediately talk about the three players of 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.829
 this episode where we're going to talk 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.590
 today the first player certainly 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:49.829
 ángel of maría del real madrid of maria 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.160
 which is the mouth of many super teams 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.190
 extra billionaires but to be precise 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.379
 the paris saint germain because of maria 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.800
 undoubtedly played a season 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.989
 exhilarating he played in the country in the real 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.970
 madrid sorry in any role 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.250
 can practically played at 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.830
 midfield played behind the tips 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.990
 played right played left 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.560
 therefore everywhere his position 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.570
 you probably don't know which but 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.720
 let's leave this outside perhaps now 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.900
 it is the card that I made myself think 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.970
 may be so we see a no 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.869
 speed increase because in my opinion 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.790
 no need 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.380
 there is certainly a need for a 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.880
 increased shooting but above all a 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.520
 step increase because we anyway 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.189
 has only made 11 seasonal goals but has 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.670
 made the 26 assist then a plus 3 in 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.369
 passage is necessary is obliged as 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.409
 moreover then it harder to dribble to a 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.170
 increase in defense because anyway 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.880
 playing as a central midfielder like 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.399
 has often done this year in the real of 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.689
 ancelotti for strength the defense must 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.790
 be increased 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.979
 and in any case if it comes out cc or whatever it is 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.290
 in midfield it should be increased 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.490
 the defense then ok, head shot is more 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.149
 a little random 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.009
 in any case, maria is a player who 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.390
 rated very high because it is 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.620
 a formidable player certainly one 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.650
 the best players there are at 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.200
 moment is its market value for 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.700
 which paris saint is very high 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.459
 germain should have an offer ready 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.840
 of 60 million euros 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.280
 but you all know that paris saint 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.110
 germain has this problem a little 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.690
 financial fair play then you will try 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.280
 to get around maybe paying in installments 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.900
 rather than later 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.880
 you have to see then if real madrid 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.470
 will accept this offer anyway 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.730
 we talk in the second player the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.569
 second player a lot player 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.370
 very hot ie cuadrado cuadrado of 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.370
 Florentine season of course also for 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.480
 he very very positive both in 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.800
 championship that in any case in cups e 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.000
 especially in the world played at 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.550
 so he too is great on 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.350
 the mouth of many teams also on the 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:02.380
 notebook let's say many teams up 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.750
 on the list on the wish list but 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.910
 especially from barcelona because 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.980
 however there are teams like the bayern 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.410
 monaco the manchester however others 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.930
 English that are on cuadrado is from a 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.610
 quite some time we say however surely 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.380
 the player's will is to 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.769
 leave florence to go to 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.790
 move to barcelona barcelona that 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.250
 however he has already campaigned 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.489
 absurd purchases by taking rakitic 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.579
 taking suarez etc. etc. 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.310
 mattia 20 million inexplicable thing 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.709
 however however cuadrado is a 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.230
 player who will probably play 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.650
 to the right even though I don't really know 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.829
 well what is its position in the 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.570
 barcelona if it comes out if yes 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.790
 will transfer to barcelona in any case 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:51.670
 here you can see the card with the various 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.410
 statistics increases the player has 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.040
 a value of the card definitely 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.920
 high high could be offered by 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.989
 35 40 million to tear it down precisely 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.130
 Florentine style 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.090
 here we see an increase in speed 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.799
 because no doubt it should be 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.109
 increased speed because for example 

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.090
 the team of the season card received 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:15.430
 a big increase of type 97 if not 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.140
 I don't want something like that 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.810
 make mistakes anyway the speed must 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.130
 be increase 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.430
 how shooting should also be increased 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.870
 here more high 7 as an increase however 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.380
 I think it's because you can't 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.900
 have an evaluation 84 with 66 of 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.600
 shooting from must at least have more than 70 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.280
 according to me the passage the shot sorry 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.680
 passing though increasing anyway 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:41.389
 I made both goals that did type 15 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.220
 Seasonal goals and 11 assists 15th rise 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.570
 of dribbling because a player does 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.970
 of dribbling perhaps his best weapon 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.650
 along with the speed and for which there are 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.050
 even five star skills as you can 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.800
 see from this extra image there will be 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.270
 an increase in defense because he played 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.300
 even this right-back player 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.100
 it is also fairly good so there is 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.540
 also an increase in defense then oh well 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.510
 head shot I don't always put a little 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:07.910
 random because they always put it we go 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.010
 indeed another thing 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.810
 it will indeed be difficult to understand what it will be 

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.850
 its location in barcelona because 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:18.050
 we remember that in attack there is suarez 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.820
 suarez is put there is neymar and where it is 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.360
 puts cuadrado will probably play from 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.490
 right wing when there will be no suarez for 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.010
 the disqualification then you will see we go with 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:33.200
 the last player of this episode 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:36.470
 Let's talk about Lavezzi Lavezzi too is 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:37.700
 we say linked to many Milan teams 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.810
 juventus etc. 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.770
 let's talk about juventus in this case 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.990
 lavezzi that still comes from one 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.720
 not exciting season but that is a good one 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.180
 season but here is not so exorbitant 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.620
 like how it forms blacks from this player 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.289
 because he is a very good player 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.460
 I really like lavezzi lavezzi 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:00.200
 which was purchased for one amount 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:01.639
 very high from Naples and now the figure 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.610
 obviously its value has fallen 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:07.460
 because anyway over time with the years 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.880
 the player is lowered anyway 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.710
 great here the card of fifa 15 la 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.389
 first possible fifa card 15 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.840
 could find a speed increase 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.289
 as of shooting and substantially low if 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.479
 not 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:22.249
 minus one in defense because a 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:25.129
 player who defends little I do not see from 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:30.289
 what I saw so there is no 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:31.879
 big increase or decrease of 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:34.309
 statistics for this player because 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:36.830
 however he did a modest season 

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:39.349
 but it is not exciting nor disappointing then 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:42.559
 I think the player stays that way 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:45.319
 however its price then 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:46.550
 it will probably be about 20 25 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:49.430
 million euros 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.649
 you have to see if the juventus is ready 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.080
 to buy this player after having 

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:55.479
 bought morata that has already been injured 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.189
 for which he needs an additional 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:07:00.349
 offensive player to add to the 

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:02.899
 his team, however, dispels the episode 

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:04.909
 ends here I hope you enjoyed it 

00:07:02.899 --> 00:07:06.740
 as usual invitation to sharm el mi 

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:08.899
 like 400 i like it 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.520
 the new episode will be released at 

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:12.529
 write in the comments to make it easier for me 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.809
 little life also some other rumor that 

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:16.399
 you have heard of the market I remember you 

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:18.289
 not to write the players who are already 

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:20.599
 official official transfers but 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:22.159
 only the rumors you hear but 

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:23.689
 obviously the page is subscribed by the channel 

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:25.699
 facebook twitter all the links that 

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:28.009
 found as usual in description 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:30.279
 we'll see you at the next nice video 

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:30.279
 vague
