00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
new mascara it's a two-in-one mascara

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.200 
new mascara it's a two-in-one mascara
which<00:00:49.409> is<00:00:49.559> excellent<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.430> got<00:00:50.610> one<00:00:50.909> brush

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
which is excellent it's got one brush

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.939 
which is excellent it's got one brush
but<00:00:51.659> two<00:00:51.900> different<00:00:52.259> openings<00:00:52.650> we're<00:00:52.860> gonna

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
but two different openings we're gonna

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.429 
but two different openings we're gonna
use<00:00:53.220> the<00:00:53.489> lighter<00:00:53.759> application<00:00:54.119> and<00:00:55.049> I<00:00:55.140> start

00:00:55.429 --> 00:00:55.439 
use the lighter application and I start

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:57.920 
use the lighter application and I start
at<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.680> base<00:00:56.009> of<00:00:56.369> your<00:00:56.699> lash<00:00:56.939> pushing<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
at the base of your lash pushing the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.320 
at the base of your lash pushing the
eyelash<00:00:58.320> backwards<00:00:59.040> which<00:00:59.339> emphasizes<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
eyelash backwards which emphasizes the

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.049 
eyelash backwards which emphasizes the
natural<00:01:01.049> curl<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.650> your<00:01:01.680> eyelash<00:01:02.220> I<00:01:02.489> think<00:01:02.909> a

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
natural curl in your eyelash I think a

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.719 
natural curl in your eyelash I think a
good<00:01:03.329> dose<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.780> mascara<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.470> great<00:01:05.009> because<00:01:05.579> it

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
good dose of mascara is great because it

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.060 
good dose of mascara is great because it
gives<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.150> little<00:01:06.689> feminine<00:01:07.140> sexy<00:01:08.070> edge

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
gives it that little feminine sexy edge

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.260 
gives it that little feminine sexy edge
and<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.130> think<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.400> black<00:01:11.610> against<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> pink

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and I think the black against the pink

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.120 
and I think the black against the pink
eyeshadow<00:01:12.479> really<00:01:13.079> makes<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.470> eyelash<00:01:13.829> pop

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
eyeshadow really makes the eyelash pop

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.980 
eyeshadow really makes the eyelash pop
out<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> lot<00:01:14.670> now<00:01:15.299> we're<00:01:15.509> going<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> take<00:01:15.840> that

out a lot now we're going to take that
makeup<00:01:16.350> we're<00:01:16.530> gonna<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> little<00:01:17.430> bit<00:01:17.520> of

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
makeup we're gonna have a little bit of

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.980 
makeup we're gonna have a little bit of
punch<00:01:17.939> thrown<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.420> there<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> little<00:01:18.750> bit<00:01:18.869> of

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
punch thrown in there a little bit of

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.359
