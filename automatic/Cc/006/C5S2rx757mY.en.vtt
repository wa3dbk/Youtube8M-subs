00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
have to rub at them so that will be my

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.720 
have to rub at them so that will be my
complain<00:00:28.740> about<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:29.070> one<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.490> then<00:00:29.699> I

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
see how it applies this guy's a little

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.170 
see how it applies this guy's a little
bit<00:01:11.220> tricky<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.740> apply<00:01:13.740> like<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.460> needs<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.030> bit

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
bit tricky to apply like it needs a bit

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.560 
bit tricky to apply like it needs a bit
of<00:01:15.210> work<00:01:15.689> there's<00:01:16.080> like<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> two<00:01:16.560> step<00:01:16.830> process

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
of work there's like a two step process

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.600 
of work there's like a two step process
I<00:01:18.570> guess<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.900> want<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.170> call<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:20.189> get<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.490> on

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
I guess you want to call it to get it on

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.520 
I guess you want to call it to get it on
so<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.750> don't<00:01:21.869> want<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.049> watch<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> whole

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
so obviously the tube is different for

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.800 
so obviously the tube is different for
the<00:02:28.560> full<00:02:28.740> size<00:02:28.890> but<00:02:29.670> this<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.390> wand<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:33.720> it

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
the full size but this is the wand so it

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.410 
the full size but this is the wand so it
has<00:02:33.990> like<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.230> sort<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.560> funny<00:02:34.800> shape<00:02:35.160> it's<00:02:35.420> flat

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.270 
has like a sort of funny shape it's flat
and<00:02:36.780> then<00:02:37.200> it's<00:02:37.650> rounded<00:02:39.380> so<00:02:40.380> you're<00:02:40.860> supposed

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
and then it's rounded so you're supposed

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.560 
and then it's rounded so you're supposed
to<00:02:41.459> use<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:42.330> flat<00:02:42.660> side<00:02:42.690> first<00:02:47.360> like<00:02:48.360> in<00:02:48.510> the

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
first step and then the rounded side and

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.350 
first step and then the rounded side and
it's<00:02:50.850> supposed<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.090> be<00:02:51.180> like<00:02:51.390> an<00:02:51.510> extreme

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
would agree with the extreme part yes

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.229 
would agree with the extreme part yes
sure<00:02:59.730> if<00:02:59.880> I<00:03:00.000> spend<00:03:00.330> like<00:03:00.510> 10<00:03:00.930> minutes<00:03:01.290> on<00:03:01.440> it<00:03:02.239> it

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
sure if I spend like 10 minutes on it it

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:09.470 
sure if I spend like 10 minutes on it it
will<00:03:03.450> get<00:03:03.780> really<00:03:04.910> big<00:03:05.910> volume<00:03:07.940> but<00:03:08.940> still<00:03:09.239> not

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
will get really big volume but still not

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.720 
will get really big volume but still not
where<00:03:09.720> it's<00:03:09.870> like<00:03:09.989> extreme<00:03:10.590> look<00:03:11.550> I<00:03:11.640> think

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
not flake isn't waterproof but doesn't

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.540 
not flake isn't waterproof but doesn't
really<00:05:19.300> move<00:05:19.569> throughout<00:05:19.930> the<00:05:19.990> day<00:05:20.139> and<00:05:20.710> it

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
really move throughout the day and it

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.550 
really move throughout the day and it
does<00:05:21.729> give<00:05:21.970> you<00:05:22.150> a<00:05:22.180> fair<00:05:22.599> bit<00:05:22.780> of<00:05:22.810> volume<00:05:23.470> and

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
does give you a fair bit of volume and

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.619 
does give you a fair bit of volume and
you<00:05:23.650> can<00:05:23.800> build<00:05:24.009> it<00:05:24.129> up<00:05:24.220> so<00:05:24.400> you<00:05:24.460> can<00:05:24.550> only<00:05:25.180> sort

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:25.629 
you can build it up so you can only sort

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:28.110 
you can build it up so you can only sort
of<00:05:25.690> have<00:05:25.870> one<00:05:26.169> layer<00:05:26.470> you<00:05:27.460> still<00:05:27.729> look<00:05:27.940> I<00:05:28.060> think

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
of have one layer you still look I think

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.730 
of have one layer you still look I think
would<00:05:28.360> want<00:05:28.539> to<00:05:28.599> use<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:28.870> two<00:05:29.110> steps<00:05:29.409> so<00:05:29.560> it

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
would want to use the two steps so it

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.499 
would want to use the two steps so it
would<00:05:29.860> still<00:05:30.099> be<00:05:31.090> only<00:05:31.210> a<00:05:31.360> sort<00:05:31.599> of<00:05:31.629> I<00:05:33.509> would

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
would still be only a sort of I would

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:37.230 
would still be only a sort of I would
still<00:05:34.750> count<00:05:34.900> it<00:05:35.110> as<00:05:35.199> one<00:05:35.229> layer<00:05:35.849> and<00:05:36.849> it<00:05:37.120> could

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
still count it as one layer and it could

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.999 
still count it as one layer and it could
be<00:05:37.360> sort<00:05:37.569> of<00:05:37.690> a<00:05:37.870> more<00:05:38.229> natural<00:05:38.379> look<00:05:38.740> and<00:05:38.889> then

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
be sort of a more natural look and then

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:40.230 
be sort of a more natural look and then
you<00:05:39.099> could<00:05:39.250> build<00:05:39.370> it<00:05:39.490> up<00:05:39.580> for<00:05:39.789> something<00:05:40.090> more

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
you could build it up for something more

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.990 
you could build it up for something more
