Europe just kind of a quick update on
the<00:00:04.140> server<00:00:04.410> I'm<00:00:04.680> in<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.859> process<00:00:05.009> of<00:00:05.370> moving

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
the server I'm in the process of moving

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.849 
the server I'm in the process of moving
between<00:00:05.879> houses<00:00:06.240> right<00:00:06.660> now<00:00:06.810> so<00:00:07.500> obviously

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
between houses right now so obviously

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.560 
between houses right now so obviously
the<00:00:08.040> server<00:00:08.250> has<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.519> come<00:00:08.700> with<00:00:08.849> me<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:09.059> had

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
the server has to come with me I had

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.650 
the server has to come with me I had
some<00:00:09.750> problems<00:00:10.170> moving<00:00:11.040> it<00:00:11.250> over<00:00:11.389> the<00:00:12.389> reason

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
some problems moving it over the reason

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.330 
some problems moving it over the reason
I'm<00:00:12.750> making<00:00:12.840> this<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.410> just<00:00:13.650> prior<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.040> me

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
I'm making this is just prior to me

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.609 
I'm making this is just prior to me
moving<00:00:14.820> we<00:00:15.450> actually<00:00:15.839> moved<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.260> tekkit

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
moving we actually moved the tekkit

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.790 
moving we actually moved the tekkit
server<00:00:16.830> over<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.460> my<00:00:17.640> gaming<00:00:18.029> computer<00:00:18.539> on<00:00:18.800> its

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
server over to my gaming computer on its

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.580 
server over to my gaming computer on its
asus<00:00:20.699> board<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.270> an<00:00:21.420> overclocked<00:00:21.869> 4.5

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
asus board with an overclocked 4.5

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.089 
asus board with an overclocked 4.5
gigahertz<00:00:22.949> chip<00:00:23.900> ivory<00:00:24.900> bridge<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.980> we

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
gigahertz chip ivory bridge and so we

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.650 
gigahertz chip ivory bridge and so we
decided<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.490> put<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.670> server<00:00:26.910> on<00:00:27.119> there<00:00:27.359> and

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
decided to put the server on there and

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.810 
decided to put the server on there and
the<00:00:28.109> reason<00:00:28.439> we're<00:00:28.560> placing<00:00:28.769> nukes<00:00:29.429> all<00:00:29.670> over

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
the reason we're placing nukes all over

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.040 
the reason we're placing nukes all over
the<00:00:29.910> place<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.330> because<00:00:30.660> we're<00:00:30.900> actually

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
the place is because we're actually

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.560 
the place is because we're actually
having<00:00:31.349> trouble<00:00:31.769> crashing<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:33.090> as<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.390> see

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
having trouble crashing it so as you see

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.639 
having trouble crashing it so as you see
this<00:00:33.660> guy<00:00:33.840> thought<00:00:34.020> it'd<00:00:34.140> be<00:00:34.170> funny<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.469> make<00:00:34.590> a

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
this guy thought it'd be funny to make a

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.520 
this guy thought it'd be funny to make a
swastika<00:00:35.329> so<00:00:36.329> he<00:00:36.780> actually<00:00:36.960> gets<00:00:37.200> kicked<00:00:37.469> from

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
swastika so he actually gets kicked from

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.670 
swastika so he actually gets kicked from
the<00:00:37.680> server<00:00:37.890> here<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.550> that's<00:00:39.180> neat<00:00:39.480> um<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.530> we

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
the server here so that's neat um and we

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.750 
the server here so that's neat um and we
actually<00:00:40.890> called<00:00:41.370> out<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.579> turtles<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:43.760> drag

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
actually called out the turtles and drag

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.549 
actually called out the turtles and drag
it<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.090> turtles<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.719> place<00:00:45.989> enough<00:00:46.289> nukes

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
it the turtles to place enough nukes

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.500 
it the turtles to place enough nukes
here<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:47.010> crash<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.430> server<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.969> you'll<00:00:48.270> see

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
here to crash the server and you'll see

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.529 
here to crash the server and you'll see
more<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.899> more<00:00:48.960> Turtles<00:00:49.760> but<00:00:50.760> yeah<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.270> want<00:00:51.510> to
