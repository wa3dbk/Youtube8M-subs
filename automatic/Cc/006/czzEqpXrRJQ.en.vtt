00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
like care and not care but like I'm

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:20.809 
like care and not care but like I'm
saying<00:03:19.919> like<00:03:20.099> they<00:03:20.220> do<00:03:20.280> things<00:03:20.669> like<00:03:20.760> that

think that people you know tell each

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.789 
think that people you know tell each
other<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.870> kill<00:03:25.079> themselves<00:03:25.440> because<00:03:25.560> it's

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
other to kill themselves because it's

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.280
