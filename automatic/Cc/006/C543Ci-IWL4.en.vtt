pretty<00:00:48.390> big<00:00:48.660> as<00:00:48.780> well<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.289> your<00:00:49.860> opponent<00:00:50.129> was

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
pretty big as well so your opponent was

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.400 
pretty big as well so your opponent was
struggled<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.090> find<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.420> way<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.600> get<00:00:51.870> past<00:00:52.140> him

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
struggled to find a way to get past him

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.619 
struggled to find a way to get past him
he<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.190> keeps<00:00:53.460> making<00:00:53.670> those<00:00:54.000> tackles<00:00:54.480> when

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
he just keeps making those tackles when

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.200 
he just keeps making those tackles when
you<00:00:54.750> need<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.079> most<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.530> well<00:00:55.739> he<00:00:56.129> always<00:00:56.460> he's

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
you need it most as well he always he's

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.670 
you need it most as well he always he's
always<00:00:57.329> there<00:00:57.660> making<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.199> tackle

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
always there making that tackle

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.729 
always there making that tackle
he's<00:00:59.489> also<00:00:59.670> got<00:00:59.940> very<00:01:00.000> good<00:01:00.300> positioning<00:01:01.079> 93

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
he's also got very good positioning 93

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.529 
he's also got very good positioning 93
marking<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.520> you'll<00:01:02.820> find<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.149> he<00:01:03.270> actually

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
marking and you'll find that he actually

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.000 
marking and you'll find that he actually
doesn't<00:01:03.690> get<00:01:03.960> involved<00:01:04.409> much<00:01:04.559> in<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.830> game

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
doesn't get involved much in the game

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.219 
doesn't get involved much in the game
only<00:01:05.610> makes<00:01:05.820> two<00:01:06.150> or<00:01:06.299> three<00:01:06.479> tackles<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.020> game

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
only makes two or three tackles a game

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.929 
only makes two or three tackles a game
and<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.740> think<00:01:07.799> that's<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.310> good<00:01:08.460> thing<00:01:08.520> that

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
and you I think that's a good thing that

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.190 
and you I think that's a good thing that
shows<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.390> he's<00:01:09.540> always<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.049> right

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
shows that he's always in the right

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.440 
shows that he's always in the right
position<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:10.920> your<00:01:11.430> opponent<00:01:11.640> doesn't<00:01:12.060> like

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
position so your opponent doesn't like

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.990 
position so your opponent doesn't like
go<00:01:13.049> towards<00:01:13.590> finish<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.130> find<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.580> way<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.790> get

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
go towards finish to find a way to get

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.630 
go towards finish to find a way to get
through<00:01:15.619> and<00:01:16.619> then<00:01:16.799> moving<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.400> his

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
through and then moving on to his

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.460 
through and then moving on to his
heading<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.150> know<00:01:18.270> obviously<00:01:18.720> he's<00:01:18.900> got<00:01:18.990> 90

heading you know obviously he's got 90
heading<00:01:19.830> which<00:01:19.979> i<00:01:20.130> think<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.790> best

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
heading which i think is the best

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.050 
heading which i think is the best
heading<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.159> game<00:01:23.369> or<00:01:23.640> for<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.850> non

inform anyway so my month video is just

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.969 
inform anyway so my month video is just
got<00:01:27.630> incredible<00:01:28.110> heading<00:01:28.409> from<00:01:28.650> attacking

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
got incredible heading from attacking

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.460 
got incredible heading from attacking
corners<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:30.180> wouldn't<00:01:30.600> most<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:31.020> his<00:01:31.140> headers

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
corners you wouldn't most of his headers

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.380 
corners you wouldn't most of his headers
there's<00:01:31.710> one<00:01:31.950> there<00:01:32.189> where<00:01:32.640> he<00:01:32.729> scored<00:01:33.090> and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
there's one there where he scored and

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.469 
there's one there where he scored and
then<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:33.960> defensive<00:01:34.710> hitters<00:01:35.009> as<00:01:35.159> well<00:01:35.479> he

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
then on defensive hitters as well he

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.910 
then on defensive hitters as well he
always<00:01:36.750> gets<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.200> header<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.619> if<00:01:37.799> he

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
always gets that header but if he

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.490 
always gets that header but if he
doesn't<00:01:38.310> get<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.610> header<00:01:38.960> you'll<00:01:39.960> find<00:01:40.320> that

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
doesn't get that header you'll find that

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.219 
doesn't get that header you'll find that
he<00:01:40.619> actually<00:01:41.159> puts<00:01:42.000> enough<00:01:42.240> pressure<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.720> on

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
he actually puts enough pressure to on

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.620 
he actually puts enough pressure to on
the<00:01:43.829> opponent<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.430> stuff<00:01:44.700> up<00:01:44.880> his<00:01:45.119> header<00:01:45.360> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the opponent to stuff up his header and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.749 
the opponent to stuff up his header and
you<00:01:46.020> don't<00:01:46.229> see<00:01:46.470> many<00:01:46.649> goals<00:01:47.009> scored<00:01:47.369> against

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759
