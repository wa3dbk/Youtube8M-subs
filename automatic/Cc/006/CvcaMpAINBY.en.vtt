00:00:08.090 --> 00:02:46.839 
it's 17.3 inches it's from each piece so
let's<00:00:09.090> open<00:00:09.360> it<00:00:09.660> up<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:09.929> check<00:00:09.960> it<00:00:10.230> out

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:54.319 

power<00:02:47.849> cable<00:02:50.420> power<00:02:51.420> adapter<00:02:51.689> engine<00:02:53.329> and

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
power cable power adapter engine and

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:04:18.300 

battery

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.039 

okay<00:04:19.310> doesn't<00:04:19.579> come<00:04:19.850> with<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.150> recovery<00:04:20.780> disk

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
okay doesn't come with a recovery disk

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.940 
okay doesn't come with a recovery disk
so<00:04:22.040> that<00:04:22.310> means<00:04:22.610> that<00:04:23.380> does<00:04:24.380> a<00:04:24.410> recovery

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
so that means that does a recovery

this

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:14.999 

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:27.340 

disgust<00:06:15.719> me

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.350 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.740 

there<00:06:28.350> we<00:06:28.500> go

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.700 

and<00:06:34.420> under<00:06:35.420> here<00:06:35.630> had<00:06:35.900> to<00:06:36.050> cover<00:06:36.260> this<00:06:36.440> first

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
and under here had to cover this first

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.620 
and under here had to cover this first
second<00:06:37.040> here<00:06:37.330> that's<00:06:38.330> where<00:06:39.100> you<00:06:40.100> could

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
second here that's where you could

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:44.290 
second here that's where you could
replace<00:06:41.630> the<00:06:42.050> hard<00:06:42.290> drive<00:06:42.350> or<00:06:43.120> upgrade<00:06:44.120> the

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
replace the hard drive or upgrade the

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.870 
replace the hard drive or upgrade the
RAM<00:06:44.510> so<00:06:45.020> this<00:06:46.010> has<00:06:46.340> four<00:06:46.730> gigabytes<00:06:47.210> of<00:06:47.330> RAM<00:06:48.880> it

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 
RAM so this has four gigabytes of RAM it

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.650 
RAM so this has four gigabytes of RAM it
could<00:06:50.090> be<00:06:50.180> upgradable<00:06:50.870> up<00:06:51.140> to<00:06:52.360> eight<00:06:53.360> I

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:53.660 
could be upgradable up to eight I

00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:01.120 
could be upgradable up to eight I
