some<00:00:16.980> kind<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.340> knee<00:00:17.610> problem<00:00:18.180> knee<00:00:18.510> injury<00:00:19.080> I

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
some kind of knee problem knee injury I

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.609 
some kind of knee problem knee injury I
think<00:00:21.150> one<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.510> major<00:00:21.750> reasons<00:00:22.440> is

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
think one of the major reasons is

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.820 
think one of the major reasons is
because<00:00:23.190> they<00:00:24.060> don't<00:00:24.240> know<00:00:24.390> how<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.720> relax

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
because they don't know how to relax

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.820 
because they don't know how to relax
and<00:00:26.750> open<00:00:27.750> this<00:00:27.930> area<00:00:29.780> thus<00:00:30.780> putting<00:00:31.560> too<00:00:31.680> much

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
and open this area thus putting too much

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.350 
and open this area thus putting too much
stress<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.760> knees<00:00:34.940> it<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.090> really

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
stress on the knees it is really

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.150 
stress on the knees it is really
important<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.930> open<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.500> swing<00:00:37.739> from<00:00:37.949> this

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
important to open and swing from this

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.920 
important to open and swing from this
part<00:00:38.489> from<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.879> feet<00:00:39.090> at<00:00:39.330> least<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.780> I've

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
knees softening the knees but actually

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.639 
knees softening the knees but actually
at<00:01:28.160> the<00:01:28.280> same<00:01:28.490> time<00:01:28.880> if<00:01:29.690> you<00:01:29.840> put<00:01:30.050> your<00:01:30.200> hands

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
here this area when you go down if you

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.430 
here this area when you go down if you
do<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:40.670> movement<00:01:40.940> correctly<00:01:41.750> your<00:01:42.229> body

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
do the movement correctly your body

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.880 
do the movement correctly your body
remains<00:01:42.950> sweet<00:01:43.750> you<00:01:44.750> can<00:01:44.899> feel<00:01:45.229> this<00:01:45.440> part<00:01:45.770> is

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
remains sweet you can feel this part is

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:53.310 
remains sweet you can feel this part is
going<00:01:46.100> in<00:01:49.630> so<00:01:50.630> this<00:01:50.810> part<00:01:51.080> is<00:01:51.140> going<00:01:51.380> in<00:01:51.680> and

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
going in so this part is going in and

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.170 
going in so this part is going in and
when<00:01:54.320> you<00:01:54.439> stand<00:01:54.680> up<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:55.189> can<00:01:55.369> feel<00:01:55.610> that<00:01:55.640> this

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
when you stand up you can feel that this

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.230 
when you stand up you can feel that this
part<00:01:56.450> is<00:01:56.570> pushing<00:01:56.869> your<00:01:57.170> hands<00:01:57.560> out<00:02:01.000> it's<00:02:02.000> fast

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
part is pushing your hands out it's fast

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.960 
part is pushing your hands out it's fast
putting<00:02:02.630> your<00:02:02.780> hands<00:02:03.079> out

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
putting your hands out

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.749 
putting your hands out
so<00:02:04.970> actually<00:02:05.570> whenever<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.200> go<00:02:06.380> up<00:02:06.649> and<00:02:06.979> down

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
so actually whenever you go up and down

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.150 
so actually whenever you go up and down
there<00:02:10.759> is<00:02:10.790> a<00:02:10.910> false<00:02:11.299> going<00:02:11.720> in<00:02:11.989> and<00:02:12.260> out<00:02:12.590> at<00:02:12.980> the

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
there is a false going in and out at the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.740 
there is a false going in and out at the
same<00:02:13.430> time<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.370> force<00:02:16.579> is<00:02:16.700> like<00:02:16.940> this<00:02:17.150> put

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
same time so the force is like this put

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.400 
same time so the force is like this put
your<00:02:17.900> hands<00:02:18.200> here<00:02:19.209> now<00:02:20.209> I<00:02:20.239> go<00:02:20.540> down<00:02:20.810> there<00:02:21.290> is<00:02:21.380> a

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
your hands here now I go down there is a

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.259 
your hands here now I go down there is a
force<00:02:21.769> going<00:02:21.980> in<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:23.829> when<00:02:24.829> I<00:02:24.860> stand<00:02:25.190> up<00:02:25.370> this

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
force going in and when I stand up this

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.090 
force going in and when I stand up this
part<00:02:26.690> will<00:02:26.930> push<00:02:27.200> out<00:02:27.500> from<00:02:28.370> here<00:02:29.739> like<00:02:30.739> there

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
part will push out from here like there

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.819 
part will push out from here like there
is<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.250> force<00:02:31.670> going<00:02:32.030> this<00:02:32.360> way<00:02:32.600> going<00:02:32.810> out<00:02:33.380> from

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
is a force going this way going out from

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:38.710 
is a force going this way going out from
here<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:36.310> then<00:02:37.310> when<00:02:37.489> you<00:02:37.610> go<00:02:37.760> down<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.420> force

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
here and then when you go down the force

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:56.150 
here and then when you go down the force
is<00:02:39.049> going<00:02:39.380> in<00:02:40.570> out<00:02:41.570> in<00:02:44.109> out

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:05.000
