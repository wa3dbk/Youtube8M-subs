this<00:00:27.480> gameplay<00:00:27.750> I've<00:00:28.050> actually<00:00:28.230> discovered<00:00:28.769> a

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
this gameplay I've actually discovered a

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.009 
this gameplay I've actually discovered a
pretty<00:00:29.099> good<00:00:29.279> strategy<00:00:29.789> it's<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.630> really<00:00:30.779> good

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
pretty good strategy it's a really good

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.630 
pretty good strategy it's a really good
pivot<00:00:31.230> point<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.679> middle<00:00:31.920> of<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.070> map<00:00:32.309> but

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
pivot point in the middle of the map but

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.520 
pivot point in the middle of the map but
the<00:00:32.730> downside<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.930> have<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.320> C

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the downside is that you have to have C

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.440 
the downside is that you have to have C
and<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.770> enemy<00:00:34.920> has<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.670> B<00:00:35.940> now

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
and the enemy has to have a and B now

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.880 
and the enemy has to have a and B now
I'm<00:00:36.780> just<00:00:36.870> going<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.110> assume<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.380> if<00:00:37.770> you

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
I'm just going to assume that if you

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.979 
I'm just going to assume that if you
don't<00:00:38.070> have<00:00:38.340> those<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.180> specific<00:00:39.390> order

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
don't have those in that specific order

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.569 
don't have those in that specific order
then<00:00:40.379> it's<00:00:40.739> probably<00:00:40.980> going<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> be<00:00:41.340> different

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
then it's probably going to be different

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.490 
then it's probably going to be different
but<00:00:42.149> I'm<00:00:42.329> not<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.570> sure<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.079> might<00:00:43.230> still<00:00:43.410> be

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
but I'm not so sure so it might still be

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.479 
but I'm not so sure so it might still be
worth<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> try<00:00:43.920> even<00:00:44.129> if<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.370> have<00:00:44.460> a

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
worth the try even if you have a

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.880 
worth the try even if you have a
different<00:00:44.700> variation<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.360> capture<00:00:45.660> point<00:00:45.890> so

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
different variation of capture point so

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.830 
different variation of capture point so
if<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.070> picked<00:00:47.309> up<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.640> already<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.510> pivot

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
if you picked up on it already the pivot

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.990 
if you picked up on it already the pivot
point<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.590> beauty<00:00:50.039> salon<00:00:50.370> or<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
point is in that beauty salon or the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.639 
point is in that beauty salon or the
cosmetic<00:00:51.660> salon<00:00:51.899> or<00:00:52.079> whatever<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.379> want<00:00:52.590> to

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
call it cosmetics room whatever and you

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.510 
call it cosmetics room whatever and you
just<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.559> make<00:00:55.680> sure<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.949> pivot<00:00:56.250> between

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
just have to make sure you pivot between

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.740 
just have to make sure you pivot between

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the window on the far right and the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.540 
the window on the far right and the
window<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> far<00:00:58.320> left<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.770> as<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.430> can

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.860 
window on the far left and as you can
see<00:00:59.579> sometimes<00:01:00.210> there's<00:01:00.510> not<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.690> much

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
see sometimes there's not that much

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.750 
see sometimes there's not that much
traffic<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.440> part<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.920> map<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.520> while
