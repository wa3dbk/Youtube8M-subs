00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.200
 three styles and that is about the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.700
 popular jazz in mind i have like that 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.460

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.890

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.930
 I take my roses I find the skirts 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.449
 very very little trucks in general 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.910
 summer very much and I think this 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.590
 always a bit sportier 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.240
 sporty too my first look and too 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.160
 I combined all this with mine 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.320
 sorrow of the lately I really 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.450
 like to wear and very cool 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.059
 they are the perfect match for my color 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.550
 rock the pink so pink have a bit 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.530
 Blue is thus third looking for myths on it 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.320
 and it's not like that for a long time 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.719
 yes, that can only be combined earlier 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.520
 are with jogging pants but also with 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.930
 a rock to ride the highlight 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.489
 doing that is possible 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.230
 has laces but this poland 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.030
 turn on the village if you 're still on 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.340
 the search for replacement do not bring 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.260
 definitely everyone has then definitely 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.510
 click my info card i have you 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.520
 because the puma disc fits in and gives it 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.650
 in very different cool colors there 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.420
 you can definitely search and 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.310
 Maybe I'll find one 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.200
 little village gone you know I like 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.030
 it breaks the course would have a t 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.189
 shirt can fit but also in 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.200
 shirt and power will definitely be there 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.259
 more interesting that's why I have one 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.259
 white loose fit and casual 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.700
 boyfriend shirt and attracted 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.920
 maybe a little bit more 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.840
 Direction sexy steered in the me 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.050
 link up more and have left 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.630
 then pointed 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.730
 with reference to it, start equal to twice 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.190
 with the conspicuous piece and indeed 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.640
 a chain she has a colorful pompom 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.290
 tuned 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.450
 I think the post in any case very much 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.280
 mountain green in the summer because the heating 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.620
 everyone is colorful and because i necessarily 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.630
 I wanted to wear this necklace 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.700
 You can do all that outfit 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.320
 grow around be conspicuous 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.390
 course , of course, also fits in the simple 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.850
 Underground that is a simple off 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.350
 is the right part to it and the chain 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.330
 to bring such important equations 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.680
 That's why I have cottbus times 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.710
 it's plain colors 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.140
 it's green or shows gray and two 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.940
 Slits on the side and it's on 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.369
 herb if it is on course so if I am 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.840
 Now with a very jeans pants 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.520
 why would you wear it? 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.490
 to see belly but with the head goes 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.410
 is because the rock is already pretty 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.970
 often hurry that is called rupp and therefore it 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.130
 no belly visible in the jackets 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.080
 either I have resorted to leather 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.840
 it is a jacket with christie that is 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.300
 stuck in the back and has but from the front 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.190
 not much frills 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.670
 So no big flashy silver ones 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.080
 buttons or no eye-catching 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.730
 zipper and I thought so 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.220
 important for otherwise that would be back 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.709
 bit too much with the chain at the 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.630
 I love schumann flat 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.190
 singing busan I feel then one 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.440
 a bit safer or not 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.300
 understood and can in such an outfit 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.670
 really go everywhere and feel 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.440
 well the third look is something 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.380
 cozier and thought I have me 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.120
 in this outfit we also in the 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.280
 spring in the summer somehow 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.650
 it does not seem to have days in between 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.850
 so warm and I have to frostbite 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.680
 protect yourself from it 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.540
 That's why I have a cardigan one 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.630
 Combine what cardigans keep great 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.000
 Choice I find and look good too 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.890
 my is pretty striking it 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.980
 not close buddy has his front 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.560
 Waterfall collar and pretty neon 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.970
 colors yellow or green I can 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.709
 Definitely define it then 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.019
 pink and that fits perfectly with mine 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.150
 rock as a top part I thought so one 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.000
 loud cardigan definitely needs 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.890
 What 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.540
 Silently as a judgment I have him completely 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.530
 simply chosen and white knows there can 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.020
 you do not do anything wrong 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.090
 in a flashy cardigan the 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.950
 really has a colorful pattern or 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.510
 Gaudy colors you should rather 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.460
 just stay under it so I like 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.200
 the so very happy but if he for 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.420
 For example, with a cardigan that is not so 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.310
 is conspicuous and you outfit the whole 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.230
 spice up a bit then you can 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.640
 Of course you look forward to beautiful every kind 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.590
 fall back if you have one too 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.660
 frostbite since like me and not enough 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.400
 of cardigans then looks up 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.690
 be definitely in my info card i 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.850
 I already said that I prefer 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.860
 miniskirts in combination with flat 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.230
 wearing shoes and that's the way it is 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.810
 that's my favorite but if i am 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.520
 would have to make an exception then 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.410
 rather wedges ankle boots because of me 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.790
 in which one can also run well 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.790
 then she does not necessarily come 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.530
 rigged or so before and why 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.940
 I do not have an heel ankle boot too 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.680
 this outfit are combined 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.990
 suede boots duck in the middle of 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.400
 have golden zipper accessories 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.050
 I do not like this outfit either 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.330
 conspicuous for the chain from numero two 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.220
 but I think they are cute too 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.640
 And in any case fits the look that 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.130
 is a golden long chain with fasting 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.860
 at the ends almost still pearl but rather 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.100
 so inconspicuous and so in pastel tones 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.560
 which I think is quite cute but all the pertinent 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.210
 the chain definitely outfit and 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.860
 especially to my shoes with the 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.660
 golden zippers if I love 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.820
 Hope the video has pleased you 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.590
 I look forward to the trees 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.180
 of course, quite a lot of comments 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.390
 Of course, what are you on the heart 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.640
 but is very important to 123 what 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.890
 i liked you i would be larsen today 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.380
 I take number two I found that 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.750
 pretty cool and I'm looking forward to it 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.000
