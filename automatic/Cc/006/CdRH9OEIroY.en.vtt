auto dimming rear view mirror which is
something<00:02:13.050> simple<00:02:13.620> but<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.099> really<00:02:14.220> makes<00:02:14.489> a

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
think Chrysler's done well

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.070 
think Chrysler's done well
with<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:22.980> 200<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:23.850> they<00:02:24.420> lengthen<00:02:24.930> the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
with this 200 is they lengthen the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.760 
with this 200 is they lengthen the
wheelbase<00:02:25.850> from<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.970> previous<00:02:27.770> midsize

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
wheelbase from the previous midsize

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.740 
wheelbase from the previous midsize
sedan<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.430> they<00:02:29.550> used<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.850> have<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.270> Sebring

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
sedan that they used to have the Sebring

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.530 
sedan that they used to have the Sebring
and<00:02:31.580> it's<00:02:32.580> got<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.790> little<00:02:33.030> bit<00:02:33.150> more<00:02:33.390> of<00:02:33.480> a

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
and it's got a little bit more of a

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.150 
and it's got a little bit more of a
softer<00:02:33.990> ride<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:34.620> even<00:02:34.890> though<00:02:34.950> it's<00:02:35.100> a

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
softer ride so even though it's a

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.160 
softer ride so even though it's a
midsize<00:02:35.550> sedan<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:36.360> almost<00:02:36.720> feel<00:02:37.110> like

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
really do think that they addressed the

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.009 
really do think that they addressed the

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
much so that I would say that you don't

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.500
