love things like that but honestly

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.000

Kingdom<00:00:47.510> Hearts<00:00:47.660> isn't<00:00:48.050> mainly<00:00:48.500> Disney<00:00:48.829> and

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
Kingdom Hearts isn't mainly Disney and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.799 
Kingdom Hearts isn't mainly Disney and
they<00:00:49.129> have<00:00:49.250> love<00:00:49.460> rules<00:00:49.730> like<00:00:49.850> that<00:00:50.030> but<00:00:50.570> Sora

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
and Kyrie shouldn't be like that in my

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.250 
and Kyrie shouldn't be like that in my
opinion<00:00:52.820> just<00:00:52.850> because<00:00:53.329> it's<00:00:53.449> a<00:00:53.510> Disney<00:00:53.809> game

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
opinion just because it's a Disney game

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.229 
opinion just because it's a Disney game
and<00:00:54.559> it's<00:00:54.800> partly<00:00:55.100> Disney<00:00:55.430> doesn't<00:00:55.670> mean<00:00:55.940> as

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
and it's partly Disney doesn't mean as

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:57.760 
and it's partly Disney doesn't mean as
to<00:00:56.570> end<00:00:56.750> up<00:00:56.870> like<00:00:56.989> every<00:00:57.199> Disney<00:00:57.469> movie

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
together it wouldn't really mean

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.420

through King words 2 and a lot of the
other<00:01:50.149> games<00:01:50.329> you<00:01:50.570> would<00:01:50.689> see<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:50.990> struggle

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
other games you would see the struggle

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.749 
other games you would see the struggle
sort<00:01:51.470> of<00:01:51.530> goes<00:01:51.680> through<00:01:51.710> but<00:01:52.340> now<00:01:52.430> that<00:01:52.579> it's

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
sort of goes through but now that it's

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.130 
sort of goes through but now that it's
at<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.030> end<00:01:53.149> of<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.329> saga<00:01:53.630> ball<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:53.960> mean

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
at the end of the saga ball you mean

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.380 
at the end of the saga ball you mean
anything<00:01:54.350> so<00:01:54.680> I<00:01:54.740> think<00:01:55.009> it's<00:01:55.159> kind<00:01:55.460> of<00:01:55.520> useless

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
anything so I think it's kind of useless

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.110 
anything so I think it's kind of useless
but<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.930> only<00:01:58.110> way<00:01:58.350> I'd<00:01:58.500> understand<00:01:58.980> fit<00:01:59.220> to

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
but the only way I'd understand fit to

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.850 
but the only way I'd understand fit to
have<00:02:00.300> been<00:02:00.510> if<00:02:00.660> it<00:02:01.140> was<00:02:01.290> after<00:02:01.590> they<00:02:01.680> defeated

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
have been if it was after they defeated

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.370 
have been if it was after they defeated
a<00:02:02.220> Nord<00:02:02.520> like<00:02:02.760> maybe<00:02:03.210> soraka's<00:02:03.870> now<00:02:04.140> that's

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
a Nord like maybe soraka's now that's

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.710 
a Nord like maybe soraka's now that's
always<00:02:04.530> free<00:02:04.800> from<00:02:04.950> all<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.450> darkness<00:02:06.450> and

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
always free from all the darkness and

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.150 
always free from all the darkness and
repair<00:02:07.080> he<00:02:07.170> could<00:02:07.320> enjoy<00:02:07.530> his<00:02:07.560> life<00:02:07.800> a<00:02:07.950> little

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
repair he could enjoy his life a little

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.999 
repair he could enjoy his life a little
more<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:08.520> he<00:02:08.670> could<00:02:08.790> go<00:02:08.880> out<00:02:09.000> with<00:02:09.030> Kyrie<00:02:09.509> and

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
more so he could go out with Kyrie and

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.200 
more so he could go out with Kyrie and
enjoy<00:02:11.009> himself<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.670> maybe<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.060> would<00:02:12.150> work

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
enjoy himself so maybe it would work

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.700 
enjoy himself so maybe it would work

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
someone right now because the whole game

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.479 
someone right now because the whole game
is<00:02:48.120> kind<00:02:48.300> of<00:02:48.360> been<00:02:48.570> based<00:02:48.870> around<00:02:49.220> theme<00:02:50.220> of

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
is kind of been based around theme of

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.180 
is kind of been based around theme of
friendship<00:02:50.970> so<00:02:51.570> saying<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.530> these<00:02:52.890> two<00:02:53.040> she

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
friendship so saying that these two she

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.530 
friendship so saying that these two she
fell<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.430> love<00:02:53.580> with<00:02:53.730> Emily<00:02:53.940> makes<00:02:54.150> sense<00:02:54.420> I

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
fell in love with Emily makes sense I

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.940 
fell in love with Emily makes sense I
think<00:02:54.570> friends<00:02:55.110> should<00:02:55.260> be<00:02:55.380> more<00:02:55.530> important

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
think friends should be more important

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.680 
think friends should be more important
to<00:02:56.040> him<00:02:56.190> because<00:02:56.670> he<00:02:56.850> won<00:02:57.030> in<00:02:57.150> love<00:02:57.330> he<00:02:57.570> would

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
to him because he won in love he would

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.000 
to him because he won in love he would
be<00:02:57.840> saying<00:02:58.020> that<00:02:58.080> love<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.440> more<00:02:58.470> important<00:02:58.890> to

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
be saying that love is more important to

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.890 
be saying that love is more important to
him<00:02:59.160> but<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.400> is<00:02:59.520> in<00:02:59.730> friendship<00:03:00.180> is<00:03:00.330> so<00:03:00.870> I

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
him but it is in friendship is so I

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.240 
him but it is in friendship is so I
think<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.410> love<00:03:01.590> shouldn't<00:03:01.830> really<00:03:02.010> come

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
think the love shouldn't really come

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
think it would be effective for the

think it would be effective for the
story<00:03:54.720> but<00:03:55.410> I<00:03:55.440> think<00:03:55.830> it<00:03:55.920> wouldn't<00:03:56.130> really

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
story but I think it wouldn't really

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.740 
story but I think it wouldn't really
help<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:56.610> story<00:03:56.820> at<00:03:56.970> all<00:03:57.060> all<00:03:57.299> it<00:03:57.420> would<00:03:57.510> do<00:03:57.630> is

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
help the story at all all it would do is

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.660 
help the story at all all it would do is
just<00:03:57.780> push<00:03:58.049> it<00:03:58.200> back<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.530> part<00:03:59.220> where<00:03:59.400> no<00:03:59.580> one

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
just push it back to a part where no one

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.520 
just push it back to a part where no one
will<00:03:59.790> really<00:04:00.030> like<00:04:00.150> it<00:04:00.209> anymore<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:01.230> in<00:04:01.410> my

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
will really like it anymore so in my

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.620 
will really like it anymore so in my
opinion<00:04:01.709> that<00:04:02.220> you<00:04:03.120> should<00:04:03.150> just<00:04:03.420> keep<00:04:03.570> going

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
opinion that you should just keep going

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.210 
opinion that you should just keep going
how<00:04:03.930> they<00:04:04.049> are<00:04:04.230> they<00:04:04.530> shouldn't<00:04:04.799> have<00:04:05.190> a

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
how they are they shouldn't have a

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.710 
how they are they shouldn't have a
relationship<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:06.090> me<00:04:06.239> it<00:04:06.480> just<00:04:06.510> doesn't
