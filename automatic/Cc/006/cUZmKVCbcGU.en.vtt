00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
labor filling and then we're making the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.000 
labor filling and then we're making the
cooked<00:00:50.600> out<00:00:50.750> of<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:50.960> way<00:00:51.140> my<00:00:51.380> mother<00:00:51.620> made<00:00:51.829> it

cooked out of the way my mother made it

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.900 
cooked out of the way my mother made it
the<00:00:52.370> defined<00:00:52.940> activity<00:00:53.059> with<00:00:53.809> that<00:00:54.020> which<00:00:54.770> is

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
the defined activity with that which is

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.430 
the defined activity with that which is
well<00:00:55.910> we<00:00:56.390> call<00:00:56.600> it<00:00:56.630> the<00:00:56.720> shape<00:00:56.960> of<00:00:57.079> a<00:00:57.170> flying

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
well we call it the shape of a flying

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.560 
well we call it the shape of a flying
saucer<00:00:57.829> and<00:00:58.070> you're<00:00:58.309> gonna<00:00:58.430> see<00:00:58.700> why<00:00:58.910> when<00:00:59.420> I'm

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
saucer and you're gonna see why when I'm

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.780 
saucer and you're gonna see why when I'm
finished<00:00:59.960> now<00:01:00.230> here's<00:01:00.980> the<00:01:01.160> twist<00:01:01.280> we're

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
finished now here's the twist we're

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.119 
finished now here's the twist we're
making<00:01:02.149> a<00:01:02.180> heart<00:01:02.480> healthy<00:01:02.780> proof<00:01:03.230> that<00:01:03.410> and<00:01:03.649> if

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
making a heart healthy proof that and if

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.610 
making a heart healthy proof that and if
that<00:01:04.280> sounds<00:01:04.790> like<00:01:04.820> a<00:01:04.969> contradiction<00:01:05.500> it<00:01:06.500> is

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
that sounds like a contradiction it is

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.730 
that sounds like a contradiction it is
but<00:01:07.159> we're<00:01:07.850> going<00:01:07.970> to<00:01:08.060> do<00:01:08.150> it<00:01:08.270> anyway<00:01:08.740> instead

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
but we're going to do it anyway instead

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.680 
but we're going to do it anyway instead
of<00:01:09.830> using<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.310> traditional<00:01:10.430> ground<00:01:11.060> lamb<00:01:11.330> or

this<00:02:09.680> a<00:02:09.920> day<00:02:10.100> ahead<00:02:10.280> of<00:02:10.490> time<00:02:10.700> so<00:02:11.030> that<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.780> was

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
this a day ahead of time so that it was

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.820 
this a day ahead of time so that it was
set<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.500> become<00:02:13.130> much<00:02:13.310> easier<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:14.060> work<00:02:14.240> with

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
set and become much easier to work with

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.140 
set and become much easier to work with
traditionally<00:02:15.830> this<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.130> made<00:02:16.370> with<00:02:16.880> butter

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
traditionally this is made with butter

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.630 
traditionally this is made with butter
but<00:02:17.590> because<00:02:18.590> we're<00:02:18.770> trying<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.160> be<00:02:19.280> healthy

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
we've made this with olive oil so it's

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.390 
we've made this with olive oil so it's
not<00:02:22.790> quite<00:02:23.270> as<00:02:23.600> solid<00:02:24.200> as<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:25.010> would<00:02:25.370> be

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
not quite as solid as it would be

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.980 
not quite as solid as it would be
traditionally<00:02:26.150> but<00:02:26.330> I'm<00:02:26.480> going<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.690> work<00:02:26.840> with

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
I can make this pretty thin and I must

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.390 
I can make this pretty thin and I must
say<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.030> Turkey<00:04:21.690> is<00:04:22.520> easy<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:24.240> work<00:04:24.450> with<00:04:24.510> and

hand and if it breaks apart you just fix
it<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:37.950> just<00:04:38.160> take<00:04:38.340> another<00:04:38.639> piece<00:04:38.940> of<00:04:39.090> meat

they can take a spoon and just about a

they can take a spoon and just about a
heaping<00:04:48.950> tablespoon<00:04:49.950> of<00:04:51.290> filling<00:04:52.290> should<00:04:52.320> do

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
heaping tablespoon of filling should do

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.469 
heaping tablespoon of filling should do
it<00:04:52.800> you<00:04:52.979> put<00:04:53.220> it<00:04:53.310> right<00:04:53.460> in<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:53.940> center<00:04:54.240> of<00:04:54.270> the

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
it you put it right in the center of the

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.480 
it you put it right in the center of the
shell<00:04:56.030> you<00:04:57.030> don't<00:04:57.240> have<00:04:57.360> to<00:04:57.479> be<00:04:57.600> precise<00:04:58.490> and

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
shell you don't have to be precise and

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:06.409 
shell you don't have to be precise and
you<00:05:00.479> fold<00:05:00.900> over<00:05:01.790> the<00:05:02.790> top<00:05:03.030> of<00:05:03.389> the<00:05:03.930> shell<00:05:05.419> maybe

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
you fold over the top of the shell maybe

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.610 
you fold over the top of the shell maybe
what<00:05:06.720> your<00:05:06.870> hands<00:05:07.080> again<00:05:07.710> you<00:05:08.310> can<00:05:08.520> cold<00:05:08.790> and

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
what your hands again you can cold and

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:19.980 
what your hands again you can cold and
work<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.960> meat<00:05:13.610> so<00:05:14.610> that<00:05:14.639> it<00:05:14.940> closes

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:24.059 

and<00:05:20.560> again<00:05:20.919> if<00:05:21.669> there's<00:05:22.030> a<00:05:22.150> little<00:05:22.740> hole<00:05:23.740> you

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:24.069 
and again if there's a little hole you

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:25.559 
and again if there's a little hole you
can<00:05:24.400> just<00:05:24.580> take<00:05:24.729> some<00:05:24.970> more<00:05:25.150> of<00:05:25.210> the<00:05:25.389> shell

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:25.569 
can just take some more of the shell

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:31.230 
can just take some more of the shell
mixture<00:05:26.819> pass<00:05:27.819> it<00:05:28.060> over<00:05:29.220> and<00:05:30.220> continue<00:05:30.970> to

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
mixture pass it over and continue to

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.110 
mixture pass it over and continue to
work<00:05:31.449> it<00:05:32.580> and<00:05:33.580> that's<00:05:34.449> all<00:05:34.690> there<00:05:34.900> is<00:05:35.050> to<00:05:35.289> it

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
work it and that's all there is to it

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.430 
work it and that's all there is to it
now<00:05:37.120> do<00:05:37.180> you<00:05:37.300> understand<00:05:37.750> what<00:05:37.960> I<00:05:37.990> meant<00:05:38.080> by

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
now do you understand what I meant by

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.409 
now do you understand what I meant by
the<00:05:39.310> Flying<00:05:39.610> Saucer<00:05:39.729> shape<00:05:40.419> as<00:05:41.319> you<00:05:41.560> can<00:05:41.710> see

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
the Flying Saucer shape as you can see

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:48.059 
the Flying Saucer shape as you can see
it's<00:05:43.419> flat<00:05:43.630> on<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.050> bottom<00:05:44.199> and<00:05:45.630> domed<00:05:46.710> on<00:05:47.710> the

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:48.069 
it's flat on the bottom and domed on the

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:50.879 
it's flat on the bottom and domed on the
top<00:05:49.020> and<00:05:50.020> that's<00:05:50.199> the<00:05:50.349> way<00:05:50.500> it's<00:05:50.680> going<00:05:50.830> to

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
top and that's the way it's going to

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:54.390 
top and that's the way it's going to
cook<00:05:52.050> so<00:05:53.050> ideally<00:05:53.650> you<00:05:53.830> will<00:05:54.009> take<00:05:54.250> the

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.400 
cook so ideally you will take the

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.310 
cook so ideally you will take the
completed<00:05:54.940> Cooke<00:05:55.120> data<00:05:55.360> put<00:05:55.870> it<00:05:55.900> in<00:05:56.139> your

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
completed Cooke data put it in your

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.850 
completed Cooke data put it in your
refrigerator<00:05:56.470> for<00:05:57.220> maybe<00:05:57.849> an<00:05:57.940> hour<00:05:58.740> let<00:05:59.740> it

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
refrigerator for maybe an hour let it

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.240 
refrigerator for maybe an hour let it
get<00:06:00.039> nice<00:06:00.340> and<00:06:00.699> firm<00:06:01.330> and<00:06:01.599> then<00:06:02.560> you<00:06:02.889> cook<00:06:03.099> it

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
get nice and firm and then you cook it

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.719 
get nice and firm and then you cook it
now

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
now

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:06.510 
now

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.279 
some people like to bake it we like to
boil<00:06:06.880> that's<00:06:07.599> the<00:06:07.840> way<00:06:07.990> it's<00:06:08.139> done

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.289

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.120 
prefer if you boil it be very careful
when<00:06:13.449> you<00:06:13.539> put<00:06:13.780> it<00:06:13.900> into<00:06:14.139> the<00:06:14.470> boiling<00:06:14.650> water

when you put it into the boiling water

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.540 
when you put it into the boiling water
