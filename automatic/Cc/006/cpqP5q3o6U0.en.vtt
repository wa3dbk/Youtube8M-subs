00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
before the time of that basically

showing you how they all met and what

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.100 
showing you how they all met and what
how<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.100> whole<00:00:44.460> zombies<00:00:44.969> storyline<00:00:45.210> came<00:00:45.930> to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
how this whole zombies storyline came to

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.930 
how this whole zombies storyline came to
be<00:00:46.260> about<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:47.010> they<00:00:47.160> did<00:00:47.340> say<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:47.789> is

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
be about so they did say that this is

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.520 
be about so they did say that this is
the<00:00:48.090> largest<00:00:48.450> scale<00:00:48.840> map<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.230> they've<00:00:49.410> ever

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
the largest scale map that they've ever

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.319 
the largest scale map that they've ever
done<00:00:49.800> for<00:00:50.160> zombies<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.760> something<00:00:51.120> bigger

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
done for zombies so something bigger

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.819 
done for zombies so something bigger
than<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.719> know<00:00:51.809> mob<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.140> dead<00:00:52.230> was<00:00:52.559> fairly

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
than you know mob of the dead was fairly

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.529 
than you know mob of the dead was fairly
big<00:00:53.129> something<00:00:53.789> even<00:00:54.090> bigger<00:00:54.239> than<00:00:54.390> that

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
big something even bigger than that

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.180 
big something even bigger than that
bigger<00:00:54.930> than<00:00:55.199> anything<00:00:55.559> they've<00:00:55.680> done<00:00:55.860> before

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
bigger than anything they've done before

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.860 
bigger than anything they've done before
and<00:00:56.399> I'm<00:00:57.180> guessing<00:00:57.480> there's<00:00:57.539> going<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> be<00:00:57.809> a

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
and I'm guessing there's going to be a

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.479 
and I'm guessing there's going to be a
mix<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.289> inside<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.829> outside<00:00:58.980> with<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
mix of inside and outside with the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.310 
mix of inside and outside with the
trenches<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.660> kind<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.109> little

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
trenches and the kind of like little

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.660 
trenches and the kind of like little
roomy<00:01:01.770> bits<00:01:01.949> that<00:01:02.039> we've<00:01:02.190> seen<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.520> this

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
roomy bits that we've seen in this

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.149 
roomy bits that we've seen in this
trailer<00:01:03.030> as<00:01:03.270> well<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.750> another<00:01:04.500> big<00:01:04.769> thing<00:01:04.799> is

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
trailer as well and another big thing is

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.649

called it the dieselpunk twist to the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.499 
called it the dieselpunk twist to the
map<00:01:29.189> which<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.520> basically<00:01:29.790> kind<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.240> retro

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
map which is basically kind of a retro

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.840 
map which is basically kind of a retro
futuristic<00:01:31.229> look<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.100> it's<00:01:32.220> got<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.430> retro

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
futuristic look so it's got that retro

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.999 
futuristic look so it's got that retro
feel<00:01:33.119> twix<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.600> set<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:33.960> world<00:01:34.229> war<00:01:34.409> one<00:01:34.680> kind

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
feel twix is set in world war one kind

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.440 
feel twix is set in world war one kind
of<00:01:35.130> time<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.670> it's<00:01:35.820> got<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:36.000> futuristic

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
of time but it's got that futuristic

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.319 
of time but it's got that futuristic
robotic<00:01:37.409> look<00:01:37.650> with<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.460> robots<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
robotic look with the robots and the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.510 
robotic look with the robots and the
other<00:01:39.900> easter<00:01:40.470> eggs<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.799> know<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.070> tanks<00:01:41.400> and

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
things that have put into the map as

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.420 
things that have put into the map as
well<00:01:43.170> which<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.380> really<00:01:43.530> really<00:01:43.920> cool<00:01:44.220> they've

put<00:01:44.700> two<00:01:45.000> new<00:01:45.240> weapons<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.200> they've<00:01:46.350> told<00:01:46.590> us

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
put two new weapons that they've told us

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.050 
put two new weapons that they've told us
about<00:01:46.950> at<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.399> minute<00:01:47.700> maybe<00:01:47.850> there's<00:01:48.030> more

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
about at the minute maybe there's more

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.149 
about at the minute maybe there's more
in<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.840> future<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.350> haven't<00:01:49.649> been<00:01:49.740> told

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
in the future that we haven't been told

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.649 
in the future that we haven't been told
about<00:01:50.340> especially<00:01:50.790> wound<00:01:51.149> weapons<00:01:51.540> because

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
about especially wound weapons because

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.120 
about especially wound weapons because
they<00:01:51.780> did<00:01:51.960> say<00:01:52.140> there<00:01:52.259> was<00:01:52.439> another<00:01:52.770> wonder

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
they did say there was another wonder

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.160 
they did say there was another wonder
weapon<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.640> we<00:01:53.880> haven't<00:01:54.060> seen<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.509> yet<00:01:54.720> and

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
weapon and we haven't seen it yet and

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.109 
weapon and we haven't seen it yet and
unless<00:01:55.590> these<00:01:55.770> artland<00:01:56.189> weapons<00:01:56.610> but<00:01:56.850> anyway

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
unless these artland weapons but anyway

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.940 
unless these artland weapons but anyway
I'm<00:01:57.180> going<00:01:57.420> off<00:01:57.540> track<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.259> two<00:01:58.469> new<00:01:58.590> weapons

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
I'm going off track the two new weapons

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.310 
I'm going off track the two new weapons
are<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.130> MGO<00:01:59.610> 8<00:01:59.759> machine<00:02:00.210> gun<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.840> Moses

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
are the MGO 8 machine gun and the Moses

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.469 
are the MGO 8 machine gun and the Moses
starting<00:02:01.799> pistol<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.610> that's<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.969> pistol

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
starting pistol so that's the pistol

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.760 
starting pistol so that's the pistol
that<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.630> start<00:02:03.869> off<00:02:04.020> with<00:02:04.229> is<00:02:04.259> brand-new

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
that you start off with is brand-new

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.830 
that you start off with is brand-new
which<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.159> cool<00:02:05.430> also<00:02:06.180> we<00:02:06.299> now<00:02:06.450> have<00:02:06.659> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
which is cool also we now have the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.630 
which is cool also we now have the
zombies<00:02:07.170> tank<00:02:07.500> which<00:02:07.710> moves<00:02:07.979> around<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.459> map

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
zombies tank which moves around the map

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.520 
zombies tank which moves around the map
whether<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.209> control<00:02:09.660> where<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:09.929> goes<00:02:10.080> or

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
whether you can control where it goes or

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.770 
whether you can control where it goes or
when<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.890> goes<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.340> yet<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:12.000> be<00:02:12.030> seen<00:02:12.120> really

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
when it goes is yet to be seen really

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.400 
when it goes is yet to be seen really
and<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.110> guess

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
and I guess

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.170 
and I guess
a<00:02:13.440> little<00:02:13.740> bit<00:02:13.830> like<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.100> books<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.580> transit

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
a little bit like the books in transit

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.030 
a little bit like the books in transit
maybe<00:02:15.630> it's<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.900> little<00:02:16.020> bit<00:02:16.260> easier<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.650> work

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
maybe it's a little bit easier to work

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.310 
maybe it's a little bit easier to work
or<00:02:17.490> maybe<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:18.000> can<00:02:18.150> control<00:02:18.510> how<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.050> when<00:02:19.200> it

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
or maybe you can control how and when it

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.630 
or maybe you can control how and when it
goes<00:02:19.470> like<00:02:19.680> i<00:02:19.800> said<00:02:19.980> i<00:02:20.160> don't<00:02:20.310> know<00:02:20.370> at<00:02:20.550> the

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
goes like i said i don't know at the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.950 
goes like i said i don't know at the
minute<00:02:20.910> but<00:02:21.300> I've<00:02:21.390> got<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> feeling<00:02:21.690> that's

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
minute but I've got a feeling that's

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.870 
minute but I've got a feeling that's
going<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.200> help<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.530> in<00:02:22.680> some<00:02:22.980> way<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.460> then

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
going to help you in some way and then

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.190 
going to help you in some way and then
finally<00:02:24.120> of<00:02:24.360> course<00:02:24.480> we've<00:02:24.870> got<00:02:24.990> this<00:02:25.140> a

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
finally of course we've got this a

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.260 
finally of course we've got this a
thousand<00:02:25.800> foot<00:02:25.920> robot<00:02:26.280> or<00:02:26.400> these<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> thousand

thousand foot robot or these a thousand
foot<00:02:27.390> robots<00:02:27.840> didn't<00:02:28.410> really<00:02:28.590> specify

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
foot robots didn't really specify

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.980 
foot robots didn't really specify
whether<00:02:29.280> is<00:02:29.430> one<00:02:29.790> or<00:02:30.060> many<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.540> them<00:02:30.870> or

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
whether is one or many of them or

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.270 
whether is one or many of them or
whether<00:02:31.080> it's<00:02:31.320> a<00:02:31.380> box<00:02:31.620> round<00:02:31.920> or<00:02:32.130> whether
