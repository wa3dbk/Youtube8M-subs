00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 The network was discovered google there 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.040
 a space elevator the man wanted 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.839
 A plane with a chocolate bar 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:13.290
 kidnap there you should be more there 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.849
 now the field just looks at me 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.590
 since I am small and there is nothing 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.199
 better than at night the view sky 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.490
 to wander and to watch stars 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.380
 That's why I always find the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.580
 astronauts met her flying high there 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.470
 a longer time on a space station 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.210
 I live my strengths the awesome 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.070
 outlook on what was last again 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.570
 a photo taken of europe at night 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.189
 I once watched you now times like 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.020
 horny is that bitter that one with 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.670
 space tourism a lot of coal why 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.750
 has also thought google the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.250
 search engine gone announced now 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.230
 that you have been a long time already 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.469
 space elevator would work 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.120
 in turn, the people of Himmelsberg 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.350
 catapult 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.430
 Google itself is in fact at the brenz 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.200
 google ickx and there will be the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.239
 different futuristic ideas 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.070
 worked on it in google 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.750
 so among other things also the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.520
 google dates glasses google clarifies and 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.050
 even the cars drive the world 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.850
 come lift his google thousand 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.859
 times cheaper than the people one 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.510
 rocket and then up in the 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.830
 to shoot the sky but unfortunately always 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.240
 even google to the limits of physics 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.710
 to move people up 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.780
 you would need to street is 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.369
 would have to be about a hundred times more stable 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.170
 as we already know today technically 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.460
 it can unfortunately be made 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.200
 it will take a while for Google to do that 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.509
 realize this space travel already 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.189
 Can not do something for today's question 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.630
 bring you if it's this space travel 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.610
 already you would follow the users 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.990
 she likes to drive up in the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.430
 comments I personally would have been afraid 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.320
 with some unpleasant person 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.850
 get stuck I mean how 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.040
 then it may take a while for the technician 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.040
 still helping to fly out of it 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.690
 thanks sometimes as very annoying 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.190
 security checks at the airport 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.780
 The number of aircraft leading to 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.580
 luck I went back my faith 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.530
 weapons like knife pistols logs 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.490
 directly the metal detector all 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.050
 liquids if you of the 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.180
 security guards right before the flight 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.190
 torn from his hands and destroyed 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.500
 So you have to be pretty creative 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.900
 his and in the plane to the leading 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.030
 rip out the seat to run amok 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.830
 I imagine rather difficult before a 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.920
 should the creative fin came in february 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.240
 2014 but a very stark idea the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.009
 film wanted the plane on the way from 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.090
 Amsterdam to Hong Kong in lead with it 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.370
 in the pilot to the olympic 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.780
 winter games after sochi fli you have 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.220
 I 'll kill myself either 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.080
 or you fly with Olympic 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.940
 winter games with the guides wrapped 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.620
 he is threatened in several cover 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.989
 the crew with an incredible 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.310
 dangerous weapon since this weapon like that 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.850
 I'm extremely dangerous 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.010
 extra for these consequences starts in evil 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.540
 internet but this weapon for 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.310
 you got worried by showing yourself 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.350
 thanks to a Nigerian 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.390
 smuggler rings the weapon is here now 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.260
 the fin wanted to kidnap the plane 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.880
 with a toblerone rule according to the cred 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.830
 is the man with the tobler high 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.110
 Regular direction cockpit and swung 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.459
 as a sword was injured 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.500
 of course no one and this abduction 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:57.769
 the man became without his tuba 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.769
 usually tied up relatively quickly 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.420
 cut and taken into custody 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.400
 He has arrived in Hong Kong a 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.960
 Mental hospital instituted and 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.310
 You have a big deal now 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.320
 against itself at the running of the fin itself 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.970
 says it was a great fun had the 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.440
 save other flight passengers by saving 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.750
 I'll want the thing with a 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.820
 tree or a glass or a user 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.560
 better for him assumed new items 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.820
 hypothetically asked with what kind of one 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.860
 candy would make you a plane 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.390
 Want to lead me in 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.830
 the comments and hello mr staeck nsa 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.450
 There are many in the world today 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.070
 Ministries that have not been clarified until today 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.600
 could be white , for example 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.459
 no one knows exactly how the sound is made 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.500
 if cats purr or if it is the 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.570
 yeti really gives it or if it does 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.010
 Pretty counselor man was the same 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.990
 applies to the monster of Loch Ness 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.850
 some want to have seen when wet 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.050
 others think that was a lie and 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.820
 others believe that at 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.560
 Nancy could trade my beltfish 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.090
 but just apple delivers now 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.680
 the proof that they really exist 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.780
 net how can you namely the rp 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.550
 kartendienst maps admire if you 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.110
 There after Loch Ness simply scotland 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.820
 look for it and then at the northernmost tip 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.400
 the whole looks a bit bigger 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.080
 are your network so at least something 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.400
 it could be so i see there 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.840
 actually a huge body with 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.700
 Two already flowed through the water 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.410
 rather, that's not happening at all 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.730
 monsters that are either in the shade 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.830
 or ship for small 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.360
 all doubts already want from the 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.950
 clear away kerry campbell the 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.169
 Chairman of the monster of Loch Ness 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.760
 He fanclubs his people through the whole 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.780
 have been audited for over half a year 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.830
 come now in the end 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.830
 in the net 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.229
 for the high tech what do you think that 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.349
 be nancy what else should it be 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.910
 I like to write in the comments 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.710
 where we are already in conspiracies 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.060
 even theories are in the sequel 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.770
 I had to think of myself 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.030
 little to mars reported and in the 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.830
 it's about a study that says 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.270
 in scan the crystals to potential 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.830
 who was now completely hers 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.479
 I please me very much when a download

 that others see this video too 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.710
 For the manufacturer you can see the video 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.539
 has ever seen then writes yet 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.520
 Kerstin dominated the comments because 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.050
