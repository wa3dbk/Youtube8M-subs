00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.420
 siege 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:46.180
 this is probably one of the most social 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.879
 significant events in any game and in the case of 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.489
 with app cache the most significant win 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.010
 fame castle territory dreams 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.829
 any clan leader but not everyone is at it 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.559
 able to open some curtains today 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.719
 and voila the mystery of the process of asad in order to 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.539
 Russian servers, everyone could start playing 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:07.439
 armed with knowledge you are knowledge 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:07.439
 great power 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.829
 so asadova arc edge is the battle for 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.929
 territory that turns just 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.420
 enchanting action and carries 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:27.880
 a huge rush of adrenaline to all of her 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.039
 participants the winner of this war 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.409
 gains control of territory what 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.829
 gives him the right to build his own 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.539
 Castle 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.789
 yourself while choosing 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:39.130
 location of walls and siege weapons 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.619
 but remember to build one 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.840
 scale project like a castle requires 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.240
 just a huge resource cost 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.759
 think about this question even before 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.810
 how to set a place for yourself 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.130
 under the sun 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:57.069
 among the elite, the siege itself represents 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.439
 a great fight 70 by 70 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.719
 although in the future the developers promise 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.270
 increase the number of participants will give a 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.819
 also addressed the issue of the system 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.799
 mercenaries when the leader of any clan 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.739
 maybe for a fee 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.599
 hire other players this brings in more 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.569
 more sharpness and without 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.959
 most curious action remarkable 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.359
 moment 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.150
 sieges after starting servers are not available 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:24.819
 immediately that it is reasonable because one thing to catch 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.359
 all to pump a friend and create a market and 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.870
 stock up on resources and we move on 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:34.599
 38 is represented on the northern mainland 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.170
 territories 37 of which are available to 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.540
 siege 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.319
 while the clan can control any 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.069
 the amount of land as far as it will last 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.230
 captured territory can 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.450
 used to build houses 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.829
 obtaining resources in the territories 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.440
 which is located special 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:53.620
 obelisk tree growth rate of 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.889
 which can be obtained weaning is not increased 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.370
 you should also forget about the possibility 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:02.109
 taxing your locals 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.690
 noteworthy is the siege process of which 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.930
 should say a few words at auction 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.310
 start bidding for a particular item 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.459
 characterizing the intent of the attacker 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.069
 hand minimum bet 500 gold 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.650
 auction goes as long as someone from 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.989
 participants will not appoint the highest 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.910
 price side which won the bid 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.459
 can use received 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.240
 subject to camp and announce 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.550
 state of siege 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.680
 however, it was not without limitations and 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.230
 nuances if at the appointed time is not 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.100
 will begin the siege that thing automatically 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.260
 will disappear 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.480
 camp can not be installed next to 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.350
 the point of resurrection of opponents from 100 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.600
 meters and more 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:46.700
 the camp can not be installed and next to 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.620
 home and garden from 10 meters and more in 30 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.500
 minutes before the siege begins 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.390
 useful goods dealers forwards 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.710
 defenders can stock up on them 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.440
 useful items 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.230
 also from this moment all fines are removed 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.510
 on killing players of their faction as 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.280
 already noted in the siege take part 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:09.140
 70 players from the side within 90 minutes 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.300
 attackers must destroy the enemy 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.170
 obelisk which zealously guard 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.900
 defenders 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.959
 By the way the second is somewhat more complicated reason 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.299
 the minority of them only after 20 minutes 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.400
 after the beginning of the siege defenders can 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.920
 call reinforcements and equalize and 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.620
 numerical advantage the number itself 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.600
 defenders of the first 20 minutes of the battle directly 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.680
 depends on the number of territories 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.200
 owned by this expedition 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.570
 in the end ending the conversation both gardens 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.150
 in the game not to mention the siege 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.610
 weapons up to the questionnaire wounds and other 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.400
 gadgets without which climb on the enemy 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.870
 walls meaningless and now after all 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.990
 what we told you 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.180
 I think no one will doubt 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.050
 how important and interesting the siege in the game 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.600
 archeage 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.490
 and we will return to the new narration about 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.490
 the game very soon bye
