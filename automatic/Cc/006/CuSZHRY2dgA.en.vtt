00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.150 

then<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:01.240> next<00:02:01.600> software<00:02:02.110> that<00:02:02.470> we'll<00:02:02.590> use<00:02:02.619> is

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
then the next software that we'll use is

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.910 
then the next software that we'll use is
called<00:02:03.340> malwarebytes<00:02:04.209> anti-malware<00:02:04.920> and

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
called malwarebytes anti-malware and

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.300 
called malwarebytes anti-malware and
with<00:02:06.250> this<00:02:06.490> software<00:02:07.530> we<00:02:08.530> are<00:02:08.560> going<00:02:09.009> to

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
with this software we are going to

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:17.250 
with this software we are going to
remove<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:15.209> malware<00:02:16.209> from<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.870> computer

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
remove the malware from the computer

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.870 
remove the malware from the computer
which<00:02:17.440> are<00:02:17.590> other<00:02:17.740> useless<00:02:18.099> files<00:02:18.520> on<00:02:18.790> the

which are other useless files on the

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.559 
which are other useless files on the
computer<00:02:19.270> that<00:02:19.709> really<00:02:20.709> are<00:02:21.069> not<00:02:21.430> required<00:02:22.150> at

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
computer that really are not required at

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:23.490 
computer that really are not required at
all

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
all

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.680 
all
what<00:02:24.099> would<00:02:24.220> you<00:02:24.310> just<00:02:24.640> uses<00:02:25.060> that<00:02:25.090> perform

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
what would you just uses that perform

what would you just uses that perform
the<00:02:25.870> quick<00:02:26.140> scan<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:27.840> let<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.110> scan<00:02:29.620> run

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
the quick scan and let that scan run

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:40.300 
the quick scan and let that scan run
through<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.860> scan<00:02:33.130> takes<00:02:33.370> quite<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.760> while

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.120 

and<00:02:41.150> you're<00:02:41.780> just<00:02:41.959> waiting<00:02:42.200> for<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.620> scam<00:02:42.920> to

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
complete once it's complete you're

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.050 
complete once it's complete you're
expecting<00:02:45.680> results<00:02:46.160> here<00:02:46.400> there<00:02:46.550> was<00:02:46.730> none

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
expecting results here there was none

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.610 
expecting results here there was none
basically<00:02:47.900> whenever<00:02:48.020> there<00:02:48.230> is<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.500> would

protect<00:03:21.950> this<00:03:22.100> but<00:03:22.370> what<00:03:22.550> your<00:03:22.700> main<00:03:22.850> point<00:03:23.209> is

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
protect this but what your main point is

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.210 
protect this but what your main point is
is<00:03:23.660> that<00:03:23.870> there's<00:03:24.080> different<00:03:24.140> types<00:03:24.680> of<00:03:24.890> scans

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
is that there's different types of scans

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.729 
is that there's different types of scans
you<00:03:25.489> can<00:03:25.700> do<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:26.360> usually<00:03:27.319> I<00:03:27.380> would<00:03:27.590> just

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
you can do and usually I would just

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.820 
you can do and usually I would just
select<00:03:27.890> a<00:03:28.130> quick<00:03:28.370> scan<00:03:28.730> and<00:03:29.230> an<00:03:30.230> scan<00:03:30.590> your

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
select a quick scan and an scan your

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
computer

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.300 
computer
and<00:03:32.780> what<00:03:32.900> I<00:03:32.930> will<00:03:33.110> do<00:03:33.319> is<00:03:33.470> start<00:03:33.590> to<00:03:33.890> look<00:03:34.010> for

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
no results a bit of a problem here

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.960 
no results a bit of a problem here
because<00:03:57.440> I<00:03:57.799> wasn't<00:03:58.130> coming<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.400> show<00:03:58.610> you<00:03:58.670> some

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
but usually what will happen is then

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.470

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
them all and what this software will do

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.819 
them all and what this software will do
is<00:04:04.880> obviously<00:04:05.030> quarantine<00:04:05.900> them<00:04:06.110> or<00:04:06.290> remove

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
is obviously quarantine them or remove

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.680 
is obviously quarantine them or remove
them<00:04:07.100> and<00:04:07.690> that<00:04:08.690> is<00:04:09.049> essentially<00:04:10.010> this<00:04:10.880> easy

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
them and that is essentially this easy

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.440

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
computer to in the end make your

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:21.330 
computer to in the end make your

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
computer more fast and perform better

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.640 
computer more fast and perform better
really<00:04:22.340> easy
