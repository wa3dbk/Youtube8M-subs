00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.670
 we have 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.670
 and admit that have expired 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.330
 the feeling really finally the 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.500
 impulses and that's a way of getting 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.620
 to find oneself 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.989
 this aspect without prejudice without anything just 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.510
 the phase with the time there was a 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.980
 discipline behind his glasses the 20th 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.770
 dynastic that appear the 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.690
 first festive illustrations with is 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.800
 wooden with trumpets this 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.020
 way you do that would take her 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.949
 safe without the energy of a way 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.379
 totally different 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.230
 the foundation also in the tic 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.230
 opportunities for future leaders who 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.000
 are places of risk you are and 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.040
 years policies of the harmony of 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.960
 the year of the cohesion of the de to bring 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.130
 development or evening finally the 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.240
 authentic neversois not want you 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.759
 have started doing just now 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.710
 I did that a vocation was dad the 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.660
 fights with a vocation in the crash 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.310
 it makes you think of sticks as 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.420
 a part of ourselves in fact and because 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.700
 that we really go small to a 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.770
 species of extension of our body you 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.020
 go graft the stick admit it's going to you 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.360
 present your so your 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.899
 is filled we waited I did not wear 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.300
 strength 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.100
 France must be excluded from all its 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.840
 weapons really consider the boat 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.150
 as living make it move with our 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.950
 body he must be 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.750
 that's the behavioral interpretation 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.090
 what can be said is either wav l 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.140
 history considers the other alas its 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.549
 commitments with each other so 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.080
 the intention behind property 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:54.630
 now the intention to grow 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.630
 one evening channeling the farce 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:06.140
 the best defense is to move 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:08.569
 in the cold you come to inject 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.810
 the presale to you and the law in your 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.810
 trips 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.989
 these ice cream delicacy we do not want 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.569
 but after the right here by the left 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.760
 seems to far away if your head you are 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.810
 not protected if you put there you're right 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.269
 to be afraid because the state had to 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.580
 touching the pencil and the body behind 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.500
 I must be well it comes from you 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.569
 I made three contacts with Corsican and 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.910
 gain contact alps is legal and does not 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.299
 seek to destabilize his defense for 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.470
 trying to create an attack is that it 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.750
 reaches to the head for example you 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.180
 go relax completely relaxed 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.730
 or what to do with fans 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:51.510
 here I wish I could you 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:03:00.239
 admire this presents both l 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:03:03.420
 after-sales lalo you was trying to 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.980
 lose faith in taking care of the stick 1 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.690
 that is what the other was saying 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.610
 there but not lose without you as long as 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.750
 gallant Jesus had little of me taking care of you 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.510
 and me 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.450
 take care of a month no ok no me 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.600
 me me I do not take care of each other 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.930
 not from the boat the relationship to the other create 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:28.819
 this particular link that I have 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:48.859
 put this decentralized way 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:50.480
 of energy somewhere I think there is 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.030
 this aspect of entertainment contacting 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.739
 a return to the gillon roots 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.700
 present a link and the German anthem 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.379
 France 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.829
 the faces that I liked game has 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.829
 shot at the time
