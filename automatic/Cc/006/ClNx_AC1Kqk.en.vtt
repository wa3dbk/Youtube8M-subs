00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
plus - up here so let's just test it out

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.370 
plus - up here so let's just test it out
let's<00:01:26.400> give<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.880> two<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.479> half<00:01:27.659> speed<00:01:28.140> you

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380

so<00:01:32.820> that's<00:01:33.270> method<00:01:33.689> number<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:33.990> method

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
so that's method number one method

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.149 
so that's method number one method
number<00:01:35.189> two<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.579> also<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> plug-in<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.200> a

axé<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:13.580> let's<00:02:13.850> go<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.360> little<00:02:14.450> faster<00:02:14.930> okay<00:02:15.620> so

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
axé so let's go a little faster okay so

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.290 
axé so let's go a little faster okay so
that's<00:02:17.210> the<00:02:17.420> second<00:02:17.870> method<00:02:18.020> and<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:19.850> third

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
that's the second method and the third

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.720

method<00:02:20.720> let's<00:02:21.560> switch<00:02:21.890> back<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.520> normal

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
method let's switch back to a normal

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.510 
method let's switch back to a normal
youtube<00:02:23.360> video<00:02:23.750> it's<00:02:24.110> gonna<00:02:24.350> be<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.650> program

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
youtube video it's gonna be a program

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.620 
youtube video it's gonna be a program
called<00:02:26.210> my<00:02:26.630> speed<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:27.820> what<00:02:28.820> you<00:02:29.000> can<00:02:29.180> do<00:02:29.330> here

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
called my speed and what you can do here

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.720 
called my speed and what you can do here
essentially<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:30.560> I'm<00:02:30.770> here<00:02:30.980> on<00:02:31.070> a<00:02:31.130> Mac<00:02:31.430> this

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
essentially and I'm here on a Mac this

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.340 
essentially and I'm here on a Mac this
may<00:02:31.910> look<00:02:32.120> different<00:02:32.330> on<00:02:32.570> a<00:02:32.630> Windows<00:02:33.110> computer

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
may look different on a Windows computer

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.220 
may look different on a Windows computer
but<00:02:34.070> same<00:02:34.370> principle<00:02:34.970> essentially<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:36.080> can

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
but same principle essentially you can

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.540 
but same principle essentially you can
have<00:02:36.470> a<00:02:36.500> slider<00:02:37.100> speed<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.150> can<00:02:38.360> change

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
have a slider speed that you can change

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.570 
have a slider speed that you can change
for<00:02:40.930> for<00:02:41.930> all<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.350> videos<00:02:42.740> that<00:02:43.130> you<00:02:43.430> can

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
for for all the videos that you can

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.580 
for for all the videos that you can
possibly<00:02:44.030> think<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.720> supports<00:02:45.170> lots<00:02:45.380> of

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
possibly think of it supports lots of

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.380 
possibly think of it supports lots of
videos<00:02:45.950> youtube<00:02:46.220> vimeo<00:02:46.970> whatever<00:02:47.780> else<00:02:48.020> and

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
videos youtube vimeo whatever else and

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.180 
videos youtube vimeo whatever else and
what<00:02:50.390> you<00:02:50.540> need<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.930> do<00:02:51.110> though<00:02:51.350> is<00:02:51.620> you'll

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
what you need to do though is you'll

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.520 
what you need to do though is you'll
have<00:02:52.459> to<00:02:52.700> restart<00:02:53.090> your<00:02:53.510> browser<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:54.440> i'm
