00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
it it's just ridiculous it's just you

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.210 
it it's just ridiculous it's just you
increase<00:04:11.509> the<00:04:11.659> damage<00:04:11.840> of<00:04:12.229> that<00:04:12.439> I<00:04:12.620> know<00:04:12.799> many

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
increase the damage of that I know many

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.710 
increase the damage of that I know many
of<00:04:13.340> you<00:04:13.430> guys<00:04:13.639> have<00:04:13.699> forgotten<00:04:14.389> the<00:04:14.509> same

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
of you guys have forgotten the same

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.860 
of you guys have forgotten the same
problem<00:04:15.139> with<00:04:15.259> this<00:04:15.379> l<00:04:16.039> 118<00:04:16.820> I<00:04:17.090> think<00:04:17.750> they

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
problem with this l 118 I think they

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.089 
problem with this l 118 I think they
should<00:04:18.049> increase<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.620> power<00:04:18.799> on<00:04:19.070> that

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
should increase the power on that

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.149 
should increase the power on that
because<00:04:19.579> i<00:04:19.820> think<00:04:20.630> that<00:04:21.229> the<00:04:21.680> birth<00:04:21.859> of<00:04:22.010> the

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159 
because i think that the birth of the

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.800 
because i think that the birth of the
killer's<00:04:22.490> more<00:04:22.760> damage<00:04:23.180> than<00:04:23.479> the<00:04:23.539> l

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
killer's more damage than the l

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.500 
killer's more damage than the l
18<00:04:24.320> and<00:04:24.500> which<00:04:25.070> and<00:04:25.970> it<00:04:26.060> should<00:04:26.240> be<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.480> other

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
18 and which and it should be the other

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.510 
18 and which and it should be the other
way<00:04:26.720> around<00:04:26.930> actually<00:04:27.820> and<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:29.210> think<00:04:29.510> um<00:04:29.720> um

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
way around actually and I think um um

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.270 
way around actually and I think um um
Infinity<00:04:31.520> Ward<00:04:31.820> should<00:04:32.120> fix<00:04:32.300> that<00:04:32.419> around<00:04:33.280> to

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
Infinity Ward should fix that around to
