00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:00.310 
a picture over here be standing up next
to<00:02:59.330> this<00:02:59.390> Bush<00:02:59.660> you<00:02:59.840> can<00:02:59.990> see<00:03:00.170> it's

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
to this Bush you can see it's

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.190 
to this Bush you can see it's
considerably<00:03:00.860> over<00:03:01.040> my<00:03:01.310> head<00:03:02.050> and<00:03:03.050> get<00:03:03.140> a

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
considerably over my head and get a

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.820 
considerably over my head and get a
little<00:03:03.500> bit<00:03:03.680> wider<00:03:03.860> shot<00:03:04.220> there

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
little bit wider shot there

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.160 
little bit wider shot there
so<00:03:06.830> this<00:03:06.980> tomato<00:03:07.420> plane<00:03:08.420> is<00:03:08.600> really<00:03:08.900> grown

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
so this tomato plane is really grown

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.440 
so this tomato plane is really grown
like<00:03:09.800> we<00:03:10.130> said<00:03:10.340> before<00:03:10.370> we<00:03:10.820> keep<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.120> seven

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
like we said before we keep it seven

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.280 
like we said before we keep it seven
dust<00:03:11.660> on<00:03:11.870> we<00:03:11.959> keep<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.230> bugs<00:03:12.440> off<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:14.290> roots

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
dust on we keep the bugs off the roots

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.850 
dust on we keep the bugs off the roots
are<00:03:15.590> in<00:03:15.620> dirt<00:03:16.190> and<00:03:16.430> in<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.150> Bela<00:03:17.330> hey<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:18.650> it's

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
are in dirt and in the Bela hey and it's

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.650 
are in dirt and in the Bela hey and it's
getting<00:03:19.130> its<00:03:19.220> nutrients<00:03:19.730> from<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.180> Bella<00:03:20.390> has

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
getting its nutrients from the Bella has

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.710 
getting its nutrients from the Bella has
it<00:03:20.959> decays<00:03:21.940> so<00:03:22.940> you<00:03:23.000> can<00:03:23.209> see<00:03:23.420> how<00:03:23.660> many

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
it decays so you can see how many

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.830 
it decays so you can see how many
tomatoes<00:03:24.530> we've<00:03:25.459> gotten<00:03:25.910> off<00:03:26.180> of<00:03:26.209> this<00:03:26.570> one

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
tomatoes we've gotten off of this one

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.199 
tomatoes we've gotten off of this one
pick<00:03:27.170> in<00:03:27.200> here<00:03:27.650> I<00:03:28.510> think<00:03:29.510> it's<00:03:29.630> pretty<00:03:29.780> good<00:03:31.209> so

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
pick in here I think it's pretty good so

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.990 
pick in here I think it's pretty good so
this<00:03:32.690> is<00:03:32.750> Thomas<00:03:33.230> Patrick<00:03:33.700> showing<00:03:34.700> you<00:03:34.820> how
