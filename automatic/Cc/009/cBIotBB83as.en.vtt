00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
when I got into it more I had a lot of

when I got into it more I had a lot of
time<00:01:05.189> on<00:01:05.309> my<00:01:05.339> hands<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.030> chilled<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.479> practice

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
time on my hands so I chilled a practice

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
spot for a good six to eight hours and I

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.780 
spot for a good six to eight hours and I
would<00:01:09.630> improve<00:01:10.140> don't<00:01:10.560> get<00:01:10.680> me<00:01:10.799> wrong<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.369> a

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
would improve don't get me wrong and a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.640 
would improve don't get me wrong and a
definite<00:01:12.150> got<00:01:12.299> me<00:01:12.420> past<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.960> beginner<00:01:13.290> stage

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
definite got me past that beginner stage

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.520 
definite got me past that beginner stage
but<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.520> soon<00:01:14.760> as<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.060> started<00:01:15.330> getting<00:01:15.600> past

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
but as soon as I started getting past

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.520 
but as soon as I started getting past
that<00:01:16.710> stage<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.630> realized<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.170> was

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
that stage I realized that I was

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.740 
that stage I realized that I was
spending<00:01:19.770> way<00:01:20.400> too<00:01:20.430> much<00:01:20.850> time<00:01:21.030> at<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
spending way too much time at the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.050 
spending way too much time at the
practice<00:01:22.170> by<00:01:22.409> getting<00:01:22.890> way<00:01:23.250> too<00:01:23.310> little<00:01:23.729> done

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
practice by getting way too little done

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.270 
practice by getting way too little done
so<00:01:24.750> for<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.110> concept<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> big<00:01:26.040> thing

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
so for this concept that the big thing

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.050 
so for this concept that the big thing
to<00:01:26.400> remember<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.850> less<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.479> more<00:01:28.020> okay<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.549> we

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
to remember is less is more okay so we

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.910 
to remember is less is more okay so we
can<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.570> practice<00:01:31.049> spot<00:01:31.259> for<00:01:31.500> six<00:01:31.650> eight

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
can be in a practice spot for six eight

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.289 
can be in a practice spot for six eight
hours<00:01:32.040> where<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.490> train<00:01:32.759> for<00:01:33.000> six<00:01:33.150> eight

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
hours where you train for six eight

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.950

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
hours or we train for two hours and get

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.010 
hours or we train for two hours and get
the<00:01:37.110> same<00:01:37.380> if<00:01:37.680> not<00:01:37.920> more<00:01:37.979> done<00:01:38.909> I'm<00:01:39.299> constantly

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.109 
the same if not more done I'm constantly
reminding<00:01:40.530> myself<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:41.070> our<00:01:41.310> minds<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.030> our

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
reminding myself that our minds and our

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.630 
reminding myself that our minds and our
bodies<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.780> only<00:01:42.930> focus<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.649> long<00:01:43.920> we<00:01:44.520> only

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
bodies can only focus so long we only

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.639 
bodies can only focus so long we only
have<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.119> much<00:01:45.240> energy<00:01:45.420> before<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:46.409> start

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
have so much energy before we start

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.230 
have so much energy before we start
making<00:01:46.829> bad<00:01:47.189> habits<00:01:47.729> we<00:01:48.210> start<00:01:48.450> having<00:01:48.630> a

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
making bad habits we start having a

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.929 
making bad habits we start having a
risk<00:01:49.479> of<00:01:49.600> injury<00:01:50.110> and<00:01:50.350> we<00:01:51.040> start<00:01:51.310> losing<00:01:51.549> focus

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
risk of injury and we start losing focus

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.149 
risk of injury and we start losing focus
altogether<00:01:52.689> so<00:01:53.320> we<00:01:53.409> have<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.740> remember<00:01:53.979> that

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
altogether so we have to remember that

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.950 
altogether so we have to remember that
we<00:01:54.430> have<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:54.790> Train<00:01:55.060> effectively<00:01:55.240> in<00:01:55.810> those

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
we have to Train effectively in those

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.289 
we have to Train effectively in those
two<00:01:56.259> to<00:01:56.409> three<00:01:56.649> hours<00:01:57.040> versus<00:01:57.880> training

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
two to three hours versus training

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.810 
two to three hours versus training
unaffectedly<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.259> unofficially<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.340> those

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
unaffectedly and unofficially and those

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.880 
unaffectedly and unofficially and those
three<00:02:01.149> to<00:02:01.299> six<00:02:01.540> hours<00:02:01.720> okay<00:02:02.409> guys<00:02:02.619> now<00:02:02.860> let's

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
three to six hours okay guys now let's

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.249 
three to six hours okay guys now let's
break<00:02:03.280> down<00:02:03.310> what<00:02:03.520> a<00:02:03.729> perfect<00:02:04.360> practice<00:02:04.990> looks

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
break down what a perfect practice looks

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.669 
break down what a perfect practice looks
like<00:02:05.530> again<00:02:06.420> perfect<00:02:07.420> so<00:02:07.960> remember<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.289> perfect

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
like again perfect so remember a perfect

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.220 
like again perfect so remember a perfect
practice<00:02:08.890> is<00:02:09.340> just<00:02:09.539> when<00:02:10.539> you<00:02:10.750> can<00:02:10.899> do<00:02:11.080> your

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
practice is just when you can do your

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.400 
practice is just when you can do your
best<00:02:11.500> when<00:02:12.280> you<00:02:12.400> have<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:13.030> most<00:02:13.269> energy<00:02:13.510> and

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
best when you have the most energy and

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.839 
best when you have the most energy and
woody<00:02:14.620> can<00:02:14.769> be<00:02:14.860> most<00:02:15.099> efficient<00:02:15.700> and

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
woody can be most efficient and

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.150 
woody can be most efficient and
effective<00:02:15.970> in<00:02:16.569> that<00:02:16.810> time<00:02:17.110> frame<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:17.739> we're

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
effective in that time frame so we're

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.680 
effective in that time frame so we're
gonna<00:02:18.250> do<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.400> two<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.760> half<00:02:19.000> hour<00:02:19.300> time

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
gonna do a two and a half hour time

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.570 
gonna do a two and a half hour time
frame<00:02:19.870> because<00:02:20.560> in<00:02:20.709> mind<00:02:20.890> us<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.340> perfect

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
frame because in mind us the perfect

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.690 
frame because in mind us the perfect
time<00:02:21.970> frame<00:02:22.239> first<00:02:22.959> 15<00:02:23.620> minutes<00:02:23.830> warm-up

packs<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.510> be<00:02:37.630> like<00:02:37.780> warmup<00:02:38.440> time<00:02:38.470> that's

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
packs to be like warmup time that's

45 minutes you want to work on the

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.500 
45 minutes you want to work on the
hardest<00:02:50.500> most<00:02:50.980> technically<00:02:51.549> physically

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
hardest most technically physically

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.509 
hardest most technically physically
laboring<00:02:53.110> moves<00:02:53.440> you're<00:02:54.100> gonna<00:02:54.220> be<00:02:54.340> working

that's<00:02:59.680> gonna<00:03:00.010> be<00:03:00.100> really<00:03:00.340> exploding<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:01.329> you

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
that's gonna be really exploding so you

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.180 
that's gonna be really exploding so you
wanna<00:03:01.600> do<00:03:01.690> that<00:03:01.840> for<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.049> first<00:03:02.079> 30<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.769> 45

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
wanna do that for the first 30 to 45

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.550 
wanna do that for the first 30 to 45
minutes<00:03:03.220> after<00:03:03.700> warm-up<00:03:04.480> so<00:03:05.049> now<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:05.290> should

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
minutes after warm-up so now you should

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.979 
minutes after warm-up so now you should
get<00:03:05.650> one<00:03:06.010> hour<00:03:06.220> mark<00:03:06.579> after<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.510> first<00:03:07.780> hour

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
get one hour mark after the first hour

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.009 
get one hour mark after the first hour
you<00:03:08.859> can<00:03:09.010> start<00:03:09.250> moving<00:03:09.609> into<00:03:09.760> more<00:03:10.180> style<00:03:10.720> and

you<00:06:48.249> get<00:06:48.459> it<00:06:48.639> it<00:06:48.999> feels<00:06:49.330> good<00:06:49.599> man<00:06:49.899> and<00:06:50.319> you

00:06:50.459 --> 00:06:50.469 
you get it it feels good man and you

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:51.899 
you get it it feels good man and you
really<00:06:50.800> want<00:06:51.009> to<00:06:51.069> keep<00:06:51.219> going<00:06:51.369> with<00:06:51.550> it<00:06:51.729> once

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:51.909 
really want to keep going with it once

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:53.669 
really want to keep going with it once
you<00:06:51.969> get<00:06:52.209> it<00:06:52.389> another<00:06:52.869> super<00:06:53.259> important

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:53.679 
you get it another super important

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:55.079 
you get it another super important
factor<00:06:54.099> and<00:06:54.219> one<00:06:54.369> that<00:06:54.520> will<00:06:54.610> definitely<00:06:54.789> help

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:55.089 
factor and one that will definitely help

00:06:55.089 --> 00:06:57.419 
factor and one that will definitely help
you<00:06:55.270> improve<00:06:55.569> left<00:06:55.929> right<00:06:56.169> and<00:06:56.379> center<00:06:56.740> this

00:06:57.419 --> 00:06:57.429 
you improve left right and center this

00:06:57.429 --> 00:06:58.559 
you improve left right and center this
is<00:06:57.580> definitely<00:06:57.849> something<00:06:58.089> I've<00:06:58.360> struggled

00:06:58.559 --> 00:06:58.569 
is definitely something I've struggled

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:00.659 
is definitely something I've struggled
with<00:06:58.929> a<00:06:58.959> lot<00:06:59.259> growing<00:06:59.589> up<00:06:59.800> because<00:07:00.309> I<00:07:00.610> would

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:00.669 
with a lot growing up because I would

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:02.760 
with a lot growing up because I would
always<00:07:00.819> go<00:07:01.209> to<00:07:01.240> practice<00:07:01.539> and<00:07:02.020> only<00:07:02.529> train

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:02.770 
always go to practice and only train

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.290 
always go to practice and only train
moves<00:07:03.009> that<00:07:03.189> were<00:07:03.279> comfortable<00:07:03.699> with<00:07:03.849> me<00:07:04.029> and

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
moves that were comfortable with me and

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.290 
moves that were comfortable with me and
only<00:07:04.899> train<00:07:05.289> moves<00:07:05.619> and<00:07:06.009> the<00:07:06.339> corner<00:07:06.729> or<00:07:06.939> this

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:07.300 
only train moves and the corner or this

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:08.549
