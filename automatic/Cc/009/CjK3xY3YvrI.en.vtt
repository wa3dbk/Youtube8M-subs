hey<00:00:02.490> guys<00:00:02.790> selenium<00:00:03.330> X<00:00:03.720> and<00:00:03.929> today<00:00:04.170> we're

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
hey guys selenium X and today we're

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.150 
hey guys selenium X and today we're
going<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.560> do<00:00:04.710> review<00:00:05.160> of<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.549> shat<00:00:06.210> VAE

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
going to do review of the shat VAE

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.129 
going to do review of the shat VAE
identity<00:00:08.160> fog<00:00:08.370> food<00:00:08.639> versus<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.480> regular<00:00:09.690> fog

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
identity fog food versus the regular fog

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.350 
identity fog food versus the regular fog
fluid<00:00:10.410> now<00:00:10.980> these<00:00:11.219> are<00:00:11.639> Chevy<00:00:13.849> 1300<00:00:14.849> foggers

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
fluid now these are Chevy 1300 foggers

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.950 
fluid now these are Chevy 1300 foggers
both<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.960> same<00:00:16.260> units<00:00:17.119> the<00:00:18.119> same<00:00:18.390> heating

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
both the same units the same heating

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.810 
both the same units the same heating
elements<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.590> them<00:00:19.830> they're<00:00:20.189> exactly<00:00:20.699> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
elements in them they're exactly the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.000 
elements in them they're exactly the
same<00:00:20.910> machines<00:00:21.650> the<00:00:22.650> same<00:00:22.680> same<00:00:23.519> ma<00:00:23.730> bran<00:00:24.119> fog

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
same machines the same same ma bran fog

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.740 
same machines the same same ma bran fog
but<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.130> difference<00:00:26.550> is<00:00:26.760> we're<00:00:27.480> gonna<00:00:27.570> use

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
but the difference is we're gonna use

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.990 
but the difference is we're gonna use
this<00:00:28.650> one<00:00:28.949> on<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.400> right<00:00:29.580> we're<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:29.970> to

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
this one on the right we're going to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.319 
this one on the right we're going to
have<00:00:30.179> original<00:00:30.750> fog<00:00:30.960> fluid<00:00:31.550> then<00:00:32.550> I'm<00:00:32.730> left

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
have original fog fluid then I'm left

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.299 
have original fog fluid then I'm left
we're<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:33.960> using<00:00:34.530> high<00:00:34.770> density

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
we're going to be using high density

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.360 
we're going to be using high density
today<00:00:35.910> we're<00:00:36.239> going<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.450> compare<00:00:36.920> the<00:00:37.920> two<00:00:37.950> fog

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
today we're going to compare the two fog

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.690 
today we're going to compare the two fog
clouds<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:39.120> they<00:00:39.360> make<00:00:40.280> you<00:00:41.280> got<00:00:41.430> I'm<00:00:41.550> gonna

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
clouds that they make you got I'm gonna

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.580 
clouds that they make you got I'm gonna
set<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.180> guys<00:00:42.420> back<00:00:42.870> down<00:00:45.050> just<00:00:46.050> remember

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
set you guys back down just remember

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.319 
set you guys back down just remember
that<00:00:46.800> high<00:00:47.760> densities<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.570> left<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.170> our

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
that high densities on the left and our

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.380 
that high densities on the left and our
original<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.870> right<00:00:52.940> so<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:53.969> guess<00:00:54.270> you

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
original is on the right so I guess you

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.889 
original is on the right so I guess you
centered<00:00:54.809> right<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:56.120> you<00:00:57.120> guys<00:00:57.300> just<00:00:57.600> watch

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
centered right here you guys just watch

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.369 
centered right here you guys just watch
the<00:00:58.170> clouds<00:00:59.420> so<00:01:00.420> high<00:01:00.690> densities<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the clouds so high densities on the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.340 
the clouds so high densities on the
right<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:02.239> mean<00:01:03.239> left<00:01:03.480> high<00:01:03.750> densities<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.229> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
right I mean left high densities on the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.410 
right I mean left high densities on the
left<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.799> originals<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.909> right<00:01:06.119> ready

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
left and originals on the right ready

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:22.820 
left and originals on the right ready
guys<00:01:06.630> 1<00:01:07.080> 2<00:01:07.590> 3

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.310 

that's<00:01:23.830> one<00:01:24.040> big<00:01:24.280> burst<00:01:24.930> now<00:01:25.930> it's<00:01:26.110> quite

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
that's one big burst now it's quite

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.400 
that's one big burst now it's quite
obvious<00:01:26.470> that<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.070> high-density<00:01:27.400> is<00:01:28.410> more

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
obvious that the high-density is more

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.590 
obvious that the high-density is more
dense<00:01:29.680> coming<00:01:30.190> out<00:01:30.310> of<00:01:30.400> the<00:01:30.460> machine<00:01:30.910> than<00:01:31.390> the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
dense coming out of the machine than the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.460 
dense coming out of the machine than the
original<00:01:32.640> with<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.910> both<00:01:34.450> makes<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:35.140> same

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
original with the both makes the same

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.350 
original with the both makes the same
amount<00:01:35.740> of<00:01:35.770> volume<00:01:35.830> maybe<00:01:36.730> the<00:01:36.910> original<00:01:36.970> is

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
amount of volume maybe the original is

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.510 
amount of volume maybe the original is
just<00:01:37.420> a<00:01:37.570> little<00:01:37.780> bit<00:01:37.900> less<00:01:38.020> of<00:01:38.200> volume<00:01:38.620> but

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
just a little bit less of volume but

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.490 
just a little bit less of volume but
high-density<00:01:40.150> definitely<00:01:40.660> is<00:01:40.930> more<00:01:41.200> dense

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
high-density definitely is more dense

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.980 
high-density definitely is more dense
and<00:01:41.740> thicker<00:01:42.040> of<00:01:42.280> fog<00:01:42.520> cloud<00:01:42.970> cover<00:01:43.390> than<00:01:43.750> the

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
and thicker of fog cloud cover than the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.510 
and thicker of fog cloud cover than the
original<00:01:44.470> as<00:01:45.430> well<00:01:45.610> suit<00:01:45.820> again<00:01:49.440> sick<00:01:50.520> with

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
original as well suit again sick with

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.030 
original as well suit again sick with
the<00:01:52.140> high-density<00:01:53.140> on<00:01:53.290> the<00:01:53.440> left<00:01:53.620> is<00:01:53.830> much

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
the high-density on the left is much

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.270 
the high-density on the left is much
thicker<00:01:54.400> in<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.700> cloud<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.950> it's<00:02:00.100> quite

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
thicker in the cloud so it's quite

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.400 
thicker in the cloud so it's quite
obvious<00:02:00.759> that<00:02:00.790> even<00:02:01.420> in<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:01.690> cloud<00:02:01.930> cover<00:02:02.229> you

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
obvious that even in the cloud cover you

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.070 
obvious that even in the cloud cover you
see<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.590> little<00:02:02.800> bit<00:02:02.920> on<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.130> left<00:02:03.280> is<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.840> over

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
see a little bit on the left is and over

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.010 
see a little bit on the left is and over
there<00:02:05.350> is<00:02:05.740> our<00:02:05.920> high<00:02:06.130> dense<00:02:06.479> can<00:02:07.479> you<00:02:07.570> even<00:02:07.690> see

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.979 

great<00:02:11.020> much<00:02:11.970> high-density<00:02:12.970> quits<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.570> much

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
great much high-density quits a much

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.510 
great much high-density quits a much
thicker<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.560> cloud<00:02:14.830> cover<00:02:15.130> than<00:02:15.370> the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
thicker of a cloud cover than the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.720
