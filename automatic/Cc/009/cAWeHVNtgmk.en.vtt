00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
couple of beds and I decided to go with

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.090 
couple of beds and I decided to go with
raised<00:01:01.280> beds<00:01:02.050> because<00:01:03.050> my<00:01:03.350> backyard

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.879 
day the soil would just be dry and
cracked<00:05:00.530> like<00:05:01.160> you<00:05:01.400> wouldn't<00:05:01.669> believe

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
cracked like you wouldn't believe

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.100 
cracked like you wouldn't believe
and<00:05:03.889> I'm<00:05:04.070> sure<00:05:04.310> good<00:05:05.210> deal<00:05:05.450> of<00:05:05.479> that<00:05:05.810> is

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
and I'm sure good deal of that is

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.020 
and I'm sure good deal of that is
because<00:05:06.740> of<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:06.950> drought<00:05:07.190> that<00:05:07.250> we<00:05:07.610> had<00:05:07.820> in

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
because of the drought that we had in

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.909 
because of the drought that we had in
the<00:05:08.210> extreme<00:05:08.630> heat<00:05:11.020> some<00:05:12.020> mulch<00:05:12.289> probably

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
the extreme heat some mulch probably

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:14.230 
the extreme heat some mulch probably
would<00:05:13.100> have<00:05:13.190> gone<00:05:13.340> a<00:05:13.400> long<00:05:13.729> way

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
would have gone a long way

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.360 
would have gone a long way
I<00:05:14.270> started<00:05:14.930> mulching<00:05:15.380> late<00:05:15.860> in<00:05:16.010> the<00:05:16.130> season

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
I started mulching late in the season

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.909 
I started mulching late in the season
and<00:05:16.789> I<00:05:17.000> did<00:05:17.720> notice<00:05:17.960> a<00:05:18.229> difference<00:05:18.620> at<00:05:18.889> that

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
and I did notice a difference at that

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.790 
and I did notice a difference at that
point<00:05:19.960> however<00:05:20.960> I<00:05:21.169> think<00:05:21.470> the<00:05:21.560> biggest

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
point however I think the biggest

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.310 
point however I think the biggest
problem<00:05:22.400> was<00:05:22.610> and<00:05:23.090> the<00:05:23.360> biggest<00:05:23.720> mistake<00:05:24.139> on

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
problem was and the biggest mistake on

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.279 
problem was and the biggest mistake on
my<00:05:24.350> part<00:05:24.970> was<00:05:25.970> buying<00:05:26.240> that<00:05:26.479> top<00:05:26.720> soil<00:05:27.080> that

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
my part was buying that top soil that

decomposing factors will determine on
how<00:06:27.200> long<00:06:27.410> it<00:06:27.560> takes<00:06:27.770> the<00:06:27.980> wood<00:06:28.130> chips<00:06:28.430> to

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:28.730 
how long it takes the wood chips to

how long it takes the wood chips to
decompose<00:06:29.660> and<00:06:29.930> turn<00:06:30.110> into<00:06:30.410> compost<00:06:32.380> anyway
