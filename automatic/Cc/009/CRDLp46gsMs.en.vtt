00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello everyone and now i'm filming that in my 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.230
 A backpack a lot of people wrote to me that they 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.840
 want to see that we are in language and and even 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.880
 that my case but I was confused by the final 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.519
 because we're from pen with pencils 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.529
 and since many wrote what they want 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.920
 see what lies exactly in my pencil box 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.650
 so I will show both the backpack and the pencil case 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:26.220
 let's go here my ass I did not understand it 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.929
 still after the wow came from school and it was 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:36.960
 about ten days maybe back you can 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:40.410
 more so let's see what we have there 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.370
 lies but first i have here mrs 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.500
 disinfector it is a formidable sheath from a fat body 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.940
 works 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.910
 I do not know we just tasty 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.309
 antibacterial go ahead and take a look 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.309
 inside there is a pencil case 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.449
 stand well here diary tutorials are different 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.920
 but I decided not to show the textbooks because 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:11.850
 why should I also have such a notebook 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.220
 and write down all sorts of definition theorems 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:20.009
 This examples on algebra geometry 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:22.970
 algebra geometry here it is theorems with 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.970
 evidence 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.770
 in general, very convenient because all 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.250
 organized me only furious that 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:38.270
 here I have the risks rip out terribly 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.109
 50 I have the same big 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:46.069

 pink weigh inspecting history to 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:51.530
 it was not easy to learn but very tired 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.079
 because hello for one parade you write 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.020
 about two pages by hand 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.390
 and it is still very much easier but it 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.879
 hard focus avaite 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:07.429
 have me english and a third tests by 

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:09.920

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:17.900
 he has another one there but I'm not 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:21.140
 I like to use more on 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:29.930
 my last poland is a bottle 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:37.069
 water is fine then we shall understand that's me 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.700
 water gel the first thing I have here 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:41.810
 lies 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.470
 This lipstick should females fed a route 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.470
 de la passion 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:50.810
 Spassky 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.370
 my nation, it is blue and the smell 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.620
 I can't lose because it 's hard for me 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.930
 to lose 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.540
 but sense it is clear that for example if I 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.210
 I was singing that we are here but with apple 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.020
 lipstick mark lived inflame another 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.860
 pomade 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.400
 We showed small daughter and favorites 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.430
 black plan 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.220
 pussy and this but where we are 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:18.400
 Generally why is this rat hiding with 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.400
 a bundle on a stone farther than me 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.930
 the image of the years I also showed the blue ball 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.370
 It has 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:34.520
 farther i have those here too 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:41.000
 showed it above with a roller spirit and 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:44.500
 youtube concessions his triangle just 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.500
 he is not himself 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:51.650
 further the question is bright pink if 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:56.150
 suddenly we can again this chewing gum 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.330
 orbits juicy watermelon supposedly protecting against 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.630
 cinnamon 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.370
 Well, the last thing is every little thing 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.360
 Basically, the whole world is on the verge of a very 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:12.190
 interesting and customary school backpack with 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.930
 things that really husband pin 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.900
 why is azattyk big because 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:20.900
 comfortable I have a lot of things in the afternoon I 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.880
 I carry all sorts of felt and pitch and even 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:28.300
 if I have one city I write well 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:31.510
 I carry 5 onegin this is the first ruler scissors 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.510
 ordinary with 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:40.259
 one more line more precisely transport 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:43.279
 the circus and because us recently was the one 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:46.559
 the circumference goes not long ago 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:48.839
 I wanted a small stick 

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:52.829
 first washed well then how is she 

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:55.829
 I am beginning terribly extend the logic of something else 

00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:58.649
 this paper is torn why from me 

00:04:55.829 --> 00:05:01.829
 one marker lies marker to divider 

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:03.689
 highlighter I watched video comments 

00:05:01.829 --> 00:05:06.329
 my hall where I talk about him 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:09.059
 change if you are phone code 

00:05:06.329 --> 00:05:11.129
 so I said farther on with me 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:13.529
 there are 4 pencils here 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:16.709
 I need three black gel pens 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:19.829
 slept through olympiads and three pens 

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:22.409
 because I have something abruptly like that 

00:05:19.829 --> 00:05:24.749
 all the pen ended and they ended 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:28.819
 right at school I autocad stalin did not write 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:32.009
 write got let not write and right 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:34.529
 well, the last thing in this kicked 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:36.900
 empty and these are the liners 

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:38.729
 I have a lot of them 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.130
 because I always highlight something 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:44.840
 definition of the word generally all local 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:49.860
 12 pieces it will be all that is and 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:52.020
 I like to color this 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.060
 there were all videos now you know what in 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.830
 music 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.080
 if he prayed put on a thumbs up 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.590
 I will know what a video like this 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:04.169
 like what's in my bag or what is mine 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.630
 racks on my desk for example and 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:11.030
 generally let's say you like me 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.030
 someday I 'll take off maybe 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:21.539
 I have too much energy to drink water 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.090
 in the morning 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:30.150
 how do people make you sense the right 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.150
 food for 30 days is terrible
