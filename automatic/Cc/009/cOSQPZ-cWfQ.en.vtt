how to make this t-shirt I actually cut

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:11.320 
how to make this t-shirt I actually cut
it<00:00:09.860> up<00:00:10.010> for<00:00:10.369> a<00:00:10.400> different<00:00:10.820> project<00:00:10.969> I<00:00:11.209> was

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
it up for a different project I was

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.049 
it up for a different project I was
working<00:00:11.389> on<00:00:11.809> so<00:00:12.650> I<00:00:13.070> don't<00:00:13.580> have<00:00:13.670> the<00:00:13.789> footage

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
working on so I don't have the footage

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:22.720 
working on so I don't have the footage
of<00:00:14.480> cutting<00:00:14.840> up<00:00:14.990> the<00:00:15.500> size

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.700 

so<00:00:23.090> the<00:00:23.210> first<00:00:23.510> thing<00:00:23.750> I<00:00:23.840> did<00:00:24.020> was<00:00:24.170> cut<00:00:24.410> off<00:00:24.440> the

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
so the first thing I did was cut off the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.240 
so the first thing I did was cut off the
neck<00:00:25.000> usually<00:00:26.000> I'll<00:00:26.480> cut<00:00:26.900> along<00:00:27.440> exactly

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
neck usually I'll cut along exactly

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.090 
neck usually I'll cut along exactly
along<00:00:28.790> the<00:00:29.540> edge<00:00:29.720> of<00:00:29.930> the<00:00:30.080> collar<00:00:30.350> but<00:00:30.770> this

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.100 
along the edge of the collar but this

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.630 
along the edge of the collar but this
time<00:00:31.310> I<00:00:31.400> left<00:00:31.610> an<00:00:31.940> inch<00:00:32.750> extra<00:00:33.530> room<00:00:33.920> here<00:00:34.340> so

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
time I left an inch extra room here so

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.060 
time I left an inch extra room here so
all<00:00:35.630> the<00:00:35.900> way<00:00:36.020> around<00:00:36.050> with<00:00:36.500> an<00:00:36.590> extra<00:00:36.890> inch

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
all the way around with an extra inch

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.210 
all the way around with an extra inch
just<00:00:37.520> so<00:00:37.670> I<00:00:37.880> had<00:00:38.090> a<00:00:38.120> wire<00:00:38.420> neck<00:00:38.780> so<00:00:39.620> it<00:00:39.739> can<00:00:39.890> sit

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
just so I had a wire neck so it can sit

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.240 
just so I had a wire neck so it can sit
sort<00:00:40.910> of<00:00:41.000> like<00:00:41.180> this<00:00:41.420> or<00:00:42.140> off<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:42.739> shoulder

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
sort of like this or off the shoulder

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:51.210 
sort of like this or off the shoulder
like<00:00:43.520> that<00:00:44.559> or<00:00:45.559> off<00:00:46.100> both<00:00:46.430> shoulders<00:00:46.540> even<00:00:49.000> and

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
like that or off both shoulders even and

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.270 
like that or off both shoulders even and
the<00:00:52.220> shirt<00:00:52.430> is<00:00:52.550> a<00:00:52.580> medium<00:00:53.030> so<00:00:53.710> I<00:00:54.710> didn't<00:00:55.160> want

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
the shirt is a medium so I didn't want

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.980 
the shirt is a medium so I didn't want
to<00:00:55.340> cut<00:00:55.460> too<00:00:55.610> much<00:00:55.640> or<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:56.420> it'd<00:00:56.540> be<00:00:56.660> falling

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
to cut too much or so it'd be falling

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.860 
to cut too much or so it'd be falling
off<00:00:57.140> my<00:00:57.170> shoulders<00:00:58.330> another<00:00:59.330> reason<00:00:59.720> why<00:00:59.840> I

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
off my shoulders another reason why I

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.720 
off my shoulders another reason why I
want<00:01:00.230> to<00:01:00.320> do<00:01:00.470> an<00:01:00.590> extra<00:01:00.860> inch<00:01:01.160> was<00:01:01.430> because<00:01:01.700> I

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
want to do an extra inch was because I

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.700 
want to do an extra inch was because I
was<00:01:01.970> writing<00:01:02.300> on<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.480> back<00:01:02.630> and<00:01:03.320> I<00:01:03.380> want<00:01:03.590> to

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
was writing on the back and I want to

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.340 
was writing on the back and I want to
make<00:01:03.890> sure<00:01:03.920> I<00:01:04.309> cut<00:01:04.610> all<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.540> words<00:01:05.720> out<00:01:05.990> as

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
make sure I cut all the words out as

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.630 
make sure I cut all the words out as
well<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.100> it<00:01:07.369> looks<00:01:07.550> like<00:01:07.759> this<00:01:08.350> so<00:01:09.350> I<00:01:09.410> just<00:01:09.650> cut

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
well so it looks like this so I just cut

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.400 
well so it looks like this so I just cut
an<00:01:10.850> extra<00:01:11.060> inch<00:01:11.330> on<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.810> front<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.259> back

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
an extra inch on the front and the back

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.219 
an extra inch on the front and the back
at<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.680> same<00:01:12.830> time<00:01:13.479> so<00:01:14.479> that's<00:01:14.690> the<00:01:14.840> neckline

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
at the same time so that's the neckline

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.749 
at the same time so that's the neckline
here<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:17.710> because<00:01:18.710> it<00:01:18.830> was<00:01:18.920> a<00:01:18.979> medium<00:01:19.399> it<00:01:19.580> was

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
here and because it was a medium it was

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.040 
here and because it was a medium it was
a<00:01:19.790> little<00:01:20.030> bit<00:01:20.180> too<00:01:20.300> big<00:01:20.509> for<00:01:20.540> me<00:01:20.810> so<00:01:20.840> I

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
a little bit too big for me so I

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.370 
a little bit too big for me so I
measured<00:01:22.840> 1/2<00:01:23.840> inches<00:01:24.440> I<00:01:24.649> wanted<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.990> go<00:01:26.990> in<00:01:27.200> at

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
measured 1/2 inches I wanted to go in at

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.710 
measured 1/2 inches I wanted to go in at
the<00:01:27.500> waist<00:01:27.740> but<00:01:28.550> not<00:01:28.729> so<00:01:28.940> much<00:01:29.090> at<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.330> bottom

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
the waist but not so much at the bottom

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.600 
the waist but not so much at the bottom
at<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.200> bottom<00:01:30.289> of<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:30.740> shirt<00:01:30.979> it<00:01:31.220> was<00:01:31.399> pretty

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
at the bottom of the shirt it was pretty

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.719 
at the bottom of the shirt it was pretty
much<00:01:31.819> how<00:01:32.780> I<00:01:32.810> wanted<00:01:33.229> it<00:01:33.350> so<00:01:33.710> I<00:01:33.979> cut<00:01:34.610> off<00:01:34.700> the

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
much how I wanted it so I cut off the

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.639 
much how I wanted it so I cut off the
original<00:01:34.970> hem<00:01:35.539> of<00:01:35.690> the<00:01:35.750> bottom

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.170 

until<00:01:40.649> the<00:01:40.710> first<00:01:40.979> step<00:01:41.189> would<00:01:41.490> be<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.969> cut

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
until the first step would be to cut

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.499 
until the first step would be to cut
little<00:01:42.360> slips<00:01:42.780> all<00:01:43.229> along<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:45.060> edge<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.390> this

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
little slips all along the edge of this

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.350 
little slips all along the edge of this
shirt<00:01:46.159> however<00:01:47.159> much<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.820> want<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.210> I've

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
got a different like a curve so maybe

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.690 
got a different like a curve so maybe
half<00:01:51.929> an<00:01:52.110> inch<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.619> then<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.829> middle<00:01:53.219> I<00:01:53.399> cut

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
half an inch and then the middle I cut

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.700

one and a half inches of them at the
bottom<00:01:55.829> another<00:01:56.729> half<00:01:57.030> an<00:01:57.210> inch<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.990> I<00:01:58.140> did

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
bottom another half an inch and I did

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.319 
bottom another half an inch and I did
maybe<00:01:59.270> half<00:02:00.270> an<00:02:00.450> inch<00:02:00.659> wide<00:02:01.219> strips<00:02:02.329> after

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
maybe half an inch wide strips after

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.230 
maybe half an inch wide strips after
that<00:02:03.780> you'll<00:02:03.960> be<00:02:04.110> able<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.380> pull<00:02:04.939> the<00:02:05.939> middle

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
that you'll be able to pull the middle

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.969 
that you'll be able to pull the middle
seam<00:02:06.630> because<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.469> know<00:02:07.560> how<00:02:07.710> when<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.950> have

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
seam because you know how when you have

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.529 
seam because you know how when you have
t-shirts<00:02:08.310> there's<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.789> seam<00:02:09.060> right<00:02:09.269> along<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
t-shirts there's a seam right along the

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.270 
t-shirts there's a seam right along the
edge<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:09.929> after<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.709> you'll<00:02:10.890> be<00:02:11.009> able<00:02:11.069> to

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
edge so after that you'll be able to

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.550 
edge so after that you'll be able to
just<00:02:11.430> pull<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.239> seams<00:02:12.480> apart<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.080> it'll<00:02:13.410> just

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
just pull the seams apart and it'll just

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.190 
just pull the seams apart and it'll just
come<00:02:13.709> apart<00:02:13.880> so<00:02:14.880> you<00:02:14.940> have<00:02:15.299> a<00:02:15.660> front<00:02:16.019> in<00:02:16.110> the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
come apart so you have a front in the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.460 
come apart so you have a front in the
back<00:02:16.380> tie<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.239> then<00:02:18.599> you<00:02:18.720> just<00:02:18.900> go<00:02:19.079> through

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
back tie so and then you just go through

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.960 
back tie so and then you just go through
and<00:02:19.769> double<00:02:20.610> knot<00:02:20.760> each<00:02:21.030> single<00:02:22.819> double<00:02:23.819> knot

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
and double knot each single double knot

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.600 
and double knot each single double knot
all<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.420> strips<00:02:24.780> together<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.470> then<00:02:26.310> you

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
all the strips together and then you

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.440 
all the strips together and then you
won't<00:02:26.849> go<00:02:27.420> through<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.489> snip<00:02:29.489> off<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.730> ends

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
won't go through and snip off the ends

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.059 
won't go through and snip off the ends
on<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.720> ties<00:02:30.930> after<00:02:31.290> you've<00:02:31.410> double<00:02:31.799> bonded

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
on the ties after you've double bonded

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.430 
on the ties after you've double bonded
them<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:33.180> it's<00:02:33.329> really<00:02:33.569> simple<00:02:34.019> it's<00:02:34.349> really

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
them so it's really simple it's really

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.670 
them so it's really simple it's really
similar<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.280> my<00:02:35.610> diamond<00:02:36.180> t-shirt<00:02:36.680> except

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
similar to my diamond t-shirt except

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.089 
similar to my diamond t-shirt except
this<00:02:37.890> time<00:02:38.190> we<00:02:38.670> don't<00:02:38.970> show<00:02:39.569> any<00:02:39.750> skin

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
this time we don't show any skin

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.069 
this time we don't show any skin
everyone<00:02:41.099> has<00:02:41.400> diamond<00:02:41.880> shapes<00:02:42.180> all<00:02:42.510> on<00:02:42.930> the

everyone has diamond shapes all on the

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.289 
everyone has diamond shapes all on the
side<00:02:43.349> sort<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.859> as<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.010> design<00:02:44.430> but<00:02:44.730> this<00:02:44.880> one<00:02:45.090> is

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
side sort of as a design but this one is

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.930 
side sort of as a design but this one is
more<00:02:45.810> covered<00:02:46.200> up<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.620> scrunch<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.639> gives<00:02:47.850> a

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
more covered up and scrunch it gives a

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.059 
more covered up and scrunch it gives a
scrunch<00:02:48.299> look<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.810> shirt<00:02:49.079> so<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.950> was

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
scrunch look to the shirt so it was

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.670 
scrunch look to the shirt so it was
definitely<00:02:50.190> longer<00:02:50.670> before<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:52.109> it<00:02:52.319> ends<00:02:52.620> up

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
definitely longer before and it ends up
