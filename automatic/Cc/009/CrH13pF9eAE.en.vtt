beginning this G flat and this T flat
they<00:03:32.069> don't<00:03:32.219> look<00:03:32.310> quite<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.700> same<00:03:32.730> move<00:03:33.180> it

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
they don't look quite the same move it

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.209 
they don't look quite the same move it
now<00:03:33.689> so<00:03:33.959> this<00:03:34.079> was<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.379> four<00:03:34.650> in<00:03:34.799> this<00:03:34.920> one<00:03:35.069> two

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:35.219 
now so this was the four in this one two

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:36.679 
now so this was the four in this one two
three<00:03:35.519> so<00:03:35.969> make<00:03:36.150> sure<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.299> don't<00:03:36.359> throw<00:03:36.540> the

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:36.689 
three so make sure you don't throw the

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:38.809 
three so make sure you don't throw the
same<00:03:36.870> one<00:03:37.109> the<00:03:37.260> same<00:03:37.439> way<00:03:37.620> this<00:03:38.099> is<00:03:38.159> a<00:03:38.310> lower<00:03:38.549> D

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
same one the same way this is a lower D

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:39.589 
same one the same way this is a lower D
flat<00:03:39.090> than<00:03:39.299> that

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
flat than that

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.280 
flat than that
the<00:03:39.750> next<00:03:39.989> lower<00:03:40.139> one<00:03:40.349> so<00:03:41.569> you<00:03:42.569> practice<00:03:42.840> from

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
the next lower one so you practice from

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.679 
the next lower one so you practice from
nine<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.889> twelve<00:03:44.189> a<00:03:44.400> whole<00:03:44.549> bunch<00:03:44.760> get<00:03:45.480> that

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
nine to twelve a whole bunch get that

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:47.240 
nine to twelve a whole bunch get that
smooth<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.439> then<00:03:46.560> try<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.769> next<00:03:46.980> part

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
smooth and then try the next part

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.490 
smooth and then try the next part
basically<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:48.540> just<00:03:48.780> say<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.019> next<00:03:49.230> part<00:03:49.409> to

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
basically I just say the next part to

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.490 
basically I just say the next part to
practice<00:03:49.859> would<00:03:50.010> be<00:03:50.159> measured<00:03:50.790> 15<00:03:54.290> then<00:03:55.290> here

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
practice would be measured 15 then here

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:03.649 
practice would be measured 15 then here
we<00:03:55.590> do<00:03:55.709> our<00:03:55.859> CV<00:03:56.310> just<00:03:56.579> like<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.909> five<00:04:02.569> and<00:04:03.569> then

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
we do our CV just like the five and then

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.420 
we do our CV just like the five and then
you<00:04:03.689> play<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:03.959> lowest<00:04:04.319> e<00:04:04.439> on<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.829> end

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
you play the lowest e on the end

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.899 
you play the lowest e on the end
now<00:04:06.060> Louis<00:04:06.389> D<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:06.629> right<00:04:06.780> next<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.139> Louis<00:04:07.469> II

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
now Louis D is right next to Louis II

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.250 
now Louis D is right next to Louis II
didn't<00:04:08.909> see<00:04:09.000> that<00:04:09.090> coming<00:04:09.359> did<00:04:09.450> you<00:04:09.599> so<00:04:10.139> we
