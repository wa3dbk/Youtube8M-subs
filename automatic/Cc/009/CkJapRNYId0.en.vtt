00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 Did you know that the thermos was 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.680
 invented in 1892 by the physicist and chemist 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.599
 and if you san james ware 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.910
 I'm leandro felipe be very well. 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.429
 coming to the new season of inventions 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:22.439
 you crazy on youtube 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:23.939
 right after the parent vignette in the video 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.590
 This week I'll show you how 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.990
 save your hard-earned money 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.269
 making its own thermos flask 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.679
 the list of materials you 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.410
 found below in the description 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.829
 of this video on youtube 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.290
 just take a look first you need 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:54.570
 reinvest the bottle smaller than a liter 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:56.760
 using aluminum foil or use 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.329
 enough duct tape to hold everything 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.329
 firm 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.290
 The next step is to 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.290
 bottle with a newspaper 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.799
 hold everything with tape 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.530
 just do not overdo it in the newspaper because she 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.009
 needs to fit in the two liter bottle 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.170
 The next step is to split the bottle of 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.799
 two liters in half and remove your 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.799
 neck 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.590
 now places the smaller bottle inside the 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.140
 larger and tape it all together 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.140
 is ready our thermos 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.140
 homemade 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.539
 I did a test and that bottle kept 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.759
 ice water for about five 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.709
