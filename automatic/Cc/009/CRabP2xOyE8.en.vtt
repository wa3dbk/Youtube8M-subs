00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
hi guys so it's later on in the year

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.409 
hi guys so it's later on in the year
there's<00:00:02.520> now<00:00:02.610> time<00:00:02.850> for<00:00:02.879> us<00:00:03.000> to<00:00:03.149> think<00:00:03.330> about

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
there's now time for us to think about

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:04.970 
there's now time for us to think about
whether<00:00:03.780> we<00:00:03.899> want<00:00:04.049> to<00:00:04.140> overwinter<00:00:04.500> some<00:00:04.770> dried

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
whether we want to overwinter some dried

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.369 
whether we want to overwinter some dried
chilies<00:00:05.180> so<00:00:06.180> what<00:00:06.480> we've<00:00:06.629> got<00:00:06.779> some<00:00:07.200> of<00:00:07.290> our

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
chilies so what we've got some of our

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.870 
chilies so what we've got some of our
chilies<00:00:07.649> which<00:00:07.799> we<00:00:07.980> put<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.220> our<00:00:08.280> aquaponics

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
chilies which we put in our aquaponics

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.549 
chilies which we put in our aquaponics
system<00:00:09.210> you<00:00:09.630> can<00:00:09.750> just<00:00:09.929> as<00:00:09.990> easily<00:00:10.110> put<00:00:10.320> it

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
system you can just as easily put it

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.140 
system you can just as easily put it
into<00:00:11.420> normal<00:00:12.420> soils<00:00:13.049> Mobile<00:00:13.769> winter<00:00:14.099> you<00:00:14.969> can

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
into normal soils Mobile winter you can

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.760 
into normal soils Mobile winter you can
put<00:00:15.299> them<00:00:15.420> into<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.660> hydroponic<00:00:16.260> system<00:00:16.650> to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
put them into a hydroponic system to

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.109 
put them into a hydroponic system to
keep<00:00:16.890> them<00:00:17.039> overwinter<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.670> important<00:00:18.029> thing

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
keep them overwinter the important thing

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.179 
keep them overwinter the important thing
is<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.270> try<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.570> keep<00:00:18.690> them<00:00:18.869> warm<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.980> what<00:00:20.160> I

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
is to try and keep them warm and what I

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.370 
is to try and keep them warm and what I
mean<00:00:20.369> warm<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.850> mean<00:00:21.000> above<00:00:21.210> 10<00:00:21.480> degrees<00:00:21.510> so

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
mean warm I mean above 10 degrees so

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.960 
mean warm I mean above 10 degrees so
they'd<00:00:22.650> have<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.890> be<00:00:22.949> super<00:00:23.250> warm<00:00:23.460> like<00:00:23.760> during

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
they'd have to be super warm like during

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.790 
they'd have to be super warm like during
the<00:00:24.000> summer<00:00:24.240> when<00:00:24.420> they're<00:00:24.600> footing<00:00:24.960> but

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
the summer when they're footing but

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.980 
the summer when they're footing but
every<00:00:26.039> winter<00:00:26.189> they<00:00:26.400> do<00:00:26.460> like<00:00:26.789> to<00:00:27.000> keep<00:00:27.750> away

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
every winter they do like to keep away

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.509 
every winter they do like to keep away
from<00:00:28.019> anything<00:00:28.410> close<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.769> freezing<00:00:29.130> because

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
from anything close to freezing because

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.479 
from anything close to freezing because
then<00:00:29.699> they'll<00:00:29.910> die<00:00:30.599> off<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.349> they<00:00:32.340> are

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
then they'll die off so they are

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.910 
then they'll die off so they are
perennials<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.719> can<00:00:34.020> keep<00:00:34.469> them<00:00:34.620> for<00:00:34.770> many

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
perennials so you can keep them for many

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.459 
perennials so you can keep them for many
many<00:00:35.010> years<00:00:35.430> but<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.540> UK<00:00:36.719> climate<00:00:37.230> because

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
many years but in the UK climate because

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.810 
many years but in the UK climate because
you<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:37.829> cold<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.160> winter<00:00:38.190> they<00:00:38.520> tend<00:00:38.760> to

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
you get so cold in winter they tend to

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.200 
you get so cold in winter they tend to
act<00:00:38.879> more<00:00:39.239> like<00:00:39.270> annuals<00:00:40.820> so<00:00:41.820> these<00:00:41.940> are<00:00:42.149> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
act more like annuals so these are the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.790 
act more like annuals so these are the
clothes<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.989> plants<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.320> we<00:00:43.500> put<00:00:43.710> into

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
clothes that the plants that we put into

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.830 
clothes that the plants that we put into
our<00:00:43.920> aquaponic<00:00:44.579> system<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:45.480> can<00:00:45.629> win<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
our aquaponic system so we can win the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.690 
our aquaponic system so we can win the
greenhouse<00:00:46.140> every<00:00:46.410> winter<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.309> there's<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
greenhouse every winter so there's a

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.830 
greenhouse every winter so there's a
couple<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:48.000> things<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.300> need<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.570> think<00:00:48.750> about

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
couple of things you need to think about

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.420 
couple of things you need to think about
so<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> first<00:00:49.559> thing<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:49.890> if<00:00:50.219> there's<00:00:50.399> any

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
so the first thing is if there's any

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.189 
so the first thing is if there's any
fruit<00:00:50.760> left<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> plant<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.750> there's<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.020> few

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
fruit left on the plant so there's a few

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.380 
fruit left on the plant so there's a few
I<00:00:52.469> was<00:00:52.949> pretty<00:00:53.190> literally<00:00:53.670> we'll<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:54.149> go

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
I was pretty literally we'll just go

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.569 
I was pretty literally we'll just go
down<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:54.690> we'll<00:00:54.750> pick<00:00:54.899> all<00:00:55.079> those<00:00:55.230> fruits

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
down and we'll pick all those fruits

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.630 
down and we'll pick all those fruits
come<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.789> see<00:00:57.859> anything<00:00:58.859> usable<00:00:59.219> ups<00:00:59.460> they

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
come on see anything usable ups they

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.060 
come on see anything usable ups they
will<00:00:59.820> use<00:01:00.260> anything<00:01:01.260> that's<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.739> know<00:01:01.800> bit

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
will use anything that's you know bit

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.270 
will use anything that's you know bit
sort<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.430> shriveled<00:01:02.609> up<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.510> like<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.470> Thai

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
sort of shriveled up so like this Thai

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.270 
sort of shriveled up so like this Thai
orange<00:01:05.640> here<00:01:06.140> not<00:01:07.140> really<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.250> a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
orange here not really going to be a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.730 
orange here not really going to be a
nice<00:01:08.490> fruit<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.939> eat<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:10.080> will<00:01:10.409> go<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.650> to

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
nice fruit to eat so that will go on to

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.219 
nice fruit to eat so that will go on to
compost<00:01:11.100> tea<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.549> I'm<00:01:12.180> surely<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:13.080> know<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
compost tea and I'm surely you know the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.320 
compost tea and I'm surely you know the
birds<00:01:13.470> will<00:01:13.740> enjoy<00:01:14.490> having<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.820> go<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.180> a

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
birds will enjoy having to go of that a

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.899 
birds will enjoy having to go of that a
place<00:01:15.540> here<00:01:16.220> the<00:01:17.220> second<00:01:17.520> thing<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.729> need<00:01:17.759> to

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
place here the second thing you need to

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.240 
place here the second thing you need to
do<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.390> then<00:01:18.659> go<00:01:18.689> long<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.200> look<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:19.890> any<00:01:20.009> dead

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
do is then go long and look for any dead

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.179 
do is then go long and look for any dead
leaves<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.759> come<00:01:21.530> onto<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.770> plant<00:01:23.009> at<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
leaves that come onto the plant at the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.980 
leaves that come onto the plant at the
end<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.520> year<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.210> literally<00:01:24.659> we'll<00:01:24.840> just

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
end of the year so literally we'll just

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.480 
end of the year so literally we'll just
go<00:01:25.140> along<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:25.350> us<00:01:25.710> get<00:01:25.890> rid<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.040> all<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.220> these

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
go along with us get rid of all of these

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.880 
go along with us get rid of all of these
leaves<00:01:27.180> here<00:01:29.840> okay<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.290> then<00:01:31.560> once<00:01:31.740> we've

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
leaves here okay and then once we've

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.560 
leaves here okay and then once we've
done<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.100> then<00:01:32.490> we<00:01:33.030> need<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.210> think<00:01:33.270> about

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
done that then we need to think about

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.660 
done that then we need to think about
whether<00:01:33.689> we're<00:01:33.810> gonna<00:01:33.900> cut<00:01:34.170> down<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:35.280> pants

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
whether we're gonna cut down the pants

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.450 
whether we're gonna cut down the pants
at<00:01:35.850> all<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.229> go<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.100> bottom<00:01:38.369> of

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
at all so if you go to the bottom of

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.760 
at all so if you go to the bottom of
the--<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:39.210> then<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.540> can<00:01:39.689> see<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:40.079> there<00:01:40.619> is

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the-- but then you can see that there is

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.460 
the-- but then you can see that there is
some<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.600> tendency<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.840> sort<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.079> start<00:01:43.350> to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
some that tendency to sort of start to

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.990 
some that tendency to sort of start to
get<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.860> little<00:01:44.040> bit<00:01:44.250> woody<00:01:44.460> at<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.700> bottom

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
get a little bit woody at the bottom

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.230 
get a little bit woody at the bottom
here<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.229> see<00:01:46.380> here<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.490> green<00:01:48.060> who

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
here so you can see here the green who

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.060 
here so you can see here the green who
starts<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.570> turn<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.780> bit<00:01:48.960> brown<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.920> does

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
starts to turn a bit brown and it does

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.950 
starts to turn a bit brown and it does
give<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> woody<00:01:50.759> effect<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.360> over<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.930> next

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
give you a woody effect so over the next

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.350 
give you a woody effect so over the next
few<00:01:52.229> years<00:01:52.380> if<00:01:53.100> we<00:01:53.340> keep<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.670> plant<00:01:54.030> alive

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
few years if we keep the plant alive

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.730 
few years if we keep the plant alive
then<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.140> will<00:01:55.259> sell<00:01:55.470> into<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.920> small<00:01:56.340> bush<00:01:57.270> and

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
then it will sell into a small bush and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.770 
then it will sell into a small bush and
resemble<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.920> small<00:01:59.490> tree<00:01:59.759> eventually

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
resemble a small tree eventually

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.080 
resemble a small tree eventually
and<00:02:01.080> go<00:02:01.200> quite<00:02:01.440> woody<00:02:01.650> so<00:02:02.250> what<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:02.790> want<00:02:02.940> to<00:02:03.000> do

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
and go quite woody so what we want to do

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.400 
and go quite woody so what we want to do
is<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.300> need<00:02:03.480> to<00:02:03.510> make<00:02:03.600> sure<00:02:03.840> there's<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.080> good

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
is you need to make sure there's a good

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.060 
is you need to make sure there's a good
eight<00:02:04.890> inches<00:02:05.400> of<00:02:05.460> green<00:02:06.120> growth<00:02:06.450> above<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
eight inches of green growth above the

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.999 
eight inches of green growth above the
woody<00:02:09.060> area<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:09.690> quite<00:02:10.259> simply<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.800> know<00:02:10.890> if

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
woody area so quite simply you know if

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.520 
woody area so quite simply you know if
you've<00:02:11.130> got<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> big<00:02:11.490> hand

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
you've got a big hand

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.840 
you've got a big hand
huge<00:02:13.670> 8<00:02:14.670> inches<00:02:15.980> span<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.280> what<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.430> do<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.730> I

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
huge 8 inches span so what I do is I

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.810 
huge 8 inches span so what I do is I
basically<00:02:18.380> do<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.590> bottom<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.190> plant

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
basically do to the bottom of the plant

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.760 
basically do to the bottom of the plant
and<00:02:21.000> find<00:02:21.450> where<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> woody<00:02:21.990> part<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.470> and

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
and find where the woody part is and

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.290 
and find where the woody part is and
then<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.190> literally<00:02:23.459> just<00:02:23.700> measure<00:02:23.940> up<00:02:24.120> with<00:02:24.270> a

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
then I literally just measure up with a

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.060 
then I literally just measure up with a
span<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.840> then<00:02:25.320> I<00:02:25.380> know<00:02:25.440> from<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:26.010> point

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
span and then I know from this point

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.670 
span and then I know from this point
here<00:02:26.459> I<00:02:26.730> can<00:02:27.390> then<00:02:27.630> chop<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.110> back<00:02:28.260> if<00:02:28.380> I<00:02:28.470> want

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
here I can then chop it back if I want

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.320 
here I can then chop it back if I want
to<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.250> can<00:02:29.400> just<00:02:29.550> see<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.000> top<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.270> the

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
to so you can just see the top of the

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.350 
to so you can just see the top of the
plant<00:02:30.570> there<00:02:30.810> I<00:02:31.130> can<00:02:32.130> get<00:02:32.250> rid<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.459> basically

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
plant there I can get rid of basically

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.540 
plant there I can get rid of basically
what<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.570> does<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.260> compacts<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.250> plant

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
what that does is it compacts the plant

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.760 
what that does is it compacts the plant
and<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.880> encourages<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.900> growth<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.350> from<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
and it encourages the growth in from the

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.380 
and it encourages the growth in from the
lower<00:02:37.950> parts<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.459> plant<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.300> the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
lower parts of the plant and the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.060 
lower parts of the plant and the
following<00:02:39.630> year<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.290> does<00:02:40.470> get<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.680> bit<00:02:40.739> more<00:02:41.010> a

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
following year it does get a bit more a

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.830 
following year it does get a bit more a
bushy<00:02:41.340> effect<00:02:42.320> but<00:02:43.320> it<00:02:43.440> also<00:02:44.270> helps<00:02:45.270> cut<00:02:45.660> back

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
bushy effect but it also helps cut back

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.960 
bushy effect but it also helps cut back
anything<00:02:46.260> that's<00:02:46.800> got<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:46.980> bit<00:02:47.130> gangly<00:02:47.520> and

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
anything that's got a bit gangly and

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.580 
anything that's got a bit gangly and
throughout<00:02:48.300> this<00:02:48.510> season<00:02:51.050> so<00:02:52.050> now<00:02:52.200> given<00:02:52.470> them

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
throughout this season so now given them

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.490 
throughout this season so now given them
a<00:02:52.620> trim<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:54.690> can<00:02:54.840> see<00:02:55.020> they're<00:02:55.260> actually

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
a trim and you can see they're actually

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:05.720 
a trim and you can see they're actually
quite<00:02:56.300> Werebear<00:02:57.300> now<00:03:02.030> anything<00:03:03.030> extra<00:03:04.730> pretty

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
quite Werebear now anything extra pretty

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.180 
quite Werebear now anything extra pretty
much<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.570> bare<00:03:06.780> minimum<00:03:07.200> so<00:03:07.739> we've<00:03:08.010> taken

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
much the the bare minimum so we've taken

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.789 
much the the bare minimum so we've taken
the<00:03:09.030> woody<00:03:09.510> part<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.959> stems<00:03:10.230> on<00:03:10.530> each<00:03:10.620> one

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
the woody part of the stems on each one

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.560 
the woody part of the stems on each one
of<00:03:10.890> them<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.430> then<00:03:11.670> we've<00:03:11.820> just<00:03:12.000> given<00:03:12.120> them<00:03:12.360> a

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
of them and then we've just given them a

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.020 
of them and then we've just given them a
hand<00:03:13.140> span<00:03:15.739> just<00:03:16.739> some<00:03:16.950> green<00:03:17.190> grows<00:03:17.400> up<00:03:17.640> to

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
hand span just some green grows up to

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.060 
hand span just some green grows up to
there<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:19.019> give<00:03:19.200> them<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.410> trim<00:03:19.620> so<00:03:19.890> I've<00:03:19.950> been

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
there and give them a trim so I've been

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.860 
there and give them a trim so I've been
quite<00:03:20.340> harsh<00:03:20.610> on<00:03:20.820> them<00:03:20.940> but<00:03:21.390> as<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.600> can<00:03:21.720> see

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
quite harsh on them but as you can see

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.960 
quite harsh on them but as you can see
that<00:03:22.110> many<00:03:22.260> of<00:03:22.470> them<00:03:22.590> have<00:03:22.799> no<00:03:23.400> younger<00:03:23.760> leaves

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
that many of them have no younger leaves

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.580 
that many of them have no younger leaves
on<00:03:24.269> there<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:24.690> they<00:03:24.900> have<00:03:25.019> little<00:03:25.410> shoots

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
on there and they have little shoots

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.250 
on there and they have little shoots
coming<00:03:25.860> out<00:03:26.010> even<00:03:27.000> on<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.720> smallest<00:03:27.959> ones

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
coming out even on the smallest ones

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.500 
coming out even on the smallest ones
growing<00:03:29.100> out<00:03:29.220> there<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:29.880> I'm<00:03:29.940> quite<00:03:30.120> confident

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
growing out there so I'm quite confident
