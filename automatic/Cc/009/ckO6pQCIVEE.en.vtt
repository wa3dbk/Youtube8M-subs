00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.010
 between the two winners who were the 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.260
 skeleton of the first fight or not of the 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.450

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.449
 transport where I want to like 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.570

 nine patches and all that I loosen up to 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.920

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.700
 put skeletons mutan there bastard that 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.310

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.660
 god god know how to endure 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.730
 leave me alone 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.100
 endurance 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.380
 let me grab the good things already 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.490
 he already threw me poison and made me slow 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:41.510
 this does not happen anything let's accommodate this 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.180
 fast already that's fine so it's ok ok 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.630
 I did not expect that, I'm sorry it's that 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.830
 let's put this in normal and will 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:57.020
 put yes yes to the inder man with 200 of 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:02:00.650
 life and the skeleton butÃ¡n skeletons 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.510
 mutant where it is I do not see it or that I already 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.460
 I found here I do not know why I did not 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.320
 I found at the beginning but here 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.520
 we are the two winners the time 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.560
 I think this battle is going to be very 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.290
 fast because the two do a lot 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.390
 damage and well it 's good let's see how 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.640
 let's see how we're going to put this 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.220
 in survival and in creative fast and I 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.660
 is attacking so there we are already 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.550
 is that they are fighting if I do not 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.040
 wrong there we are fighting 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.780
 let's see what I'm saying, I think 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.310
 this battle is going to be very fast I do not know 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.970
 let's see this how can they opt this 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.620
 understand discomfort 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.630
 well there he made the panda hug 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.420
 but with the bones 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.740
 how did the skeleton is hitting 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.200
 far thing that is taking advantage of the 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.570
 skeleton that is by far not the 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.220
 skeleton and then for when the 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.440
 leander manco has already hit him several blows 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.640
 the skeleton and good if you support this 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.140
 good video this I think will end 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.630
 well before 44 of life against 104 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.140
 if this saw you support him I will do the 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.209
 winner and right now against 100 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.209
 snowball ems well I think he won 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.209
 lenderman I think it was pretty obvious I 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.260
 I tell you this is supported in this video I'm going 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.650
 to do 100 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.260
 snowball against 50 in the man yes 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.580
 because 50 ander more because because in 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.340
 sister is very strong for example here 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.370
 I put one of these and as you can see what 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.260
 it's going to be shit what do you do that you have 80's 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.750
 life because he has them very much 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.840
 a lot more life the leander killed 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.180
 so if you support this video this one 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.600
 Do a super epic battle, I think 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.970
 that 200 is new lens against 100 in the 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.820
 gentle 50 in others a thing like that so that 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.070
 be level then you know you support in 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.980
 this video this how they saw him raped 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.800
 then I think it's going to be 200 if not 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.760
 goals against 150 in the most not today is 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.470
 let's do this so it's a 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.600
 little bit longer the video we are going to do 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:59.200
 what I know how many one two three four 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:04:05.290
 five against how many about 20 21 23 45 67 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:06.770
 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.610
 we were 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:13.070
 there is no god so imagine the same as 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.920
 I'm doing this right now but with more 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.140
 of 100 or about 200 is we do not fly 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.579
 unlike that 50 I tell them for a 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.310
 example 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.840
 more than peak is going to be evidently that 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.460
 I have to prepare it, I can not 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.750
 do it like louis right now because it's 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.340
 a very large number I all have to 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.780
 prepare everything then it seems that if 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.520
 I think they're going to tend more 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.009
 easy to win them in weapons very very 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.219
 easy I'm here in 100% sure 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:44.089
 this if the first ones are already dying 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:45.800
 golems this one I also have this or it 

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:49.430
 you have gone down just 50 see this 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:52.420
 encounter already has 100 78 73 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.420
 if they are going to win 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:59.310
 5 I'm love I'm sure 2 of life and 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.320
 love me 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.020
 this already died the first ndr man that 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.230
 dies or god or god is very good 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.810
 animation 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.050
 and if I think they won very easily the 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:16.250
 that da is alive just 32 and 22 are not left 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:19.580
 alive and it's going to die this one died 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:23.180
 a live flee flee that fled for your life 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.420
 and your family I accompany you come hear hey 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:30.700
 there is no other from another one to come here to God 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:35.569
 have not died or have not seen it 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:37.999
 good died another here look 12 are left 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:40.490
 well two were only two 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:42.499
 sisters and a new motto so I think 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:46.550
 it is quite obvious that won the 

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:49.270
 brother talks he's going to help kill him I'll 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.270
 I help friend 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.570
 my love I am or not the clipper 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:04.679
 well and now with that already died on 

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:08.740
 last so they won the one-armed no 

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:11.110
 two sender mans were left as well this one 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.819
 well if it was alive this well then they 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.669
 I say support this video without wanting a 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:17.410
 epic battle of 200 against 50 or something 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:19.569
 well because I tell them to be close 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.490
 because if I put 200 against 200 then 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:23.740
 Obviously you will win under more 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.680
 Well, I'm going to finish this here, 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:33.030
 which I hope you liked it is very 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:33.030
 good the picture better said 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.639
 well here I am already building this 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:40.749
 so the repairs 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.749
 oh god hold 2 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:50.510
 how it was good so they liked it 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:50.510
 and see you until next time
