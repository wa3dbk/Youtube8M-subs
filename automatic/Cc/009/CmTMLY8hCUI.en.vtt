00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
it's a confidence builder and not only

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.089 
it's a confidence builder and not only
is<00:02:17.549> that<00:02:17.579> it<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.629> allows<00:02:18.989> you<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.409> make<00:02:19.650> every

is that it it allows you to make every

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.270 
is that it it allows you to make every

these<00:02:26.129> slides<00:02:26.519> when<00:02:27.510> I've<00:02:27.629> done<00:02:27.840> on<00:02:28.019> this

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
these slides when I've done on this

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.470 
these slides when I've done on this
board<00:02:28.439> I<00:02:28.590> feel<00:02:28.799> more<00:02:29.069> locked<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.670> more

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
board I feel more locked in more

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.830 
board I feel more locked in more
confident<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.489> it<00:02:32.489> just<00:02:33.180> feels<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.659> lot

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
confident and it just feels a lot

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.199 
confident and it just feels a lot
cleaner<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.349> mean<00:02:34.680> just<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.579> whole<00:02:35.610> board

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
cleaner I mean just the whole board

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.809 
cleaner I mean just the whole board
itself<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:37.920> just<00:02:38.849> love<00:02:39.060> all<00:02:39.269> of<00:02:39.299> it<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.750> i<00:02:40.049> also

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
itself I just love all of it and i also

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.399 
itself I just love all of it and i also
think<00:02:41.819> it's<00:02:42.030> great<00:02:42.239> that<00:02:42.299> you're<00:02:42.930> even<00:02:43.290> able

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
think it's great that you're even able

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.559 
think it's great that you're even able
to<00:02:43.590> ollie<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:44.040> sport<00:02:44.310> i<00:02:44.370> mean<00:02:44.519> it's<00:02:44.790> not<00:02:45.269> easy

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
to ollie the sport i mean it's not easy

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.289 
to ollie the sport i mean it's not easy
for<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> company<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.290> pull<00:02:46.560> off<00:02:46.769> a<00:02:46.799> 30<00:02:47.159> 8.5<00:02:47.970> inch

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
for a company to pull off a 30 8.5 inch

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:54.140 
for a company to pull off a 30 8.5 inch
board<00:02:50.599> that<00:02:51.599> has<00:02:52.280> slight<00:02:53.280> kicks<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:54.000> you're

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
board that has slight kicks that you're

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.479 
board that has slight kicks that you're
able<00:02:54.299> to<00:02:54.510> ollie<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.989> i<00:02:55.109> mean<00:02:55.260> i<00:02:55.500> just<00:02:56.280> think

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
able to ollie it i mean i just think

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.979 
able to ollie it i mean i just think
that<00:02:56.609> that's<00:02:56.819> also<00:02:57.150> another<00:02:57.299> great<00:02:57.599> feature

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
that that's also another great feature

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.710 
that that's also another great feature
from<00:02:58.409> this<00:02:58.470> idea<00:02:58.980> so<00:02:59.310> before<00:02:59.639> i<00:02:59.670> show<00:03:00.359> you<00:03:00.389> some

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
from this idea so before i show you some

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.199 
from this idea so before i show you some
riding<00:03:00.989> on<00:03:01.379> this<00:03:01.650> board<00:03:01.980> i<00:03:02.220> wanted<00:03:03.000> to<00:03:03.090> mention

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
riding on this board i wanted to mention

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.490 
riding on this board i wanted to mention
two<00:03:03.540> other<00:03:03.569> things<00:03:03.900> i<00:03:03.989> forgot<00:03:04.319> to<00:03:04.349> mention

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
two other things i forgot to mention

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.879 
two other things i forgot to mention
before<00:03:04.889> and<00:03:05.370> those<00:03:06.030> are<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.889> preston

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
before and those are the preston

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.720 
before and those are the preston
flushmount<00:03:08.569> mounting<00:03:09.569> option<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.730> wheel

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
flushmount mounting option and the wheel

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.280 
flushmount mounting option and the wheel
wells<00:03:11.970> first<00:03:12.239> talked<00:03:12.540> about<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:12.840> preston

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
wells first talked about the preston

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.720 
wells first talked about the preston
flush<00:03:13.530> mount<00:03:14.060> I've<00:03:15.060> liked<00:03:15.959> them<00:03:16.139> a<00:03:16.230> lot<00:03:16.260> lately

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
flush mount I've liked them a lot lately

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.240 
flush mount I've liked them a lot lately
I<00:03:17.750> think<00:03:18.750> it's<00:03:18.989> a<00:03:19.109> really<00:03:19.319> good<00:03:19.470> option<00:03:19.829> I

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
I think it's a really good option I

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.839 
I think it's a really good option I
think<00:03:20.549> it<00:03:20.699> it's<00:03:20.970> better<00:03:21.540> than<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.199> Machine

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
think it it's better than the Machine

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.729 
think it it's better than the Machine
flush<00:03:23.849> mounts<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.269> can<00:03:24.419> be<00:03:24.540> created<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:25.199> I

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
flush mounts that can be created and I

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.099 
flush mounts that can be created and I
think<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.280> these<00:03:27.150> are<00:03:27.389> just<00:03:27.629> as<00:03:27.870> good<00:03:28.049> if

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
think that these are just as good if

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.699 
think that these are just as good if
better<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:29.099> I<00:03:29.940> have<00:03:30.209> yet<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.750> find<00:03:30.930> no<00:03:31.290> problem

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
better and I have yet to find no problem

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.680 
better and I have yet to find no problem
with<00:03:31.859> them<00:03:32.010> so<00:03:32.400> those<00:03:32.790> are<00:03:32.819> those<00:03:33.209> are<00:03:33.269> plus

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
with them so those are those are plus

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.300 
with them so those are those are plus
the<00:03:34.290> next<00:03:34.470> thing<00:03:34.650> I'd<00:03:34.769> like<00:03:34.919> to<00:03:35.010> talk<00:03:35.129> about

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
the next thing I'd like to talk about

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.069 
the next thing I'd like to talk about
that<00:03:35.579> effort<00:03:35.849> at<00:03:35.940> mentioned<00:03:36.239> earlier<00:03:36.329> are<00:03:36.720> the

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
that effort at mentioned earlier are the

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.069 
that effort at mentioned earlier are the
wheel<00:03:37.410> wells<00:03:37.970> they're<00:03:38.970> really<00:03:39.120> deeply<00:03:39.629> cut<00:03:39.900> in

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
wheel wells they're really deeply cut in

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.050 
wheel wells they're really deeply cut in
they<00:03:40.680> run<00:03:41.040> what<00:03:41.370> right<00:03:41.609> into<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.910> wheel

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
they run what right into the wheel

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.409 
they run what right into the wheel
flares<00:03:42.359> which<00:03:42.660> is<00:03:42.780> great<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:44.000> you<00:03:45.000> can<00:03:45.209> run

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
flares which is great and you can run

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.420 
flares which is great and you can run
those<00:03:45.660> larger<00:03:46.230> downhill<00:03:46.799> wheels<00:03:47.099> on<00:03:47.400> your

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
those larger downhill wheels on your

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.129 
those larger downhill wheels on your
setup<00:03:47.879> without<00:03:48.000> worrying<00:03:48.449> about<00:03:48.750> getting

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
setup without worrying about getting

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.069 
setup without worrying about getting
wheel<00:03:49.470> bite<00:03:49.910> I'm<00:03:50.910> running<00:03:51.359> these<00:03:51.540> dangers

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
wheel bite I'm running these dangers

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.550 
wheel bite I'm running these dangers
there<00:03:52.440> 72<00:03:53.310> millimeter<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:54.079> still<00:03:55.079> have<00:03:55.199> a<00:03:55.230> ton

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
there 72 millimeter and still have a ton

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.909 
there 72 millimeter and still have a ton
of<00:03:55.620> clearance<00:03:56.129> right<00:03:56.340> there<00:03:57.139> so<00:03:58.139> I<00:03:58.470> think<00:03:58.560> the

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
of clearance right there so I think the

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.339 
of clearance right there so I think the
bigger<00:03:59.159> wheels<00:03:59.370> shouldn't<00:03:59.790> be<00:03:59.849> a<00:03:59.879> problem<00:04:00.349> so

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
bigger wheels shouldn't be a problem so

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:02.899 
bigger wheels shouldn't be a problem so
those<00:04:01.769> are<00:04:01.889> the<00:04:01.919> last<00:04:02.129> two<00:04:02.340> things<00:04:02.579> I<00:04:02.669> want<00:04:02.819> to
