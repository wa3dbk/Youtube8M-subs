assault<00:00:07.620> rifle<00:00:07.980> so<00:00:08.760> far<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.059> gun<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.269> pretty

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
assault rifle so far this gun is pretty

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.080 
assault rifle so far this gun is pretty
solid<00:00:09.809> Ivan<00:00:10.260> used<00:00:10.410> it<00:00:10.559> too<00:00:10.769> much<00:00:10.980> but<00:00:11.340> from<00:00:11.849> my

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
solid Ivan used it too much but from my

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.509 
solid Ivan used it too much but from my
knowledge<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.809> usage<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.559> very<00:00:13.799> high

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
knowledge and usage of it very high

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.700 
knowledge and usage of it very high
damage<00:00:14.790> pretty<00:00:15.240> good<00:00:15.420> accuracy<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.529> only

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
damage pretty good accuracy the only

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.620 
damage pretty good accuracy the only
downside<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.220> sometimes<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:18.000> recoil<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.600> a

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
downside is sometimes that recoil is a

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.689 
downside is sometimes that recoil is a
little<00:00:19.140> bit<00:00:19.260> too<00:00:19.470> bouncy<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.160> if<00:00:20.550> you're

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
little bit too bouncy and if you're

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.279 
little bit too bouncy and if you're
going<00:00:20.880> after<00:00:21.090> someone<00:00:21.480> who's<00:00:21.720> head<00:00:21.930> glitch<00:00:22.140> in

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
going after someone who's head glitch in

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.109 
going after someone who's head glitch in
a<00:00:22.380> car<00:00:22.619> or<00:00:22.890> wall<00:00:23.840> trashcan<00:00:24.840> or<00:00:24.869> whatever

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
a car or wall trashcan or whatever

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.849 
a car or wall trashcan or whatever
sometimes<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.359> do<00:00:27.599> miss<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:27.869> headshot<00:00:28.289> so

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
sometimes you do miss that headshot so

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.800 
sometimes you do miss that headshot so
that's<00:00:29.490> why<00:00:29.670> most<00:00:29.849> people<00:00:30.210> are<00:00:30.359> preferring

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
that's why most people are preferring

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.010 
that's why most people are preferring
the<00:00:30.840> scar<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:32.340> ACR<00:00:33.030> over<00:00:33.420> this<00:00:33.570> weapon

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
not as good as the g36 that's got to be

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.450 
not as good as the g36 that's got to be
the<00:00:45.660> best<00:00:45.899> reload<00:00:46.410> animation<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:47.160> modern
