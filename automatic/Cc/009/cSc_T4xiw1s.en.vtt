00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
it also is very warm and friendly and

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.430 
it also is very warm and friendly and
appealing<00:00:46.579> rather<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:47.879> Levi<00:00:48.289> one<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.379> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
appealing rather like Levi one of the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.489 
appealing rather like Levi one of the
main<00:00:49.589> challenges<00:00:49.769> that<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:50.370> faced<00:00:50.640> was<00:00:50.910> taking

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:51.499 
main challenges that we faced was taking

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:54.619 
main challenges that we faced was taking
human<00:00:52.499> features<00:00:53.309> eyes<00:00:53.489> nose<00:00:53.820> face<00:00:54.420> and

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
human features eyes nose face and

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.110 
human features eyes nose face and
actually<00:00:54.749> making<00:00:55.440> them<00:00:55.769> to<00:00:56.309> scale<00:00:56.640> which<00:00:56.940> our

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
actually making them to scale which our

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.939 
actually making them to scale which our
animators<00:00:57.600> could<00:00:57.780> handle<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.649> one<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.890> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
animators could handle and so one of the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.410 
animators could handle and so one of the
biggest<00:00:59.280> differences<00:00:59.699> on<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.030> job<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.390> that

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
biggest differences on this job is that

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.020 
biggest differences on this job is that
Levi<00:01:00.839> Roots<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.620> about<00:01:02.249> half<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.579> meter<00:01:02.760> tall

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
Levi Roots is about half a meter tall

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.880 
Levi Roots is about half a meter tall
and<00:01:03.449> that's<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.929> animators<00:01:04.409> can<00:01:04.530> actually

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
and that's so the animators can actually

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.980 
and that's so the animators can actually
get<00:01:05.370> in<00:01:05.520> an<00:01:05.640> animate<00:01:05.970> all<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.450> details<00:01:06.870> that

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
get in an animate all the details that

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.250 
get in an animate all the details that
are<00:01:07.170> needed<00:01:07.410> in<00:01:07.470> his<00:01:07.650> face<00:01:08.570> we<00:01:09.570> have<00:01:09.750> done<00:01:09.960> some

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
are needed in his face we have done some

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.370 
are needed in his face we have done some
animations<00:01:10.890> before<00:01:11.730> we<00:01:12.690> know<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> process<00:01:13.350> is

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
animations before we know the process is

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.460 
animations before we know the process is
very<00:01:13.440> long<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.900> from<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.990> beginning<00:01:16.080> was

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
very long and from the beginning was

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.500 
very long and from the beginning was
it's<00:01:16.980> quite<00:01:17.160> tricky<00:01:17.430> because<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.300> can

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
it's quite tricky because you can

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.570 
it's quite tricky because you can
imagine<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.290> never<00:01:19.500> you're<00:01:20.160> not<00:01:20.340> sure

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
imagine but you never you're not sure

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.520 
imagine but you never you're not sure
about<00:01:20.790> how<00:01:21.270> you'll<00:01:21.510> be<00:01:21.660> the<00:01:21.810> result<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> final

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
about how you'll be the result the final

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.430 
about how you'll be the result the final
result<00:01:23.010> but<00:01:23.940> because<00:01:24.360> was<00:01:24.570> our<00:01:24.840> tomorrow<00:01:25.140> you

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
result but because was our tomorrow you

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.190 
result but because was our tomorrow you
are<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.800> confident<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.780> relaxed<00:01:27.780> about<00:01:27.840> that

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
are so confident so relaxed about that

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.640 
are so confident so relaxed about that

caricature them without misrepresenting

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.870 
caricature them without misrepresenting
them<00:01:34.350> is<00:01:34.470> quite<00:01:34.620> a<00:01:34.650> challenge<00:01:35.040> normally<00:01:35.580> and

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
them is quite a challenge normally and

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.730 
them is quite a challenge normally and
we're<00:01:36.000> very<00:01:36.180> happy<00:01:36.330> animating<00:01:36.870> dogs<00:01:37.230> or

leaps<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.489> faith<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:16.060> because<00:02:17.050> admin<00:02:17.440> did

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
leaps of faith and because admin did

such<00:02:18.129> a<00:02:18.160> good<00:02:18.370> job<00:02:18.430> creating<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.510> burst<00:02:19.860> it

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
such a good job creating the burst it

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.220 
such a good job creating the burst it
required<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.400> smaller<00:02:21.700> leap<00:02:22.000> of<00:02:22.150> faith<00:02:22.330> so<00:02:22.720> when

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
required a smaller leap of faith so when

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.259
