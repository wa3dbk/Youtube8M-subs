00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.200
 I bring another recipe what we are going to 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.990
 to cook are some meat pancakes 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.759
 milled with potatoes and well here I'm going to 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.759
 teach the ingredients that I will use 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.100
 well here I already have the peeled potatoes 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.550
 Now we're going to grate it with a grater 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.810
 so that we can make our recipe and 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.750
 well so here I'm going to teach you 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:46.430
 how am I going to do it, let's grate the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.430
 potatoes in this way 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 ah 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.460
 you have to be very careful because these 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.460
 radiators have a lot of edge and 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.960
 well here I already have a little and this 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.810
 we're going to make it 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.570
 all the potatoes that we are going to use and 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.930
 then let's mix it with the meat 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.330
 here I have ready the grated potato 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.840
 and well now what we are going to do is 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.160
 add the ground meat and this 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.160
 let's mix everything 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.580
 I'm going to add 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:39.110
 the marinade of goya more or less as a 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.980
 spoonful of marinade 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:46.820
 or if not, then you will feel it 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.700
 where you think it's okay to see 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.700
 that the marinade has a lot of salt then 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.100
 the best we no longer salt but there 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.580
 have to try it before to see how we 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.030
 remains 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.870
 the flavor we are going to add another little 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.060
 of marinade and we will not add salt 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.680
 with the marinade is more than enough and 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.680
 now we are going to add the eggs 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.459
 and we are going to mix everything 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.020
 Now what we are going to do is give you 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:30.250
 shape our pancakes we are going to 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.590
 grab some of the mixture 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.510

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.930
