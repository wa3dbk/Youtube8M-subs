00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.440 
about is essentially a rush type game
mode<00:00:14.070> it's<00:00:14.309> very<00:00:14.549> similar<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.969> Battlefield

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
mode it's very similar to Battlefield

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.300 
mode it's very similar to Battlefield
3's<00:00:15.660> rush<00:00:15.960> but<00:00:16.529> it<00:00:16.619> does<00:00:16.710> have<00:00:16.890> some<00:00:17.070> slight

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
3's rush but it does have some slight

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.070 
3's rush but it does have some slight
differences<00:00:17.550> basically<00:00:18.480> what<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.779> have<00:00:18.810> to

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
differences basically what you have to

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.320 
differences basically what you have to
do<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.439> metal<00:00:19.980> water<00:00:20.130> warfighter<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.210> have

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
do in metal water warfighter is you have

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.300 
do in metal water warfighter is you have
to<00:00:21.480> take<00:00:21.720> an<00:00:21.840> objective<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.500> then<00:00:22.619> defend<00:00:23.130> it

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
to take an objective and then defend it

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.769 
to take an objective and then defend it
you<00:00:23.760> know<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:23.939> either<00:00:24.060> have<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.330> plant<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
you know you either have to plant the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.689 
you know you either have to plant the
objective<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.830> can<00:00:25.980> be<00:00:26.099> various<00:00:26.460> things

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
objective it it can be various things

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.250 
objective it it can be various things
sometimes<00:00:27.119> it'll<00:00:27.269> be<00:00:27.390> like<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> piece<00:00:28.230> of

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
sometimes it'll be like a piece of

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.929 
sometimes it'll be like a piece of
weaponry<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.949> have<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.189> blow<00:00:29.340> up<00:00:29.550> or<00:00:29.760> like<00:00:29.910> a

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
weaponry you have to blow up or like a

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.820 
weaponry you have to blow up or like a
lighthouse<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:31.050> think<00:00:31.199> one<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.470> maps<00:00:31.619> has

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
lighthouse I think one of the maps has

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.590 
lighthouse I think one of the maps has
like<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.040> very<00:00:32.489> small<00:00:32.759> lighthouse<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.239> at<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
like a very small lighthouse you at the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.440 
like a very small lighthouse you at the
blow<00:00:33.750> up<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.739> building<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.670> bridge<00:00:35.940> anything

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
blow up a building a bridge anything

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.790 
blow up a building a bridge anything
like<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.989> it's<00:00:37.110> actually<00:00:37.200> kind<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.649> cool

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
like that so it's actually kind of cool

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.650 
like that so it's actually kind of cool
it<00:00:38.250> was<00:00:38.460> really<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.730> game<00:00:39.149> mode<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.510> I'm

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
it was really the game mode that I'm

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.389 
it was really the game mode that I'm
looking<00:00:39.989> forward<00:00:40.230> was<00:00:40.620> looking<00:00:41.040> forward<00:00:41.280> to

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
looking forward was looking forward to

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.270 
looking forward was looking forward to
most<00:00:41.700> now<00:00:42.050> does<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.200> live<00:00:43.320> up<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.620> expectations

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
most now does it live up to expectations

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.680 
most now does it live up to expectations

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
will talk a little bit about that but

knee-jerk review of the game last night
and<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.600> want<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.840> do<00:00:51.899> an<00:00:52.020> in-depth<00:00:52.860> video<00:00:53.160> on

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
and I want to do an in-depth video on

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.220 
and I want to do an in-depth video on
the<00:00:53.730> game<00:00:53.940> once<00:00:54.329> I've<00:00:54.510> spent<00:00:54.750> more<00:00:54.870> time<00:00:54.930> with

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
the game once I've spent more time with

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.660 
the game once I've spent more time with
it<00:00:55.379> because<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.590> don't<00:00:55.739> feel<00:00:55.920> like<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.370> fair

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
it because I don't feel like it be fair

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.810 
it because I don't feel like it be fair
to<00:00:57.030> give<00:00:57.300> an<00:00:57.420> in-depth<00:00:57.870> thought<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.530> game

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
to give an in-depth thought on the game

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.750 
to give an in-depth thought on the game
until<00:00:59.820> I<00:01:00.629> really<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> grip<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.609> ins

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
until I really have a grip on the ins

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.889 
until I really have a grip on the ins
and<00:01:02.940> outs<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.270> metal<00:01:03.539> Honor<00:01:03.690> Warfighter

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
and outs of metal Honor Warfighter

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.450 
and outs of metal Honor Warfighter
because<00:01:04.379> I've<00:01:04.500> played<00:01:04.769> about<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.070> think<00:01:05.339> I've

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
because I've played about I think I've

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.850 
because I've played about I think I've
played<00:01:05.670> about<00:01:05.820> five<00:01:06.119> hours<00:01:06.150> right<00:01:06.750> now<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.830> I

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
played about five hours right now so I

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.899 
played about five hours right now so I
don't<00:01:08.010> think<00:01:08.130> it'd<00:01:08.189> be<00:01:08.220> fair<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.610> give<00:01:08.880> a

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
don't think it'd be fair to give a

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.359 
don't think it'd be fair to give a
review<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:10.020> being<00:01:10.260> said<00:01:10.590> one<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
review on it that being said one of the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.460 
review on it that being said one of the
downsides<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.270> combat<00:01:12.659> mission<00:01:13.020> mode<00:01:13.229> is

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
downsides to the combat mission mode is

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.800 
downsides to the combat mission mode is
the<00:01:13.920> maps<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.430> maps<00:01:14.460> are<00:01:14.790> very<00:01:15.090> very<00:01:15.330> linear<00:01:15.750> I

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
the maps the maps are very very linear I

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.929 
the maps the maps are very very linear I
mean<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.170> does<00:01:16.350> fit<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.830> game<00:01:17.040> type<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:17.850> in

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
mean it does fit the game type but in

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.120 
mean it does fit the game type but in
the<00:01:18.000> same<00:01:18.180> respect<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.900> leads<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.650> eat<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> lot

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
the same respect it leads to eat a lot

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.950 
the same respect it leads to eat a lot
of<00:01:20.310> chokepoints<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:21.119> leads<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.540> lot<00:01:21.900> of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
of chokepoints that leads to a lot of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.170 
of chokepoints that leads to a lot of
spawn<00:01:22.290> trapping<00:01:22.909> especially<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.090> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
spawn trapping especially for the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.210 
spawn trapping especially for the
attackers<00:01:24.659> if<00:01:25.439> you're<00:01:25.590> familiar<00:01:25.710> with<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
good team versus a bad team so that's

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.830

did<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.470> video<00:02:57.650> in<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.220> beta<00:02:58.640> showing<00:02:59.629> that<00:02:59.780> one

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
did a video in the beta showing that one

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.330 
did a video in the beta showing that one
off<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.500> little<00:03:00.530> birds<00:03:00.920> more<00:03:01.160> like<00:03:01.310> a

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
off and the little birds more like a

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.580 
off and the little birds more like a
strafing<00:03:01.849> run<00:03:02.060> a<00:03:02.690> lot<00:03:03.049> of<00:03:03.079> times<00:03:03.319> i<00:03:03.440> don't

it's really hit or miss i mean if you
can<00:03:06.739> find<00:03:06.859> a<00:03:06.980> good<00:03:07.010> concentration<00:03:07.640> of<00:03:08.150> people

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
can find a good concentration of people

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.750 
can find a good concentration of people
you<00:03:09.230> can<00:03:09.379> get<00:03:09.500> some<00:03:09.620> good<00:03:09.829> good<00:03:10.430> amount<00:03:10.670> of

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
you can get some good good amount of

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.099 
you can get some good good amount of
kills<00:03:10.940> with<00:03:11.150> it<00:03:11.269> but<00:03:11.420> for<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.599> most<00:03:11.750> part<00:03:11.870> i've

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:12.109 
kills with it but for the most part i've

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:13.900 
kills with it but for the most part i've
always<00:03:12.349> found<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.650> UAV<00:03:13.160> is<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.459> better<00:03:13.730> way

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
always found the UAV is the better way

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.030 
always found the UAV is the better way
to<00:03:13.940> go<00:03:14.090> but<00:03:14.480> like<00:03:15.290> I<00:03:15.379> was<00:03:15.500> saying<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.799> point

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
we shouldn't all run assault because

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
definitely makes it a lot easier on your

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.830 
definitely makes it a lot easier on your
team<00:03:37.340> to<00:03:37.489> figure<00:03:37.730> out<00:03:37.880> where<00:03:38.060> concentrations

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
team to figure out where concentrations

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.780 
team to figure out where concentrations
of<00:03:38.959> people<00:03:39.290> are<00:03:39.440> because<00:03:40.250> some<00:03:40.400> of<00:03:40.430> these<00:03:40.519> maps

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
of people are because some of these maps

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.460 
of people are because some of these maps
can<00:03:41.060> get<00:03:41.269> very<00:03:41.450> campy<00:03:41.930> and<00:03:41.959> that's<00:03:42.169> one<00:03:42.290> of<00:03:42.410> the

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
can get very campy and that's one of the

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.080 
can get very campy and that's one of the
like<00:03:42.889> i<00:03:42.919> said<00:03:43.160> one<00:03:43.280> of<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.459> downsides<00:03:43.639> to

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
like i said one of the downsides to

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.240 
like i said one of the downsides to
combat<00:03:44.540> mission<00:03:44.900> is<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.620> fact<00:03:45.829> that<00:03:45.950> it<00:03:46.099> can

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
combat mission is the fact that it can

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.220 
combat mission is the fact that it can
get<00:03:46.400> very<00:03:46.459> very<00:03:46.940> clustered<00:03:47.510> it<00:03:47.630> can<00:03:47.720> basically

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
get very very clustered it can basically

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.069 
get very very clustered it can basically
turn<00:03:48.650> into<00:03:48.680> a<00:03:48.889> standoff<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.669> you<00:03:50.660> notice<00:03:50.930> our

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
turn into a standoff and you notice our

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.839 
turn into a standoff and you notice our
team<00:03:51.260> is<00:03:51.410> playing<00:03:51.560> very<00:03:51.859> meticulous<00:03:52.549> you<00:03:52.760> know

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
team is playing very meticulous you know

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:54.370 
team is playing very meticulous you know
we're<00:03:53.030> not<00:03:53.150> rushing<00:03:53.510> in<00:03:53.750> I'm<00:03:53.900> not<00:03:54.079> playing

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
we're not rushing in I'm not playing

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.890 
we're not rushing in I'm not playing
super<00:03:54.769> aggressive<00:03:55.280> because<00:03:56.120> about<00:03:56.359> the<00:03:56.569> first

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
super aggressive because about the first

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.629 
super aggressive because about the first
hour<00:03:57.139> or<00:03:57.440> two<00:03:57.560> of<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.769> game<00:03:57.950> I<00:03:57.980> was<00:03:58.310> really

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
hour or two of the game I was really

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.400 
hour or two of the game I was really
running<00:03:58.819> around<00:03:59.209> like<00:03:59.389> like<00:03:59.780> an<00:03:59.930> idiot<00:04:00.049> just

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
running around like like an idiot just

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.690 
running around like like an idiot just
trying<00:04:00.650> to<00:04:00.739> learn<00:04:00.859> the<00:04:01.010> maps<00:04:01.190> trying<00:04:01.489> to<00:04:01.579> get<00:04:01.669> a

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
trying to learn the maps trying to get a

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.909 
trying to learn the maps trying to get a
feel<00:04:02.000> for<00:04:02.269> how<00:04:02.419> the<00:04:02.450> game<00:04:02.780> played<00:04:03.109> and<00:04:03.379> I

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
feel for how the game played and I

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.619 
feel for how the game played and I
quickly<00:04:04.160> learned<00:04:04.430> that<00:04:04.639> plane<00:04:04.970> aggressive

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
quickly learned that plane aggressive

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:07.690 
quickly learned that plane aggressive
really<00:04:06.019> doesn't<00:04:06.530> doesn't<00:04:06.980> do<00:04:07.250> it<00:04:07.370> for<00:04:07.400> you<00:04:07.579> on

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
really doesn't doesn't do it for you on

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.339 
really doesn't doesn't do it for you on
some<00:04:08.000> of<00:04:08.090> these<00:04:08.150> maps<00:04:08.419> especially<00:04:08.900> on<00:04:08.989> combat

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
some of these maps especially on combat

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.170 
some of these maps especially on combat
mission<00:04:09.620> because<00:04:09.799> you<00:04:09.919> run<00:04:10.129> in<00:04:10.280> there<00:04:10.310> you

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
mission because you run in there you

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.699 
mission because you run in there you
might<00:04:11.329> run<00:04:11.480> in<00:04:11.599> the<00:04:11.690> four<00:04:11.900> or<00:04:11.989> five<00:04:12.169> guys<00:04:12.379> and

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
might run in the four or five guys and

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.470 
might run in the four or five guys and
there's<00:04:12.889> literally<00:04:13.430> no<00:04:13.760> chance<00:04:14.090> that<00:04:14.359> you're

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
there's literally no chance that you're

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.240 
there's literally no chance that you're
going<00:04:14.629> to<00:04:14.810> survive<00:04:15.109> in<00:04:15.319> a<00:04:15.410> scenario<00:04:15.560> like<00:04:15.859> that

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
going to survive in a scenario like that

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.520 
going to survive in a scenario like that
so<00:04:16.519> you<00:04:17.329> do<00:04:17.449> want<00:04:17.630> to<00:04:17.660> play<00:04:17.810> more<00:04:17.989> tactically

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
so you do want to play more tactically

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:19.930 
so you do want to play more tactically
and<00:04:18.650> that's<00:04:18.769> one<00:04:18.919> of<00:04:18.949> the<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.430> positive

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
and that's one of the the positive

finally get my Apache but we're not
really<00:05:51.680> going<00:05:51.860> to<00:05:51.980> get<00:05:52.190> much<00:05:52.310> in<00:05:52.490> this<00:05:52.610> Apache

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
really going to get much in this Apache

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.970 
really going to get much in this Apache
unfortunately<00:05:53.690> because<00:05:54.020> it<00:05:54.200> is<00:05:54.320> glitchy<00:05:54.650> and

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:54.980 
unfortunately because it is glitchy and

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.100 
unfortunately because it is glitchy and
James<00:05:55.700> actually<00:05:56.090> doesn't<00:05:56.390> get<00:05:56.510> teleported<00:05:56.810> to

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
James actually doesn't get teleported to

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.830 
James actually doesn't get teleported to
it<00:05:57.320> but<00:05:57.730> yeah<00:05:58.730> they<00:05:58.880> end<00:05:59.090> up<00:05:59.180> getting<00:05:59.420> like<00:05:59.600> two

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
it but yeah they end up getting like two

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.620 
it but yeah they end up getting like two
kills<00:06:00.140> in<00:06:00.320> it<00:06:00.440> or<00:06:00.530> something<00:06:00.560> like<00:06:00.890> that<00:06:00.950> so

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
kills in it or something like that so

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.090 
kills in it or something like that so
not<00:06:02.630> bad<00:06:02.810> considering<00:06:03.290> the<00:06:03.440> game<00:06:03.650> was<00:06:03.800> ending

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100
