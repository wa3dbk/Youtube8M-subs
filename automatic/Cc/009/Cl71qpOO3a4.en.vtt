still<00:05:48.659> it<00:05:48.960> shows<00:05:49.229> innovative<00:05:49.919> thinking<00:05:50.339> or

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
still it shows innovative thinking or

still it shows innovative thinking or
innovative<00:05:51.330> lying<00:05:51.870> I<00:05:52.399> am<00:05:53.399> impressed

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
innovative lying I am impressed

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.430
