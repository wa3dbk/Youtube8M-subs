supreme line they're gonna offer the top
line<00:00:14.660> protection<00:00:15.259> as<00:00:15.379> well<00:00:15.829> as<00:00:15.950> some

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:16.129 
line protection as well as some

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.859 
line protection as well as some
unbelievable<00:00:16.850> mobility<00:00:17.420> out<00:00:17.510> of<00:00:17.600> this<00:00:17.690> guy

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
unbelievable mobility out of this guy

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.960 
unbelievable mobility out of this guy
I'm<00:00:18.140> so<00:00:18.619> starting<00:00:18.950> us<00:00:19.039> out<00:00:19.190> on<00:00:19.400> the<00:00:19.760> front

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
I'm so starting us out on the front

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.700 
I'm so starting us out on the front
portion<00:00:20.150> of<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.390> pad<00:00:20.539> you<00:00:20.750> can<00:00:21.260> see<00:00:21.500> here

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
portion of the pad you can see here

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.169 
portion of the pad you can see here
they're<00:00:21.859> using<00:00:21.890> several<00:00:22.429> different<00:00:22.580> panels

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:23.179 
they're using several different panels

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:24.519 
they're using several different panels
which<00:00:23.330> I<00:00:23.420> really<00:00:23.750> like<00:00:23.869> in<00:00:23.990> the<00:00:24.050> shoulder<00:00:24.289> pads

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
which I really like in the shoulder pads

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.050 
which I really like in the shoulder pads
because<00:00:24.710> at<00:00:24.890> a<00:00:24.920> level<00:00:25.220> allows<00:00:25.670> them<00:00:25.910> to

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
because at a level allows them to

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.300 
because at a level allows them to
maintain<00:00:26.240> that<00:00:26.779> high<00:00:27.019> level<00:00:27.289> protection<00:00:27.500> by

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
maintain that high level protection by

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.009 
maintain that high level protection by
increasing<00:00:29.060> the<00:00:29.150> overall<00:00:29.179> level<00:00:29.839> of

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:30.019 
increasing the overall level of

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.120 
increasing the overall level of
performance<00:00:30.500> and<00:00:30.589> I<00:00:30.650> think<00:00:30.800> that's<00:00:30.949> the

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
performance and I think that's the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.100 
performance and I think that's the
really<00:00:31.339> biggest<00:00:31.699> difference<00:00:32.210> you<00:00:32.599> see<00:00:32.630> on<00:00:32.990> the

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
really biggest difference you see on the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.470 
really biggest difference you see on the
top<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.500> line<00:00:33.650> pads<00:00:34.000> compared<00:00:35.000> to<00:00:35.090> one<00:00:35.270> below

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
top the line pads compared to one below

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.330 
top the line pads compared to one below
is<00:00:35.719> because<00:00:36.020> it<00:00:36.170> really<00:00:36.379> has<00:00:36.530> a<00:00:36.559> huge<00:00:36.860> jump<00:00:37.219> and

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
is because it really has a huge jump and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.700 
is because it really has a huge jump and
mobility<00:00:37.700> and<00:00:38.090> feel<00:00:38.360> to<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:38.899> fit<00:00:39.170> so<00:00:39.410> starting

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
mobility and feel to the fit so starting

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.590 
mobility and feel to the fit so starting
us<00:00:39.800> out<00:00:39.920> on<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.190> front<00:00:40.399> portion<00:00:40.640> you<00:00:41.239> can<00:00:41.390> see

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
us out on the front portion you can see

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.660 
us out on the front portion you can see
here<00:00:41.930> they're<00:00:42.260> using<00:00:42.590> that<00:00:42.680> max<00:00:43.010> orb<00:00:43.340> shell

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
here they're using that max orb shell

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.950 
here they're using that max orb shell
unit<00:00:44.090> so<00:00:44.149> that's<00:00:44.210> going<00:00:44.390> to<00:00:44.449> really<00:00:44.660> increase

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
unit so that's going to really increase

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.810 
unit so that's going to really increase
the<00:00:45.170> oval<00:00:45.379> protection<00:00:45.949> to<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:46.190> sternum<00:00:46.579> area

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
the oval protection to the sternum area

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.849 
the oval protection to the sternum area
as<00:00:47.120> well<00:00:47.510> as<00:00:47.629> some<00:00:47.780> dual<00:00:47.989> density<00:00:48.199> foams<00:00:48.649> you

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
as well as some dual density foams you

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.220 
as well as some dual density foams you
also<00:00:49.070> have<00:00:49.190> some<00:00:49.399> hex<00:00:49.670> orb<00:00:50.059> up<00:00:50.329> in<00:00:50.750> here<00:00:51.050> to

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
also have some hex orb up in here to

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.869 
also have some hex orb up in here to
keep<00:00:51.410> the<00:00:51.559> overall<00:00:51.859> lightweight<00:00:52.370> feel<00:00:52.640> but

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
keep the overall lightweight feel but

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.400 
keep the overall lightweight feel but
once<00:00:53.030> again<00:00:53.180> give<00:00:53.690> you<00:00:53.780> that<00:00:53.899> great<00:00:54.079> level<00:00:54.350> of

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
once again give you that great level of

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.619 
once again give you that great level of
protection<00:00:54.530> you<00:00:55.100> can<00:00:55.910> see<00:00:56.180> here<00:00:56.329> it's<00:00:56.449> almost

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
protection you can see here it's almost

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.830 
protection you can see here it's almost
like<00:00:56.870> a<00:00:56.899> a<00:00:57.170> two-channel<00:00:58.090> jacket<00:00:59.090> design<00:00:59.390> you

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
like a a two-channel jacket design you

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.810 
like a a two-channel jacket design you
have<00:00:59.870> some<00:01:00.079> nice<00:01:00.199> perforated<00:01:00.890> foams<00:01:01.519> in<00:01:01.730> there

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
have some nice perforated foams in there

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.069 
have some nice perforated foams in there
so<00:01:01.940> it's<00:01:02.059> going<00:01:02.149> to<00:01:02.239> have<00:01:02.539> a<00:01:02.570> very<00:01:02.809> lightweight

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
so it's going to have a very lightweight

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.439 
so it's going to have a very lightweight
feel<00:01:03.559> it's<00:01:04.010> not<00:01:04.160> a<00:01:04.190> very<00:01:04.370> thick<00:01:04.670> foams<00:01:04.970> but

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
feel it's not a very thick foams but

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:06.700 
feel it's not a very thick foams but
it's<00:01:05.540> going<00:01:05.630> to<00:01:05.690> be<00:01:05.810> a<00:01:05.840> good<00:01:06.050> amount<00:01:06.680> of

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
it's going to be a good amount of

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.140 
it's going to be a good amount of
protection<00:01:07.190> for<00:01:07.310> that<00:01:07.369> outer<00:01:07.640> area<00:01:07.970> that

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
protection for that outer area that

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.480 
protection for that outer area that
doesn't<00:01:08.479> get<00:01:08.630> quite<00:01:08.960> as<00:01:09.080> many<00:01:09.290> impacts<00:01:09.740> now

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
doesn't get quite as many impacts now

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.520 
doesn't get quite as many impacts now
moving<00:01:10.729> on<00:01:10.939> to<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:11.720> shoulder<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.110> the<00:01:12.200> bicep

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
moving on to the shoulder and the bicep

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.560 
moving on to the shoulder and the bicep
portion<00:01:12.890> of<00:01:13.009> the<00:01:13.070> pad<00:01:13.220> you<00:01:13.880> can<00:01:14.000> see<00:01:14.210> here<00:01:14.450> they

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
portion of the pad you can see here they

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.660 
portion of the pad you can see here they
are<00:01:14.600> using<00:01:14.840> that<00:01:15.020> segmented<00:01:15.619> bicep<00:01:16.040> so<00:01:16.640> I

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
are using that segmented bicep so I

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.160 
are using that segmented bicep so I
really<00:01:16.939> like<00:01:17.090> that<00:01:17.210> as<00:01:17.360> well<00:01:17.509> it<00:01:17.659> allows<00:01:17.930> as

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
really like that as well it allows as

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.840 
really like that as well it allows as
the<00:01:18.290> arm<00:01:18.470> moves<00:01:18.770> for<00:01:19.009> it<00:01:19.100> to<00:01:19.189> slide<00:01:19.460> inside

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
the arm moves for it to slide inside

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.730 
the arm moves for it to slide inside
each<00:01:20.030> other<00:01:20.240> and<00:01:20.960> also<00:01:21.229> one<00:01:21.500> thing<00:01:21.590> you'll

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
each other and also one thing you'll

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.649 
each other and also one thing you'll
notice<00:01:21.829> at<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.189> bottom<00:01:22.460> piece<00:01:23.270> here<00:01:23.509> it

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
notice at the bottom piece here it

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.330 
notice at the bottom piece here it
really<00:01:23.900> wraps<00:01:24.229> around<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.740> bicep<00:01:25.130> does<00:01:25.310> a

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
really wraps around the bicep does a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.039 
really wraps around the bicep does a
great<00:01:25.579> job<00:01:25.820> that<00:01:26.000> nice<00:01:26.509> and<00:01:26.659> thick<00:01:26.810> plastic

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
great job that nice and thick plastic

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:28.510 
great job that nice and thick plastic
insert<00:01:27.560> so<00:01:27.680> you're<00:01:27.770> gonna<00:01:27.860> get<00:01:28.040> a<00:01:28.100> good<00:01:28.400> level

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
insert so you're gonna get a good level

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.190 
insert so you're gonna get a good level
protection<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.299> front<00:01:29.659> as<00:01:29.810> well<00:01:29.960> as<00:01:30.079> the

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
protection to the front as well as the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.960 
protection to the front as well as the
back<00:01:30.350> of<00:01:30.380> it<00:01:30.680> and<00:01:30.829> once<00:01:31.250> again<00:01:31.400> keeping<00:01:31.880> that

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
back of it and once again keeping that

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.450 
back of it and once again keeping that
level<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.360> mobility<00:01:32.570> you<00:01:33.560> can<00:01:33.710> also<00:01:33.860> see<00:01:34.189> here

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
level of mobility you can also see here

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.190 
level of mobility you can also see here
it<00:01:34.640> has<00:01:35.000> an<00:01:35.149> adjustment<00:01:35.570> feature<00:01:35.869> for<00:01:36.140> the

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
it has an adjustment feature for the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.410 
it has an adjustment feature for the
bicep<00:01:36.590> so<00:01:36.740> that<00:01:36.829> depends<00:01:37.310> on<00:01:37.399> how<00:01:37.610> far<00:01:37.850> down<00:01:38.090> or

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
bicep so that depends on how far down or

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.179 
bicep so that depends on how far down or
how<00:01:38.509> far<00:01:38.689> up<00:01:38.930> you'd<00:01:39.110> like<00:01:39.229> it<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.439> be<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:39.740> that

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
how far up you'd like it to be and that

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.520 
how far up you'd like it to be and that
same<00:01:40.490> adjustment<00:01:41.060> goes<00:01:41.329> for<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:42.229> overall

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
same adjustment goes for the overall

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.800 
same adjustment goes for the overall
shoulder<00:01:42.979> cap<00:01:43.220> so<00:01:43.909> they're<00:01:44.030> actually<00:01:44.360> using<00:01:44.630> a

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
shoulder cap so they're actually using a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.240 
shoulder cap so they're actually using a
couple<00:01:45.350> different<00:01:45.470> materials<00:01:46.070> in<00:01:46.159> the

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
couple different materials in the

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.010 
couple different materials in the
shoulder<00:01:46.460> cap<00:01:46.670> or<00:01:47.060> they're<00:01:47.240> actually<00:01:47.570> fusing

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
shoulder cap or they're actually fusing

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.990 
shoulder cap or they're actually fusing
foams<00:01:48.350> as<00:01:48.649> well<00:01:48.799> as<00:01:48.890> plastics<00:01:49.399> together<00:01:49.700> to

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
foams as well as plastics together to

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.209 
foams as well as plastics together to
increase<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.570> level<00:01:50.780> of<00:01:50.840> protection<00:01:50.990> but<00:01:51.950> the

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:52.219 
increase the level of protection but the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:53.590 
increase the level of protection but the
nice<00:01:52.399> thing<00:01:52.610> about<00:01:52.700> being<00:01:53.000> able<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.240> adjust

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
nice thing about being able to adjust

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.330 
nice thing about being able to adjust
where<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.020> shoulder<00:01:54.409> is<00:01:54.560> you<00:01:55.009> can<00:01:55.159> really

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
where the shoulder is you can really

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.950 
where the shoulder is you can really
make<00:01:55.579> sure<00:01:55.610> that<00:01:55.790> it<00:01:56.060> sits<00:01:56.329> square<00:01:56.719> on<00:01:56.840> the

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
make sure that it sits square on the

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.420 
make sure that it sits square on the
shoulder<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.350> give<00:01:57.469> you<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.770> right<00:01:57.979> amount<00:01:58.189> of

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
shoulder to give you the right amount of

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.730 
shoulder to give you the right amount of
protection<00:01:58.750> as<00:01:59.750> far<00:01:59.960> as<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.140> clavicle<00:02:00.619> they

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
protection as far as the clavicle they

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.529 
protection as far as the clavicle they
use<00:02:00.860> some<00:02:01.039> nice<00:02:01.189> thick<00:02:01.820> foams<00:02:02.090> up<00:02:02.270> there<00:02:02.450> as

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
use some nice thick foams up there as

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.630 
use some nice thick foams up there as
well<00:02:02.719> and<00:02:02.990> they<00:02:03.439> have<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.740> two<00:02:03.950> jackets<00:02:04.250> kind

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
well and they have the two jackets kind

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.850 
well and they have the two jackets kind
of<00:02:04.729> seamed<00:02:05.030> together<00:02:05.240> right<00:02:05.659> here<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:06.770> it

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
of seamed together right here and it

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.130 
of seamed together right here and it
really<00:02:07.130> has<00:02:07.430> an<00:02:07.789> overlapping<00:02:08.330> design<00:02:08.810> so<00:02:09.110> you

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
really has an overlapping design so you

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.810 
really has an overlapping design so you
get<00:02:09.350> that<00:02:09.470> good<00:02:09.710> level<00:02:09.950> protection<00:02:10.100> but<00:02:10.580> still

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
get that good level protection but still

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.160 
get that good level protection but still
allows<00:02:11.210> these<00:02:11.480> pieces<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:12.020> move

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
allows these pieces to move

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.620 
allows these pieces to move
independently<00:02:12.410> which<00:02:13.400> I<00:02:13.490> really<00:02:13.760> like<00:02:13.970> as<00:02:14.210> we

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
independently which I really like as we

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.960 
independently which I really like as we
go<00:02:14.750> ahead<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.050> turn<00:02:15.470> this<00:02:15.620> guy<00:02:15.800> around<00:02:15.940> take<00:02:16.940> a

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
go ahead and turn this guy around take a

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:17.590 
go ahead and turn this guy around take a
look<00:02:17.060> at<00:02:17.300> what<00:02:17.420> there

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
look at what there

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.300 
look at what there
the<00:02:17.900> back<00:02:18.080> portion<00:02:18.410> very<00:02:18.830> similar<00:02:19.160> design

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
the back portion very similar design

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.120 
the back portion very similar design
into<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.700> front<00:02:20.000> instead<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.720> double<00:02:21.230> panel

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
into the front instead of a double panel

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.310 
into the front instead of a double panel
here<00:02:22.490> I'm<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:23.030> have<00:02:23.210> just<00:02:23.480> one<00:02:23.690> on<00:02:23.840> each<00:02:24.050> side

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
here I'm you have just one on each side

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.020 
here I'm you have just one on each side
so<00:02:24.350> it's<00:02:24.620> CE<00:02:24.740> still<00:02:25.130> three<00:02:25.400> panels<00:02:25.760> but<00:02:25.910> it's

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
so it's CE still three panels but it's

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.340 
so it's CE still three panels but it's
not<00:02:26.120> doubled<00:02:26.540> up<00:02:26.660> like<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:26.930> saw<00:02:27.080> on<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.230> front

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
not doubled up like you saw on the front

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.440 
not doubled up like you saw on the front
nice<00:02:27.920> periphery<00:02:28.400> ated<00:02:28.580> foams<00:02:28.850> increase<00:02:29.300> that

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
nice periphery ated foams increase that

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.240 
nice periphery ated foams increase that
air<00:02:29.750> circulation<00:02:30.290> as<00:02:30.500> well<00:02:30.530> as<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.830> comfort

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
air circulation as well as the comfort

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.830 
air circulation as well as the comfort
and<00:02:31.400> then<00:02:31.820> down<00:02:32.030> in<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.210> spine<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:32.600> see<00:02:32.750> the

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
and then down in the spine you see the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.330 
and then down in the spine you see the
segments<00:02:33.380> so<00:02:33.770> that's<00:02:33.890> gonna<00:02:34.040> allow<00:02:34.130> it<00:02:34.220> to

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
segments so that's gonna allow it to

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.100 
segments so that's gonna allow it to
move<00:02:34.550> with<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.880> body<00:02:35.090> you<00:02:35.360> also<00:02:35.720> have<00:02:35.930> them<00:02:36.050> on

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
move with the body you also have them on

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.960 
move with the body you also have them on
the<00:02:36.200> outside<00:02:36.350> here<00:02:37.100> and<00:02:37.220> then<00:02:37.280> some<00:02:37.730> dense

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
the outside here and then some dense

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.820 
the outside here and then some dense
foams<00:02:38.300> as<00:02:38.630> well<00:02:38.780> softer<00:02:39.230> foams<00:02:39.410> underneath

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
foams as well softer foams underneath

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.360 
foams as well softer foams underneath
and<00:02:40.040> then<00:02:40.400> also<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:41.390> have<00:02:41.770> that<00:02:42.770> hex<00:02:43.070> orb

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
and then also you have that hex orb

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.400 
and then also you have that hex orb
material<00:02:43.820> as<00:02:43.970> well<00:02:44.210> so<00:02:44.930> that's<00:02:45.110> going<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.260> help

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
material as well so that's going to help

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.990 
material as well so that's going to help
increase<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:46.100> overall<00:02:46.190> protection<00:02:46.520> to<00:02:46.910> the

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
increase the overall protection to the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.150 
increase the overall protection to the
spine<00:02:47.270> region<00:02:47.660> so<00:02:48.380> this<00:02:48.500> just<00:02:48.650> a<00:02:48.740> quick<00:02:48.860> look

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
spine region so this just a quick look

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.800 
spine region so this just a quick look
