00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
when it comes to going up to the center

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.890 
when it comes to going up to the center
to<00:03:49.970> the<00:03:50.720> center<00:03:50.900> all<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:51.560> way<00:03:51.919> in<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:52.690> just<00:03:53.690> do

light strokes and I just want to make

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.640 
light strokes and I just want to make
sure<00:04:00.319> that<00:04:00.739> it<00:04:00.949> is<00:04:01.160> actually<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:02.139> way<00:04:03.139> I<00:04:03.169> want

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
sure that it is actually the way I want

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.650 
sure that it is actually the way I want
it<00:04:03.739> to<00:04:03.799> so<00:04:04.549> that<00:04:04.699> one<00:04:04.849> looks<00:04:04.879> pretty<00:04:05.120> good<00:04:05.359> it

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
it to so that one looks pretty good it

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.509 
it to so that one looks pretty good it
looks<00:04:05.840> more<00:04:06.169> filled<00:04:06.470> in<00:04:06.709> than<00:04:06.919> this<00:04:07.010> one<00:04:07.280> and

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
looks more filled in than this one and

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.789 
looks more filled in than this one and
it<00:04:07.849> just<00:04:08.030> doesn't<00:04:08.329> look<00:04:08.359> as<00:04:08.599> sparse<00:04:09.199> as<00:04:09.500> this

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
it just doesn't look as sparse as this

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.979 
it just doesn't look as sparse as this
one<00:04:10.010> does<00:04:10.159> because<00:04:10.760> my<00:04:11.030> natural<00:04:11.449> brows<00:04:11.720> are

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
one does because my natural brows are

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.580 
one does because my natural brows are
pretty<00:04:12.440> sparse<00:04:12.889> so<00:04:14.169> that's<00:04:15.169> a<00:04:15.260> good<00:04:15.409> thing

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
pretty sparse so that's a good thing

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.710 
pretty sparse so that's a good thing
about<00:04:15.709> filling<00:04:16.130> them<00:04:16.280> in<00:04:16.400> this<00:04:16.539> you<00:04:17.539> know<00:04:17.659> you

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
up and then what I do is I like to just

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.520 
up and then what I do is I like to just
Pat<00:06:16.570> it<00:06:16.750> so<00:06:16.990> it<00:06:17.110> blends<00:06:17.410> in<00:06:17.740> nicely<00:06:19.260> and<00:06:20.260> then<00:06:20.500> I

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:20.530 
Pat it so it blends in nicely and then I

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.290 
Pat it so it blends in nicely and then I
do<00:06:20.650> the<00:06:20.830> same<00:06:20.860> thing<00:06:21.070> on<00:06:21.490> the<00:06:21.730> other<00:06:21.760> side<00:06:24.300> so

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:25.300 
do the same thing on the other side so

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.910 
do the same thing on the other side so
what<00:06:25.540> this<00:06:25.690> actually<00:06:25.750> does<00:06:26.230> is<00:06:26.620> that<00:06:26.740> it

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:26.920 
what this actually does is that it

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.940 
what this actually does is that it
actually<00:06:27.070> cleans<00:06:28.030> up<00:06:28.330> on<00:06:28.750> the<00:06:29.140> bottom<00:06:29.530> half<00:06:29.740> of

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
actually cleans up on the bottom half of
