that make up the whole brain model

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.570 
that make up the whole brain model
there's<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:33.380> blue<00:01:33.620> which<00:01:33.980> is<00:01:34.190> the<00:01:34.370> logical

sequential thinker there's the red which
is<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.250> interpersonal<00:01:43.760> feeling<00:01:44.600> based<00:01:44.960> so<00:01:45.470> we

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
is the interpersonal feeling based so we

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.800 
is the interpersonal feeling based so we
call<00:01:45.740> a<00:01:45.770> kinesthetic<00:01:46.250> finger<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.270> then

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
call a kinesthetic finger and then

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.950 
call a kinesthetic finger and then
there's<00:01:48.050> the<00:01:48.200> yellow<00:01:48.380> which<00:01:48.740> is<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.950> holistic

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
there's the yellow which is the holistic

own individual thinking preference
that's<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:36.080> first<00:02:36.380> step<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:37.459> second<00:02:37.940> step<00:02:38.000> is

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
that's the first step the second step is

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.559 
that's the first step the second step is
the<00:02:38.989> team<00:02:39.500> profile<00:02:40.190> then<00:02:40.549> takes<00:02:40.940> that<00:02:41.269> data

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
the team profile then takes that data

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.690 
the team profile then takes that data
and<00:02:42.079> creates<00:02:42.980> for<00:02:43.730> like<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.480> picture<00:02:45.319> of<00:02:45.700> the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
and creates for like a a picture of the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.789 
and creates for like a a picture of the
team<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.329> their<00:02:47.720> collective<00:02:48.230> intelligence

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
team and their collective intelligence

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.330 
team and their collective intelligence
it<00:02:49.549> then<00:02:50.120> allows<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.930> team<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.829> look<00:02:52.040> at<00:02:52.220> the

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
it then allows the team to look at the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.630 
it then allows the team to look at the
task<00:02:52.670> its<00:02:53.060> doing<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:54.069> to<00:02:55.069> answer<00:02:55.519> the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
task its doing and to answer the
