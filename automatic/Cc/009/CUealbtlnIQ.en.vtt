00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
every week so it'll be like I'm on one

week add these on the next week and it

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.170 
week add these on the next week and it
just<00:00:34.739> rotates<00:00:34.920> through<00:00:35.430> like<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:36.059> way

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
just rotates through like that that way

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.910 
just rotates through like that that way
we<00:00:36.390> each<00:00:36.570> there's<00:00:37.350> something<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.710> you're

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
we each there's something that you're

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.280 
we each there's something that you're
seeing<00:00:38.219> every<00:00:38.610> week<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.570> also<00:00:39.750> gives<00:00:40.110> us

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.440 
seeing every week but that also gives us
kind<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.890> chance<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.309> we're<00:00:41.489> not<00:00:41.610> each

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
kind of a chance so we're not each

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.450 
kind of a chance so we're not each
having<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.020> do<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> video<00:00:43.440> every<00:00:43.829> week<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.399> our
