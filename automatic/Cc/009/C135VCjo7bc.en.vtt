00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099 
could affect accuracy but I'll give it a

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:06.039 
could affect accuracy but I'll give it a
review<00:02:04.399> of<00:02:04.549> shooting<00:02:04.880> it<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:05.090> see<00:02:05.240> how<00:02:05.420> it<00:02:05.479> how

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
review of shooting it and see how it how

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.749 
review of shooting it and see how it how
it<00:02:06.110> looks<00:02:06.319> now<00:02:06.439> I've<00:02:06.619> done<00:02:06.770> some<00:02:06.979> research<00:02:07.429> on

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
it looks now I've done some research on

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.339 
it looks now I've done some research on
this<00:02:07.939> quite<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.179> bit<00:02:08.299> and<00:02:08.690> they<00:02:08.840> all<00:02:08.959> say<00:02:09.200> that

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349 
this quite a bit and they all say that

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:10.930 
this quite a bit and they all say that
the<00:02:09.470> string<00:02:09.799> pretty<00:02:10.099> much<00:02:10.310> sucks<00:02:10.670> on<00:02:10.819> these

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
the string pretty much sucks on these

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.350 
the string pretty much sucks on these
things

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
things

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.759 
things
and<00:02:13.269> so<00:02:14.269> I<00:02:14.569> can<00:02:14.989> make<00:02:15.019> my<00:02:15.230> own<00:02:15.349> string<00:02:15.620> that's

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
and so I can make my own string that's

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.830 
and so I can make my own string that's
not<00:02:15.920> a<00:02:15.950> big<00:02:16.130> deal<00:02:16.310> but<00:02:16.880> I<00:02:17.150> just<00:02:17.390> want<00:02:17.599> you<00:02:17.690> guys

let's say PSE you go to buy one of those
and<00:03:07.190> it<00:03:07.250> has<00:03:07.370> BSU<00:03:07.790> written<00:03:08.030> oil<00:03:08.299> blooms<00:03:08.510> I

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
and it has BSU written oil blooms I

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.750 
and it has BSU written oil blooms I
don't<00:03:08.720> think<00:03:08.840> that's<00:03:08.989> kind<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.459> arrogant<00:03:10.459> or

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.470 
don't think that's kind of arrogant or
something<00:03:11.030> like<00:03:11.090> that

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
something like that

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.370 
something like that
ugly<00:03:13.000> so<00:03:14.349> so<00:03:15.349> there's<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.739> bow<00:03:16.120> like<00:03:17.120> that<00:03:17.389> now

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
ugly so so there's the bow like that now

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.990 
ugly so so there's the bow like that now
the<00:03:18.440> finish<00:03:19.010> on<00:03:19.220> it<00:03:19.450> is<00:03:21.190> it<00:03:22.190> doesn't<00:03:22.430> feel<00:03:22.730> that

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
the finish on it is it doesn't feel that

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.720 
the finish on it is it doesn't feel that
that<00:03:23.780> good<00:03:24.019> but<00:03:24.319> obviously<00:03:25.310> it<00:03:25.400> comes<00:03:25.519> with

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
that good but obviously it comes with

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.059 
that good but obviously it comes with
these<00:03:25.849> inserts<00:03:26.239> here<00:03:26.450> for<00:03:26.870> a<00:03:26.900> quiver<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.560> this

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
these inserts here for a quiver and this

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.190 
these inserts here for a quiver and this
is<00:03:28.220> for<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.459> like<00:03:29.060> maybe<00:03:29.209> a<00:03:29.359> plunger<00:03:29.780> rest<00:03:30.019> or

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
is for a like maybe a plunger rest or

is for a like maybe a plunger rest or
something<00:03:30.410> like<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:33.280> but<00:03:34.280> overall<00:03:34.849> it

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
something like that and but overall it

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.679 
something like that and but overall it
looks<00:03:35.120> pretty<00:03:35.510> nice<00:03:35.709> it<00:03:36.709> has<00:03:36.860> some<00:03:37.390> some<00:03:38.390> marks

there I don't know if you can see them

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.860 
there I don't know if you can see them
how<00:03:41.800> well<00:03:42.010> those<00:03:42.220> are<00:03:42.400> gonna<00:03:42.520> be<00:03:42.580> I<00:03:43.060> don't<00:03:43.780> know

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
how well those are gonna be I don't know

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.020 
how well those are gonna be I don't know
how<00:03:44.050> long<00:03:44.260> they'll<00:03:44.470> hold<00:03:44.650> up<00:03:44.860> but<00:03:45.100> for<00:03:45.490> 130

how long they'll hold up but for 130
bucks<00:03:46.210> you<00:03:46.390> definitely<00:03:46.720> can't<00:03:46.870> beat<00:03:47.050> it<00:03:48.360> again

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
bucks you definitely can't beat it again

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.580 
bucks you definitely can't beat it again
there's<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.220> bottom<00:03:51.520> end<00:03:52.180> of<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:53.520> the<00:03:54.520> limb

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
there's the bottom end of the the limb

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.380 
there's the bottom end of the the limb
actually<00:03:56.590> this<00:03:56.650> is<00:03:56.800> the<00:03:56.890> top<00:03:57.070> limb<00:03:57.280> so<00:03:57.580> and<00:03:57.850> the

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
actually this is the top limb so and the

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.660 
actually this is the top limb so and the
grooves<00:03:58.950> my<00:03:59.950> other<00:04:00.070> one<00:04:00.250> didn't<00:04:00.430> have<00:04:00.550> very

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
grooves my other one didn't have very

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.800 
grooves my other one didn't have very
deep<00:04:00.940> barriers<00:04:01.270> but<00:04:01.420> these<00:04:01.540> look<00:04:01.690> like

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
deep barriers but these look like

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.330 
deep barriers but these look like
they're<00:04:01.990> pretty<00:04:02.140> good<00:04:02.380> it's<00:04:02.890> pretty<00:04:03.130> deep

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
they're pretty good it's pretty deep

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.970 
they're pretty good it's pretty deep
grooves<00:04:03.700> here<00:04:04.380> this<00:04:05.380> will<00:04:05.500> pretty<00:04:05.650> much<00:04:05.740> sum

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
grooves here this will pretty much sum

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.470 
grooves here this will pretty much sum

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
stabilizer hole in there and I will be

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.570 
stabilizer hole in there and I will be
shooting<00:04:14.710> it<00:04:14.950> here<00:04:15.100> pretty<00:04:15.250> soon

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
shooting it here pretty soon

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.370 
shooting it here pretty soon
