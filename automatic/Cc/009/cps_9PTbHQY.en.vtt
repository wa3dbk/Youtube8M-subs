00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.360
 After the strain activates inside the winery, a 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:13.219
 New cycle 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.299
 more frantic and cable than the previous 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.810
 kim clijsters 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:25.109
 Once the harvest arrives at the winery, it is carefully squeezed so that 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.900
 the old 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.060
 libero the culture mound 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.330
 family seles to release the musician luis cobo josÃ© pascual 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.190
 different with a technical setting 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.460
 sheen cuba and her appointment to protect it from oxidation and bacteria 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.859
 to facilitate maceration 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:43.859
 and to improve the color of the day 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.740
 while mascherano the sugar of the grape transforms into ethyl alcohol 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.490
 and causes a tumultuous alcohol fermentation 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.540
 the carbon dioxide that comes off the pushed fruit or and 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.950
 old and nuggets towards the surface where they form what is known as the 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.950
 hat 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.310
 the red wines see in their color and their aroma in contact with the skins 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.080
 during fermentation 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.400
 this contact keeps tracing the must with a certain frequency that is to say 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.960
 extracting it from the bottom and showering with it three men 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.020
 the temperature of the tank is constantly controlled 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.049
 when it is estimated that alcoholic fermentation has extracted enough 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.049
 substance the pasta will proceed to discover 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.870
 this operation consists of separating the wine made by the tear hand 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.790
 of what is called the pomace constituted by the set of skin is 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.120
 guilty losses 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.560
 this orujo opa can even have approximately 15 per 100 of wine 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.709
 percentage that varies depending on the time that has been allowed to drain 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.779
 and the treatment that has been taken to the post during the works 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.939
 the pulp skins and pips are transported to the presses and compressed 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.789
 to extract the wine they still contain 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:26.039
 you get like that the press wine 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:30.659
 this wine is then added throughout the albino assembly operation 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.659
 in front of 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:41.549
 In the new Cuba the wine is prepared for a new biological transformation 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.169
 malolactic fermentation 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.160
 during which the temperature must be monitored 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.219
 the ideation and the ph 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:50.049
 that is to say 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.090
 the degree of acidity to be placed around the three with maciel 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:04.519
 malolactic fermentation transform malic acid 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:05.610
 bitter taste 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.650
 in lactic acid more pleasant and soft on the palate 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.649
 and improvements in the aroma of wine 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:15.009
 It is a fundamental process in obtaining quality wines 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:25.579
 finished this process the wine is kept in barrels for its conservation and 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.069
 aging 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.069
 it starts like this the pups 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:38.739
 during the aging it is convenient that the barrels are full 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.019
 so they are continuously refilled 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.249
 the importance of this work is such that the filling has its own name 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:56.799
 the aging wine comes from grapes with aptitudes to evolve well in the 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.439
 course of a certain period of time 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.099
 and give place even if it does not summon 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.279
 everywhere we understand the characteristics of the color please and 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:09.869
 aromas that certain wines get with their evolution over time 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.849
 during the wood phase the wine is subjected to a gentle but prolonged 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:25.209
 oxygenation through the small holes in the barrel 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.490
 in this way the tannins are oxidized transforming the violet red of the 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.499
 young wines 

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:34.499
 in red tile 

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:41.199
 another important task this racking of barrels is that rear of the wine 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.099
 periodically from one barrel to another to eliminate the well that remains in the 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:45.729
 background 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.039
 in passing air hiv 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:51.039
 the lot of ayala is done every six 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.199
 the transfer is used to clean and disinfect the newly emptied barrels 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:05.569
 with very hot water introduced pressure 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:09.529
 and they are disinfected by burning a sulfur pill inside 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.240
 in this way it is possible to increase the life of the barrel and that of the wine that less water 

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:21.270
 there are those who say that the fourth waning moon before the new moon 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.349
 It is the right time to transfer 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:29.449
 0 apparently more than the moon what really influences are the high pressures 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.479
 atmospheres that stabilize and fix the dirt of the wines at the bottom of the 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.449
 net 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.939
 this wine destined to aging will still remain for a while in wood 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.599
 with all the flavor and aromas of the oak the crime 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:58.599
 in the bottle 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:05.740
 if in the wood phase the slightly oxidative environment predominated 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.729
 During aging in bottle the environment is completely replenished 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:14.149
 it is the total absence of oxygen that makes certain flavors and aromas 

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:16.789
 acquired in the wood phase 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:19.789
 they are strengthened in this period 

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:22.669
 acts 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.860
 so that the absence of oxygen is total the bottles where it will rest in 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.139
 horizontal position 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:33.009
 making the liquid I discharged 8 I did it to prevent air from entering the 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:36.009
 Exterior 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:41.750
 There is no mathematical formula that indicates the adequate time for this 

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:42.529
 phase 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:46.909
 depends on the evolution of the wine and the experience and good hand of the 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:49.909
 grocer 

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:54.189
 the act 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:04.039
 delirium is the best known material to develop and conserve 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:06.240
 elaborated wine qualities 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.360
 in addition the bottle allows a good presentation 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.360
 and a comfortable distribution 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.339
 Thank you 

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:17.339
