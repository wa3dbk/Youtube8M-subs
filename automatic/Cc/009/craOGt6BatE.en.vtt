is I'm going to scoop now at the point

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.150 
is I'm going to scoop now at the point
of<00:02:12.610> about<00:02:13.510> here<00:02:14.020> maybe<00:02:14.410> this<00:02:14.650> will<00:02:14.800> be<00:02:14.890> six

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
of about here maybe this will be six

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.800 
of about here maybe this will be six
o'clock<00:02:15.550> on<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.760> clock<00:02:16.000> face<00:02:16.180> as<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:16.480> look<00:02:16.660> at

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
o'clock on a clock face as you look at

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.410 
o'clock on a clock face as you look at
it<00:02:16.930> there<00:02:17.650> is<00:02:17.680> an<00:02:17.920> open<00:02:18.400> line<00:02:18.640> where<00:02:18.940> this<00:02:19.120> can

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
it there is an open line where this can

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.120 
it there is an open line where this can
control<00:02:19.840> which<00:02:20.050> this<00:02:20.410> can<00:02:20.620> start<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.920> come<00:02:21.070> up

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
control which this can start to come up

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.100 
control which this can start to come up
against<00:02:21.580> me<00:02:21.700> this<00:02:21.880> way<00:02:22.090> that's<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.900> bad

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
against me this way that's a bad

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.600 
against me this way that's a bad
situation<00:02:23.800> so<00:02:23.830> what<00:02:23.980> I<00:02:24.070> want<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.310> do<00:02:24.370> is<00:02:24.489> move

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
situation so what I want to do is move

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.550 
situation so what I want to do is move
away<00:02:24.790> from<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.209> blade<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.660> carriers<00:02:26.200> are<00:02:26.380> MOJ

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
away from the blade and carriers are MOJ

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.680 
away from the blade and carriers are MOJ
using<00:02:27.040> what<00:02:27.160> we<00:02:27.280> just<00:02:27.459> go<00:02:27.550> like<00:02:27.580> see<00:02:28.090> grip<00:02:28.390> here

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
using what we just go like see grip here

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.710 
using what we just go like see grip here
so<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:29.319> just<00:02:29.680> carry<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.130> away<00:02:30.250> so<00:02:31.209> if<00:02:31.390> he<00:02:31.510> does

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
so I just carry it away so if he does

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.050 
so I just carry it away so if he does
want<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:31.989> come<00:02:32.050> back<00:02:32.319> at<00:02:32.440> me<00:02:32.470> with<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.769> knife

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
want to come back at me with the knife

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.699 
want to come back at me with the knife
very<00:02:34.060> difficult<00:02:34.540> for<00:02:34.630> him<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:34.870> come<00:02:35.050> back<00:02:35.410> he'd

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
very difficult for him to come back he'd

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.410 
very difficult for him to come back he'd
have<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.950> spin<00:02:36.190> but<00:02:36.310> around<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.670> other<00:02:36.730> way<00:02:36.850> or

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
have to spin but around the other way or

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.479 
have to spin but around the other way or
we'd<00:02:37.690> have<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.900> clear<00:02:38.230> this<00:02:38.410> arm<00:02:38.680> all<00:02:38.980> of<00:02:39.370> this

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
we'd have to clear this arm all of this

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.130 
we'd have to clear this arm all of this
is<00:02:39.640> accounted<00:02:40.060> for<00:02:40.090> within<00:02:40.480> Carly<00:02:40.959> this<00:02:41.080> is
