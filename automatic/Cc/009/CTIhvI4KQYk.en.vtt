there<00:00:27.990> today<00:00:28.619> we're<00:00:28.800> talking<00:00:29.039> about

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
there today we're talking about

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.860 
there today we're talking about
principles<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:31.219> flight<00:00:32.660> something<00:00:33.660> that's

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
principles of flight something that's

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.100 
principles of flight something that's
real<00:00:34.230> basic<00:00:35.000> but<00:00:36.000> something<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.660> so

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
real basic but something that is so

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.110 
real basic but something that is so
crucial<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:39.410> understand<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.770> know<00:00:41.219> whether

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
crucial to understand and know whether

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.030 
crucial to understand and know whether
before<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.780> start<00:00:43.079> your<00:00:43.260> flight<00:00:43.469> training<00:00:43.860> or

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
before you start your flight training or

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.410 
before you start your flight training or
before<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.430> get<00:00:44.550> too<00:00:44.789> far<00:00:44.820> along

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
before you get too far along

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.959 
before you get too far along
so<00:00:45.899> let<00:00:45.989> me<00:00:46.050> get<00:00:46.200> up<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.410> imma<00:00:46.739> move<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
so let me get up and imma move to the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.340 
so let me get up and imma move to the
board<00:00:48.420> here<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:50.449> now<00:00:51.449> as<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.780> said<00:00:51.960> I'm<00:00:52.110> by<00:00:52.289> no

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
board here and now as I said I'm by no

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.860 
board here and now as I said I'm by no
means<00:00:52.590> an<00:00:53.070> artist<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.239> bear<00:00:54.449> with<00:00:54.480> me<00:00:54.690> on

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
means an artist so so bear with me on

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.200 
means an artist so so bear with me on
this<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.710> we're<00:00:55.860> talking<00:00:56.129> here<00:00:56.520> principles

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
this but we're talking here principles

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.010 
this but we're talking here principles
of<00:00:57.449> flight<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:58.920> let's<00:00:59.820> see<00:01:00.300> where<00:01:00.539> do<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.690> start

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
of flight so let's see where do I start

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.540 
of flight so let's see where do I start
anything<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.410> flight<00:01:01.620> instructor<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:02.309> draw<00:01:02.489> on

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
anything a flight instructor to draw on

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.369 
anything a flight instructor to draw on
airplanes<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.780> know<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.960> would<00:01:04.080> be<00:01:04.170> pretty

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
airplanes you know it would be pretty

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.230 
airplanes you know it would be pretty
good<00:01:04.559> at<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.769> but<00:01:04.979> I'm<00:01:05.400> not<00:01:05.610> very<00:01:05.670> good<00:01:05.970> at<00:01:06.119> it

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
good at it but I'm not very good at it

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.500 
good at it but I'm not very good at it
this<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.810> our<00:01:07.290> bubble<00:01:08.130> canopy<00:01:08.750> sail<00:01:11.510> that's

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
this is our bubble canopy sail that's

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.230 
this is our bubble canopy sail that's
and<00:01:13.049> that's<00:01:13.470> somehow<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.860> propeller<00:01:14.369> again<00:01:15.150> I'm

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
and that's somehow a propeller again I'm

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.670 
and that's somehow a propeller again I'm
not<00:01:15.360> an<00:01:15.479> artist<00:01:16.700> that's<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.909> wing<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.680> know

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
not an artist that's a wing you know

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.140 
not an artist that's a wing you know
that's<00:01:19.920> not<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> half-bad<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.670> an<00:01:20.759> airplane

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
that's not a half-bad like an airplane

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.080 
that's not a half-bad like an airplane
if<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.990> do<00:01:22.049> say<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.380> myself

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
if I do say so myself

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.070 
if I do say so myself
alright<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:25.009> before<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.369> understand<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
alright so before you can understand the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.649 
alright so before you can understand the
principles<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.950> flight<00:01:29.450> we<00:01:30.450> didn't

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
principles of flight we didn't

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.990 
principles of flight we didn't
understand<00:01:31.259> what<00:01:31.470> four<00:01:31.829> forces<00:01:32.280> are<00:01:32.729> acting

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
understand what four forces are acting

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.340 
understand what four forces are acting
on<00:01:33.479> our<00:01:33.540> airplane<00:01:34.170> at<00:01:34.500> all<00:01:35.040> times<00:01:35.509> okay<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.170> we

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
on our airplane at all times okay so we

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.260 
on our airplane at all times okay so we
obviously<00:01:37.729> have<00:01:41.090> lift

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.450 

and<00:01:45.140> I<00:01:45.200> hope<00:01:45.350> you<00:01:45.470> guys<00:01:45.590> can<00:01:45.650> read<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.280> I<00:01:46.340> know

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
and I hope you guys can read that I know

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.039 
and I hope you guys can read that I know
it<00:01:46.579> might<00:01:46.700> be<00:01:46.820> a<00:01:46.850> little<00:01:46.909> bit<00:01:47.090> hard<00:01:47.299> but<00:01:47.810> the

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
it might be a little bit hard but the

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.120 
it might be a little bit hard but the
first<00:01:48.320> force<00:01:48.680> is<00:01:48.970> lift<00:01:50.290> what<00:01:51.290> counteracts

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
first force is lift what counteracts

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:01.060 
first force is lift what counteracts
lift<00:01:53.350> well<00:01:54.350> we<00:01:54.619> have<00:01:55.540> wait<00:01:59.409> some<00:02:00.409> people<00:02:00.830> and

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
lift well we have wait some people and

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.859 
lift well we have wait some people and
don't<00:02:01.280> my<00:02:01.399> my<00:02:01.549> hand<00:02:01.820> review<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.330> really<00:02:02.659> haven't

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
don't my my hand review I really haven't

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.570 
don't my my hand review I really haven't
worked<00:02:03.049> on<00:02:03.289> it<00:02:03.350> since<00:02:03.710> like<00:02:03.920> kindergarten

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
worked on it since like kindergarten

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.840 
worked on it since like kindergarten
uh-huh<00:02:05.539> wait<00:02:06.380> some<00:02:06.740> people<00:02:07.009> put<00:02:07.189> gravity

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
uh-huh wait some people put gravity

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.400 
uh-huh wait some people put gravity
there<00:02:08.060> but<00:02:08.390> I<00:02:08.420> like<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.750> call<00:02:08.929> this<00:02:09.110> way<00:02:09.349> to

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
there but I like to call this way to

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.160 
there but I like to call this way to
have<00:02:09.709> lift<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:10.399> weight<00:02:10.640> or<00:02:10.970> gravity<00:02:11.840> pulling

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
have lift and weight or gravity pulling

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.270 
have lift and weight or gravity pulling
us<00:02:12.319> down<00:02:12.370> then<00:02:13.370> from<00:02:13.670> our<00:02:13.760> propeller<00:02:15.280> we

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
us down then from our propeller we

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.009 
us down then from our propeller we
generate<00:02:16.730> thrust<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.870> obviously<00:02:20.870> to

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
generate thrust and obviously to

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:28.990 
generate thrust and obviously to
counteract<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:23.830> we<00:02:24.830> have<00:02:25.040> our<00:02:25.600> drag<00:02:27.130> so<00:02:28.130> four

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
counteract that we have our drag so four

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.990 
counteract that we have our drag so four
forces<00:02:29.860> acting<00:02:30.860> on<00:02:31.069> an<00:02:31.250> airplane<00:02:31.870> lift<00:02:32.870> weight

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
forces acting on an airplane lift weight

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.830 
forces acting on an airplane lift weight
thrust<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.299> drag<00:02:36.310> when<00:02:37.310> all<00:02:37.610> four<00:02:38.209> of<00:02:38.540> these

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
thrust and drag when all four of these

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.870 
thrust and drag when all four of these
forces<00:02:39.350> are<00:02:39.920> equal<00:02:40.549> you<00:02:40.930> have<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:42.049> level<00:02:42.380> flight

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
forces are equal you have a level flight

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.789 
forces are equal you have a level flight
when<00:02:43.880> lift<00:02:45.730> exceeds<00:02:46.730> weight<00:02:47.510> or<00:02:48.080> exceeds

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
when lift exceeds weight or exceeds

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.349 
when lift exceeds weight or exceeds
gravity<00:02:49.549> you're<00:02:50.510> in<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:51.049> climb<00:02:52.180> okay

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
gravity you're in a climb okay

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.490 
gravity you're in a climb okay
and<00:02:53.450> likewise<00:02:54.459> when<00:02:55.459> that<00:02:55.760> weight<00:02:56.690> exceeds

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
and likewise when that weight exceeds

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.780 
and likewise when that weight exceeds
the<00:02:57.739> gravity<00:02:58.220> we'll<00:02:58.340> make<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.549> arrows

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
the gravity we'll make the arrows

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.069 
the gravity we'll make the arrows
smaller<00:02:59.150> here<00:02:59.950> you<00:03:00.950> have<00:03:01.160> a<00:03:01.190> descent<00:03:01.850> and<00:03:02.239> when

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
smaller here you have a descent and when

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.039 
smaller here you have a descent and when
all<00:03:03.200> forces<00:03:03.739> four<00:03:04.160> forces<00:03:04.430> are<00:03:04.730> equal<00:03:05.090> we<00:03:05.750> have

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
all forces four forces are equal we have

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.390 
all forces four forces are equal we have
level<00:03:07.010> flight<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:08.630> those<00:03:08.959> that's<00:03:09.290> really<00:03:09.920> your

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
level flight so those that's really your

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.370 
level flight so those that's really your
basic<00:03:11.290> principles<00:03:12.290> of<00:03:12.920> flight<00:03:13.609> and<00:03:14.150> if<00:03:15.109> you're

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
basic principles of flight and if you're

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.800
