Pacquiao and Mikey Garcia is very

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.060 
Pacquiao and Mikey Garcia is very
possible<00:00:39.160> in<00:00:39.430> 2015<00:00:40.330> it's<00:00:41.170> very<00:00:41.470> possible<00:00:41.740> that

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
possible in 2015 it's very possible that

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.250 
possible in 2015 it's very possible that
this<00:00:42.370> could<00:00:42.700> be<00:00:42.880> the<00:00:43.150> very<00:00:43.300> last<00:00:43.480> fight<00:00:44.080> of

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
this could be the very last fight of

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.380 
this could be the very last fight of
Manny<00:00:44.980> Pacquiao<00:00:45.490> and<00:00:45.550> his<00:00:45.760> entire<00:00:46.120> career

Manny Pacquiao and his entire career

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.360 
Manny Pacquiao and his entire career
because<00:00:46.870> I<00:00:46.990> think<00:00:47.050> 2015<00:00:47.800> will<00:00:47.980> be<00:00:48.070> his<00:00:48.190> last

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
because I think 2015 will be his last

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.680 
because I think 2015 will be his last
year<00:00:48.550> in<00:00:49.300> professional<00:00:49.630> boxing<00:00:50.140> and<00:00:51.690> Mikey

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
year in professional boxing and Mikey

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.890

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
Garcia being a top ranked fighter and

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.330 
Garcia being a top ranked fighter and
he's<00:00:55.900> moving<00:00:56.290> up<00:00:56.530> in<00:00:56.680> weight<00:00:56.710> pretty<00:00:57.100> soon

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
he's moving up in weight pretty soon

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.630 
he's moving up in weight pretty soon
because<00:00:57.960> judging<00:00:58.960> from<00:00:59.110> what<00:00:59.620> Alex<00:01:00.460> and

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
because judging from what Alex and

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.060 
because judging from what Alex and

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
reason said and Robert Garcia said of in

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.630 
reason said and Robert Garcia said of in
that<00:01:03.190> video

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.380 
that video
they<00:01:04.420> said<00:01:04.659> that<00:01:05.430> Mikey<00:01:06.430> Garcia<00:01:06.850> has<00:01:07.030> no<00:01:07.180> long

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
they said that Mikey Garcia has no long

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.990 
they said that Mikey Garcia has no long
like<00:01:08.020> he's<00:01:08.229> having<00:01:08.470> a<00:01:08.650> hard<00:01:08.830> time<00:01:08.890> making<00:01:09.250> 130

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
like he's having a hard time making 130

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.820 
like he's having a hard time making 130
pounds<00:01:10.479> so<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.080> looks<00:01:11.260> like<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.560> fight

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
pounds so it looks like the fight

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.700 
pounds so it looks like the fight
against<00:01:12.310> Juan<00:01:13.210> Carlos<00:01:13.690> Burgos<00:01:14.170> will<00:01:14.409> be<00:01:14.560> his

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
last fight at 130 pounds and he will

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.090 
last fight at 130 pounds and he will
move<00:01:17.530> up<00:01:17.799> in<00:01:18.040> weight<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:19.479> 135<00:01:20.440> pounds<00:01:20.860> pretty

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
move up in weight to 135 pounds pretty

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.240 
move up in weight to 135 pounds pretty

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.280 
just January so for his next fight which
will<00:01:27.400> probably<00:01:27.850> take<00:01:28.180> place<00:01:28.450> sometime<00:01:28.960> in

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
will probably take place sometime in

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.460 
will probably take place sometime in
March<00:01:29.530> or<00:01:29.830> April<00:01:30.010> and<00:01:30.460> it<00:01:31.450> will<00:01:31.630> most<00:01:32.350> likely

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
March or April and it will most likely

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.030 
March or April and it will most likely
be<00:01:32.740> against<00:01:33.280> URI<00:01:34.030> OCA's<00:01:34.420> Gamboa<00:01:34.780> at<00:01:35.110> 135

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
be against URI OCA's Gamboa at 135

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.840 
be against URI OCA's Gamboa at 135
pounds<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.990> he's<00:01:38.770> definitely<00:01:39.159> moving<00:01:39.640> up<00:01:39.729> in

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
pounds so he's definitely moving up in

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.760 
pounds so he's definitely moving up in
weight<00:01:39.880> I<00:01:40.000> think<00:01:40.330> I<00:01:40.510> think<00:01:40.990> he'll<00:01:41.110> move<00:01:41.350> up<00:01:41.560> in

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
weight I think I think he'll move up in

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.890 
weight I think I think he'll move up in
weight<00:01:41.799> definitely<00:01:42.610> after<00:01:43.150> the<00:01:43.270> Burgos<00:01:43.630> fight

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
weight definitely after the Burgos fight

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.640 
weight definitely after the Burgos fight
fight<00:01:44.680> fight<00:01:45.310> he<00:01:45.580> will<00:01:45.729> fight<00:01:45.970> at<00:01:46.150> 135<00:01:47.080> pounds

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.339 
think that's how it will go I think I
think<00:02:15.010> they<00:02:15.130> will<00:02:15.280> fight<00:02:15.520> one<00:02:15.760> day<00:02:16.020> if<00:02:17.020> they

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
think they will fight one day if they

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.460 
think they will fight one day if they
keep<00:02:17.620> winning<00:02:17.890> well<00:02:18.550> maybe<00:02:18.849> if<00:02:19.420> Mikey<00:02:20.080> Garcia

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
keep winning well maybe if Mikey Garcia

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.020 
keep winning well maybe if Mikey Garcia
keeps<00:02:20.770> winning<00:02:21.010> he<00:02:21.310> will<00:02:21.459> definitely<00:02:21.819> fight

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
keeps winning he will definitely fight

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.150 
keeps winning he will definitely fight
Pacquiao<00:02:22.270> but<00:02:22.900> if<00:02:22.989> Mike<00:02:23.230> if<00:02:23.470> Pacquiao<00:02:23.890> keeps

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
Pacquiao but if Mike if Pacquiao keeps

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.890 
Pacquiao but if Mike if Pacquiao keeps
is<00:02:24.340> like<00:02:24.550> if<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.700> lose<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.120> or<00:02:25.360> like<00:02:25.630> gets

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
is like if you lose this or like gets

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.479 
is like if you lose this or like gets
knocked<00:02:26.140> out<00:02:26.319> again<00:02:26.680> then<00:02:26.890> maybe<00:02:26.920> he<00:02:27.340> might

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
knocked out again then maybe he might

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.910 
knocked out again then maybe he might
consider<00:02:27.910> retiring<00:02:28.450> actually<00:02:29.020> this<00:02:29.140> time<00:02:29.349> but

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
consider retiring actually this time but

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.290 
consider retiring actually this time but
who<00:02:30.010> knows<00:02:30.220> man<00:02:30.489> I<00:02:30.520> think<00:02:30.790> there's<00:02:30.940> a<00:02:31.030> really

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
who knows man I think there's a really

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.350 
who knows man I think there's a really
good<00:02:31.510> chance<00:02:32.020> a<00:02:32.709> really<00:02:32.950> high<00:02:33.160> chance<00:02:33.580> that<00:02:33.910> we

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
good chance a really high chance that we

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.570 
good chance a really high chance that we
will<00:02:34.600> actually<00:02:34.840> see<00:02:35.290> this<00:02:35.440> fight<00:02:35.650> in<00:02:35.800> 2015<00:02:36.400> and
