00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
foam deer tail I'm going to measure that

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.540 
foam deer tail I'm going to measure that
so<00:00:30.200> it<00:00:30.320> comes<00:00:30.529> out<00:00:30.740> to<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:31.160> tips<00:00:31.820> of<00:00:32.060> the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
so it comes out to the tips of the

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.970 
so it comes out to the tips of the
saddles<00:00:34.550> we<00:00:34.700> use<00:00:34.910> them<00:00:35.150> the<00:00:35.240> tail<00:00:35.980> another

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
saddles we use them the tail another

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.440 
saddles we use them the tail another
thing<00:00:37.220> I<00:00:37.340> should<00:00:37.400> tell<00:00:37.670> you<00:00:37.700> is<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:38.060> the

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
thing I should tell you is and the

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.270 
thing I should tell you is and the
saddles<00:00:38.930> I<00:00:39.050> like<00:00:39.260> to<00:00:39.410> use<00:00:39.560> for<00:00:39.800> these<00:00:39.950> tails

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
saddles I like to use for these tails

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.720 
saddles I like to use for these tails
are<00:00:41.030> from<00:00:41.420> whiting<00:00:44.200> streamer<00:00:45.200> necks<00:00:45.730> they're

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
are from whiting streamer necks they're

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.830 
are from whiting streamer necks they're
stiff<00:00:47.239> in<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.449> stem<00:00:48.129> which<00:00:49.129> helps<00:00:49.489> the<00:00:50.270> action

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
stiff in the stem which helps the action

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.389 
stiff in the stem which helps the action
of<00:00:50.960> this<00:00:51.140> fly<00:00:51.440> what<00:00:51.770> we're<00:00:51.890> really<00:00:52.070> trying<00:00:52.309> to

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
of this fly what we're really trying to

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.540 
of this fly what we're really trying to
imitate<00:00:52.640> with<00:00:52.969> this<00:00:53.120> fly<00:00:53.359> is<00:00:53.420> a<00:00:53.600> dead<00:00:54.050> or<00:00:54.829> dying

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
imitate with this fly is a dead or dying

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.709 
imitate with this fly is a dead or dying

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.259 
baitfish
all<00:00:57.469> right<00:00:57.649> the<00:00:57.980> rigidity<00:00:58.370> of<00:00:58.730> this<00:00:58.969> is

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
all right the rigidity of this is

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.959 
all right the rigidity of this is
actually<00:00:59.809> good<00:01:00.079> for<00:01:00.109> the<00:01:00.410> fly<00:01:00.679> a<00:01:01.010> lot<00:01:01.850> of

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
actually good for the fly a lot of

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.520 
actually good for the fly a lot of
people<00:01:02.239> think<00:01:02.480> well<00:01:02.719> you<00:01:02.929> could<00:01:03.109> add<00:01:03.230> a<00:01:03.260> nice

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
people think well you could add a nice

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.110 
people think well you could add a nice
soft<00:01:03.890> feather<00:01:04.220> it's<00:01:04.430> going<00:01:04.580> to<00:01:04.640> have<00:01:04.820> a<00:01:04.850> lot

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
soft feather it's going to have a lot

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.630 
soft feather it's going to have a lot
more<00:01:05.150> action<00:01:05.990> well<00:01:06.500> that's<00:01:06.680> true<00:01:06.920> it<00:01:07.130> will<00:01:07.370> and

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
more action well that's true it will and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.700 
more action well that's true it will and
you<00:01:08.330> will<00:01:08.630> catch<00:01:08.840> fish<00:01:09.200> too

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
you will catch fish too

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.690 
you will catch fish too
but<00:01:10.300> the<00:01:11.300> stiffer<00:01:11.780> stem<00:01:12.110> just<00:01:13.010> adds<00:01:13.250> a<00:01:13.460> better

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
but the stiffer stem just adds a better

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.940 
but the stiffer stem just adds a better
profile<00:01:14.330> for<00:01:14.660> the<00:01:14.750> bait<00:01:14.960> fish<00:01:15.200> I<00:01:15.380> found<00:01:15.680> over

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
profile for the bait fish I found over

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.980 
profile for the bait fish I found over
the<00:01:16.040> years<00:01:16.070> doing<00:01:16.580> this<00:01:16.760> so<00:01:17.630> we<00:01:17.720> got<00:01:17.840> the

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
the years doing this so we got the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.480 
the years doing this so we got the
seafoam<00:01:18.380> we're<00:01:18.619> going<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:18.829> match<00:01:19.009> it<00:01:19.220> to<00:01:19.250> the

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
seafoam we're going to match it to the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.069 
seafoam we're going to match it to the
tips<00:01:19.759> of<00:01:19.909> the<00:01:20.030> saddle<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.920> hold<00:01:22.189> that<00:01:22.369> on<00:01:22.610> top

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.310 

tie<00:01:27.079> that<00:01:27.320> in<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:29.060> look<00:01:29.390> at<00:01:29.540> that<00:01:29.720> take<00:01:30.110> my

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
tie that in and look at that take my

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.020 
tie that in and look at that take my
finger<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:30.829> just<00:01:31.100> going<00:01:31.340> to<00:01:31.430> press<00:01:31.759> that<00:01:31.790> down

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
finger and just going to press that down

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.149 
finger and just going to press that down
a<00:01:32.329> little<00:01:32.720> to<00:01:32.840> spread<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:33.350> out<00:01:33.470> see<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.070> way

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
a little to spread it out see the way

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.810 
a little to spread it out see the way
that's<00:01:34.399> right<00:01:34.700> out<00:01:34.909> and<00:01:36.369> we're<00:01:37.369> going<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:37.579> cut

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
that's right out and we're going to cut

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.520 
that's right out and we're going to cut
all<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:39.040> fibers<00:01:40.040> off<00:01:41.020> this<00:01:42.020> will<00:01:42.200> be<00:01:42.290> a<00:01:42.320> lot

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
all the fibers off this will be a lot

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.230 
all the fibers off this will be a lot
easier<00:01:42.590> if<00:01:43.009> you<00:01:43.189> just<00:01:44.740> cut<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:46.700> deer<00:01:46.939> tail

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
easier if you just cut the deer tail

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.120 
easier if you just cut the deer tail
first<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:47.780> then<00:01:47.960> tied<00:01:48.229> it<00:01:48.409> on<00:01:48.500> but<00:01:48.770> I<00:01:48.799> really

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
first and then tied it on but I really

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.100 
first and then tied it on but I really
just<00:01:49.280> don't<00:01:49.490> like<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:49.969> way<00:01:50.090> that<00:01:50.329> comes<00:01:50.869> out

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
just don't like the way that comes out

00:01:51.110 --> 00:02:04.850 
just don't like the way that comes out
when<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:51.530> have<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.770> finished<00:01:52.130> fly

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.839 

great<00:02:05.460> tool<00:02:05.759> for<00:02:05.790> doing<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:07.849> burnished

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
great tool for doing this is a burnished

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.940 
great tool for doing this is a burnished
tool<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:09.720> get<00:02:09.929> right<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.289> just<00:02:10.530> melt

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
tool and just get right in just melt

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:21.970 
tool and just get right in just melt
those<00:02:11.130> hairs<00:02:11.430> right<00:02:11.700> off<00:02:15.440> that's<00:02:16.440> good

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.880 

no<00:02:22.580> next<00:02:23.920> here<00:02:24.920> we're<00:02:25.129> going<00:02:25.250> to<00:02:25.310> add<00:02:25.550> is

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
no next here we're going to add is

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.729 
no next here we're going to add is
Pollock<00:02:27.890> bronze<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:29.720> can<00:02:29.870> do<00:02:30.019> these<00:02:30.200> in<00:02:30.230> olive

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
Pollock bronze you can do these in olive

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.610 
Pollock bronze you can do these in olive
also<00:02:31.190> olive<00:02:31.730> works<00:02:31.940> pretty<00:02:32.150> good<00:02:32.299> I<00:02:32.720> really

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
also olive works pretty good I really

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.170 
also olive works pretty good I really
like<00:02:33.890> this<00:02:34.129> Pollock<00:02:34.549> bronze<00:02:34.849> color<00:02:37.000> that's<00:02:38.000> a

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
like this Pollock bronze color that's a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.240 
like this Pollock bronze color that's a
little<00:02:38.480> too<00:02:38.750> much<00:02:39.019> we're<00:02:39.530> gonna<00:02:39.620> thin<00:02:40.069> this

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
little too much we're gonna thin this

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.410 
little too much we're gonna thin this
out<00:02:41.290> by<00:02:42.290> grabbing<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:42.920> about<00:02:43.250> here<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:44.239> we'll

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
out by grabbing it about here and we'll

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.940 
out by grabbing it about here and we'll
just<00:02:44.569> take<00:02:44.780> some<00:02:45.080> of<00:02:45.200> those<00:02:45.319> shorter<00:02:45.739> hairs

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
just take some of those shorter hairs

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.039 
just take some of those shorter hairs
out<00:02:46.220> I<00:02:46.489> do<00:02:46.910> not<00:02:47.209> stack<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:48.079> hair<00:02:48.470> for<00:02:49.040> this<00:02:49.190> fly

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
out I do not stack the hair for this fly

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.630 
out I do not stack the hair for this fly
it<00:02:51.049> just<00:02:51.110> kind<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.530> look<00:02:51.860> like<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:52.069> paintbrush

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
it just kind of look like a paintbrush
