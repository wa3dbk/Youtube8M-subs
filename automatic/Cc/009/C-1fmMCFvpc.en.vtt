00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.500
 three brothers acrobat I think you can 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.750
 say about three juicers from took 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.059
 outwardly they are almost the same 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.100
 and what is the difference between them and which one 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.349
 juicer series cartoon wick made 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.810
 more delicious I will reveal today during 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.000
 tested each of them ability 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.480
 make a glass of juice in almost 15 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.390
 seconds 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.949
 and in a minute will make a whole liter 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.460
 compare fresh juice with a store 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.120
 in packages 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.670
 but you understand it is not logical to say 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.539
 complete form and volume here everything 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.820
 one to one 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:41.699
 the volume of removable tank for cake 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.100
 exactly 2 liters and a tank for juice 1 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.230
 liter 250 grams he is here as 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.629
 graduated flasks with handle and cap 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.460
 each juicer works in two 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.350
 speeds that switch this 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.640
 switch 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.429
 first speed is meant for more 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.010
 soft vegetables and fruits such as peach 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:01.469
 grapes apricot and the second speed for 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.290
 more solid carrot apples and so on 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.870
 Included is a very useful thing this 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.720
 brush brush believe this thing you oh 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.120
 as needed, i will note the filter with micro 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.480
 stainless steel mesh it is he and 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.740
 turns vegetables and fruits into juice 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.800
 rubber feet do not scratch the surface 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.740
 table and do not give fidget during 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.700
 work at the bottom provides a compartment for 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.980
 cord winding 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.080
 the cord will have a relatively short 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.020
 put the device closer to the outlet 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.670
 at least while squeezing the juice is not 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.530
 correctly assemble the juicer is not 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.990
 get these snaps fixed 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.750
 among themselves all the main parts of technology 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.200
 if something went wrong then the latch didn't 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.390
 will close and the unit will not turn on 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.990
 The case of the braun j300 is completely black. 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.060
 plastic 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.880
 frankly glossy surface 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.030
 looks good but prints remain 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.840
 it's very fast power cartoon Vectra 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.030
 exactly 800 watts that's why the j300 is the most 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.400
 little brother in lineup 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.200
 in the braun j500 case base also from 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.870
 plastic but here already used 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.869
 steel elements and capacities here are 900 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.570
 watt spout system these drop in help 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.120
 so as not to splash the braun table 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.570
 j700 the most powerful and solid of the family 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.860
 power as much as 1000 watts 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.560
 stainless steel 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.500
 looks spectacular and if to speak 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.960
 it seems very strong to itself 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.350
 without a spout, the anti-drop here is also not 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.300
 cost today I will try in each of 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.300
 cartoon juicer series century make 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.230
 apple and peach juice while 1 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.300
 and 2 speeds 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.640
 I have a responsible task 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.900
 reveal which juicer from the series 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.390
 makes juice tastier 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.090
 The groove for feeding products here is big 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.500
 and apples do not need to cut into pieces 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.050
 entirely they pass with a whistle a 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.020
 I cut the peaches in half to remove 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.540
 pits in graduated juice cup 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.850
 there is a foam separator very handy thing 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.870
 when pouring juice into a glass of foam 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.740
 stays in the bowl making juice cleaner 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.200
 clean after use 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.300
 juicer is very simple the main thing is that 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.470
 all removable parts can be washed even in 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.320
 dishwasher 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.420
 and the miracle brush to help the Well 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.310
 squeeze the juice from the peaches on the second 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.350
 speed there was no need and 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.050
 at first fruit and instantly turned 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.320
 in juice but apples are definitely on the second 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.420
 speed squeeze faster and more convenient 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:30.150
 speaking of power then braun j700 is clearly 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.209
 showed itself better than all the weighty difference 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.610
 except for external differences between j300 and j500 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.920
 I have not identified in practice what juice 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.489
 It turned out more delicious but the main thing is that it 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.410
 was in a favorite cup of what then a store 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.410
 I certainly don't want high now
