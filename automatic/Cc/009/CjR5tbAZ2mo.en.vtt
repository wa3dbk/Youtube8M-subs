00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.180
 Good night guys per night 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.840
 the same year, we came here today the invitation to process luiz 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.420
 carlos to do a math here with the institute professor do 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.650
 some issues in the app addressing there were those themes that are most common in 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.710
 the vestibular test area 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.269
 approved in the ufrn call has been 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.739
 has evolved quite a lot in recent years. 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.060
 I have the pride for hebe it in inclusive 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.000
 recently at the beginning of this year I even published a book containing the 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.680
 questions and the rulings of the 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.740
 and there the test has intensified landing in recent times né 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.060
 post make 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.570
 so from my point of view less and less technical nor approve today 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.050
 she prioritized 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.140
 more reasoning than I the West of Beijing in each matter 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.860
 discontented kleber we'll try 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.270
 today we are not going to try to address here some of the same issues 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.290
 time 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.550
 the chassis are frequent in the race - in these last editions of the 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.720
 Proof as the gari have 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.520
 basic math is not a little bit of flat geometry part of 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.890
 parental discrepancy 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.570
 so this 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.940
 Good night from Sao Joao. 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.740
 is initially would like to congratulate the 'teacher' 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.370
 the councilman and the people 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.560
 in the state 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.480
 because this great project 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.150
 without great initiative 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.890
 so we want here me and professor carlos gomes some people 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.110
 just as he put color vehicle 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.090
 is that the rains are forced to flee 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.520
 is that expected 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.870
 for the ufsc test 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.870
 Agra questioned that there is an unfortunate algarve 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.590
 before we start asking this question 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.640
 Let's talk let's give a 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.790
 time setting 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.410
 knows to understand that playing intimate if you do not play the tour exposes 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.549
 whose base is positive and different said 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:11.499
 I started on the basis of different conseg 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:14.499
 all the media is synonymous with chosen ones 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:19.979
 important things and far from the gari is the definition 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:24.029
 and who knows the properties of the three properties 

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:27.660
 so let's see the question of days 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.049
 or will see real positive numbers 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.239
 I think 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.449
 abílio deferente mil 

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:38.379
 no doubt then on the threshold at the base abdib hashish 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.890
 we can affirm that the baby in the basin of fields the pope did and very interesting 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.689
 or we take your solution 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:47.710
 we have to go 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.369
 fluvia b 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:53.319
 in the basin within the area justified tax-based Claudia 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.989
 we are wanting 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.859
 laurel bay base abdib 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:02:59.969
 a good way of accidents 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:05.049
 If you call there I'll drive in the basin anyway, we're not the one. 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.019
 first equality of 1 to 1 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.229
 bibi logo on base abi embolados 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.389
 so we're wanting there liedson 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.389
 will do in the vision of these two equalities there 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:22.899
 suddenly jumped air into the base of his mazloum bibi on base b 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:26.409
 It's just like that headline. 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:27.880
 that we can describe 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.239
 thus 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:36.069
 If you know abc mazloum name in his bowl I can put it and this 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:38.309
 the new envoy demands of him 

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:41.149
 on abdib base 

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:43.719
 then that is equal to the system x 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:50.659
 foto and pequim soon send in base hb mark burg bibi in his basin 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.999
 It's just like the maxi lopez 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:56.619
 the dn writes fitch a risk on staff ownership 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:57.979
 they play 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:01.589
 we can predict this as obvious b in the basin of 

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:06.499
 on the highway in the peniche basin 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:08.029
 it's just like me 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:11.029
 is not that we have to play intimate from the base 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:15.619
 then we lose who composes equal to x too much and 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.799
 You'll want the tax amount 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.430
 What should we do? 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.999
 in each of these equalities there 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:26.460
 if you can raise my unconsciousness 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.460
 So is staying with my kids. 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:35.139
 r xix mas shittu mello x 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.150
 what are you going to give 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.240
 eriksson 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.240
 You go from there, I am a palm tree people. 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:43.889
 you find follow in letter b 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.889
 now make the carlos gomes 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:53.960
 as a precaution the issue of dividing the gold mining 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.949
 the process will be analyzed in blue with the evidence that keeps logarithmic alive 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.949
 It has always been a subject 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:09.120
 besides this disease 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.270
 this part of the properties is good also the months student said 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.029
 and in this final stretch 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:18.529
 he takes a look not to review those issues 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.960
 that involve some contextualization of the questions that involve idea 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.790
 number 10 in the world due to the 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.889
 issues involving the calculation of compound interest 

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:34.689
 then they are questions that involve the concept of the part line 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:37.439
 last year even though an issue 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:40.439
 burned via property matches right 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.159
 basic properties of logarithm 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:47.589
 and also that another more contextualized issue neki used was 

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:49.939
 physical sound level setting
