00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
is play what's called a harmonic but a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
called the fundamental ah but if we

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.620 
called the fundamental ah but if we
touch<00:01:36.039> the<00:01:36.070> string<00:01:36.550> in<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.700> middle<00:01:37.060> will

so we put that whole sequence together

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:28.750 
so we put that whole sequence together
slowly<00:04:15.030> here's<00:04:15.420> what<00:04:15.540> we<00:04:15.600> have<00:04:15.780> e-minor<00:04:16.530> nine

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.640 

so<00:04:29.330> the<00:04:29.450> difference<00:04:29.630> between<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:30.170> first<00:04:30.410> EU

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
so the difference between the first EU

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.470 
so the difference between the first EU
minor<00:04:30.860> night<00:04:31.100> and<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.340> last<00:04:31.550> one<00:04:31.820> is<00:04:31.970> on<00:04:32.390> the

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
minor night and the last one is on the

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.440 
minor night and the last one is on the
first<00:04:32.690> one<00:04:32.870> I'm<00:04:32.990> hitting<00:04:33.230> the<00:04:33.290> low<00:04:33.440> E<00:04:33.470> string

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
first one I'm hitting the low E string

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.430 
first one I'm hitting the low E string
now<00:04:35.450> the<00:04:35.510> last<00:04:35.690> that<00:04:35.930> I'm<00:04:36.050> hitting<00:04:36.290> the<00:04:36.410> a

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
now the last that I'm hitting the a

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.440 
now the last that I'm hitting the a
string<00:04:36.920> you<00:04:37.730> know<00:04:37.850> holding<00:04:38.090> that<00:04:38.210> you<00:04:38.330> might

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
string you know holding that you might

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.839 
string you know holding that you might
have<00:04:38.480> might<00:04:38.690> work

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
have might work

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:51.340 
have might work
so<00:04:40.569> listen<00:04:41.199> carefully

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:05:07.810 

you

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820
