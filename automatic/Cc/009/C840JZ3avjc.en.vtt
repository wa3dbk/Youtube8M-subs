00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.350
 hello I am mar berrÃ­o marvel.com today I am going to 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:09.650
 make a both singh of something that very 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.709
 I rarely do this is not something 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:16.020
 technology is nothing of computers is 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:20.100
 a hamilton vix juice extractor 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.240
 big bout pro juice extractor and good 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:29.099
 has a package that is the packaging 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:32.450
 this frustration was from amazon that is a 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.290
 easy to open packaging so let's 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.550
 proceed to open it 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.550
 it's a juice extractor 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.840
 700 watts forgiveness 800 watts I think that 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.600
 they have 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:55.769
 and it's called big boats because it has 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.100
 the big mouth to be able to throw 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:03.120
 whole fruits apples 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:07.220
 carrots and is have the instructions 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.220
 English French and Spanish 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.179
 instructions parts features 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.990
 the brush this is to clean the part 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.990
 of the 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.320
 where are the blades 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.780
 to do the cleaning of that 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.770
 is a conventional knife easy to 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.770
 replace 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.570
 and a brush 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.090
 to see that it is also good 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.090
 and today in the extract 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.590
 yes 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.500
 is the extractor the containers this 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.500
 small to pick up the juice 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:16.450
 that collects the liquid and this collects the 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:19.750
 pulp or fiber 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.260
 on the other side of the extractor 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.920
 they are from like plastic I do not know what it's called 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.920
 this plastic 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.910
 It's plastic 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:35.160
 now the 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.160
 in theory it 's plastic that does not have 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.050
 I can not make values 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.250
 to see here is he 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.430
 the device as such 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.030
 and notice here that says that 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.910
 I fit the complete food the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.540
 traffic and an apple 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.220
 and here other things that get 24% 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.660
 more smoke 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.800
 that the competitor 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.800
 even security 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.210
 he's cool look 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.210
 the 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:25.400
 the on and off 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:25.400
 it's quite industrial and on this side 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.150
 will pick up the blame 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.150
 so 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.360
 and 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.530
 it's metallic I think it's the difference 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.790
 with the one who does not call himself I think this is 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.439
 metallic and on the other sheets 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.439
 the gate is also different 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.330
 of london as plastic 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.930
 to open it 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.659
 here 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.360
 the lid 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.650
 information the warning 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.200
 yes 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.540
 I'm later like this 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.220
 these are the blades that 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.710
 they effectively cut the fruit and 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.810
 vegetable 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.810
 and this is also removed to wash 

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:43.719
 pretty simple and to our video them 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.050
 I'll show you how it works in so much juice 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:46.050
 comes out 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.340
 just press 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.190
 and that's the hamilton beach 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.980
 big mac pro 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:09.750
 a juice extractor I hope you 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.750
 have liked the video we see the next
