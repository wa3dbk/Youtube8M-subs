00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.290
 and this is the door of the corrals of that square before the constitution 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.540
 it's ten o'clock in the morning it has to be about to start 

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:12.759

 expectant occupying which wants the bars 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:19.900
 good to witness the confinement 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.920
 and this just broke to see more closely the runners you know 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.039
 daniel d lan 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.189
 has traveled towards the trees 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.890
 I running to farrar the two times that has played here 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.419
 belt mentioned 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.160
 chronicles of living this festival 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.830
 there was an experience 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.260
 different, more than anything else, because it is little more than the betrayal of 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.680
 goal 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.550
 they followed 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.470
 the luck of dinars for last year 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.950
 tower a confinement 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.450
 i also in moratalla murcia of family of moratalla alto and citi corrido 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.870
 more often 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.870
 also by involving a point a little more on the track 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.920
 e point 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.910
 the morning cabanes will do on thursday 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.720
 it was the sound signal 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.050
 so that the confinement starts 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.050
 the halters lay salem in front 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.760
 with dovizioso one step still very fast 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.880
 comrade very tight 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.880
 the certain thing is that those four parties followed by the facts 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.800
 it seems 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.730
 is for the moment they are 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.060
 because it does not cause the whole field 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.180
 mayoral new album your quiet 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.020
 it seems to me that he has begun clothed master 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.500
 the head of the herd opening 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.880
 the halters are already ahead a ball 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.250
 and eye because 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.320
 that animal 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.750
 has reacted very quickly to the call of a waiter 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.750
 is imprinting the running a frantic pace 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.580
 two steers mancini takes the lead the march halter stop 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.310
 Like every day 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.310
 begins to stand in Indian line to the confinement 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.510
 with that steer that very clearly has taken the lead to the rest of his 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.290
 brothers 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.350
 three in a row 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.599
 stopped a little 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.299
 senovilla if it betrayed 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.559
 one of his brothers 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.559
 too expectant 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:21.409
 sd 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.639
 Novillo who has taken the lead iquique hosts 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:27.129
 the intersection of the street robador 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.789
 this cloud 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:32.659
 going quickly to the cites that 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.659
 the shepherds do well the pastors who have just 

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.739
 cover the back of the enclosure that speed accommodated in steers 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.799
 We are on the street Ezequiel Ordonez 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.769
 that is where 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.769
 number of runners 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.259
 the confinement 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:01.049
 now they have focused a little more notorious entrance of the square even 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.329
 It seems 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.389
 that had been stopped 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:09.059
 three young schoolboys who are in the cavern's backyard 4 5 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:10.669
 still to be entered 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:13.669
 the last steer 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:18.569
 the closure that has been completed 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.949
 with apparent normality 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:24.769
 little more than two minutes to get to the square but remember to say no 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.499
 ends until the three steers take the door 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:30.499
 of the pens and they are inside the yards 

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:38.639
 polished quickly that steer to the call of someone who has quoted him 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.379
 I do not know if improperly of the center and calefón cd 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:47.869
 they induce us in the square always better 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.439
 here the question 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:54.879
 this percent the steers 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.839
 they have caught high speed 

00:03:56.839 --> 00:04:00.129
 once entered the square and have left behind the stop halters 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.979
 i the income of the group of 20 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:04.149
 that day 

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:07.799
 percent and the rubbing and burning of die wires there we do not talk so that 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.459
 will calm down and even more 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.070
 they are no longer alone in the place 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.820
 reiterates that not at dawn the animals animal brave orient 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.649
 everything smelled special blocking conditions the question 

00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:23.020
 certainly he knows about him 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.199
 the square in the afternoon two totally with the management especially through the door to 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.340
 it will be addressed by laporta that laplace did not enter through the door 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.509
 that have come out with this case in the big door and at the door of gangs 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.569
 and then you look at selling the vines to the problem of 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:38.529
 in front of the horse at the door 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:41.559
 that all the bulls go to Greece because they remember that in the morning 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:43.650
 come through that door right behind 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.949
 and there they were 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.949
 the halters say the one that touched the front door 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.920
 efe 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.360
 by karin defeat the burial use of the abacus temps this figure is a bit 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.069
 asleep 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.509
 because two out of three minutes 37 seconds what has augured 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:00.509
 the confinement until the steers 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:03.580
 anne taken the door of the cdc corrales 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.689
 that sanction of laws 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:07.050
 daniele and irán 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.120
 that closing price 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.380
 well some springs a clean running the most important thing was nothing happened 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.029
 not that no 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:16.330
 I do not cook any person are the most important 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.839
 and well, well 

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:20.589
 everything with the family of the two what was said by one of the steers 

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:24.009
 speed have left the meek behind and that date has been a bit lackluster 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:25.110
 why 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.449
 I do not think that everyone arrives to pace the tomatina that swam the 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:32.199
 herd percent I got harder is to run knoll dílar
