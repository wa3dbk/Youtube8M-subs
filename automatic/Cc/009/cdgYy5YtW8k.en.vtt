go over this little procedure I did to
locate<00:01:00.610> my<00:01:00.730> cab<00:01:00.970> mounts<00:01:01.360> basically<00:01:01.780> what<00:01:01.960> I

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:01.990 
locate my cab mounts basically what I

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.520 
locate my cab mounts basically what I
did<00:01:02.230> was<00:01:02.440> I<00:01:03.120> located<00:01:04.120> the<00:01:04.630> front<00:01:04.900> cab<00:01:05.110> mounts

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
did was I located the front cab mounts

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.340 
did was I located the front cab mounts
off<00:01:05.710> of<00:01:05.950> these<00:01:06.160> up<00:01:06.400> there's<00:01:07.210> an<00:01:07.360> oval<00:01:07.690> hole

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
off of these up there's an oval hole

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.890 
off of these up there's an oval hole
right<00:01:08.530> here<00:01:08.590> I<00:01:08.980> measure<00:01:09.880> two<00:01:10.210> inches<00:01:10.570> forward

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
right here I measure two inches forward

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.540 
right here I measure two inches forward
of<00:01:11.110> that<00:01:11.140> and<00:01:11.530> that's<00:01:11.770> where<00:01:11.950> I<00:01:11.980> located<00:01:12.430> the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
of that and that's where I located the

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.800 
of that and that's where I located the
back<00:01:12.760> edge<00:01:13.120> of<00:01:13.450> my<00:01:14.160> forward<00:01:15.160> cab<00:01:15.490> mounts<00:01:15.940> did

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
back edge of my forward cab mounts did

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:17.880 
back edge of my forward cab mounts did
that<00:01:16.960> on<00:01:17.080> both<00:01:17.260> sides

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
that on both sides

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.620 
that on both sides
I<00:01:17.920> believe<00:01:18.400> I<00:01:18.550> attacked<00:01:18.850> mine<00:01:19.120> in<00:01:19.270> place<00:01:19.450> but

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
I believe I attacked mine in place but

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.190 
I believe I attacked mine in place but
you<00:01:19.690> could<00:01:19.930> clamp<00:01:20.200> them<00:01:20.410> probably<00:01:22.200> anyway

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
you could clamp them probably anyway

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.040 
you could clamp them probably anyway
then<00:01:23.560> I<00:01:24.060> attached<00:01:25.060> all<00:01:25.300> my<00:01:25.450> front<00:01:25.780> sheetmetal

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
then I attached all my front sheetmetal

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.410 
then I attached all my front sheetmetal
made<00:01:26.800> sure<00:01:26.979> that<00:01:27.160> my<00:01:27.340> wheels<00:01:27.760> were<00:01:28.030> centered

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
made sure that my wheels were centered

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:36.780 
made sure that my wheels were centered
in<00:01:28.510> my<00:01:28.540> wheel<00:01:28.810> opening

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:49.910

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
and this is just what worked for me

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.959 
and this is just what worked for me
don't<00:01:53.049> go<00:01:53.200> totally<00:01:53.500> off<00:01:53.710> my<00:01:54.159> measurements

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
don't go totally off my measurements

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:57.060 
don't go totally off my measurements

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
wheel well so on all I have is 14 inch

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.180 
wheel well so on all I have is 14 inch
wheels<00:02:13.989> I'll<00:02:14.230> be<00:02:14.349> running<00:02:14.620> something<00:02:14.860> bigger

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
wheels I'll be running something bigger

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.039

and<00:02:15.489> so<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:16.000> might<00:02:16.209> want<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.450> mock<00:02:16.629> yours<00:02:16.900> up

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
and so you might want to mock yours up

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.300 
and so you might want to mock yours up
with<00:02:17.200> something<00:02:17.500> bigger<00:02:17.709> just<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.129> make<00:02:18.280> sure

with something bigger just to make sure
it's<00:02:18.610> really<00:02:19.000> centered<00:02:20.069> anyway<00:02:21.360> that's<00:02:22.360> what

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
it's really centered anyway that's what

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.750 
it's really centered anyway that's what
I<00:02:22.630> did<00:02:22.840> then<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:23.290> took<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.769> measurements<00:02:24.459> from

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
I did then I took the measurements from

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.720 
I did then I took the measurements from
the<00:02:24.880> floorboard<00:02:25.599> of<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.870> cab<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:27.310> distance

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
the floorboard of the cab the distance

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.479 
the floorboard of the cab the distance
between<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:29.230> mount<00:02:29.590> hole<00:02:29.829> in<00:02:30.010> this<00:02:30.190> mount

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
between this mount hole in this mount

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.490 
between this mount hole in this mount
hole<00:02:30.700> from<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.120> cab<00:02:31.329> itself<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.019> transferred

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
hole from the cab itself and transferred

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.880 
hole from the cab itself and transferred
it<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.739> these<00:02:32.920> two<00:02:32.950> mounts<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:34.860> made<00:02:35.860> sure

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
on my rear mounts rear cab mounts all I

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.360 
on my rear mounts rear cab mounts all I
did<00:03:10.840> was<00:03:10.990> locate<00:03:11.380> those<00:03:11.620> underneath<00:03:12.100> the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
did was locate those underneath the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.250 
did was locate those underneath the
channel<00:03:12.760> that<00:03:12.910> runs

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
channel that runs

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.540 
channel that runs
crossways<00:03:14.260> underneath<00:03:14.740> the<00:03:14.860> back<00:03:15.040> of<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.340> cab

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
crossways underneath the back of the cab

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.420 
crossways underneath the back of the cab
where<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.660> old<00:03:16.900> cab<00:03:17.290> mounts<00:03:17.709> were<00:03:18.040> attached

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
where the old cab mounts were attached

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.150 
where the old cab mounts were attached
and<00:03:18.990> I<00:03:19.990> will<00:03:20.170> eventually<00:03:20.410> have<00:03:20.709> to<00:03:20.740> drill<00:03:21.040> my

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
and I will eventually have to drill my

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.740 
and I will eventually have to drill my
own<00:03:21.190> holes<00:03:21.520> in<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.760> floorboard<00:03:22.270> but

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
own holes in the floorboard but

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.810 
own holes in the floorboard but
basically<00:03:23.380> I<00:03:23.470> just<00:03:23.680> located<00:03:24.130> them<00:03:24.340> centered

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
basically I just located them centered

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.000 
basically I just located them centered
on<00:03:24.970> that<00:03:25.000> channel<00:03:25.690> on<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.300> bed<00:03:28.480> mounts

on that channel on the the bed mounts

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.250 
on that channel on the the bed mounts
what<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.040> did<00:03:30.280> was<00:03:30.550> I<00:03:30.940> set<00:03:31.510> jack<00:03:31.870> stands

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
what I did was I set jack stands

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.740 
what I did was I set jack stands
underneath<00:03:32.620> the<00:03:32.890> back<00:03:33.160> end<00:03:33.550> of<00:03:34.060> the<00:03:34.209> cab<00:03:34.450> or

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.619 
they're going to be attached eventually
and<00:03:59.370> made<00:04:00.370> sure<00:04:00.579> that<00:04:00.760> my<00:04:00.819> running<00:04:01.239> boards<00:04:01.510> are

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
and made sure that my running boards are

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.309 
and made sure that my running boards are
running<00:04:01.870> parallel<00:04:02.349> with<00:04:02.379> my<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:04.810> bottom<00:04:05.170> of

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
to make sure that my angles were all

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.270 
to make sure that my angles were all
running<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.629> same<00:04:13.720> and<00:04:14.340> then<00:04:15.340> I<00:04:16.949> also<00:04:17.949> the

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
and that was kind of how I set all that

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.440 
and that was kind of how I set all that
up<00:04:40.050> now<00:04:40.410> I<00:04:40.440> realize<00:04:40.890> I'm<00:04:41.130> it's<00:04:42.060> not<00:04:42.120> going<00:04:42.390> to

be it's not perfect yet there will be

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.220 
be it's not perfect yet there will be
some<00:04:44.790> tweaking<00:04:45.060> and<00:04:45.360> shimming<00:04:45.750> probably

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
some tweaking and shimming probably

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.930 
some tweaking and shimming probably
involved<00:04:46.680> when<00:04:46.800> I<00:04:46.830> do<00:04:46.950> go<00:04:47.340> to<00:04:47.370> permanently

think you're going to have to cut a

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.220 
think you're going to have to cut a
