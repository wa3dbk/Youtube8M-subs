Christianity got going in the first

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:16.929 
Christianity got going in the first
place<00:00:15.260> because<00:00:15.920> the<00:00:16.189> early<00:00:16.460> Christians

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
place because the early Christians

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.269 
place because the early Christians
believed<00:00:17.329> that<00:00:17.810> he<00:00:17.960> had<00:00:17.990> been<00:00:18.439> raised<00:00:18.769> bodily

believed that he had been raised bodily

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.939 
believed that he had been raised bodily
leaving<00:00:20.150> an<00:00:20.239> empty<00:00:20.630> tomb<00:00:20.929> behind<00:00:21.529> him<00:00:21.769> and

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
leaving an empty tomb behind him and

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.089 
leaving an empty tomb behind him and
thereby<00:00:22.550> launching<00:00:23.239> God's<00:00:24.140> whole<00:00:24.499> new<00:00:24.829> world

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.040 
had really occurred something they
certainly<00:02:25.720> had<00:02:26.050> not<00:02:26.290> been<00:02:26.620> expecting

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
certainly had not been expecting

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.449 
certainly had not been expecting
Christianity<00:02:29.050> didn't<00:02:29.350> begin<00:02:29.500> as<00:02:29.830> a<00:02:29.890> new

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
Christianity didn't begin as a new

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.940 
Christianity didn't begin as a new
religious<00:02:30.970> experience<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:32.260> began<00:02:32.709> with<00:02:32.890> the

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
religious experience it began with the

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.320 
religious experience it began with the
claim<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.370> something<00:02:33.880> had<00:02:34.150> happened

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
claim that something had happened

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.420 
claim that something had happened
something<00:02:34.810> which<00:02:35.470> had<00:02:35.590> changed<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:36.190> world

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
something which had changed the world

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.840 
something which had changed the world
something<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.330> had<00:02:37.540> happened<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:38.290> Jesus<00:02:38.850> and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
something that had happened to Jesus and

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.970 
something that had happened to Jesus and
when<00:02:40.060> we<00:02:40.180> trace<00:02:40.480> that<00:02:40.750> claim<00:02:41.110> we<00:02:41.380> find<00:02:41.709> that<00:02:41.830> it

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
when we trace that claim we find that it

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.560 
when we trace that claim we find that it
goes<00:02:42.160> back<00:02:42.459> to<00:02:42.670> two<00:02:42.940> things<00:02:43.270> in<00:02:43.450> particular

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
goes back to two things in particular

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.170 
goes back to two things in particular
first<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.100> belief<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.670> tomb<00:02:45.910> really

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
first to the belief that the tomb really

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.160 
first to the belief that the tomb really
was<00:02:46.540> empty

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
was empty

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.560 
was empty
second<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.100> belief<00:02:48.489> that<00:02:48.520> the<00:02:49.030> disciples

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
second to the belief that the disciples

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.740 
second to the belief that the disciples
really<00:02:49.870> had<00:02:50.110> met<00:02:50.560> Jesus<00:02:51.130> alive<00:02:51.790> again<00:02:52.239> in<00:02:52.420> a

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
really had met Jesus alive again in a

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.920 
really had met Jesus alive again in a
transformed<00:02:53.500> body<00:02:53.970> how<00:02:54.970> do<00:02:55.030> we<00:02:55.180> explain<00:02:55.600> that

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
transformed body how do we explain that

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.590 
transformed body how do we explain that
lots<00:02:56.739> of<00:02:56.890> theories<00:02:57.280> have<00:02:57.310> been<00:02:57.459> tried<00:02:57.850> most<00:02:58.480> of

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
lots of theories have been tried most of

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.410 
lots of theories have been tried most of
them<00:02:58.690> pretty<00:02:58.900> thin<00:02:58.989> and<00:02:59.560> unconvincing<00:03:00.430> the

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
them pretty thin and unconvincing the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.840 
them pretty thin and unconvincing the
one<00:03:01.630> that<00:03:01.810> fits<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.380> evidence<00:03:02.620> like<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.190> glove

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
one that fits the evidence like a glove

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.420 
one that fits the evidence like a glove
and<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.630> is<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.900> simplest<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.470> all<00:03:05.650> is<00:03:05.920> that

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
and that is the simplest of all is that

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.970 
and that is the simplest of all is that
it's<00:03:06.580> actually<00:03:06.760> true<00:03:07.300> that<00:03:07.570> Jesus<00:03:08.260> really<00:03:08.770> was

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
it's actually true that Jesus really was

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:17.330 
it's actually true that Jesus really was
raised<00:03:09.970> from<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.630> dead

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340
