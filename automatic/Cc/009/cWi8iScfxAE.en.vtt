telemetry in life battery power levels

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.990 
telemetry in life battery power levels
in<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.840> earth<00:01:51.020> speed<00:01:51.470> you<00:01:51.979> have<00:01:52.160> the<00:01:52.340> altitude

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
in the earth speed you have the altitude

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.980 
in the earth speed you have the altitude
the<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.110> high<00:01:54.740> retaining<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.640> bearing<00:01:56.030> and

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
the the high retaining the bearing and

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.910 
the the high retaining the bearing and
ground<00:01:57.590> speed<00:01:58.539> and<00:01:59.539> another<00:02:00.080> information<00:02:00.740> per

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
ground speed and another information per

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:09.160 
ground speed and another information per
Waypoint<00:02:06.009> and<00:02:07.009> so<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:08.539> you're<00:02:08.720> also<00:02:08.869> using

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
Waypoint and so so you're also using

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.000 
Waypoint and so so you're also using
like<00:02:09.800> standard<00:02:10.900> remote<00:02:11.900> control<00:02:12.290> airplane

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
like standard remote control airplane

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:21.940 
like standard remote control airplane
stuff<00:02:19.269> when<00:02:20.269> when<00:02:20.690> you're<00:02:20.900> landing<00:02:21.230> or<00:02:21.709> taking

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
stuff when when you're landing or taking

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.030 
stuff when when you're landing or taking
off<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:23.060> for<00:02:23.330> legal<00:02:23.510> reasons<00:02:23.840> overhead<00:02:24.530> you

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
off and for legal reasons overhead you

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.490 
off and for legal reasons overhead you
need<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.519> radio<00:02:25.850> control<00:02:26.330> so<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.290> rate<00:02:27.470> of

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
need a radio control so the rate of

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.620 
need a radio control so the rate of
control<00:02:27.920> will<00:02:28.160> let<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.580> fly<00:02:28.970> this<00:02:29.030> aircraft

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
control will let you fly this aircraft

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.320 
control will let you fly this aircraft
manually<00:02:30.440> in<00:02:30.709> case<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:31.130> emergency<00:02:31.850> or<00:02:31.880> your

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
manually in case of emergency or your

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.039 
manually in case of emergency or your
code<00:02:32.540> enforcement<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.880> when<00:02:35.570> you<00:02:35.720> are<00:02:35.810> ready

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
code enforcement and when you are ready

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.800 
code enforcement and when you are ready
and<00:02:36.610> enough<00:02:37.610> altitude<00:02:37.910> you<00:02:38.390> can<00:02:38.570> switch<00:02:38.780> to

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
and enough altitude you can switch to

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.550 
and enough altitude you can switch to
idle<00:02:39.290> pilot<00:02:39.709> just<00:02:39.860> like<00:02:40.070> this<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:41.540> I<00:02:41.660> also<00:02:42.260> I

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
idle pilot just like this and I also I

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.819 
idle pilot just like this and I also I
develop<00:02:43.070> as<00:02:43.220> failsafe<00:02:43.600> system<00:02:44.600> if<00:02:45.110> you<00:02:45.320> go<00:02:45.470> far

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
develop as failsafe system if you go far

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.380 
develop as failsafe system if you go far
away<00:02:45.950> from<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.519> range<00:02:46.730> of<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:46.970> radio<00:02:47.150> control

away from the range of the radio control

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.080 
away from the range of the radio control
and<00:02:47.959> you<00:02:48.140> lose<00:02:48.350> radio<00:02:48.829> or<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:49.549> have<00:02:49.910> no

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
and you lose radio or you have no

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.569

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.729 
battery for example a picture of the
outfile<00:02:53.000> will<00:02:53.329> kick<00:02:53.600> in

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
outfile will kick in

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.459 
outfile will kick in
we'll<00:02:55.159> pay<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:55.760> then<00:02:55.909> it'll<00:02:56.090> return<00:02:56.540> home<00:02:56.780> okay

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:57.469 
we'll pay so then it'll return home okay

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:01.360 
we'll pay so then it'll return home okay
we'll<00:02:57.739> bring<00:02:57.920> back<00:02:58.189> there<00:02:59.530> for<00:03:00.530> you<00:03:00.680> Wow

have a good time flying it and then you

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:09.099 
have a good time flying it and then you
say<00:03:07.340> okay<00:03:07.640> come<00:03:07.819> on<00:03:07.849> back<00:03:08.120> home<00:03:08.299> and<00:03:08.629> then<00:03:08.719> and

as<00:03:42.500> well<00:03:42.650> we're<00:03:43.489> preparing<00:03:43.939> a<00:03:44.060> kid<00:03:44.329> we<00:03:44.840> are

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
as well we're preparing a kid we are

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.440 
as well we're preparing a kid we are
getting<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.650> parts<00:03:46.040> slowly<00:03:46.430> you<00:03:46.969> have<00:03:47.090> parts

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
getting the parts slowly you have parts

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.849 
getting the parts slowly you have parts
of<00:03:47.510> it<00:03:47.659> like<00:03:47.870> you've<00:03:48.049> got<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.319> circuit<00:03:48.650> board

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
of it like you've got the circuit board

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:56.500 
of it like you've got the circuit board
here<00:03:52.840> is<00:03:53.840> part<00:03:54.169> fun<00:03:54.409> and<00:03:55.069> I<00:03:55.430> also<00:03:55.459> develop<00:03:56.389> a

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
here is part fun and I also develop a

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.770 
here is part fun and I also develop a
small<00:03:56.810> shield<00:03:58.269> more<00:03:59.919> components<00:04:00.919> and

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
small shield more components and

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.870 
small shield more components and
and<00:04:01.870> a<00:04:01.990> fishery<00:04:02.500> issue<00:04:02.980> like<00:04:03.400> this<00:04:03.610> one

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
and a fishery issue like this one

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.740 
and a fishery issue like this one
pressure<00:04:04.270> sensor<00:04:04.870> then<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:05.830> put<00:04:06.100> like<00:04:06.750> that's

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
pressure sensor then you put like that's

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.410 
pressure sensor then you put like that's
one<00:04:08.020> basic<00:04:08.410> simple<00:04:08.830> we<00:04:09.190> need<00:04:09.420> also

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
one basic simple we need also

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.630 
one basic simple we need also
perpendicular<00:04:10.930> all<00:04:11.620> the<00:04:11.770> harnesses<00:04:12.010> and

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
perpendicular all the harnesses and

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.120 
perpendicular all the harnesses and
cables<00:04:13.090> to<00:04:13.290> increasingly<00:04:14.290> interface<00:04:14.920> with

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
cables to increasingly interface with

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.130 
cables to increasingly interface with
the<00:04:15.250> sensory<00:04:15.700> system<00:04:16.060> so<00:04:16.690> it's<00:04:16.870> gonna<00:04:16.959> be

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
the sensory system so it's gonna be

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.430 
the sensory system so it's gonna be
ready<00:04:17.350> like<00:04:17.500> in<00:04:17.769> one<00:04:18.100> month<00:04:18.430> I<00:04:18.670> think<00:04:19.030> so

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
ready like in one month I think so

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.170 
ready like in one month I think so
it's<00:04:20.950> all<00:04:21.070> a<00:04:21.100> bunch<00:04:21.310> of<00:04:21.430> bits<00:04:21.610> off<00:04:21.760> the<00:04:21.790> shelf

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
it's all a bunch of bits off the shelf

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.050 
it's all a bunch of bits off the shelf
and<00:04:22.500> then<00:04:23.500> a<00:04:23.770> little<00:04:23.950> bit<00:04:24.190> of<00:04:24.310> it<00:04:24.460> you<00:04:24.700> you've

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
and then a little bit of it you you've

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.680 
and then a little bit of it you you've
had<00:04:25.090> to<00:04:25.420> create<00:04:25.690> some<00:04:26.110> of<00:04:26.140> the<00:04:26.290> other<00:04:26.440> things

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
had to create some of the other things

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.420 
had to create some of the other things
