that there's a really powerful interface
that<00:00:57.030> allow<00:00:57.270> people<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.690> get<00:00:57.930> right<00:00:58.199> down<00:00:58.440> and

that allow people to get right down and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.220 
that allow people to get right down and
see<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.460> vessels<00:00:59.850> either<00:01:00.030> worldwide<00:01:00.629> or

I<00:01:03.690> remember<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.409> back<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.010> November<00:01:05.450> 2006<00:01:06.450> when

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
I remember in back in November 2006 when

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.929 
I remember in back in November 2006 when
the<00:01:06.780> EMA<00:01:06.900> murska<00:01:07.470> came<00:01:07.680> into<00:01:07.890> Felixstowe<00:01:08.700> I

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the EMA murska came into Felixstowe I

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.210 
the EMA murska came into Felixstowe I
was<00:01:09.540> out<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.840> country<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.470> by<00:01:10.650> using<00:01:10.890> this

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
was out of the country but by using this

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.359 
was out of the country but by using this
system<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.909> could<00:01:12.270> actually<00:01:12.570> see<00:01:13.049> her<00:01:13.369> being

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
system I could actually see her being

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.670 
system I could actually see her being
pushed<00:01:15.000> into<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.479> pins<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:16.020> key<00:01:16.229> there<00:01:16.530> by

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
pushed into the pins for key there by

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.859 
pushed into the pins for key there by
the<00:01:16.740> Bertha<00:01:17.369> tugs<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.540> made<00:01:18.750> me<00:01:18.840> feel

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
the Bertha tugs and just made me feel

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.870 
the Bertha tugs and just made me feel
like<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.470> was<00:01:19.590> watching<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.070> arrived<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.580> Port

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
like I was watching I arrived in Port

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.149 
like I was watching I arrived in Port
and<00:01:21.630> that's<00:01:21.869> very<00:01:22.080> important<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.619> people<00:01:22.770> when

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
and that's very important to people when

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.740 
and that's very important to people when
they're<00:01:23.369> trying<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.939> understand<00:01:24.509> what<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
they're trying to understand what the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.169 
they're trying to understand what the
maritime<00:01:25.170> domain<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.710> about

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.880 

the<00:01:32.179> main<00:01:32.329> difference<00:01:32.810> between<00:01:33.200> our<00:01:33.409> system

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
the main difference between our system

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.010 
the main difference between our system
and<00:01:34.009> others<00:01:34.310> is<00:01:34.549> the<00:01:35.119> application<00:01:35.750> of<00:01:35.840> human

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
and others is the application of human

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.550 
and others is the application of human

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.740 
intelligence from our agency Network AIS
works<00:01:40.280> from<00:01:40.579> the<00:01:40.670> radio<00:01:40.969> signals<00:01:41.479> coming<00:01:41.509> from

works from the radio signals coming from
the<00:01:41.899> vessels<00:01:42.380> and<00:01:43.600> often<00:01:44.600> there<00:01:44.780> can<00:01:44.810> be

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
the vessels and often there can be

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.959 
the vessels and often there can be
problems<00:01:45.590> with<00:01:45.740> an<00:01:45.979> identification<00:01:46.429> of<00:01:46.850> the

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
problems with an identification of the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.449 
problems with an identification of the
vessel<00:01:47.329> it<00:01:47.780> really<00:01:48.049> it<00:01:48.200> relies<00:01:48.530> on<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.799> MMS<00:01:49.310> I

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459 
vessel it really it relies on the MMS I

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.609 
vessel it really it relies on the MMS I
number<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.090> that's<00:01:50.390> is<00:01:50.600> supposedly<00:01:51.079> a<00:01:51.200> unique

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
number and that's is supposedly a unique

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.919 
number and that's is supposedly a unique
number<00:01:52.069> but<00:01:52.700> there<00:01:52.880> are<00:01:53.030> problems<00:01:53.539> where<00:01:53.780> that

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
number but there are problems where that

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:55.990 
number but there are problems where that
number<00:01:54.079> can<00:01:54.380> be<00:01:54.409> reused<00:01:54.979> or<00:01:55.369> typed<00:01:55.819> in

number can be reused or typed in
incorrectly<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.500> if<00:01:57.619> you're<00:01:57.740> relying

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
incorrectly and so if you're relying

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.309 
incorrectly and so if you're relying
purely<00:01:58.520> on<00:01:58.700> that<00:01:58.819> there<00:01:59.719> is<00:01:59.869> always<00:02:00.170> the

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
purely on that there is always the

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:03.429 
purely on that there is always the
difficulty<00:02:00.860> of<00:02:00.890> misidentification<00:02:02.439> using

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
difficulty of misidentification using

difficulty of misidentification using
the<00:02:03.500> human<00:02:03.829> intelligence<00:02:04.159> someone's

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
I think the graphical interface is going

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.060 
I think the graphical interface is going

their background and what we've done
with<00:05:34.380> AIS<00:05:34.860> there<00:05:35.280> is<00:05:35.580> that<00:05:35.790> we're<00:05:35.970> color

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
having to delve into the database you

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.650 
having to delve into the database you

can see instantly through color which

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.940 
can see instantly through color which
may<00:05:45.930> be<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.200> vessels<00:05:46.590> that<00:05:46.800> need<00:05:46.920> a

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
may be the vessels that need a

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.040 
may be the vessels that need a
particular<00:05:47.250> attention<00:05:47.670> you<00:05:48.480> click<00:05:48.780> on<00:05:48.930> the

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
particular attention you click on the

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.200 
particular attention you click on the
icon<00:05:49.470> and<00:05:49.650> then<00:05:49.980> drill<00:05:50.250> down<00:05:50.460> in<00:05:50.640> the<00:05:50.730> database

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
icon and then drill down in the database

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.970 
icon and then drill down in the database
and<00:05:51.990> I<00:05:52.050> think<00:05:52.200> this<00:05:52.290> is<00:05:52.470> the<00:05:52.620> tip<00:05:52.800> of<00:05:52.920> the

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
and I think this is the tip of the

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.160 
and I think this is the tip of the
iceberg<00:05:53.460> there's<00:05:54.060> so<00:05:54.300> many<00:05:54.510> things<00:05:54.840> that<00:05:54.960> can

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.170 
iceberg there's so many things that can

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.290 
iceberg there's so many things that can
be<00:05:55.230> done<00:05:55.260> with<00:05:55.530> graphics<00:05:56.010> and<00:05:56.300> explaining

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
be done with graphics and explaining

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.620 
be done with graphics and explaining
information<00:05:58.020> trends<00:05:58.530> and<00:05:58.710> flows<00:05:58.980> and<00:05:59.280> so<00:06:00.000> the

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
information trends and flows and so the

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.120 
information trends and flows and so the
system<00:06:01.020> that<00:06:01.050> you<00:06:01.200> see<00:06:01.410> at<00:06:01.500> the<00:06:01.560> moment<00:06:01.920> is

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
system that you see at the moment is

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.250 
system that you see at the moment is
really<00:06:02.340> the<00:06:02.790> beginning<00:06:03.270> of<00:06:03.300> a<00:06:03.750> very<00:06:03.960> large

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
really the beginning of a very large

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:13.640 
really the beginning of a very large
development<00:06:05.010> in<00:06:05.340> that<00:06:05.580> graphical<00:06:06.090> interface
