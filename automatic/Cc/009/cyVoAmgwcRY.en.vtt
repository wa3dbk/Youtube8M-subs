lock<00:01:18.440> it<00:01:18.649> in<00:01:19.960> if<00:01:20.960> you<00:01:21.200> did<00:01:21.350> not<00:01:21.500> want<00:01:21.679> to<00:01:21.800> lock

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
lock it in if you did not want to lock

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.410 
lock it in if you did not want to lock
it<00:01:22.190> in<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.600> 15<00:01:23.600> degree<00:01:23.750> increment<00:01:25.210> simply<00:01:26.210> move

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
it in a 15 degree increment simply move

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.770 
it in a 15 degree increment simply move
the<00:01:26.569> lever<00:01:27.009> to<00:01:28.009> the<00:01:28.130> right<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.729> this<00:01:29.450> allows

the lever to the right and this allows

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.880 
the lever to the right and this allows
you<00:01:29.960> to<00:01:30.110> use<00:01:30.289> the<00:01:30.470> compression<00:01:31.069> lock<00:01:32.890> moving

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
you to use the compression lock moving

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.620 
you to use the compression lock moving
the<00:01:34.009> upper<00:01:34.310> rail<00:01:34.490> in<00:01:34.759> any<00:01:34.940> position<00:01:35.210> and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.499 
the upper rail in any position and
locking<00:01:36.050> it<00:01:36.640> again<00:01:37.640> the<00:01:37.789> only<00:01:37.970> difference

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
locking it again the only difference

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.990 
locking it again the only difference
between<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.929> knowledge<00:01:39.289> of<00:01:39.440> five<00:01:39.909> and<00:01:40.909> the
