 hello to all vehicles use outraged opinions 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.179
 how does the gdc work 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:09.559
 just got out 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.509
 so you can have him let go of the dogs 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.259
 in humans 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.449
 I have the foot so it's a good team 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.630
 so be aware that I wish is that if a filter function 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.069
 with the hecatomb three of the four points three points 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:28.829
 and this is the bastille of the last bump contained on the cac it takes a 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.419
 small 0 points 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.430
 what can I and germany judging that I spoke 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.539
 so it was a question that never 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:37.680
 and to prove to you that samsung it works very well 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.160
 so the kickoff was given on the phone 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.519
 so a few minutes ago to an audience 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.510
 no activity 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.520
 find the mistake 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.950
 the left rear 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.700
 I am a winner 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.390
 wal-mart 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.390
 we must leave him the free field 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.940
 so I got up 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.879
 so either we have a little bit m 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.700
 I was wondering about him 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.700
 I am bad 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.360
 from 2006 to 2010 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.420
 so for me to unlock it 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.650
 we'll wait a little bit for a little message that appears 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:45.660
 a message 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.060
 those who asked 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.210
 it's either canceled or accept so here's 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.210
 so we'll accept 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.060
 here 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.270
 my dark eyes that plasmapheresis finally available 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.600
 in this concert 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.080
 what to expect 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.400
 we reason on a good evening to the average who carried his record 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.259
 in what we do what we could say that we will call the 112 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.169
 so these are twelve 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:13.789
 call 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:15.819
 the speaker player 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.669
 for a long time in the 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:20.669
 simply 6-6 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.099

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.610
 here is 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.539
 waiting 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:30.829
 on the other hand 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.799
 so here we go home 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.109
 so that the average 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.109
