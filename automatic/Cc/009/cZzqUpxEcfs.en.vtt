00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.810 
fairly meaty in its raw form okay so
what<00:00:25.170> we're<00:00:25.289> gonna<00:00:25.380> do<00:00:25.650> for<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.160> spice<00:00:26.490> rub<00:00:26.789> is

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
what we're gonna do for the spice rub is

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.700 
what we're gonna do for the spice rub is
when<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.210> work<00:00:27.359> with<00:00:27.390> spices<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:28.349> generally

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
when you work with spices you generally

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.330 
when you work with spices you generally
want<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.949> season<00:00:29.429> your<00:00:29.730> meat<00:00:30.330> first<00:00:31.140> okay<00:00:32.040> and

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
want to season your meat first okay and

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.549 
want to season your meat first okay and
what<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:32.969> find<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.570> if<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.899> don't<00:00:33.960> season

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
what I find is that if I don't season

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.260 
what I find is that if I don't season
the<00:00:34.649> meat<00:00:34.800> first<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.460> put<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.760> rub<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.059> it

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
the meat first and I put the rub on it

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.910 
the meat first and I put the rub on it
it<00:00:36.600> tends<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.140> give<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> little<00:00:37.559> bit<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.800> a

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
it tends to give a little bit of a

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.639 
it tends to give a little bit of a
gritty<00:00:38.190> texture<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> spices<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.410> just

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
gritty texture to the spices so I just

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.560 
gritty texture to the spices so I just
lightly<00:00:40.860> seasoned<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:41.700> both<00:00:41.910> sides<00:00:42.210> and

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
lightly seasoned it on both sides and

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.540 
lightly seasoned it on both sides and
then<00:00:43.020> we're<00:00:43.140> gonna<00:00:43.230> take<00:00:43.559> our<00:00:43.770> raw<00:00:43.980> seven<00:00:44.430> ood

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
presentation side down should just

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.740 
presentation side down should just
lightly<00:02:11.069> sizzle<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.150> main<00:02:12.330> thing<00:02:12.569> on<00:02:12.690> a

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
lightly sizzle and the main thing on a

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.880 
lightly sizzle and the main thing on a
spice<00:02:13.050> rub<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.410> like<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.680> say

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
spice rub is like I say

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.050 
spice rub is like I say
you<00:02:13.980> want<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.250> cook<00:02:14.370> kind<00:02:14.610> over<00:02:14.730> low<00:02:15.030> heat
