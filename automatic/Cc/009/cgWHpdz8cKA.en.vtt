00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
oil a wheat a mini app amino acids so I

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.350 
oil a wheat a mini app amino acids so I
mean<00:01:34.380> acids<00:01:35.120> yeah

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
mean acids yeah

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.020 
mean acids yeah
so<00:01:36.810> that's<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.080> first<00:01:37.229> verse<00:01:37.860> five<00:01:38.280> there's

so that's the first verse five there's
also<00:01:39.320> hydrolyzed<00:01:40.320> hair<00:01:40.680> keratin<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.490> here

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
also hydrolyzed hair keratin in here

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.600 
also hydrolyzed hair keratin in here
collagen<00:01:44.880> amino<00:01:45.330> acids<00:01:48.380> we<00:01:49.380> term<00:01:49.770> acid<00:01:50.340> I

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
collagen amino acids we term acid I

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.100 
collagen amino acids we term acid I
don't<00:01:50.909> know<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.210> might<00:01:51.570> be<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:52.640> protein<00:01:54.110> it

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
don't know that might be a protein it

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.310 
don't know that might be a protein it
has<00:01:55.170> hydrogen<00:01:55.790> hydrolyzed<00:01:58.820> glide<00:01:59.820> cuz

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
has hydrogen hydrolyzed glide cuz

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.170 
has hydrogen hydrolyzed glide cuz
like<00:02:02.320> Oh<00:02:02.530> sugar<00:02:02.860> so<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:03.280> don't<00:02:03.549> know<00:02:03.670> if<00:02:03.759> that<00:02:03.939> is

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
like Oh sugar so I don't know if that is

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.990 
like Oh sugar so I don't know if that is
a<00:02:04.390> protein<00:02:04.719> or<00:02:04.899> not<00:02:05.170> so<00:02:05.590> that's<00:02:06.340> why<00:02:06.549> I<00:02:06.610> people

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
a protein or not so that's why I people

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.180 
a protein or not so that's why I people
it<00:02:07.270> does<00:02:07.479> have<00:02:07.689> a<00:02:07.719> couple<00:02:08.349> of<00:02:08.440> proteins<00:02:08.920> in<00:02:09.069> it

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
it does have a couple of proteins in it

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.509 
it does have a couple of proteins in it
so<00:02:09.369> those<00:02:09.519> of<00:02:09.580> you<00:02:09.789> who<00:02:09.849> are<00:02:10.290> minor<00:02:11.519> protein

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
so those of you who are minor protein

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.699 
so those of you who are minor protein
sensitive<00:02:12.940> like<00:02:13.030> me<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.269> can't<00:02:13.629> use<00:02:13.660> this<00:02:13.930> every

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709

so<00:02:37.360> I've<00:02:37.750> used<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:38.260> stuff<00:02:40.980> six<00:02:41.980> times<00:02:42.310> maybe

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
so I've used this stuff six times maybe

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.720 
so I've used this stuff six times maybe
five<00:02:43.360> five<00:02:43.989> times<00:02:44.230> six<00:02:44.680> times<00:02:44.769> something<00:02:45.579> like

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
five five times six times something like

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.910 
five five times six times something like
that<00:02:45.989> anyways<00:02:46.989> like<00:02:47.590> y'all<00:02:48.510> this<00:02:49.510> stuff<00:02:49.870> is<00:02:50.230> so

that anyways like y'all this stuff is so

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.780 
that anyways like y'all this stuff is so
economical<00:02:51.959> those<00:02:52.959> because<00:02:53.290> it's<00:02:54.160> only<00:02:54.430> eight

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
economical those because it's only eight

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.809 
economical those because it's only eight
ounces<00:02:55.420> and<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:56.019> probably<00:02:56.290> have<00:02:56.530> another<00:02:57.040> four

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
ounces and I probably have another four

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.050 
ounces and I probably have another four
four<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.450> five<00:02:58.599> times<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:59.079> use<00:02:59.200> this<00:02:59.410> and

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
four to five times to use this and

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.839 
four to five times to use this and
literally<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.420> scoop<00:03:01.780> full<00:03:02.340> my<00:03:03.340> hair<00:03:03.519> is<00:03:03.610> good

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
the only drawback for me is that it does

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.200 
the only drawback for me is that it does
have<00:04:46.360> proteins<00:04:47.360> in<00:04:47.510> it<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:47.840> I<00:04:48.200> can't<00:04:48.470> handle<00:04:48.710> a

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
have proteins in it and I can't handle a

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.420 
have proteins in it and I can't handle a
lot<00:04:50.210> of<00:04:50.330> proteins<00:04:50.780> especially<00:04:51.680> in<00:04:51.860> my<00:04:52.100> um

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
lot of proteins especially in my um

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.790 
lot of proteins especially in my um
especially<00:04:53.419> if<00:04:53.720> I'm<00:04:53.840> doing<00:04:54.050> like<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.500> steam

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
especially if I'm doing like the steam
