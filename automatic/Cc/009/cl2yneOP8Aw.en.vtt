do that and I'll easily be able to get
access<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.590> bomb<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.189> preparing<00:01:38.520> for

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
access to that bomb but preparing for

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.510 
access to that bomb but preparing for
anything<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:40.079> could<00:01:40.259> happen<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.340> gonna

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
anything that could happen that is gonna

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.789 
anything that could happen that is gonna
help<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.909> out<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.030> lot<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.899> which<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.320> knife<00:01:43.500> is

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
help you out a lot in which the knife is

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.770 
help you out a lot in which the knife is
actually<00:01:44.100> like<00:01:44.520> one<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.909> most<00:01:45.119> used<00:01:45.299> items

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
actually like one of the most used items

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.840 
actually like one of the most used items
that<00:01:46.049> are<00:01:46.350> not<00:01:46.710> doing<00:01:47.159> anything<00:01:47.460> other<00:01:47.610> than

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
that are not doing anything other than

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.030 
that are not doing anything other than
giving<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.180> an<00:01:48.299> edge<00:01:48.420> nice<00:01:49.290> examples<00:01:49.860> is

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
giving you an edge nice examples is

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.260 
giving you an edge nice examples is
whenever<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.490> see<00:01:50.640> me<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.909> game<00:01:51.060> player

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
whenever you see me in the game player

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.270 
whenever you see me in the game player
like<00:01:51.780> for<00:01:51.930> example<00:01:52.320> when<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.500> go<00:01:52.560> out<00:01:52.829> from<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
like for example when I go out from the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.889 
like for example when I go out from the
spawn<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.790> rushed<00:01:54.060> with<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.270> knife<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.780> that's

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
spawn I rushed with a knife and that's

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.450 
spawn I rushed with a knife and that's
because<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.350> gives<00:01:55.500> me<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.829> best<00:01:55.950> edge<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.430> can

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
because it gives me the best edge I can

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.999 
because it gives me the best edge I can
possibly<00:01:56.909> get<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.630> case<00:01:58.049> anything<00:01:58.619> happens

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
possibly get in case anything happens

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.609 
possibly get in case anything happens
you<00:01:59.850> cannot<00:02:00.119> predict<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.659> enemy<00:02:00.899> 100%

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
you cannot predict the enemy 100%

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.080 
you cannot predict the enemy 100%
randomly<00:02:02.070> they're<00:02:02.189> gonna<00:02:02.310> rush<00:02:02.549> randomly

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
randomly they're gonna rush randomly

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.490 
randomly they're gonna rush randomly
they're<00:02:03.240> not<00:02:03.420> if<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.110> get<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.380> best

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
they're not if you get the best

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.860 
they're not if you get the best
precision<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.310> order<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.729> deal<00:02:05.909> with<00:02:05.969> whatever

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
precision in order to deal with whatever

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.810 
precision in order to deal with whatever
could<00:02:07.260> happen<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:08.070> it's<00:02:08.190> gonna<00:02:08.310> allow<00:02:08.460> you<00:02:08.580> to

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
could happen and it's gonna allow you to

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.550 
could happen and it's gonna allow you to
maybe<00:02:09.030> survive<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.510> lot<00:02:09.840> more<00:02:10.080> kissing<00:02:10.320> artists

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
maybe survive a lot more kissing artists

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.160 
maybe survive a lot more kissing artists
and<00:02:10.710> what<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.040> should<00:02:11.340> survive<00:02:12.090> at<00:02:12.300> all<00:02:12.990> so

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
and what you should survive at all so

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.080 
and what you should survive at all so
for<00:02:13.320> example<00:02:13.740> when<00:02:13.890> your<00:02:14.040> round<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.490> done<00:02:14.550> and

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
for example when your round is done and

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.000 
for example when your round is done and
you<00:02:15.510> killed<00:02:15.870> all<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.140> enemies<00:02:16.170> it's<00:02:16.860> also

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
you killed all the enemies it's also

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.500 
you killed all the enemies it's also
very<00:02:17.190> good<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.460> equip<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.880> knife<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.210> order<00:02:18.390> to

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
very good to equip the knife in order to

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.420 
very good to equip the knife in order to
run<00:02:18.810> over<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.110> grenades<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.980> might<00:02:20.130> have<00:02:20.220> dropped

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
run over a grenades I might have dropped

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.010 
run over a grenades I might have dropped
from<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.700> enemies<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.180> or<00:02:21.390> being<00:02:21.660> able<00:02:21.870> to

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
from the enemies and or being able to

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.530 
from the enemies and or being able to
maybe<00:02:22.320> reach<00:02:22.860> one<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.580> more<00:02:23.880> important

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
maybe reach one of the more important

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.290 
maybe reach one of the more important
needs<00:02:25.230> from<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.890> know<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.040> mean<00:02:26.430> guns<00:02:26.640> but<00:02:27.210> the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
needs from you know I mean guns but the

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.820 
needs from you know I mean guns but the
enemy<00:02:27.540> might<00:02:27.690> have<00:02:27.810> dropped<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.290> or<00:02:28.470> maybe

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
enemy might have dropped and or maybe

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.060 
enemy might have dropped and or maybe
some<00:02:29.160> peanuts<00:02:29.910> dog<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.630> there's<00:02:31.410> like<00:02:31.560> already

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
some peanuts dog so there's like already

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.980 
some peanuts dog so there's like already
a<00:02:32.100> lot<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.370> uses<00:02:32.670> for<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.090> but<00:02:33.390> in<00:02:33.510> battle

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
a lot of uses for it but in battle

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.270 
a lot of uses for it but in battle
there's<00:02:34.260> actually<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.620> lot<00:02:34.740> of<00:02:34.860> them<00:02:34.950> as<00:02:35.070> well

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
there's actually a lot of them as well

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.450 
there's actually a lot of them as well
and<00:02:35.580> surfing<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.630> gonna<00:02:36.840> be<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.620> think<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.310> should

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
and surfing is gonna be I think I should

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.950 
and surfing is gonna be I think I should
make<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.640> like<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.820> quick<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.210> surfing<00:02:39.600> tutorial

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
make it like a quick to surfing tutorial

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.510 
make it like a quick to surfing tutorial
for<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:40.320> challenge<00:02:40.680> or<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.160> I've<00:02:41.280> got

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
for this challenge or so that I've got

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.920 
for this challenge or so that I've got
it<00:02:41.640> in<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.820> playlist<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.360> all<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.690> kind<00:02:42.870> of

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
it in the playlist and all that kind of

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.570 
it in the playlist and all that kind of
stuff<00:02:43.020> but<00:02:43.530> surfing<00:02:43.950> actually<00:02:44.280> have<00:02:44.400> one

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
stuff but surfing actually have one

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.090 
stuff but surfing actually have one
ability<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.510> is<00:02:45.690> very<00:02:45.990> very<00:02:46.200> much<00:02:46.500> useful<00:02:46.920> in

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
ability that is very very much useful in

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.800 
ability that is very very much useful in
the<00:02:47.220> game<00:02:47.370> itself<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.910> I'm<00:02:47.970> actually<00:02:48.150> trying

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
the game itself and I'm actually trying

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.240 
the game itself and I'm actually trying
to<00:02:48.900> learn<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.140> couple<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.440> my<00:02:49.560> real<00:02:49.770> life<00:02:49.890> but<00:02:50.130> is

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
to learn a couple of my real life but is

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.680 
to learn a couple of my real life but is
how<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.400> do<00:02:50.580> that<00:02:50.760> kind<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.090> stuff<00:02:51.270> as<00:02:51.390> well

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
how to do that kind of stuff as well

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.920 
how to do that kind of stuff as well
cuz<00:02:51.960> it<00:02:52.080> is<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.500> helpful<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.780> surfing<00:02:54.780> it

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
cuz it is that helpful so surfing it

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.690 
cuz it is that helpful so surfing it
allows<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.320> to<00:02:55.470> learn<00:02:55.650> how<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.860> strafe<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:56.550> the

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
allows you to learn how to strafe in the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.640 
allows you to learn how to strafe in the
game<00:02:56.940> obviously<00:02:57.240> the<00:02:57.960> values<00:02:58.380> of<00:02:58.560> the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
game obviously the values of the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.200 
game obviously the values of the
strafing<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.220> lot<00:02:59.400> more<00:02:59.580> powerful<00:02:59.880> which

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
strafing is a lot more powerful which

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.440 
strafing is a lot more powerful which
gives<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.690> less<00:03:01.190> loss<00:03:02.190> by<00:03:02.670> strafing<00:03:03.060> in<00:03:03.390> the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
gives you less loss by strafing in the

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.910 
gives you less loss by strafing in the
middle<00:03:03.630> of<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.840> air<00:03:04.020> but<00:03:04.530> if<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:04.680> learn<00:03:04.890> how

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
middle of the air but if you learn how

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.770 
middle of the air but if you learn how
to<00:03:05.130> you<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.790> can<00:03:05.940> do<00:03:06.060> what<00:03:06.210> that<00:03:06.240> guys<00:03:06.570> doing

to you you can do what that guys doing
right<00:03:06.990> there<00:03:07.260> he<00:03:07.950> was<00:03:08.070> literally<00:03:08.400> bunny<00:03:08.760> hop

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
right there he was literally bunny hop

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.660 
right there he was literally bunny hop
strafing<00:03:09.450> like<00:03:10.350> first<00:03:10.950> forward<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.520> then<00:03:11.610> he

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
strafing like first forward and then he

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.160 
strafing like first forward and then he
just<00:03:11.850> in<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.120> middle<00:03:12.330> of<00:03:12.390> an<00:03:12.480> air<00:03:12.630> switch<00:03:12.930> to

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
just in the middle of an air switch to

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.840 
just in the middle of an air switch to
the<00:03:13.290> left<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.860> yeah<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.280> can<00:03:14.400> allow<00:03:14.610> you<00:03:14.820> to

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
the left and yeah that can allow you to

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.790 
the left and yeah that can allow you to
get<00:03:15.090> avoided<00:03:15.600> and<00:03:15.840> or<00:03:16.050> like<00:03:16.260> dodge<00:03:16.530> more

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
get avoided and or like dodge more

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.190 
get avoided and or like dodge more
bullets<00:03:17.190> but<00:03:17.670> also<00:03:18.060> if<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.510> are<00:03:18.540> close<00:03:19.020> to<00:03:19.080> a

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
bullets but also if you are close to a

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.720 
bullets but also if you are close to a
corner<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.530> you're<00:03:19.800> playing<00:03:20.130> like<00:03:20.430> a<00:03:20.459> little

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730

bit<00:03:20.820> far<00:03:21.000> away<00:03:21.120> from<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.390> corner<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:22.230> see

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
bit far away from the corner and you see

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.590 
bit far away from the corner and you see
that<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.680> fuck<00:03:22.890> ton<00:03:23.010> of<00:03:23.070> enemies<00:03:23.220> comes<00:03:23.610> but<00:03:24.480> you

that a fuck ton of enemies comes but you

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.000 
that a fuck ton of enemies comes but you
know<00:03:24.840> that<00:03:25.020> they<00:03:25.140> will<00:03:25.290> like<00:03:25.440> only<00:03:25.739> maybe

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
know that they will like only maybe

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.830 
know that they will like only maybe
catch<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.520> glimpse<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:27.270> if<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.660> are

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
catch a glimpse of you if you are

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.060 
catch a glimpse of you if you are
running<00:03:27.959> around<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.290> corner<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.920> can

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
running around the corner you can

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.190 
running around the corner you can
actually<00:03:29.220> save<00:03:29.670> yourself<00:03:30.150> if<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.450> jump<00:03:30.840> right

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
actually save yourself if you jump right

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.840 
actually save yourself if you jump right
before<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.709> are<00:03:31.739> about<00:03:31.830> to<00:03:32.040> pass<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.550> corner

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
before you are about to pass the corner

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.400 
before you are about to pass the corner
and<00:03:33.180> then<00:03:33.330> you're<00:03:33.450> just<00:03:33.570> holding<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.260> left

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
and then you're just holding the left

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.949 
and then you're just holding the left
button<00:03:34.830> midair<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.550> then<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.270> straight<00:03:36.750> to

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
button midair and then you straight to

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.229 
button midair and then you straight to
the<00:03:37.080> left<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.709> will<00:03:37.980> allow<00:03:38.220> you<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.459> sort<00:03:39.090> to

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
the left that will allow you to sort to

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.750 
the left that will allow you to sort to
speak<00:03:39.500> moving<00:03:40.500> mid-air<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.340> left<00:03:41.520> and

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
speak moving mid-air and to the left and

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.550 
speak moving mid-air and to the left and
it's<00:03:42.300> one<00:03:42.420> of<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.630> minor<00:03:42.810> mechanics<00:03:43.350> in<00:03:43.500> the

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
it's one of the minor mechanics in the

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.860 
it's one of the minor mechanics in the
game<00:03:43.590> that<00:03:43.920> allow<00:03:44.100> you<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.370> do<00:03:44.700> or<00:03:44.940> more<00:03:45.330> even

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
game that allow you to do or more even

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.660 
game that allow you to do or more even
though<00:03:46.020> again<00:03:46.140> like<00:03:46.620> technically<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.640> should

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
though again like technically it should

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.300 
though again like technically it should
like<00:03:48.600> bind<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.230> math<00:03:49.440> in<00:03:49.709> my<00:03:49.769> head<00:03:49.920> it<00:03:50.190> should

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
like bind the math in my head it should

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.830 
like bind the math in my head it should
be<00:03:50.430> worthless<00:03:50.640> and<00:03:51.120> by<00:03:51.300> the<00:03:51.360> way<00:03:51.480> I<00:03:51.510> thought<00:03:51.780> it

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
be worthless and by the way I thought it

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.210 
be worthless and by the way I thought it
was<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:52.019> bit<00:03:52.140> weird<00:03:52.350> here<00:03:52.590> because<00:03:52.830> I<00:03:52.860> heard<00:03:53.130> a

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
someone who were above so that was kind

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.000 
someone who were above so that was kind

of cool pretty pretty ass
T<00:03:59.190> sided<00:03:59.580> map<00:03:59.700> I<00:03:59.880> would<00:04:00.030> say<00:04:00.209> that's<00:04:00.660> obviously

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
T sided map I would say that's obviously

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.630 
T sided map I would say that's obviously
I'm<00:04:01.200> show<00:04:01.410> we<00:04:01.680> are<00:04:01.769> just<00:04:01.950> really<00:04:02.130> good<00:04:02.340> at<00:04:02.489> the

I'm show we are just really good at the

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.180 
I'm show we are just really good at the
map<00:04:02.880> so<00:04:03.450> yeah<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:04.200> what<00:04:04.440> is<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:04.800> to<00:04:04.890> mention

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
map so yeah and what is it to mention

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.530 
map so yeah and what is it to mention
about<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.400> knife<00:04:05.550> well<00:04:05.880> I<00:04:05.910> don't<00:04:06.300> read<00:04:06.450> no

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
about the knife well I don't read no

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.740 
about the knife well I don't read no
matter<00:04:06.690> what<00:04:06.810> knife<00:04:06.959> you<00:04:07.110> have<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.470> would

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
matter what knife you have I would

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.270 
matter what knife you have I would
we<00:04:07.900> put<00:04:08.050> a<00:04:08.080> name<00:04:08.260> tag<00:04:08.500> on<00:04:08.620> a<00:04:08.680> default<00:04:09.100> knife

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
we put a name tag on a default knife

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.860 
we put a name tag on a default knife
then<00:04:09.520> have<00:04:09.700> one<00:04:09.940> but<00:04:10.300> the<00:04:10.420> main<00:04:10.600> reason<00:04:10.630> for

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
then have one but the main reason for

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.140 
then have one but the main reason for
that<00:04:11.020> is<00:04:11.170> because<00:04:11.410> a<00:04:11.800> lot<00:04:12.310> of<00:04:12.340> boss<00:04:12.640> accounts

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
that is because a lot of boss accounts

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.490 
that is because a lot of boss accounts
is<00:04:13.240> gonna<00:04:13.420> have<00:04:13.570> you<00:04:13.720> for<00:04:13.900> that<00:04:14.050> kind<00:04:14.260> of<00:04:14.290> crap

own on this time it a little bit but I

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.690 
own on this time it a little bit but I
was<00:04:25.600> almost<00:04:25.990> able<00:04:26.170> to<00:04:26.350> recover<00:04:26.590> myself<00:04:27.130> not<00:04:27.610> to

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
was almost able to recover myself not to

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.850 
was almost able to recover myself not to
mention<00:04:27.850> I<00:04:28.180> took<00:04:28.480> a<00:04:28.510> very<00:04:28.780> awkward<00:04:29.080> flight<00:04:29.590> so

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
mention I took a very awkward flight so

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.410 
mention I took a very awkward flight so
that<00:04:29.890> kind<00:04:30.190> of<00:04:30.250> screwed<00:04:30.460> me<00:04:30.580> over<00:04:30.610> but<00:04:31.180> if<00:04:31.300> I

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
that kind of screwed me over but if I

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.820 
that kind of screwed me over but if I
would<00:04:31.480> have<00:04:31.660> just<00:04:31.720> played<00:04:32.140> that<00:04:32.380> corner<00:04:32.800> that

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
would have just played that corner that

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.890 
would have just played that corner that
he<00:04:33.280> had<00:04:33.550> to<00:04:33.640> push<00:04:33.850> in<00:04:33.970> order<00:04:34.120> to<00:04:34.300> hit<00:04:34.450> me<00:04:34.660> I

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
he had to push in order to hit me I

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.690 
he had to push in order to hit me I
would<00:04:35.650> have<00:04:35.740> been<00:04:35.830> able<00:04:35.980> to<00:04:36.070> take<00:04:36.250> him<00:04:36.400> on<00:04:36.490> on<00:04:36.670> a

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
would have been able to take him on on a

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.550 
would have been able to take him on on a
lot<00:04:36.940> better<00:04:37.180> but<00:04:37.600> again<00:04:37.630> I<00:04:37.930> fucked<00:04:38.290> up<00:04:38.380> that

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
lot better but again I fucked up that

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.080 
lot better but again I fucked up that
moment<00:04:38.830> that<00:04:38.890> he<00:04:39.010> I<00:04:39.040> was<00:04:39.340> referring<00:04:39.640> to<00:04:39.760> that

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
moment that he I was referring to that

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.550 
moment that he I was referring to that
happened<00:04:40.390> a<00:04:40.419> little<00:04:40.600> bit<00:04:40.690> earlier<00:04:41.050> so<00:04:41.230> that's

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
happened a little bit earlier so that's

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.300 
happened a little bit earlier so that's
all<00:04:41.770> on<00:04:41.950> me

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
all on me

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.920 
all on me
but<00:04:42.430> anyways<00:04:42.730> as<00:04:42.880> you<00:04:42.970> could<00:04:43.120> see<00:04:43.390> I<00:04:43.600> was<00:04:43.810> able

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
but anyways as you could see I was able

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.450 
but anyways as you could see I was able
to<00:04:44.050> quickly<00:04:44.230> get<00:04:44.500> through<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.800> cobra<00:04:45.070> so<00:04:45.430> I

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
to quickly get through the cobra so I

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.430 
to quickly get through the cobra so I
should<00:04:45.700> actually<00:04:45.850> just<00:04:46.270> think<00:04:46.540> out<00:04:46.810> like<00:04:47.260> I

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
should actually just think out like I

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.110 
should actually just think out like I
should<00:04:47.800> think<00:04:47.980> a<00:04:48.100> little<00:04:48.250> bit<00:04:48.400> more<00:04:48.550> ahead

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
should think a little bit more ahead

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.880 
should think a little bit more ahead
than<00:04:49.300> what<00:04:49.660> I<00:04:49.690> did<00:04:49.810> in<00:04:50.050> that<00:04:50.080> case<00:04:50.380> scenario<00:04:50.770> in

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
than what I did in that case scenario in

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.950 
than what I did in that case scenario in
order<00:04:50.950> to<00:04:51.190> not<00:04:51.640> die<00:04:51.880> and<00:04:51.940> kill<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.330> enemy<00:04:52.600> so

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
order to not die and kill the enemy so

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.990 
order to not die and kill the enemy so
that<00:04:53.169> I<00:04:53.200> can<00:04:53.410> win<00:04:53.590> to<00:04:54.010> be<00:04:54.130> able<00:04:54.220> to<00:04:54.340> savor<00:04:54.700> that

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
that I can win to be able to savor that

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.270 
that I can win to be able to savor that
moment<00:04:55.570> every<00:04:55.930> detail<00:04:56.350> matter<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:56.950> even<00:04:57.040> at

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
moment every detail matter and even at

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.620 
moment every detail matter and even at
that<00:04:57.430> moment<00:04:57.580> in<00:04:57.850> the<00:04:57.940> future<00:04:58.030> I'll<00:04:58.390> probably

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
that moment in the future I'll probably

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.360 
that moment in the future I'll probably
never<00:04:58.840> make<00:04:59.080> that<00:04:59.110> mistake<00:04:59.290> again<00:04:59.620> but<00:05:00.250> it's

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
never make that mistake again but it's

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.159 
never make that mistake again but it's
just<00:05:00.490> kind<00:05:00.730> of<00:05:00.760> cool<00:05:00.940> to<00:05:01.090> see<00:05:01.300> that<00:05:01.510> even<00:05:02.050> in

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
just kind of cool to see that even in

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.080 
just kind of cool to see that even in
this<00:05:02.320> high<00:05:02.590> level<00:05:02.620> can<00:05:03.250> you<00:05:03.700> know<00:05:03.820> high

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090
