outside of Sydney playing footy with my
dad<00:00:46.680> dad<00:00:47.680> was<00:00:47.890> a<00:00:47.920> pretty<00:00:48.100> good<00:00:48.190> rugby<00:00:48.430> player

dad dad was a pretty good rugby player

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.219 
dad dad was a pretty good rugby player
so<00:00:48.940> we<00:00:49.269> always<00:00:49.420> had<00:00:49.600> a<00:00:49.629> rugby<00:00:49.809> ball<00:00:49.899> around

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:50.229 
so we always had a rugby ball around

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:53.009 
so we always had a rugby ball around
always<00:00:51.190> had<00:00:51.309> a<00:00:51.339> bit<00:00:51.489> of<00:00:51.519> fun<00:00:51.699> so<00:00:52.600> mucking

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
always had a bit of fun so mucking

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.020 
always had a bit of fun so mucking
around<00:00:53.109> in<00:00:53.289> the<00:00:53.379> backyard<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:54.670> used<00:00:54.850> to<00:00:54.940> have

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
around in the backyard we used to have

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.139 
around in the backyard we used to have
this<00:00:55.180> grass<00:00:55.899> area<00:00:56.350> up<00:00:56.469> on<00:00:56.649> top<00:00:56.829> and<00:00:57.190> a<00:00:57.789> bit<00:00:58.000> of<00:00:58.089> a

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
this grass area up on top and a bit of a

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:59.520 
this grass area up on top and a bit of a
rock<00:00:58.329> wall<00:00:58.510> and<00:00:58.750> I<00:00:58.809> fell<00:00:58.989> off<00:00:59.019> the<00:00:59.199> rock<00:00:59.350> wall

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
rock wall and I fell off the rock wall

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.410 
rock wall and I fell off the rock wall
trying<00:00:59.739> to<00:00:59.829> chase<00:00:59.979> a<00:01:00.010> kick<00:01:00.250> one<00:01:00.430> time<00:01:00.609> this<00:01:01.239> was

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
trying to chase a kick one time this was

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.700 
trying to chase a kick one time this was
pretty<00:01:01.600> funny<00:01:01.839> and<00:01:01.989> that's<00:01:02.260> probably<00:01:02.589> my

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
pretty funny and that's probably my

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.200 
pretty funny and that's probably my
earliest<00:01:03.039> memory

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.969 

it's<00:01:08.630> sort<00:01:08.870> of<00:01:08.930> a<00:01:08.990> chess<00:01:09.229> match<00:01:09.470> all<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.770> time

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
it's sort of a chess match all the time

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.480 
it's sort of a chess match all the time
and<00:01:10.159> you're<00:01:10.970> always<00:01:11.390> working<00:01:11.740> as<00:01:12.740> a<00:01:12.799> group<00:01:13.280> or

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
and you're always working as a group or

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.850 
and you're always working as a group or
a<00:01:13.549> unit<00:01:13.970> it's<00:01:14.930> not<00:01:15.080> really<00:01:15.229> an<00:01:15.409> individual

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
a unit it's not really an individual

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.580 
a unit it's not really an individual
game<00:01:15.920> and<00:01:16.190> I<00:01:16.250> really<00:01:16.520> like<00:01:16.670> that<00:01:16.760> about<00:01:16.820> agree

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
game and I really like that about agree

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
game and I really like that about agree
it's<00:01:18.590> one<00:01:18.710> of<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:18.860> biggest<00:01:18.979> positives<00:01:19.520> I

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
it's one of the biggest positives I

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.950 
it's one of the biggest positives I
think<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.630> the<00:01:20.869> fact<00:01:21.080> that<00:01:22.270> other<00:01:23.270> sports<00:01:23.659> I'm

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
think and the fact that other sports I'm

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.230 
think and the fact that other sports I'm
sort<00:01:24.229> of<00:01:24.290> vertically<00:01:24.680> challenged<00:01:25.100> so<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:26.150> the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
sort of vertically challenged so so the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.790 
sort of vertically challenged so so the
counts<00:01:26.509> against<00:01:26.720> me<00:01:26.930> in<00:01:27.110> a<00:01:27.229> lot<00:01:27.350> of<00:01:27.409> ways<00:01:27.590> where

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
counts against me in a lot of ways where

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
counts against me in a lot of ways where
it's<00:01:27.920> in<00:01:27.979> rugby<00:01:28.159> that's<00:01:28.430> sort<00:01:28.640> of<00:01:28.700> an

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
it's in rugby that's sort of an

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.340 
it's in rugby that's sort of an
advantage<00:01:29.060> to<00:01:29.210> a<00:01:29.270> lot<00:01:29.390> of<00:01:29.420> times

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.840 

when<00:01:33.770> I<00:01:33.799> was<00:01:33.979> younger<00:01:34.159> as<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:34.400> bit<00:01:34.549> quicker<00:01:34.729> I

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
when I was younger as a bit quicker I

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.700 
when I was younger as a bit quicker I
played<00:01:35.150> in<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:35.330> back<00:01:35.509> so<00:01:35.720> I<00:01:35.750> was<00:01:35.780> dislocated

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
played in the back so I was dislocated

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.170 
played in the back so I was dislocated
both<00:01:37.100> funny<00:01:37.400> cats<00:01:37.580> when<00:01:37.729> I<00:01:37.790> was<00:01:37.880> about<00:01:37.970> 15

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
both funny cats when I was about 15

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.179 
both funny cats when I was about 15
years<00:01:38.420> old<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.049> I've<00:01:39.500> got<00:01:39.619> a<00:01:39.650> bit<00:01:39.830> fatter<00:01:40.040> and

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
years old so I've got a bit fatter and

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.180 
years old so I've got a bit fatter and
slaw<00:01:40.509> and<00:01:41.509> they<00:01:42.110> sort<00:01:42.320> of<00:01:42.409> moved<00:01:42.590> to<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:43.070> front

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
slaw and they sort of moved to the front

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.039 
slaw and they sort of moved to the front
row<00:01:43.460> it's<00:01:44.270> quite<00:01:44.450> enjoyable<00:01:44.600> they're

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
row it's quite enjoyable they're

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.660 
row it's quite enjoyable they're
probably<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.070> best<00:01:46.250> part<00:01:46.490> is<00:01:46.640> that

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
probably the best part is that

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.940 
probably the best part is that
one-on-one<00:01:47.240> confrontation<00:01:47.770> being<00:01:48.770> able<00:01:48.860> to

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
one-on-one confrontation being able to

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.320 
one-on-one confrontation being able to
look<00:01:49.100> your<00:01:49.220> opponent<00:01:49.610> in<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.700> eye<00:01:49.820> on<00:01:50.060> sort<00:01:50.270> of

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
look your opponent in the eye on sort of

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.480 
look your opponent in the eye on sort of
a<00:01:50.450> smile<00:01:50.720> Adam<00:01:50.990> I<00:01:51.140> love<00:01:51.680> a<00:01:51.710> bit<00:01:51.890> of<00:01:51.920> chitchat<00:01:52.190> in

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
a smile Adam I love a bit of chitchat in

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.700 
a smile Adam I love a bit of chitchat in
the<00:01:52.580> front<00:01:52.789> row<00:01:52.940> it's<00:01:53.720> it's<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.320> best<00:01:54.500> part

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
the front row it's it's the best part

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.469 
the front row it's it's the best part
about<00:01:54.830> it<00:01:55.009> sort<00:01:55.399> of<00:01:55.460> creeping<00:01:56.030> up<00:01:56.180> on<00:01:56.299> their

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
about it sort of creeping up on their

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.060 
about it sort of creeping up on their
mark<00:01:56.720> when<00:01:56.869> it's<00:01:57.020> they're<00:01:57.140> putting<00:01:57.470> just<00:01:57.680> sort

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
mark when it's they're putting just sort

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.910 
mark when it's they're putting just sort
of<00:01:58.100> intimidating<00:01:58.789> them<00:01:59.530> smiling<00:02:00.530> at<00:02:00.770> them

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
of intimidating them smiling at them

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.770 
of intimidating them smiling at them
blowing<00:02:01.220> kisses<00:02:01.670> probably<00:02:02.539> shouldn't<00:02:02.720> say

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
blowing kisses probably shouldn't say

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.840 
blowing kisses probably shouldn't say
that<00:02:02.990> on<00:02:03.140> this<00:02:03.289> might<00:02:04.220> come<00:02:04.369> off<00:02:04.430> looking<00:02:04.670> the

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
that on this might come off looking the

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.080 
that on this might come off looking the
wrong<00:02:04.970> way

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.170 

um<00:02:09.539> when<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.959> first<00:02:10.170> moved<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.470> San<00:02:10.679> Francisco

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
um when I first moved to San Francisco

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.610 
um when I first moved to San Francisco
couple<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.239> years<00:02:12.330> ago<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.629> came<00:02:12.900> out<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.110> the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
couple of years ago I came out to the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.009 
couple of years ago I came out to the
club<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:15.150> was<00:02:15.300> really<00:02:15.510> good<00:02:15.690> friendly

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
club and it was really good friendly

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.630 
club and it was really good friendly
atmosphere<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.530> that's<00:02:17.129> what<00:02:17.280> drew<00:02:17.489> me<00:02:17.519> to

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
atmosphere and that's what drew me to

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.300 
atmosphere and that's what drew me to
the<00:02:17.849> club<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.720> think<00:02:19.230> it's<00:02:19.769> one<00:02:19.980> of<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.129> best

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
the club I think it's one of the best

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.180 
forward to playing on back again the
first<00:04:02.720> time<00:04:02.989> I<00:04:03.019> went<00:04:03.260> down<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.560> San<00:04:03.739> Diego<00:04:03.769> was

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
first time I went down to San Diego was

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.970 
first time I went down to San Diego was
a<00:04:04.220> preseason<00:04:04.610> last<00:04:04.970> year<00:04:05.299> and<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:06.620> field<00:04:06.830> down

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
a preseason last year and the field down

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.160 
a preseason last year and the field down
there<00:04:07.160> is<00:04:07.250> incredibly<00:04:07.670> quick<00:04:08.000> and<00:04:08.209> it<00:04:09.049> was

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
there is incredibly quick and it was

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.589 
there is incredibly quick and it was
something<00:04:09.440> that<00:04:09.470> I<00:04:09.590> wasn't<00:04:09.799> really<00:04:10.010> expecting

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
something that I wasn't really expecting

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.089 
something that I wasn't really expecting
and<00:04:11.599> this<00:04:11.780> year<00:04:11.810> they're<00:04:12.110> just<00:04:12.319> chock-full<00:04:12.890> of

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
and this year they're just chock-full of

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.130 
and this year they're just chock-full of
eagles<00:04:13.580> and<00:04:13.819> and<00:04:14.060> I<00:04:14.239> just<00:04:14.510> think<00:04:14.690> it's<00:04:14.930> going

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
eagles and and I just think it's going

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
the super 14 at the moment and we're

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.320 
the super 14 at the moment and we're
looking<00:05:26.889> at<00:05:27.130> bringing<00:05:27.280> a<00:05:27.430> few<00:05:27.639> old<00:05:27.819> boys<00:05:28.090> back

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
looking at bringing a few old boys back

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.020 
looking at bringing a few old boys back
from<00:05:28.509> England<00:05:28.660> like<00:05:28.930> netbook<00:05:29.349> so<00:05:29.680> I<00:05:29.889> think<00:05:30.370> New

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
from England like netbook so I think New

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.930 
from England like netbook so I think New
Zealand's<00:05:31.479> got<00:05:31.660> the<00:05:31.780> inside<00:05:32.050> running<00:05:32.910> but<00:05:33.910> I

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
Zealand's got the inside running but I

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.550 
Zealand's got the inside running but I
really<00:05:34.330> believe<00:05:34.720> that<00:05:34.750> France<00:05:35.139> will<00:05:35.289> probably

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
really believe that France will probably

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.080 
really believe that France will probably
get<00:05:35.650> up<00:05:35.770> at<00:05:35.889> home<00:05:36.039> they<00:05:36.340> always<00:05:36.490> seem<00:05:36.759> to<00:05:36.910> pull

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
get up at home they always seem to pull

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.909 
get up at home they always seem to pull
one<00:05:37.180> out<00:05:37.330> of<00:05:37.360> the<00:05:37.509> bag<00:05:37.660> at<00:05:37.810> home<00:05:37.960> so<00:05:38.319> I<00:05:38.530> think

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
one out of the bag at home so I think

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.610 
one out of the bag at home so I think
they<00:05:39.130> might<00:05:39.310> get<00:05:39.460> a<00:05:39.520> bit<00:05:39.669> lucky<00:05:40.000> and<00:05:40.240> do<00:05:41.139> a<00:05:41.169> 99

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
they might get a bit lucky and do a 99

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.740 
they might get a bit lucky and do a 99
on<00:05:41.650> the<00:05:41.830> All<00:05:42.009> Blacks<00:05:42.039> again
