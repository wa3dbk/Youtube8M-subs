00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
come out quickly and it ends up looking

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.290 
come out quickly and it ends up looking
washed<00:00:40.559> out<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.070> honestly<00:00:41.610> didn't<00:00:42.030> think<00:00:42.090> I

step-by-step and how I completed it but

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.399 
step-by-step and how I completed it but
yet<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.640> did<00:01:39.030> not<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.509> dye<00:01:39.659> my<00:01:39.720> hair<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:40.110> 12

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
yet I did not have to dye my hair for 12

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.690 
yet I did not have to dye my hair for 12
weeks<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.220> thought<00:01:41.369> that's<00:01:41.579> pretty

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
weeks and I thought that's pretty

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.580 
weeks and I thought that's pretty
amazing<00:01:42.150> because<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.630> know<00:01:42.780> usually<00:01:43.350> when<00:01:43.470> you

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
amazing because I know usually when you

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.440 
amazing because I know usually when you
have<00:01:43.710> like<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> red<00:01:44.310> shade<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.670> hair<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.180> good

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
have like a red shade of hair it's good

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.749 
have like a red shade of hair it's good
to<00:01:45.630> touch<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.439> up<00:01:46.560> every<00:01:46.920> six<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.280> eight<00:01:47.369> weeks

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
to touch it up every six to eight weeks

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.240 
to touch it up every six to eight weeks
or<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.869> because<00:01:49.020> red<00:01:49.439> red<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:49.979> fades

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
or so just because red red just fades

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.249 
or so just because red red just fades
out<00:01:50.430> but<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.090> was<00:01:51.240> able<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.570> maintain<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.229> and

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
out but I was able to maintain it and

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.310

keep<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.740> color<00:01:53.520> for<00:01:53.759> 12<00:01:54.090> weeks<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.899> didn't

look at these drinks I can't believe
this<00:03:26.100> much<00:03:26.310> has<00:03:26.489> grown<00:03:26.730> out<00:03:26.970> it's<00:03:27.209> about<00:03:27.420> an

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
this much has grown out it's about an

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.569 
this much has grown out it's about an
inch<00:03:27.810> or<00:03:27.989> so<00:03:28.019> we<00:03:28.500> need<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.739> definitely<00:03:29.340> change

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
inch or so we need to definitely change

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.030 
inch or so we need to definitely change
this<00:03:29.880> up<00:03:30.120> I'm<00:03:30.810> gonna<00:03:31.049> start<00:03:31.380> off<00:03:31.500> with<00:03:31.560> taking

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
this up I'm gonna start off with taking

this claw and layering my hair starting
from<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.709> bottom<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.130> working<00:03:35.400> my<00:03:35.670> way<00:03:35.700> up

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
from the bottom and working my way up

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.819 
from the bottom and working my way up
I'm<00:03:36.660> going<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:36.930> separate<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.380> first<00:03:37.590> layer

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
I'm going to separate the first layer

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.289 
I'm going to separate the first layer
into<00:03:38.070> two<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.519> then<00:03:38.790> we're<00:03:38.940> going<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.090> start

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
into two and then we're going to start

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.569 
into two and then we're going to start
with<00:03:39.420> a<00:03:39.450> dyeing<00:03:39.750> process<00:03:40.230> as<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:41.190> can<00:03:41.400> see

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
here I am putting the color back into

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.740 
here I am putting the color back into
the<00:03:44.040> hair<00:03:44.220> that<00:03:44.489> has<00:03:44.640> already<00:03:44.880> been<00:03:45.269> dyed<00:03:45.480> and

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
the hair that has already been dyed and

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.720 
the hair that has already been dyed and
I'm<00:03:45.870> not<00:03:46.140> dying<00:03:46.410> the<00:03:46.620> roots<00:03:46.650> yet<00:03:47.130> I'm<00:03:47.340> gonna<00:03:47.549> go

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
I'm not dying the roots yet I'm gonna go

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.610 
I'm not dying the roots yet I'm gonna go
back<00:03:47.940> in<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.359> do<00:03:48.540> that<00:03:48.660> later<00:03:48.870> what<00:03:49.380> I'm<00:03:49.470> gonna

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
back in and do that later what I'm gonna

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.800 
back in and do that later what I'm gonna
do<00:03:49.829> with<00:03:50.010> this<00:03:50.130> whole<00:03:50.370> process<00:03:50.579> to<00:03:51.000> the<00:03:51.420> whole

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
do with this whole process to the whole

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.800 
do with this whole process to the whole
head<00:03:52.079> first

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:16.860 

I

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:28.870 

whoo<00:04:17.870> finally<00:04:18.859> the<00:04:19.010> last<00:04:19.190> layers<00:04:27.669> now<00:04:28.669> that<00:04:28.850> I

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
whoo finally the last layers now that I

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.400 
whoo finally the last layers now that I
got<00:04:29.030> the<00:04:29.120> areas<00:04:29.419> that<00:04:29.480> I<00:04:29.600> wanted<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:30.020> die<00:04:30.110> this

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
got the areas that I wanted to die this

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.440 
got the areas that I wanted to die this
is<00:04:30.530> where<00:04:30.710> I<00:04:30.740> go<00:04:30.980> back<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:31.520> get<00:04:32.000> all<00:04:32.240> the

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.450 
is where I go back and get all the

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.360 
is where I go back and get all the
routes<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:33.320> reason<00:04:33.620> I<00:04:33.680> go<00:04:33.800> back<00:04:33.979> in<00:04:34.130> and<00:04:34.250> dye

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
routes the reason I go back in and dye

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.950 
routes the reason I go back in and dye
the<00:04:34.400> route<00:04:34.669> slots<00:04:34.940> in<00:04:35.150> this<00:04:35.270> whole<00:04:35.419> process<00:04:35.630> is

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
the route slots in this whole process is

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.080 
the route slots in this whole process is
because<00:04:36.350> it's<00:04:36.620> still<00:04:36.830> virgin<00:04:37.190> here<00:04:37.370> and<00:04:37.639> that

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
because it's still virgin here and that

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.460 
because it's still virgin here and that
means<00:04:38.300> that<00:04:38.479> it<00:04:38.660> will<00:04:38.810> soak<00:04:39.020> up<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:39.169> color

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
means that it will soak up the color

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.320 
means that it will soak up the color
faster<00:04:40.100> and<00:04:40.550> I<00:04:40.729> don't<00:04:40.790> want<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.120> risk<00:04:41.240> the

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
faster and I don't want to risk the

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.550 
faster and I don't want to risk the
chance<00:04:41.630> that<00:04:41.720> it<00:04:41.900> may<00:04:42.020> come<00:04:42.080> out<00:04:42.320> brighter

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
chance that it may come out brighter

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:50.170 
chance that it may come out brighter
than<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.889> rest<00:04:43.070> of<00:04:43.220> my<00:04:43.310> hair<00:04:48.729> now<00:04:49.729> I'm<00:04:49.940> just

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
than the rest of my hair now I'm just

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.879 
than the rest of my hair now I'm just
making<00:04:50.600> sure<00:04:50.690> that<00:04:50.840> I<00:04:50.900> covered<00:04:51.290> all<00:04:51.500> my<00:04:51.650> roots

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889

and then I'm going to take my fingers

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.150 
and then I'm going to take my fingers
and<00:04:53.479> run<00:04:53.720> through<00:04:53.900> my<00:04:54.110> hair<00:04:54.320> making<00:04:54.650> sure<00:04:54.800> that

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
and run through my hair making sure that

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.560 
and run through my hair making sure that

the product distributes evenly

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.750

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
whole process I leave the design for

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.140 
whole process I leave the design for
about<00:05:00.620> an<00:05:00.889> hour<00:05:01.010> and<00:05:01.310> then<00:05:01.460> wash<00:05:01.669> it<00:05:01.880> all<00:05:01.970> out

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150
