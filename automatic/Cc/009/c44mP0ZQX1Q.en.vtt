00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.260 

I<00:01:34.330> think<00:01:34.960> you<00:01:35.140> were<00:01:35.260> supposed<00:01:35.620> to<00:01:35.710> do<00:01:35.950> like<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
I think you were supposed to do like the

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
I think you were supposed to do like the
X<00:01:38.490> battle<00:01:39.490> royale<00:01:39.850> and<00:01:40.120> the<00:01:40.360> team<00:01:40.600> battle<00:01:40.960> yet

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
X battle royale and the team battle yet

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.500 
X battle royale and the team battle yet
thing<00:01:41.830> but<00:01:42.760> you<00:01:42.880> were<00:01:42.970> supposed<00:01:43.210> to<00:01:43.240> beat<00:01:43.420> them

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
thing but you were supposed to beat them

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.770 
thing but you were supposed to beat them
together<00:01:43.840> so<00:01:44.790> that's<00:01:45.790> probably<00:01:46.090> why<00:01:46.390> I<00:01:46.420> just

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
together so that's probably why I just

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:58.010 
together so that's probably why I just
molliwopped<00:01:47.320> that<00:01:47.560> whole<00:01:47.740> floor<00:01:51.630> even<00:01:52.630> just
