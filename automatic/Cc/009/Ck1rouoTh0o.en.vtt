today<00:00:00.989> I<00:00:01.020> would<00:00:01.290> like<00:00:01.410> to<00:00:01.530> show<00:00:01.890> you<00:00:01.949> my<00:00:02.070> RC<00:00:02.790> car

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
today I would like to show you my RC car

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.869 
today I would like to show you my RC car
which<00:00:03.659> is<00:00:03.689> on<00:00:04.020> a<00:00:04.250> RF<00:00:05.250> radio<00:00:05.850> frequency

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
which is on a RF radio frequency

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.530 
which is on a RF radio frequency
controlled<00:00:06.830> calm<00:00:07.880> controlled<00:00:08.880> by<00:00:09.480> this

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
controlled calm controlled by this

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.270 
controlled calm controlled by this
remote<00:00:10.170> control

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
remote control

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.609 
remote control
now<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.150> disassembled<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.200> car<00:00:13.410> found<00:00:13.920> this

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:15.619 
now I disassembled the car found this

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:21.290 
now I disassembled the car found this
motherboard<00:00:17.029> which<00:00:18.029> contains<00:00:18.600> an<00:00:18.960> RF<00:00:20.300> chip

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
motherboard which contains an RF chip

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.230 
motherboard which contains an RF chip
then<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.260> found<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.010> datasheet<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:23.939> chip

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
then I found the datasheet of that chip

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.759 
then I found the datasheet of that chip
and<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:25.439> thought<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.460> pins<00:00:26.900> for<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.140> motor

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
and I thought the pins for the motor

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.950 
and I thought the pins for the motor
controllers<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.760> motor<00:00:29.970> drivers<00:00:30.480> on<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
controllers the motor drivers on the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.190 
controllers the motor drivers on the
board<00:00:31.170> here<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.590> then<00:00:32.369> I<00:00:32.489> soldered<00:00:33.200> some

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
board here and then I soldered some

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.569 
board here and then I soldered some
wires<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.630> the<00:00:36.630> positive<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.770> negative<00:00:38.190> from

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
wires and the positive and negative from

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.610 
wires and the positive and negative from
the<00:00:38.700> battery<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.210> then<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.020> connected<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.559> to

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
the battery and then I connected it to

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.310 
the battery and then I connected it to
an<00:00:41.360> Arduino<00:00:42.360> tamaño<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:44.550> Y<00:00:45.270> shield<00:00:45.780> which

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
an Arduino tamaño and the Y shield which

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.549 
an Arduino tamaño and the Y shield which
is<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.739> Wi-Fi<00:00:47.520> shield<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.140> then<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.260> made<00:00:49.530> some

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
is a Wi-Fi shield and then I made some

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.360 
is a Wi-Fi shield and then I made some
software<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:50.879> possible<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.539> control

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
software so it's possible to control

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.430 
software so it's possible to control
this<00:00:53.370> RF<00:00:53.879> car<00:00:55.070> but<00:00:56.070> now<00:00:56.250> using<00:00:56.940> Wi-Fi<00:00:57.289> so<00:00:58.289> it's

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
this RF car but now using Wi-Fi so it's

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.500 
this RF car but now using Wi-Fi so it's
still<00:00:58.649> an<00:00:58.800> hour<00:00:58.920> F<00:00:59.129> car<00:00:59.430> but<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> can<00:01:00.000> control<00:01:00.329> it

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
still an hour F car but I can control it

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.130 
still an hour F car but I can control it
with<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.750> computer<00:01:01.579> the<00:01:02.579> commands<00:01:03.329> which<00:01:03.989> is

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
with the computer the commands which is

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.710 
with the computer the commands which is
set<00:01:04.350> from<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.739> computer<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.970> using

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
set from the computer to this is using

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.490 
set from the computer to this is using
the<00:01:07.080> normal<00:01:07.260> TCP<00:01:08.070> protocol<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.170> it's<00:01:10.170> just

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
the normal TCP protocol and it's just

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.880 
the normal TCP protocol and it's just
some<00:01:11.280> packages<00:01:11.790> containing<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:13.350> different

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
some packages containing the different

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.399 
some packages containing the different
driving<00:01:14.340> commands<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.689> if<00:01:15.869> it's<00:01:16.080> driving

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
driving commands that if it's driving

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.340 
driving commands that if it's driving
forward<00:01:16.979> then<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> speed<00:01:17.670> or<00:01:18.030> turn<00:01:18.720> right<00:01:18.750> and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
forward then the speed or turn right and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.620 
forward then the speed or turn right and
turn<00:01:19.560> left<00:01:20.360> so<00:01:21.360> let's<00:01:21.780> see<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.409> action<00:01:23.630> at

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
turn left so let's see this in action at

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.350 
turn left so let's see this in action at
power<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.290> am<00:01:26.070> connect<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:27.650> 9-volt<00:01:28.650> battery

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
power I am connect this 9-volt battery

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.890 
power I am connect this 9-volt battery
instead<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.509> using<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.500> battery<00:01:31.939> from<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
instead of using the battery from the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.969 
instead of using the battery from the
car<00:01:34.409> which<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.100> 6<00:01:35.430> volt<00:01:35.820> only<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:37.380> makes<00:01:37.710> some

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
car which is 6 volt only it makes some

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.170 
car which is 6 volt only it makes some
noises<00:01:38.250> -<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.930> Arduino<00:01:40.560> resets<00:01:41.070> itself<00:01:41.430> so

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
noises - so the Arduino resets itself so

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.719 
noises - so the Arduino resets itself so
instead<00:01:42.450> I'm<00:01:42.630> using<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.140> 9-volt<00:01:43.649> battery<00:01:43.950> so

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
instead I'm using this 9-volt battery so

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.380 
instead I'm using this 9-volt battery so
if<00:01:45.060> we<00:01:45.210> connect<00:01:45.960> this<00:01:46.280> we<00:01:47.280> have<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.700> wait<00:01:48.180> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
if we connect this we have to wait a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.740 
if we connect this we have to wait a
moment<00:01:48.810> for<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.860> Y<00:01:50.189> shield<00:01:50.520> -<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.149> July's<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
moment for the Y shield - in July's the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.649 
moment for the Y shield - in July's the
connection<00:01:52.259> with<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.560> ruler<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
connection with the ruler so in the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.120 
connection with the ruler so in the
meanwhile<00:01:54.990> let's<00:01:55.229> take<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> look<00:01:55.710> at<00:01:55.920> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
meanwhile let's take a look at the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.410 
meanwhile let's take a look at the
software<00:01:56.610> part<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.390> computer<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.590> my

indicates let the wife drilled and

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.780 
indicates let the wife drilled and
Audrina<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:36.840> connected<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.590> ruler<00:02:37.890> so<00:02:38.610> now

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
Audrina is connected to the ruler so now

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.440 
Audrina is connected to the ruler so now
let's<00:02:39.120> try<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:40.590> press<00:02:40.830> forward<00:02:41.190> in<00:02:41.610> the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
let's try to to press forward in the

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.009 
let's try to to press forward in the
application<00:02:43.020> on<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.140> computer<00:02:47.750> look<00:02:48.750> at<00:02:48.780> that

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
application on the computer look at that

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.340 
application on the computer look at that
we<00:02:49.950> move<00:02:50.130> forward<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.209> can<00:02:51.239> use<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.900> keypad

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
we move forward and I can use the keypad

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:07.130 
we move forward and I can use the keypad
to<00:02:52.890> control<00:02:53.250> it<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:05.360> then<00:03:06.360> I<00:03:06.450> can<00:03:06.630> also<00:03:06.780> change

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
to control it and then I can also change

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.000 
to control it and then I can also change
the<00:03:07.410> speed<00:03:07.760> let's<00:03:08.760> set<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.650> make<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.769> a<00:03:10.860> little

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
the speed let's set it make it a little

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:21.470 
the speed let's set it make it a little
slower<00:03:11.370> or<00:03:14.360> faster<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:20.459> speed<00:03:20.760> thing<00:03:21.060> is

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
slower or faster and the speed thing is

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.500 
slower or faster and the speed thing is
done<00:03:21.840> with<00:03:22.470> PDM<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.250> on<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.640> normal<00:03:24.120> remote

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
done with PDM and on the normal remote

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.610 
done with PDM and on the normal remote
control<00:03:25.250> here<00:03:26.510> it<00:03:27.510> doesn't<00:03:28.019> support<00:03:28.170> any

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
control here it doesn't support any

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.420 
control here it doesn't support any
speed<00:03:29.010> changes<00:03:29.579> it's<00:03:29.850> only<00:03:30.920> full<00:03:31.920> throttle

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
speed changes it's only full throttle

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.600 
speed changes it's only full throttle
forward<00:03:32.880> or<00:03:33.239> full<00:03:33.690> throttle<00:03:34.110> backward<00:03:34.610> now

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
forward or full throttle backward now

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.430 
forward or full throttle backward now
with<00:03:36.030> this<00:03:36.269> it's<00:03:36.600> possible<00:03:37.079> to<00:03:37.260> make

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
with this it's possible to make

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.670 
with this it's possible to make
different<00:03:38.250> speeds<00:03:38.610> so<00:03:39.200> when<00:03:40.200> it<00:03:40.290> hits<00:03:40.470> great

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
different speeds so when it hits great

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.660 
different speeds so when it hits great
now<00:03:41.610> I<00:03:41.640> only<00:03:42.329> turn<00:03:43.290> on<00:03:43.320> my<00:03:43.590> laptop<00:03:43.769> so<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:44.370> can

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
now I only turn on my laptop so you can

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.979 
now I only turn on my laptop so you can
see<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.780> laptop<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.650> sights<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.570> in<00:03:48.570> a<00:03:48.690> car

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
see the laptop the sights the in a car

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.990 
see the laptop the sights the in a car
in<00:03:49.440> acting<00:03:49.890> so<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.160> can<00:03:50.280> see<00:03:50.489> that<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:50.880> is

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
in acting so you can see that it is

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.530 
in acting so you can see that it is
working<00:03:51.390> with<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.870> Wi-Fi<00:03:52.290> connection<00:03:53.540> last

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
working with the Wi-Fi connection last

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.660 
working with the Wi-Fi connection last

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
but not least here's my laptop with the

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.270 
but not least here's my laptop with the
application<00:03:57.359> running<00:03:57.570> so<00:03:58.500> let's<00:03:59.340> try<00:03:59.670> to<00:04:01.280> -

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280
