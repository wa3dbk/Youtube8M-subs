00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
trade but that's it for complexity they

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.900 
trade but that's it for complexity they

this<00:00:38.239> gate<00:00:38.449> and<00:00:38.600> look<00:00:38.690> to<00:00:38.749> get<00:00:38.839> of<00:00:38.929> all<00:00:39.019> cops

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
this gate and look to get of all cops

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.310 
this gate and look to get of all cops
down<00:00:39.469> here<00:00:40.239> but<00:00:41.239> that<00:00:41.480> complexity<00:00:41.989> need<00:00:42.260> to

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
down here but that complexity need to

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.329 
down here but that complexity need to
consider<00:00:42.559> pushing<00:00:42.859> back<00:00:42.949> but<00:00:43.100> look<00:00:43.219> who's

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:43.339 
consider pushing back but look who's

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:44.919 
consider pushing back but look who's
coming<00:00:43.579> in<00:00:43.670> from<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:43.879> outside<00:00:44.120> it<00:00:44.449> says<00:00:44.659> Vicki
