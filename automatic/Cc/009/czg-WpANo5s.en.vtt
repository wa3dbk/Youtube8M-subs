00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.899
 be interested now initiatives of 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.640
 our Belgian neighbors who is inspired a little 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.350
 of what was going on in italy it's 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.840
 still goes by the way it was called that 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.190
 is called coffee sauce pesos it can 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.540
 also look like what in France one 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.130
 call the part of the poor you know we 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.839
 leave a plate with cutlery 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.029
 case where a pot was done so much at 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.980
 middle age than today perhaps at 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.480
 case where a poor man would come in 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.410
 the need there is the same 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.390
 you will see this initiative 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.970
 françois beaudonnet will tell you about it 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.279
 this is for example in the south of 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.199
 Italy to buy two coffees in wooden 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.910
 nothing next to one for a needy 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.739
 so here we are in belgium then to 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.969
 review what we keep and what we put 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.940
 French side will tell you 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.079
 hello hello there was good 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.180
 actually since we are in 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.280
 belgium well we'll talk about french fries 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.559
 so that actually makes one think of the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.260
 poor man's place this beautiful idea of 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.520
 generosity that comes to us from the bible there 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.129
 we are in Belgium so this is 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.550
 of fries you enter you enter 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.320
 a french fries order 2 cornet 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.850
 here are fried fries horned 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.379
 are not in trays like at home 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.989
 we in France and you do not eat 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.810
 only one the other will be for a 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.530
 who can not afford to 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.450
 pay to watch if there is a moment 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.549
 friendly in belgium is the one of 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.150
 cornet of french fries that we eat with 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.100
 colleagues or friends at the lunch break 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.409
 a dish that rarely costs more than two 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.890
 fifty euros still too expensive for 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.020
 some 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.070
 hence the initiative of this chip from 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.090
 center of brussels 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.490
 the fried waiting or fritz hanging the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.350
 customer actually buys two servings of which 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.990
 one will be for a person without 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.820
 fixed home the customer comes from there 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.590
 to get to the place he started fries 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.810
 and then I talk a little bit about their screams 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.490
 suspended and then I strong coupons 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.770
 so it's good that I sign ooyala 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.380
 map all the info 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.030
 and in fact it was a system that the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.460
 client even he will give to the homeless 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.619
 this new form of generosity is 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.110
 proposed for a few weeks and 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.000
 they already have some success 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.560
 it's a good idea in itself it's a 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.720
 nice gesture it's easier I think of 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.820
 china fries than to offer 2 euros in 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.810
 passing the street that makes one give 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.570
 under at least he would use it to 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.590
 come eat at the place in the woods where I 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.980
 do not know what they do with 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.660
 finally the trader has him all to 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.140
 win since it's not him who does 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.150
 gift 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.760
 but he defends himself for wanting to win 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.930
 money on the poorest 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.030
 the initiative begins in any case to 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.640
 to emulate in other cities of 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.610
 Belgium 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:33.240
 our city of belgium or beyond 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.330
 belgium to the senate yes absolutely then 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.060
 for example to sofia in bulgaria with this 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.070
 country and is very affected by the crisis 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.430
 economic is there for example and well to 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.770
 sofia this coffee system waiting or 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.790
 of fries waiting has been developed 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.680
 in snacks 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.600
 so we can buy like that a 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.370
 sandwich for example and leave it too 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.650
 for a person who needs it 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.140
 as for France william and well there is 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.720
 a group on facebook that was created 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.060
 who has more than 2,000 people who have 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.070
 joined this group I was seeing this all 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.420
 on time just before you speak and 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.650
 I do not know I confess I do not know 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.790
 not if there are traders who have for 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.130
 the moment played the game what I saw 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.470
 is that there was already a logo in 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.030
 French with coffee waiting and that 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.980
 so well it's getting 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.810
 develop also at home knowing 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.880
 obviously that more the economic crisis 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.290
 is important more this kind 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.970
 solidarity initiatives take 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.380
 the extent 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.000
 thank you pipe we'll go see that I 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.019
 will ask the aura of the web of your 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.320
 she will be sensitive 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.320
