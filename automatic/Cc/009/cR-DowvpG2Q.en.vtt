they retail about eight pounds each or

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.670 
they retail about eight pounds each or
something<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.730> are<00:01:00.629> not<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.899> websites<00:01:01.379> so

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
something and are not the websites so

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.770 
something and are not the websites so
that's<00:01:02.129> our<00:01:02.250> big<00:01:02.489> savings<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.210> I've<00:01:03.329> literally

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
that's our big savings so I've literally

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.780 
that's our big savings so I've literally
spent<00:01:04.170> less<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.739> would<00:01:04.890> up<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.220> one<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.519> them

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
