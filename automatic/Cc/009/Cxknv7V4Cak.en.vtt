00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
now go to SCP server this after you have

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.060 
now go to SCP server this after you have
installed<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.049> SCP<00:01:43.470> driver<00:01:43.799> plug<00:01:44.759> your<00:01:44.909> ds4

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070

installed the SCP driver plug your ds4
into<00:01:47.070> your<00:01:47.189> PC<00:01:47.579> with<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.479> USB<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.110> told

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
into your PC with that USB that I told

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.450 
into your PC with that USB that I told
you<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.590> would<00:01:49.740> normally<00:01:50.009> charge<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.340> with

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
you you would normally charge you with

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.170 
you you would normally charge you with
on<00:01:50.610> your<00:01:50.700> ps4

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
on your ps4

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.350 
on your ps4
so<00:01:51.750> open<00:01:52.320> up<00:01:52.409> SCP<00:01:52.890> driver

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
so open up SCP driver

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.230 
so open up SCP driver
and<00:01:54.480> now<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.410> should<00:01:55.560> pretty<00:01:56.160> much<00:01:56.340> work<00:01:56.580> all

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
and now it should pretty much work all

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.310 
and now it should pretty much work all
you<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.630> do<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.930> click<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.260> button

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
you have to do is click this button

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.110 
you have to do is click this button
right<00:01:58.620> here<00:01:58.740> I'm<00:01:59.430> not<00:01:59.670> even<00:01:59.850> sure<00:01:59.970> if<00:02:00.030> this

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
right here I'm not even sure if this

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.820 
right here I'm not even sure if this
does<00:02:00.300> anything<00:02:00.510> but<00:02:00.900> I<00:02:01.110> would<00:02:01.500> go<00:02:01.620> ahead<00:02:01.680> and

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
does anything but I would go ahead and

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.550 
does anything but I would go ahead and
click<00:02:01.980> it<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.280> for<00:02:02.460> safety<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.560> basically

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
click it just for safety and basically

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.380 
click it just for safety and basically
