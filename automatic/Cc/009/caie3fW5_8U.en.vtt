00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
especially since it can hold the DSLR

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.760 
especially since it can hold the DSLR
camera<00:01:24.900> if<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.020> didn't<00:01:25.170> have<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> tripod<00:01:25.530> you

camera if you didn't have a tripod you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.380 
camera if you didn't have a tripod you

windy day I probably heard some handling
noise<00:01:40.979> as<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.250> screw<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.150> once<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.689> get

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
noise as I screw this in but once I get

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.710 
noise as I screw this in but once I get
that<00:01:42.960> down<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.670> lock<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:44.970> there's<00:01:45.329> nothing

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
oh here it is okay so we're just gonna

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.410 
oh here it is okay so we're just gonna
record<00:02:12.960> with<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:14.040> iPod<00:02:14.400> Touch<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.910> just

record with the iPod Touch and just

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.180 
record with the iPod Touch and just
record<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.960> voice<00:02:16.110> memo<00:02:16.350> see<00:02:16.590> if<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.070> an

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
record the voice memo see if this is an

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.640 
record the voice memo see if this is an
alternative<00:02:17.690> fresh<00:02:18.690> sound<00:02:18.990> okay<00:02:19.380> so<00:02:19.440> we're

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
alternative fresh sound okay so we're

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.410 
alternative fresh sound okay so we're
recording<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.310> obviously<00:02:21.150> we're<00:02:21.270> probably

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
recording and obviously we're probably

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.180 
recording and obviously we're probably
gonna<00:02:21.600> be<00:02:21.690> hearing<00:02:21.870> some<00:02:22.080> wind<00:02:22.320> hitting<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
gonna be hearing some wind hitting the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.490 
gonna be hearing some wind hitting the
mic<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:23.610> what<00:02:23.760> I'll<00:02:23.880> do<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.240> I'll<00:02:25.110> just<00:02:25.290> slide

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
mic so what I'll do is I'll just slide

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.390 
mic so what I'll do is I'll just slide
it<00:02:25.620> back<00:02:25.740> into<00:02:25.920> my<00:02:25.980> pocket<00:02:28.040> all<00:02:29.040> right<00:02:29.220> so

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
it back into my pocket all right so

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.500 
it back into my pocket all right so
we're<00:02:29.520> doing<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.730> test<00:02:29.940> now<00:02:30.090> now<00:02:30.360> we're

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
we're doing the test now now we're

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.660 
we're doing the test now now we're
listening<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.230> audio<00:02:31.650> off<00:02:31.800> my<00:02:32.010> iPod<00:02:32.400> Touch

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
listening to the audio off my iPod Touch

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.880 
listening to the audio off my iPod Touch
so<00:02:33.090> this<00:02:33.720> is<00:02:33.840> another<00:02:33.990> little<00:02:34.170> example<00:02:34.740> just

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
so this is another little example just

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.990 
so this is another little example just
to<00:02:34.980> see<00:02:35.100> what<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.310> sounds<00:02:35.580> like<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.790> have<00:02:35.820> no

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000

idea<00:02:36.150> I've<00:02:36.360> never<00:02:36.540> actually<00:02:36.750> tried<00:02:37.170> this<00:02:37.350> out

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
idea I've never actually tried this out

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.130 
idea I've never actually tried this out
as<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.370> option<00:02:39.030> for<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.240> microphone<00:02:39.660> I've<00:02:39.900> heard

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140
