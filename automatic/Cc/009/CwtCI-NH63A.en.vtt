00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
by the title this is a call of duty

by the title this is a call of duty
black<00:00:08.400> ops<00:00:08.880> 2<00:00:09.860> glitch<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.160> what<00:00:11.700> this<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:11.910> is

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
black ops 2 glitch and what this is is

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.089 
black ops 2 glitch and what this is is
basically<00:00:12.420> it's<00:00:13.259> sort<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.590> like<00:00:13.799> it's

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
basically it's sort of like it's

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.460 
basically it's sort of like it's
basically<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:16.910> invincibility<00:00:17.910> but<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:18.840> not

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
basically a invincibility but it's not

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.359 
basically a invincibility but it's not
that<00:00:19.770> because<00:00:20.449> you<00:00:21.449> can<00:00:21.600> still<00:00:21.810> die<00:00:21.990> but<00:00:22.740> as

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
that because you can still die but as

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.089 
that because you can still die but as
you<00:00:23.880> can<00:00:24.000> see<00:00:24.210> right<00:00:24.600> there<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.500> was<00:00:25.740> really

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
you can see right there it was really

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.550 
you can see right there it was really
you<00:00:27.000> have<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.300> get<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.779> edge<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
you have to get on the edge and the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.009 
you have to get on the edge and the
zombies<00:00:28.769> think<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.670> you're<00:00:29.820> off<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.179> map<00:00:30.449> so

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
zombies think that you're off the map so

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.020 
zombies think that you're off the map so
they'll<00:00:31.230> just<00:00:31.560> stay<00:00:31.859> stuck<00:00:32.189> on<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.669> bridge

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
they'll just stay stuck on that bridge

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.770 
they'll just stay stuck on that bridge
and<00:00:33.420> if<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.530> fast<00:00:34.800> forward<00:00:35.190> actually<00:00:35.610> because<00:00:36.570> I

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
and if I fast forward actually because I

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.229 
and if I fast forward actually because I
actually<00:00:36.960> mess<00:00:37.559> up<00:00:39.770> at<00:00:40.770> some<00:00:41.610> point<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.149> this

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
actually mess up at some point in this

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.520 
actually mess up at some point in this
video<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.629> mess<00:00:42.930> up<00:00:43.820> yeah<00:00:46.039> it's<00:00:47.039> lagging<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.520> bit

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
video I mess up yeah it's lagging a bit

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.189 
video I mess up yeah it's lagging a bit
actually<00:00:49.530> like<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.039> quite<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> bit<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:50.820> um<00:00:51.199> yeah

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
actually like in quite a bit but um yeah

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.459 
actually like in quite a bit but um yeah
so<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:53.760> thing<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.090> about<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.600> glitch<00:00:55.170> is

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
so the thing is about this glitch is

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.220 
so the thing is about this glitch is
that<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:57.210> can<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:57.660> other<00:00:57.809> people<00:00:58.199> too

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
that you can do it with other people too

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.459 
that you can do it with other people too
but<00:00:58.739> they<00:00:58.890> have<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.129> stay<00:00:59.340> behind<00:00:59.399> you<00:01:00.469> guys

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
but they have to stay behind you guys

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.810 
but they have to stay behind you guys
don't<00:01:01.680> know<00:01:01.739> what<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
power room you have to stay between

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.950 
power room you have to stay between
those<00:01:04.409> two<00:01:04.650> little<00:01:04.920> um<00:01:05.330> sticks<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.630> just

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
those two little um sticks that I just

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
shot at and if you have another if

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.120 
shot at and if you have another if
you're<00:01:09.720> clinging<00:01:09.990> split-screen<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
you're clinging split-screen have the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.830 
you're clinging split-screen have the
other<00:01:11.250> person<00:01:11.549> look<00:01:11.729> at<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.420> another

other person look at you and another

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.960 
other person look at you and another
cool<00:01:13.170> thing<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.280> electro<00:01:14.729> box

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
cool thing is that the electro box

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.280 
cool thing is that the electro box
cannot<00:01:16.580> repeat<00:01:17.580> cannot<00:01:18.030> get<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.869> he<00:01:19.170> will

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
cannot repeat cannot get you he will

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.460 
cannot repeat cannot get you he will
just<00:01:19.530> flow<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.159> little<00:01:20.460> lava<00:01:21.420> whole<00:01:22.020> a

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
just flow in that little lava whole a

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.060 
just flow in that little lava whole a
best<00:01:22.890> thing<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.430> looked<00:01:23.700> up<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.180> minute<00:01:24.689> ago<00:01:25.070> but

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
best thing I looked up a minute ago but

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.399 
best thing I looked up a minute ago but
yeah<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:26.909> basically<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.810> invincibility

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
yeah so basically it's invincibility

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.039 
yeah so basically it's invincibility
glitch<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.189> when<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.490> got<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.790> nuke<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.450> felt

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
glitch and when I got that nuke I felt

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.399 
glitch and when I got that nuke I felt
so<00:01:31.259> stupid<00:01:31.619> cuz<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.570> get<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:33.960> far<00:01:34.229> off

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
so stupid cuz you have to get so far off

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.880 
so stupid cuz you have to get so far off
and<00:01:34.680> i'm<00:01:34.770> pretty<00:01:34.979> sure<00:01:35.070> i<00:01:35.100> guess<00:01:35.460> where<00:01:35.820> i<00:01:35.850> die

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
and i'm pretty sure i guess where i die

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.840 
and i'm pretty sure i guess where i die
right<00:01:37.890> here<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.840> think<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:41.360> think<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.420> do<00:01:42.570> die<00:01:42.720> here

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
right here I think I think I do die here

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.280 
right here I think I think I do die here

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
to do the invincibility glitch um sort

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.410 
to do the invincibility glitch um sort
of<00:02:07.060> like<00:02:07.360> inventory<00:02:08.259> which<00:02:08.979> as<00:02:09.700> if<00:02:09.940> I<00:02:10.090> fast

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
of like inventory which as if I fast

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.390 
of like inventory which as if I fast
forward<00:02:11.430> that's<00:02:12.430> right<00:02:12.670> here<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:14.800> can<00:02:15.130> die
