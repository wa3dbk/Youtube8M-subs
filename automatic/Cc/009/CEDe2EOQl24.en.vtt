00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
hi i'm bruce with armada technologies

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:05.900 
hi i'm bruce with armada technologies
and<00:00:05.009> today<00:00:05.069> i<00:00:05.190> want<00:00:05.370> to<00:00:05.400> talk<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.700> you<00:00:05.790> about

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
and today i want to talk to you about

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.670 
and today i want to talk to you about
the<00:00:06.450> question<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:06.960> we<00:00:07.080> really<00:00:07.290> get<00:00:07.379> asked

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
the question that we really get asked

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.129 
the question that we really get asked
the<00:00:07.740> most<00:00:07.799> about<00:00:08.250> which<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.240> how<00:00:09.599> do<00:00:09.660> i<00:00:09.750> find

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
the most about which is how do i find

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.740 
the most about which is how do i find
lost<00:00:10.650> valves<00:00:11.309> so<00:00:11.910> really<00:00:12.210> there's<00:00:12.360> two<00:00:12.420> ways

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
lost valves so really there's two ways

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.940 
lost valves so really there's two ways
to<00:00:12.780> do<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.080> i'll<00:00:13.380> show<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.830> traditional

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
to do it i'll show you the traditional

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.010 
to do it i'll show you the traditional
method<00:00:14.670> first<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.570> then<00:00:15.660> i'm<00:00:15.719> going<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.870> show

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
method first and then i'm going to show

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.420 
method first and then i'm going to show
you<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.170> kind<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.529> tricky<00:00:16.830> one<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:17.310> most

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
you a kind of a tricky one that most

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.519 
you a kind of a tricky one that most
people<00:00:17.760> don't<00:00:17.880> know<00:00:18.090> about<00:00:18.119> that's<00:00:18.750> it's<00:00:19.260> a

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
people don't know about that's it's a

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.200 
people don't know about that's it's a
little<00:00:19.740> bit<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.920> an<00:00:19.980> advanced<00:00:20.369> technique<00:00:20.609> but

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
little bit of an advanced technique but

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.189 
little bit of an advanced technique but
they<00:00:21.390> can<00:00:21.539> appreciate<00:00:21.779> it

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
they can appreciate it

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.679 
they can appreciate it
first<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.980> all<00:00:23.100> these<00:00:23.640> are<00:00:23.939> our<00:00:24.119> locators<00:00:24.570> I'm

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
first of all these are our locators I'm

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.200 
first of all these are our locators I'm
using<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.109> 800<00:00:25.619> d<00:00:25.800> today<00:00:26.130> but<00:00:26.910> these

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
using the 800 d today but these

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.370 
using the 800 d today but these
techniques<00:00:27.689> will<00:00:27.810> work<00:00:27.840> we<00:00:28.050> do<00:00:28.170> with<00:00:28.289> our

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
techniques will work we do with our

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.830 
techniques will work we do with our
three<00:00:28.619> hundred<00:00:28.920> or<00:00:28.949> seventy<00:00:29.519> first<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.570> want<00:00:30.750> to

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
three hundred or seventy first I want to

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.620 
three hundred or seventy first I want to
set<00:00:31.050> up<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.700> transmitter<00:00:32.700> with<00:00:33.090> one

set up the transmitter with one

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.810 
set up the transmitter with one
alligator<00:00:34.079> clip<00:00:34.380> going<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.190> station<00:00:35.460> wire

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
alligator clip going to the station wire

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.170 
alligator clip going to the station wire
that<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.079> valve<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.610> connected<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.090> that

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
that the valve is the connected to that

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.119 
that the valve is the connected to that
I<00:00:39.239> want<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.450> find<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.350> other<00:00:40.379> one<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.920> black

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
I want to find the other one the black

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.410 
I want to find the other one the black
one<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.520> going<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.670> go<00:00:41.820> out<00:00:41.940> here<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
one is going to go out here to the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.930 
one is going to go out here to the
ground<00:00:42.629> stake<00:00:42.960> we've<00:00:43.200> got<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.649> dirt

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
ground stake we've got that in the dirt

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.790 
ground stake we've got that in the dirt
once<00:00:44.940> I've<00:00:45.120> got<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.570> I'm<00:00:46.440> going<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.649> have

once I've got that on I'm going to have

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.760 
once I've got that on I'm going to have
the<00:00:46.950> receiver<00:00:47.760> turned<00:00:48.120> out<00:00:48.239> as<00:00:48.390> well<00:00:48.739> when<00:00:49.739> I

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
the receiver turned out as well when I

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.569 
the receiver turned out as well when I
turn<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.280> transmitter<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:52.399> want<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.460> make

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
turn on the transmitter I want to make

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.950 
turn on the transmitter I want to make
sure<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.910> needle<00:00:54.239> out<00:00:54.360> here<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.629> analog

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
sure the needle out here the analog

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.060 
sure the needle out here the analog
needle<00:00:55.289> goes<00:00:55.620> at<00:00:55.829> least<00:00:56.660> above<00:00:57.660> four<00:00:58.109> but<00:00:58.890> that

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
needle goes at least above four but that

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.330 
needle goes at least above four but that
fat<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.520> know<00:00:59.640> I've<00:00:59.760> got<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> good<00:01:00.090> ground<00:01:00.300> and

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
fat I know I've got a good ground and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.119 
fat I know I've got a good ground and
I'm<00:01:02.340> going<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.520> start<00:01:02.699> tracking<00:01:02.879> wire<00:01:04.070> now<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
I'm going to start tracking wire now the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.670 
I'm going to start tracking wire now the
receiver<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.000> null<00:01:06.240> mode<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
receiver is in the null mode and the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.920 
receiver is in the null mode and the
null<00:01:07.890> mode<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.369> lack<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.150> signal<00:01:09.659> over<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
null mode is lack of signal over the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.270 
null mode is lack of signal over the
cable<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.500> see<00:01:10.740> when<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.860> go<00:01:11.010> over<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
cable so you can see when I go over the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.469 
cable so you can see when I go over the
cable<00:01:11.490> I'm<00:01:12.420> not<00:01:12.689> getting<00:01:12.930> any<00:01:13.080> signal<00:01:14.479> what

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
cable I'm not getting any signal what

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.940 
cable I'm not getting any signal what
I'm<00:01:15.570> looking<00:01:15.930> for<00:01:16.170> when<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.350> hit<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.530> valve

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
I'm looking for when I hit that valve

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.490 
I'm looking for when I hit that valve
box<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:18.150> an<00:01:18.360> increase<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.049> signal<00:01:19.409> or

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
box is an increase in the signal or

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.149 
box is an increase in the signal or
volume<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:20.909> I'll<00:01:21.060> lose<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.509> metal<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.159> this

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
volume and I'll lose that metal so this

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.850 
volume and I'll lose that metal so this
is<00:01:23.310> not<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:24.170> not<00:01:25.170> cheating<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.650> little<00:01:25.680> bit

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
is not it not cheating a little bit

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.749 
is not it not cheating a little bit
because<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.130> know<00:01:26.189> where<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.460> wire<00:01:26.700> goes

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.710 

we're<00:01:32.759> going<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:32.970> see<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.210> get<00:01:33.329> louder<00:01:33.570> and

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
we're going to see we get louder and

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.630 
we're going to see we get louder and
I've<00:01:33.930> also<00:01:34.110> lost<00:01:34.350> my<00:01:34.590> goal<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.250> about

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
I've also lost my goal this is about

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.940 
I've also lost my goal this is about
that<00:01:35.909> be<00:01:36.000> looking<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:37.229> about<00:01:37.470> every<00:01:37.710> six

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
that be looking for that about every six

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.800 
that be looking for that about every six
inches<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.369> dirt<00:01:38.579> we<00:01:39.240> still<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.659> same

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
inches of dirt we still do the same

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.330 
inches of dirt we still do the same
signal<00:01:40.229> but<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.470> wouldn't<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.979> you'd<00:01:41.159> know

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
signal but you wouldn't that you'd know

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.039 
signal but you wouldn't that you'd know
where<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.640> now<00:01:41.790> Mike<00:01:42.030> says<00:01:42.240> I'm<00:01:42.810> gonna<00:01:42.930> go

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
where that now Mike says I'm gonna go

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.749 
where that now Mike says I'm gonna go
back<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.680> verify<00:01:43.890> them<00:01:44.250> turn<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.579> down<00:01:44.700> a

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
back just to verify them turn it down a

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.109 
back just to verify them turn it down a
little<00:01:45.060> bit<00:01:45.979> it's<00:01:46.979> getting<00:01:47.220> light<00:01:47.579> signal<00:01:48.030> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
little bit it's getting light signal and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.539 
little bit it's getting light signal and
when<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.299> go<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.630> box<00:01:49.159> you<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.310> hear<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
when I go to that box you can hear the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.090 
when I go to that box you can hear the
difference<00:01:50.820> in<00:01:50.909> volume<00:01:51.060> at<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.479> bottom

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.110 

the<00:01:55.100> second<00:01:55.550> method<00:01:55.670> that<00:01:55.850> we're<00:01:55.970> going<00:01:56.060> to

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
the second method that we're going to

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.020 
the second method that we're going to
use<00:01:56.740> it's<00:01:57.740> a<00:01:57.830> little<00:01:58.040> advanced<00:01:58.340> but<00:01:58.640> basically

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
use it's a little advanced but basically

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
use it's a little advanced but basically
what<00:01:59.180> we're<00:01:59.270> going<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.420> do<00:01:59.630> is<00:01:59.750> going<00:01:59.870> to<00:01:59.930> take

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
what we're going to do is going to take

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.590 
what we're going to do is going to take
the<00:02:00.350> black<00:02:00.800> lead<00:02:01.100> off<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.430> ground<00:02:01.670> stake<00:02:01.940> and

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
the black lead off the ground stake and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.690 
the black lead off the ground stake and
I'm<00:02:02.690> going<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.900> connect<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.320> to<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.950> common

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
I'm going to connect it to the common

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.030 
I'm going to connect it to the common
wire<00:02:04.930> that<00:02:05.930> goes<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.440> solenoid<00:02:06.860> that

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
wire that goes to the solenoid that

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.160 
wire that goes to the solenoid that
we're<00:02:07.160> already<00:02:07.370> connected<00:02:07.820> to<00:02:07.880> what<00:02:08.780> happens

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
we're already connected to what happens

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.010 
we're already connected to what happens
then<00:02:09.410> is<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:10.640> wire<00:02:10.970> path<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:11.690> we<00:02:11.810> found

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
then is the wire path that we found

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.900 
then is the wire path that we found
before<00:02:12.290> is<00:02:12.680> going<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:12.920> remain<00:02:13.160> silent

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
before is going to remain silent

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.610 
before is going to remain silent
basically<00:02:14.540> those<00:02:14.690> two<00:02:14.900> wires<00:02:15.110> run<00:02:15.440> together

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
basically those two wires run together

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.290 
basically those two wires run together
they<00:02:16.070> cancel<00:02:16.490> each<00:02:16.580> other<00:02:16.700> out

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
they cancel each other out

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.180 
they cancel each other out
but<00:02:17.690> when<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:17.840> get<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.260> valve<00:02:18.530> box<00:02:18.830> we're

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
but when I get to the valve box we're

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.130 
but when I get to the valve box we're
still<00:02:19.430> going<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.640> have<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:19.880> signal<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:20.930> in

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
still going to have that signal so in

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.600 
still going to have that signal so in
essence<00:02:21.530> we're<00:02:21.620> going<00:02:21.740> to<00:02:21.800> have<00:02:21.920> no<00:02:22.100> signal<00:02:22.460> to

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
essence we're going to have no signal to

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.910 
essence we're going to have no signal to
the<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.600> target<00:02:23.810> when<00:02:24.590> we<00:02:24.650> get<00:02:24.770> to<00:02:24.860> the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
the to the the target when we get to the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.170 
the to the the target when we get to the
target<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.250> be<00:02:25.310> loud<00:02:25.520> there<00:02:25.850> won't<00:02:25.970> be<00:02:26.030> any

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
target to be loud there won't be any

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.000 
target to be loud there won't be any
ambiguity<00:02:26.360> as<00:02:26.840> far<00:02:27.050> as<00:02:27.170> where<00:02:27.350> our<00:02:27.530> valve<00:02:27.740> box

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
ambiguity as far as where our valve box

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.340 
ambiguity as far as where our valve box
is<00:02:28.370> so<00:02:29.300> we<00:02:29.390> take<00:02:29.570> our<00:02:29.690> receiver<00:02:29.990> just<00:02:30.230> like

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
is so we take our receiver just like

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.860 
is so we take our receiver just like
before<00:02:30.730> you'll<00:02:31.730> notice<00:02:31.940> I've<00:02:32.390> got<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.720> some

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
before you'll notice I've got to some

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.810 
before you'll notice I've got to some
pretty<00:02:33.050> high<00:02:33.140> volume<00:02:33.650> I'm<00:02:34.250> not<00:02:34.430> getting<00:02:34.670> any

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
pretty high volume I'm not getting any

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.400 
pretty high volume I'm not getting any
signal<00:02:35.060> over<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.480> wire<00:02:35.630> that<00:02:35.810> we<00:02:35.930> had<00:02:36.050> signal

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
signal over the wire that we had signal

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.550 
signal over the wire that we had signal
over<00:02:36.560> before<00:02:36.709> right<00:02:37.100> so<00:02:38.110> I'm<00:02:39.110> just<00:02:39.350> showing

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
over before right so I'm just showing

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.870 
over before right so I'm just showing
you<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:39.770> don't<00:02:39.980> have<00:02:40.130> that<00:02:40.310> signal<00:02:40.670> anymore

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
you you don't have that signal anymore

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.699 
you you don't have that signal anymore
do<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.240> guide<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:41.660> there<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:42.470> if<00:02:42.530> you're<00:02:42.620> going

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
do to guide you there so if you're going

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.199 
do to guide you there so if you're going
to<00:02:42.770> use<00:02:43.010> this<00:02:43.160> technique<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.730> do<00:02:43.880> have<00:02:44.090> to

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
to use this technique you do have to

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.750 
to use this technique you do have to
kind<00:02:44.390> of<00:02:44.510> know<00:02:44.570> what<00:02:45.440> area<00:02:45.770> this<00:02:45.920> valve<00:02:46.190> box<00:02:46.459> is

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
kind of know what area this valve box is

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.420 
kind of know what area this valve box is
by<00:02:47.360> either<00:02:47.630> having<00:02:47.930> track<00:02:48.170> beware<00:02:48.530> before<00:02:48.950> or

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
by either having track beware before or

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.949 
by either having track beware before or
just<00:02:49.760> from<00:02:49.850> experience<00:02:49.970> knowing<00:02:50.540> where<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.840> is

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
just from experience knowing where it is

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.390 
just from experience knowing where it is
I'm<00:02:51.200> cheating<00:02:51.770> a<00:02:51.830> little<00:02:51.860> bit<00:02:52.040> because<00:02:52.160> I

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
I'm cheating a little bit because I

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.710 
I'm cheating a little bit because I
already<00:02:52.520> know<00:02:52.700> where<00:02:52.850> this<00:02:52.910> valve<00:02:53.120> box<00:02:53.300> is<00:02:53.510> but

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
already know where this valve box is but

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.760 
already know where this valve box is but
watch<00:02:53.870> what<00:02:54.050> happens<00:02:54.350> when<00:02:54.440> we<00:02:54.500> go<00:02:54.620> in<00:02:54.709> this

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
watch what happens when we go in this

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.160 
watch what happens when we go in this
valve<00:02:55.010> on<00:02:55.420> again<00:02:56.420> no<00:02:56.600> wire<00:02:56.840> signal<00:02:58.870> valve<00:02:59.870> box

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
valve on again no wire signal valve box

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.170 
valve on again no wire signal valve box
I<00:03:00.820> got<00:03:01.820> a<00:03:01.850> little<00:03:02.000> signal<00:03:02.269> back<00:03:02.570> here

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
I got a little signal back here

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.000 
I got a little signal back here
get<00:03:04.420> rid<00:03:04.599> of<00:03:04.629> that<00:03:04.689> pretty<00:03:05.019> I<00:03:05.349> put<00:03:05.680> it<00:03:05.799> down

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
get rid of that pretty I put it down

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.050 
get rid of that pretty I put it down
okay<00:03:09.010> forget<00:03:09.879> it

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
okay forget it

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.240 
okay forget it
six<00:03:10.420> feet<00:03:10.599> it<00:03:10.750> sits<00:03:11.049> into<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.409> plastic<00:03:11.890> speedo

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
six feet it sits into the plastic speedo

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.309 
six feet it sits into the plastic speedo
put<00:03:12.489> fix<00:03:13.150> it<00:03:13.299> to<00:03:13.390> the<00:03:13.420> dirt<00:03:13.720> on<00:03:13.870> top<00:03:14.079> of<00:03:14.230> that

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
put fix it to the dirt on top of that

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.679 
put fix it to the dirt on top of that
belt<00:03:14.590> box<00:03:14.890> I'm<00:03:15.730> going<00:03:15.879> to<00:03:15.939> know<00:03:16.030> exactly<00:03:16.150> where

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:16.689 
belt box I'm going to know exactly where

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:17.940 
belt box I'm going to know exactly where
it<00:03:16.780> is<00:03:16.900> I'm<00:03:17.079> not<00:03:17.110> going<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.379> be<00:03:17.439> confused<00:03:17.860> by

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
it is I'm not going to be confused by

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.580 
it is I'm not going to be confused by
wire<00:03:18.220> before<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.790> or<00:03:19.329> after<00:03:19.360> it<00:03:19.930> just<00:03:20.439> that
