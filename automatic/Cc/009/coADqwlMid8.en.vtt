00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
there too but I was too scared to go up

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.100 
there too but I was too scared to go up
because<00:03:11.190> he<00:03:11.760> has<00:03:11.880> you<00:03:12.720> know<00:03:12.840> all<00:03:12.990> the

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
because he has you know all the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.230 
because he has you know all the
advantage<00:03:13.590> that's<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.220> good<00:03:14.370> strategy<00:03:14.670> for

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
advantage that's a good strategy for

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.870 
advantage that's a good strategy for
this<00:03:16.110> map<00:03:16.380> to<00:03:16.680> just<00:03:16.920> patrol<00:03:17.310> around<00:03:17.400> these

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
this map to just patrol around these

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.670 
this map to just patrol around these
areas<00:03:18.210> and<00:03:18.540> stuff<00:03:18.660> like<00:03:19.020> keep<00:03:19.230> going<00:03:19.470> back<00:03:19.620> and

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
areas and stuff like keep going back and

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.250 
areas and stuff like keep going back and
forth<00:03:20.160> through<00:03:20.220> here<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.750> other<00:03:21.900> side

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
forth through here and the other side

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.860 
forth through here and the other side
but<00:03:22.740> the<00:03:23.520> one<00:03:23.730> bad<00:03:24.090> thing<00:03:24.120> or<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.720> one

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
but the one bad thing or the one

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.080 
but the one bad thing or the one
weakness<00:03:25.290> of<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:25.800> strategy<00:03:26.100> is<00:03:26.460> that<00:03:26.760> people

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
weakness of this strategy is that people

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.690 
weakness of this strategy is that people
could<00:03:27.240> be<00:03:27.360> up<00:03:27.510> there<00:03:28.160> where<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.190> got<00:03:29.459> killed

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
could be up there where I got killed

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.650 
could be up there where I got killed
just<00:03:30.060> like<00:03:30.180> that<00:03:30.390> guy<00:03:30.570> killed<00:03:30.930> me

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.200 

there<00:03:35.660> he<00:03:35.750> goes<00:03:35.930> again<00:03:36.110> I<00:03:36.560> ain't<00:03:36.940> people<00:03:37.940> just

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.210 
there he goes again I ain't people just

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:47.170 
there he goes again I ain't people just
go<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:39.350> same<00:03:39.620> spot<00:03:39.890> ah<00:03:45.880> I'm<00:03:46.880> a<00:03:46.940> thing<00:03:47.150> that

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
go to the same spot ah I'm a thing that

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.430 
go to the same spot ah I'm a thing that
would<00:03:47.360> have<00:03:47.450> been<00:03:47.510> a<00:03:47.570> quad<00:03:47.840> fee<00:03:48.050> but<00:03:48.200> that<00:03:48.320> was

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
would have been a quad fee but that was

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:57.640 
would have been a quad fee but that was
a<00:03:48.500> nice<00:03:48.710> turn<00:03:49.070> on<00:03:49.250> on<00:03:49.430> that<00:03:49.610> guy<00:03:56.650> I'm

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
a nice turn on on that guy I'm

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.170 
a nice turn on on that guy I'm
definitely<00:03:57.890> liking<00:03:58.190> till<00:03:58.550> confirm<00:03:58.910> a<00:03:58.940> lot

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
definitely liking till confirm a lot

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.449 
definitely liking till confirm a lot
more<00:03:59.360> for<00:03:59.840> the<00:03:59.960> series<00:04:03.130> just<00:04:04.130> because<00:04:04.280> i<00:04:04.400> know
