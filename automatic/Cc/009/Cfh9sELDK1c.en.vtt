00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
classes over the last 10 years so why

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.329

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
and I think this year compound Lee I'm

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.160 
and I think this year compound Lee I'm
up<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.340> thirty<00:02:17.550> eight<00:02:17.790> percent<00:02:17.819> on<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.989> which

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
up to thirty eight percent on that which

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.449 
up to thirty eight percent on that which
is<00:02:19.290> pretty<00:02:19.500> good<00:02:19.769> I<00:02:19.920> mean<00:02:20.040> I'm<00:02:20.129> quite<00:02:20.340> happy

doesn't matter it's an investment class

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.449 
doesn't matter it's an investment class
for<00:02:39.209> me<00:02:39.390> so<00:02:39.569> you<00:02:40.410> mentioned<00:02:40.739> Bordeaux<00:02:41.250> I'd

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
for me so you mentioned Bordeaux I'd

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.740 
for me so you mentioned Bordeaux I'd
like<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.760> go<00:02:41.849> to<00:02:41.910> Bordeaux<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.390> taste<00:02:42.660> the

like to go to Bordeaux and taste the
wise<00:02:42.959> but<00:02:43.170> I'm<00:02:43.319> not<00:02:43.500> sure<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.769> I<00:02:44.099> could<00:02:44.340> rely

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
wise but I'm not sure that I could rely

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.130 
wise but I'm not sure that I could rely
on<00:02:44.610> my<00:02:44.819> palate<00:02:45.239> enough<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.660> tell<00:02:45.840> me<00:02:45.870> whether

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
on my palate enough to tell me whether

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.289 
on my palate enough to tell me whether
or<00:02:46.230> not<00:02:46.349> I'm<00:02:46.709> invested<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.370> right<00:02:47.519> ones<00:02:47.760> so

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
or not I'm invested in the right ones so

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.729 
or not I'm invested in the right ones so
for<00:02:48.480> me<00:02:48.599> I'm<00:02:48.690> far<00:02:48.930> more<00:02:48.959> about<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.440> figures

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
for me I'm far more about the figures

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.069 
for me I'm far more about the figures
far<00:02:50.010> more<00:02:50.190> about<00:02:50.489> compound<00:02:51.299> Lee<00:02:51.569> if<00:02:51.750> it's<00:02:51.870> made

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
far more about compound Lee if it's made

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.949 
far more about compound Lee if it's made
I<00:02:52.290> think<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:52.739> think<00:02:53.130> live<00:02:53.790> x<00:02:54.000> has<00:02:54.150> made<00:02:54.360> twelve

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
I think I think live x has made twelve

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.750 
I think I think live x has made twelve
point<00:02:55.200> five<00:02:55.260> percent<00:02:55.829> over<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.099> last<00:02:56.160> 24

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
point five percent over the last 24

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.449 
point five percent over the last 24
years<00:02:56.790> compound<00:02:57.660> now<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.410> beats<00:02:58.860> virtually

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
years compound now that beats virtually

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.630 
years compound now that beats virtually
everything<00:02:59.910> including<00:03:00.599> gold<00:03:00.870> including<00:03:01.440> oil

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
everything including gold including oil

our<00:04:36.670> honesty<00:04:37.090> thing<00:04:37.270> I<00:04:37.510> tasted<00:04:38.050> the<00:04:38.140> yesterday

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
our honesty thing I tasted the yesterday

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.590 
our honesty thing I tasted the yesterday
it<00:04:38.590> was<00:04:38.710> definitely<00:04:39.010> the<00:04:39.820> best<00:04:40.000> wine<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:40.270> think

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
it was definitely the best wine I think

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.750 
it was definitely the best wine I think
I've<00:04:40.690> ever<00:04:40.720> tasted<00:04:41.050> in<00:04:41.260> my<00:04:41.350> life<00:04:41.470> and<00:04:41.980> I<00:04:42.520> think

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
I've ever tasted in my life and I think

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.130 
I've ever tasted in my life and I think
that<00:04:42.910> it's<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.240> only<00:04:43.420> way<00:04:43.510> just<00:04:43.780> leading<00:04:43.960> to

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
that it's the only way just leading to

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.210 
that it's the only way just leading to
an<00:04:44.230> invitation<00:04:44.800> because<00:04:44.890> it<00:04:45.010> certainly

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
an invitation because it certainly

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.830 
an invitation because it certainly
sounds<00:04:45.610> like<00:04:45.700> I<00:04:45.790> hope<00:04:46.000> its<00:04:46.240> leading<00:04:46.450> towards

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
sounds like I hope its leading towards

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.450 
sounds like I hope its leading towards
an<00:04:46.900> invitation<00:04:47.440> well<00:04:47.710> it<00:04:47.830> is<00:04:48.010> it<00:04:48.190> because<00:04:48.340> it's

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
an invitation well it is it because it's

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.530 
an invitation well it is it because it's
the<00:04:48.550> only<00:04:48.580> way<00:04:48.820> I<00:04:48.850> think<00:04:48.970> I<00:04:49.150> can<00:04:49.300> drink<00:04:49.510> the

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
thought about that putting money into a

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.840 
thought about that putting money into a
fund<00:05:40.240> and<00:05:40.690> then<00:05:40.810> then<00:05:41.650> trying<00:05:41.860> to<00:05:41.920> use<00:05:42.190> the<00:05:42.220> the

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
fund and then then trying to use the the

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.240 
fund and then then trying to use the the
veneks<00:05:43.060> model<00:05:43.420> to<00:05:44.200> to<00:05:44.530> create<00:05:44.800> returns<00:05:45.070> that

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
veneks model to to create returns that

veneks model to to create returns that
way<00:05:45.370> I<00:05:45.550> think<00:05:45.880> we<00:05:46.000> can<00:05:46.120> construct<00:05:46.990> a<00:05:47.290> funder<00:05:47.740> is

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
way I think we can construct a funder is

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:51.990 
way I think we can construct a funder is
free<00:05:48.280> of<00:05:48.370> iht<00:05:48.640> and<00:05:49.180> capital<00:05:50.050> gains<00:05:50.080> and<00:05:51.000> you

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
free of iht and capital gains and you

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.910 
free of iht and capital gains and you
don't<00:05:52.180> have<00:05:52.390> to<00:05:52.570> own<00:05:52.750> specific<00:05:53.380> wise<00:05:53.590> then

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 
don't have to own specific wise then

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.140 
don't have to own specific wise then
it's<00:05:54.070> definitely<00:05:54.430> going<00:05:54.520> to<00:05:54.580> be<00:05:54.670> a<00:05:54.730> successor

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
it's definitely going to be a successor

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.030 
it's definitely going to be a successor
that's<00:05:55.390> one<00:05:55.600> for<00:05:55.810> a<00:05:55.840> discussion<00:05:56.500> with<00:05:56.680> the<00:05:56.830> tax

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
that's one for a discussion with the tax

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.850 
that's one for a discussion with the tax
