rid<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:41.220> by<00:01:41.369> using<00:01:41.400> salt<00:01:42.210> artfully<00:01:42.899> you

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
rid of it but by using salt artfully you

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.749 
rid of it but by using salt artfully you
can<00:01:43.229> actually<00:01:43.409> control<00:01:44.070> those<00:01:44.280> flavors<00:01:44.729> a

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
can actually control those flavors a

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.850 
can actually control those flavors a
little<00:01:44.939> bit<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> trick<00:01:45.720> isn't<00:01:46.259> using<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
little bit the trick isn't using the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.530 
little bit the trick isn't using the
right<00:01:47.009> kind<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.430> salt<00:01:47.729> which<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.390> something

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
right kind of salt which is something

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.450 
right kind of salt which is something
that<00:01:48.659> kind<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.930> confuses<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> lot<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.950> Americans

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
that kind of confuses a lot of Americans

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.490 
that kind of confuses a lot of Americans
still<00:01:50.700> hold<00:01:51.299> on<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> second<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:51.930> isn't<00:01:52.290> saw

still hold on a second but isn't saw

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.280 
still hold on a second but isn't saw
just<00:01:52.860> saw<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.520> lot<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.000> folks<00:01:54.270> still<00:01:54.540> use<00:01:54.840> what<00:01:55.259> I

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
just saw a lot of folks still use what I

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.630 
just saw a lot of folks still use what I
just<00:01:55.530> call<00:01:55.740> table<00:01:56.579> salt<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.810> deny<00:01:58.229> salt<00:01:58.680> shaker

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
just call table salt I deny salt shaker

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.030 
just call table salt I deny salt shaker
salt<00:02:00.270> which<00:02:00.719> comes<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.649> look<00:02:01.799> at<00:02:01.920> it

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
salt which comes in if you look at it

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.200 
salt which comes in if you look at it
under<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.219> microscope<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.820> see<00:02:02.939> these<00:02:03.060> little

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
under a microscope you see these little

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.420 
under a microscope you see these little
bitty<00:02:03.420> cubes<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.380> very<00:02:04.829> small<00:02:05.219> very

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
bitty cubes like this very small very

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.850 
bitty cubes like this very small very
uniform<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.240> because<00:02:06.570> their<00:02:06.750> uniform<00:02:07.290> they

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
uniform and because their uniform they

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.109 
uniform and because their uniform they
have<00:02:07.979> some<00:02:08.129> interesting<00:02:08.310> characteristics

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
have some interesting characteristics

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.969 
have some interesting characteristics
that<00:02:09.179> are<00:02:09.360> not<00:02:09.539> very<00:02:09.780> good<00:02:09.959> for<00:02:09.989> cooking<00:02:10.500> one

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
that are not very good for cooking one

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.220 
that are not very good for cooking one
they're<00:02:11.430> very<00:02:11.520> hard<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.819> pinch<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.510> sprinkle

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
they're very hard to pinch and sprinkle

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.820 
they're very hard to pinch and sprinkle
because<00:02:13.470> they<00:02:13.560> just

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
because they just

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.900 
because they just
all<00:02:13.950> through<00:02:14.160> your<00:02:14.280> fingers<00:02:14.640> they<00:02:14.760> don't

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
all through your fingers they don't

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.020 
all through your fingers they don't
stick<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.750> food<00:02:15.990> very<00:02:16.410> well<00:02:16.680> at<00:02:16.980> all<00:02:17.030> and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
stick to food very well at all and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.790 
stick to food very well at all and
because<00:02:18.510> their<00:02:18.660> uniform<00:02:19.170> they<00:02:19.350> dissolve<00:02:19.650> at

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
because their uniform they dissolve at

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.890 
because their uniform they dissolve at
the<00:02:19.890> same<00:02:20.100> rate<00:02:20.130> creating<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.940> harsh<00:02:21.210> taste<00:02:21.570> and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
the same rate creating a harsh taste and

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.540 
the same rate creating a harsh taste and
because<00:02:22.560> they're<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:22.860> small<00:02:23.100> they<00:02:23.280> tend<00:02:23.490> to

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
because they're so small they tend to

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.010 
because they're so small they tend to
clump<00:02:23.820> together<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.570> that<00:02:24.660> means<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.930> have

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
clump together and that means you have

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.230 
clump together and that means you have
to<00:02:25.200> have<00:02:25.320> anti<00:02:25.830> clumping<00:02:26.220> chemicals<00:02:26.730> packed

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
to have anti clumping chemicals packed

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.870 
to have anti clumping chemicals packed
with<00:02:27.390> them<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.720> keep<00:02:27.900> them<00:02:28.310> working<00:02:29.310> for<00:02:29.790> you

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
with them to keep them working for you

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.430 
with them to keep them working for you
and<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.120> don't<00:02:30.450> like<00:02:30.540> any<00:02:30.750> of<00:02:30.780> those<00:02:30.900> attributes

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
and I don't like any of those attributes

and I don't like any of those attributes

salt koshering salt of course comes out

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.600 
salt koshering salt of course comes out
of<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.660> tradition<00:02:37.020> of<00:02:37.080> koshering<00:02:37.590> meet<00:02:38.100> by

of the tradition of koshering meet by

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.730 
of the tradition of koshering meet by
putting<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.180> salt<00:02:39.750> on<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:39.990> outside<00:02:40.320> of<00:02:40.350> me<00:02:40.560> to

putting a salt on the outside of me to

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.920 
putting a salt on the outside of me to
draw<00:02:40.950> out<00:02:41.190> blood<00:02:41.820> it's<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.150> very<00:02:42.330> old<00:02:42.390> process

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
draw out blood it's a very old process

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.600 
draw out blood it's a very old process
and<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.530> salt<00:02:43.800> that<00:02:43.950> was<00:02:44.070> used<00:02:44.280> well<00:02:44.490> it's

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
and the salt that was used well it's

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.450 
and the salt that was used well it's
like<00:02:44.760> this<00:02:45.030> it's<00:02:45.300> very<00:02:45.570> very<00:02:45.930> flaky<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.100> very

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
like this it's very very flaky and very

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.460 
like this it's very very flaky and very
sticky<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.450> see<00:02:48.630> my<00:02:48.750> fingers<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.200> can<00:02:49.290> see<00:02:49.440> I

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
sticky you see my fingers you can see I

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.680 
sticky you see my fingers you can see I
got<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.920> salt<00:02:50.160> stuck<00:02:50.520> all<00:02:50.760> over<00:02:50.790> them<00:02:51.240> oh<00:02:51.420> that

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
got the salt stuck all over them oh that

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.720 
got the salt stuck all over them oh that
wait<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.080> minute<00:02:52.380> I<00:02:52.470> thought<00:02:52.740> kosher<00:02:53.280> salt<00:02:53.490> was

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
wait a minute I thought kosher salt was

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.550 
wait a minute I thought kosher salt was
usually<00:02:54.150> used<00:02:54.300> for<00:02:54.390> cooking<00:02:54.750> savory<00:02:55.350> meals

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
usually used for cooking savory meals

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.590 
usually used for cooking savory meals
instead<00:02:55.860> of<00:02:56.040> making<00:02:56.610> dessert<00:02:56.910> well<00:02:57.360> it

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
instead of making dessert well it

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.840 
instead of making dessert well it
certainly<00:02:58.050> is<00:02:58.530> used<00:02:58.830> in<00:02:59.010> savory<00:02:59.520> but<00:02:59.820> I

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
certainly is used in savory but I

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.940 
certainly is used in savory but I
actually<00:03:00.090> use<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:00.810> exclusively<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:01.860> the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
actually use it exclusively it's the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.220 
actually use it exclusively it's the
only<00:03:02.160> salt<00:03:02.430> that<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.820> i<00:03:02.850> use<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.780> i've<00:03:04.050> got<00:03:04.200> a

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
only salt that that i use and i've got a

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.960 
only salt that that i use and i've got a
little<00:03:04.410> explanation<00:03:04.890> here<00:03:05.370> for<00:03:05.580> why<00:03:05.700> my

little explanation here for why my
