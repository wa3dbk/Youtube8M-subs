hey<00:00:01.290> Brett<00:00:01.650> Contreras<00:00:02.070> here<00:00:02.280> I'm<00:00:02.970> going<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.240> go

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
hey Brett Contreras here I'm going to go

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.300 
hey Brett Contreras here I'm going to go
over<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:04.080> wrong<00:00:04.319> way<00:00:04.560> and<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:04.890> right<00:00:05.069> way<00:00:05.130> to

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
over the wrong way and the right way to

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.540 
over the wrong way and the right way to
do<00:00:05.520> rack<00:00:05.759> pulls<00:00:06.060> so<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:07.109> lot<00:00:07.859> of<00:00:07.980> times<00:00:08.160> I'll<00:00:08.309> see

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
do rack pulls so a lot of times I'll see

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.610 
do rack pulls so a lot of times I'll see
a<00:00:08.580> video<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.059> I'll<00:00:09.150> I'll<00:00:09.900> watch<00:00:10.080> someone<00:00:10.469> do

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
a video and I'll I'll watch someone do

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.390 
a video and I'll I'll watch someone do
like<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:10.980> 900-pound<00:00:11.790> rack<00:00:12.090> pole<00:00:12.530> but<00:00:13.530> then<00:00:13.740> you

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
like a 900-pound rack pole but then you

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.980 
like a 900-pound rack pole but then you
know<00:00:14.759> they<00:00:14.940> don't<00:00:15.089> really<00:00:15.330> deadlift<00:00:15.809> nine

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
know they don't really deadlift nine

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.700 
know they don't really deadlift nine
hundred<00:00:16.289> pounds

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
hundred pounds

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.890 
hundred pounds
they<00:00:17.190> can<00:00:17.400> only<00:00:17.520> deadlift<00:00:18.090> say<00:00:18.270> six<00:00:18.600> hundred

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
they can only deadlift say six hundred

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.750 
they can only deadlift say six hundred
pounds<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.380> there's<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.070> 300<00:00:20.609> pound

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
pounds and there's a 300 pound

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.460 
pounds and there's a 300 pound
discrepancy<00:00:21.510> there<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.990> reason<00:00:22.170> why

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
discrepancy there and the reason why

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.580 
discrepancy there and the reason why
that<00:00:22.650> happens<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.310> because<00:00:23.720> they're<00:00:24.720> not

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
that happens is because they're not

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.170 
that happens is because they're not
doing<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.070> rack<00:00:26.250> pull<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.670> same<00:00:26.880> way<00:00:27.029> they

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
doing the rack pull the same way they

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.849 
doing the rack pull the same way they
dint<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.720> kinematics<00:00:28.380> are<00:00:28.529> totally

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
dint of the kinematics are totally

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.519 
dint of the kinematics are totally
different<00:00:29.039> up<00:00:29.699> top<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.420> if<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.289> want<00:00:31.470> to

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
different up top so if you want to

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.670 
different up top so if you want to
maximize<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.669> transfer<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:34.260> wrap<00:00:34.440> pull

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
maximize the transfer of the wrap pull

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.500 
maximize the transfer of the wrap pull
to<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> deadlift<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.610> you're<00:00:36.180> looking<00:00:36.450> to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
to the deadlift and you're looking to

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.569 
to the deadlift and you're looking to
work<00:00:36.660> your<00:00:36.809> posture<00:00:37.020> your<00:00:37.200> chain<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:38.250> need<00:00:38.460> to

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
work your posture your chain you need to

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.510 
work your posture your chain you need to
do<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.850> rack<00:00:39.030> pull<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.390> specific<00:00:39.629> manner<00:00:40.140> so

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
do the rack pull in a specific manner so

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.160 
do the rack pull in a specific manner so
here's<00:00:41.520> what<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.730> see<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> lot<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.180> guys<00:00:42.420> do<00:00:42.629> they

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
here's what I see a lot of guys do they

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.279 
here's what I see a lot of guys do they
will<00:00:43.350> line<00:00:43.559> up<00:00:43.590> far<00:00:44.129> away<00:00:44.399> from<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.760> bar<00:00:44.969> and

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
will line up far away from the bar and

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.139 
will line up far away from the bar and
they<00:00:46.289> will<00:00:46.469> bring<00:00:46.770> their<00:00:46.980> knees<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:48.120> know

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
they will bring their knees you know

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.779 
they will bring their knees you know
close<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.020> bar<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.500> kind<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.190> squat<00:00:50.579> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
close to the bar and kind of squat the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.200 
close to the bar and kind of squat the
weight<00:00:50.940> up<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.500> way<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.489> more<00:00:53.850> quad

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
weight up so this way is a more quad

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.750 
weight up so this way is a more quad
dominant<00:00:54.480> lift<00:00:54.989> they're<00:00:55.860> squatting<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.579> up

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.910 

and<00:00:59.760> then<00:00:59.969> they<00:01:00.090> come<00:01:00.329> down<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.899> stick<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
and then they come down and stick the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.190 
and then they come down and stick the
knees<00:01:02.100> up<00:01:02.690> yeah<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.700> that's<00:01:05.720> not<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.780> good<00:01:07.049> way

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
knees up yeah and that's not a good way

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.929 
knees up yeah and that's not a good way
to<00:01:07.260> do<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.560> wrap<00:01:07.680> pool<00:01:07.950> because<00:01:08.189> as<00:01:08.400> I

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
to do the wrap pool because as I

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.210 
to do the wrap pool because as I
mentioned<00:01:09.299> before<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:10.140> want<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.530> match<00:01:10.770> what

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
mentioned before you want to match what

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.410 
mentioned before you want to match what
it<00:01:11.310> looks<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:11.760> need<00:01:11.880> your<00:01:11.970> real<00:01:12.180> depth

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
it looks like we need your real depth

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.899 
it looks like we need your real depth
when<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.720> do<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.869> real<00:01:13.110> deadlift<00:01:13.530> as<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.700> get

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
when you do a real deadlift as you get

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.929 
when you do a real deadlift as you get
right<00:01:15.150> here<00:01:15.799> your<00:01:16.799> knees<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.640> already

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
right here your knees have already

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.390 
right here your knees have already
extended<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:19.439> more<00:01:19.680> straight<00:01:20.130> legged

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
extended and it's more straight legged

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.800 
extended and it's more straight legged
right<00:01:20.700> here<00:01:20.850> right<00:01:21.000> here<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.540> pushing

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
right here right here it's just pushing

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.780 
right here right here it's just pushing
the<00:01:22.020> hips<00:01:22.140> forward<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.560> if<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.549> want<00:01:23.729> to

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
the hips forward so if you want to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.840 
the hips forward so if you want to
maximize<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:25.080> transfer<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:26.159> need<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.460> almost

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
maximize the transfer you need to almost

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.300 
maximize the transfer you need to almost
think<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.330> like<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.540> partial<00:01:28.439> straight<00:01:29.100> leg

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
think of it like a partial straight leg

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.030 
think of it like a partial straight leg
dead<00:01:29.340> lift<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.630> line<00:01:31.170> up<00:01:31.380> where<00:01:31.650> my<00:01:31.799> knees

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
dead lift so I line up where my knees

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.719 
dead lift so I line up where my knees
are<00:01:32.220> almost<00:01:32.430> touching<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.909> bar<00:01:33.229> and<00:01:34.729> then

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
are almost touching the bar and then

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.780 
are almost touching the bar and then
from<00:01:35.939> here

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.640 

so<00:01:41.790> it'll<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.510> a<00:01:42.600> little<00:01:42.750> bit<00:01:42.869> easier<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.560> see

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
so it'll be a little bit easier to see

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.880 
so it'll be a little bit easier to see
from<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> side<00:01:44.130> view<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.560> I'm<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.799> show

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
from the side view so I'm going to show

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.219 
from the side view so I'm going to show
you<00:01:46.920> from<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> side<00:01:47.490> what<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.700> looks<00:01:48.000> like

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
you from the side what that looks like

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.480 
you from the side what that looks like
okay

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
okay

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.780 
okay
wrong<00:01:50.490> way<00:01:51.470> like<00:01:52.470> up<00:01:52.680> far<00:01:52.979> away<00:01:53.130> from<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.550> bar

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
wrong way like up far away from the bar

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.359 
wrong way like up far away from the bar
so<00:01:54.180> there's<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.509> distance<00:01:54.830> and<00:01:55.830> I<00:01:55.920> push<00:01:56.159> my

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
so there's this distance and I push my

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.499
