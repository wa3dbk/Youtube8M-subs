00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.970
 because you can do ultrasound 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:10.800
 eye examination for 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:15.089
 ultrasound of the eye 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.430
 there are special apples 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.270
 ophthalmic ultrasound 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:26.099
 special scanners are already sound 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:29.119
 devices with special sensors for 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.649
 eyeball research but even on 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:39.110
 conventional ultrasound machine 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:39.110
 having a linear sensor 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:51.199
 high frequency you can see the eye 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:56.699
 an apple and not only an eyeball but also 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:58.170
 the eyeball surrounding the fiber and 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:03.390
 muscles 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:07.640
 and you can see the optic nerve 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:12.510
 the so-called optic tract 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:19.370
 use of ultrasound method 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:23.700
 in case of eye diseases it acquired 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:29.540
 opportunities and great value 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.540
 especially in the last 15 20 years 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.380
 ultrasound method is used to 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:40.860
 diagnosis of damage to the eyeball 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:46.190
 with a decrease in transparency of transparent 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:52.500
 environments of an eye at vascular detachment 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:59.570
 shell when studying the state of the retina 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:02.670
 and also an assessment of the position and size 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.520
 foreign bodies which may not be 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.700
 visible on x-ray a 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.310
 with ultrasound they are 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.940
 determined very, very well 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.260
 so the ultrasound method is now 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.770
 is leading in diagnostics 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:29.090
 eye diseases not only eyes but also 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:33.769
 the orbits that is in those changes that 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:38.750
 occur in the fiber in the muscles that 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.750
 the orbital cavities are located
