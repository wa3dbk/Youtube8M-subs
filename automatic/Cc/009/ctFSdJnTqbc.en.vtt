00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
like able to readjust and kind of move

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.959 
like able to readjust and kind of move
about<00:01:00.269> a<00:01:00.329> lot<00:01:00.660> which<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.289> true<00:01:01.680> it's<00:01:02.460> true<00:01:02.730> if

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969
