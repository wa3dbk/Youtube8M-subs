why is this World Cup being so pivotal

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.190 
why is this World Cup being so pivotal
for<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.669> US<00:00:02.970> and<00:00:03.210> soccer<00:00:03.689> going<00:00:04.049> forward<00:00:04.470> oh

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.140 
for the US and soccer going forward oh
yeah<00:00:07.200> there's<00:00:07.440> no<00:00:07.620> doubt<00:00:07.649> this<00:00:08.340> World<00:00:08.610> Cup<00:00:08.730> is

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
yeah there's no doubt this World Cup is

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.480 
yeah there's no doubt this World Cup is
really<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.690> first<00:00:09.929> time<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.590> have<00:00:10.920> seen<00:00:11.219> or

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
really the first time I have seen or

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.120 
really the first time I have seen or
we've<00:00:11.730> seen<00:00:12.000> here<00:00:12.389> in<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.630> US<00:00:13.080> just<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.980> know

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
we've seen here in the US just you know

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.550 
we've seen here in the US just you know
so<00:00:14.790> much<00:00:15.059> support<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.870> think<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.379> main

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
so much support and I think the main

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.880 
so much support and I think the main
reason<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:17.190> that<00:00:17.220> first<00:00:17.820> off<00:00:18.029> we<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.560> team

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
reason is that first off we have a team

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.580 
reason is that first off we have a team
that<00:00:20.160> actually<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.880> finally<00:00:21.630> decent<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.320> has

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
that actually is finally decent that has

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.650 
that actually is finally decent that has
the<00:00:22.859> opportunity<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.609> potentially<00:00:24.449> be<00:00:24.630> a

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
the opportunity to potentially be a

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.679 
the opportunity to potentially be a
winner<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:26.160> think<00:00:26.580> really<00:00:26.849> what<00:00:27.210> what<00:00:27.570> has

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
winner and I think really what what has

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.689 
winner and I think really what what has
happened<00:00:28.170> over<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.470> last<00:00:28.590> several<00:00:29.070> years<00:00:29.429> is

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
happened over the last several years is

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.600 
happened over the last several years is
that<00:00:29.910> here<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.779> US<00:00:31.109> we<00:00:31.380> finally<00:00:32.099> can<00:00:32.369> watch
