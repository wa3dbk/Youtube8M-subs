searching that temple when I guess it's
a<00:00:45.110> sequel<00:00:45.500> I<00:00:45.650> suppose<00:00:46.280> you<00:00:46.430> could<00:00:46.580> play<00:00:46.790> to

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
a sequel I suppose you could play to

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.030 
a sequel I suppose you could play to
cattle<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.600> every<00:00:48.350> time<00:00:48.500> you<00:00:48.620> got<00:00:48.740> one<00:00:48.950> of

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
cattle and every time you got one of

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.880 
cattle and every time you got one of
these<00:00:49.100> temples<00:00:49.580> play<00:00:49.790> again<00:00:50.060> it's<00:00:50.210> a<00:00:50.270> cow<00:00:50.420> -

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
these temples play again it's a cow -

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.200 
these temples play again it's a cow -
yeah<00:00:51.920> that<00:00:52.250> would<00:00:52.340> take<00:00:52.460> too<00:00:52.610> long<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:52.850> be

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
yeah that would take too long and be

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.390 
yeah that would take too long and be
really<00:00:53.510> ridiculous<00:00:54.140> something<00:00:54.770> I<00:00:54.920> never<00:00:55.190> am

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
really ridiculous something I never am

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.819 
really ridiculous something I never am

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
only in that room but any room that you

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.560 
only in that room but any room that you
have<00:03:19.380> already<00:03:19.650> have<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.430> point<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.180> your<00:03:21.269> flags

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.870 
have already have a point of your flags
in<00:03:21.810> so<00:03:22.530> let's<00:03:22.680> say<00:03:22.800> add<00:03:22.890> a<00:03:22.920> flag<00:03:23.220> in<00:03:23.430> here<00:03:23.760> I

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
in so let's say add a flag in here I

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.990 
in so let's say add a flag in here I
would<00:03:24.330> get<00:03:24.480> one<00:03:24.750> two<00:03:25.110> three<00:03:25.470> four<00:03:25.920> points<00:03:26.430> for

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
would get one two three four points for

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.559 
would get one two three four points for
putting<00:03:27.270> that<00:03:27.330> five

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
putting that five

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.780 
putting that five
there<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.439> the<00:03:28.620> light<00:03:28.799> colored<00:03:29.189> tiles<00:03:29.430> can<00:03:29.730> be

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
there so the light colored tiles can be

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.539 
there so the light colored tiles can be
worth<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.390> lot<00:03:30.749> of<00:03:30.780> points<00:03:31.099> also<00:03:32.099> if<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.430> have<00:03:32.519> a

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.600 
you're maximizing points rather than
exploring<00:05:25.229> a<00:05:25.259> temple<00:05:25.650> now<00:05:25.919> that's<00:05:26.099> not<00:05:26.250> a<00:05:26.280> big

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
exploring a temple now that's not a big

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.159 
exploring a temple now that's not a big
deal<00:05:26.789> and<00:05:26.969> some<00:05:27.120> people<00:05:27.419> will<00:05:27.900> like<00:05:28.139> that

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
deal and some people will like that

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:29.930 
deal and some people will like that
because<00:05:28.620> maximizing<00:05:29.340> points<00:05:29.669> is<00:05:29.789> more

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
because maximizing points is more

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.520 
because maximizing points is more
interesting<00:05:30.360> for<00:05:30.509> them<00:05:30.690> than<00:05:31.139> the<00:05:31.289> actual

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
interesting for them than the actual

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.200 
interesting for them than the actual
theme<00:05:31.770> of<00:05:31.919> the<00:05:32.009> game<00:05:32.190> I<00:05:32.400> would<00:05:32.789> say<00:05:32.909> this<00:05:33.060> game

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
theme of the game I would say this game

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.930 
theme of the game I would say this game
is<00:05:33.360> a<00:05:33.389> good<00:05:33.570> halfway<00:05:34.080> point<00:05:34.409> it<00:05:34.889> has<00:05:35.219> a<00:05:35.250> meeting

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
is a good halfway point it has a meeting

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.150 
is a good halfway point it has a meeting
of<00:05:36.270> theme

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
of theme

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.730 
of theme
and<00:05:37.270> then<00:05:38.270> mechanics<00:05:38.900> to<00:05:39.020> get<00:05:39.140> points<00:05:39.440> and

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
and then mechanics to get points and

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.800 
and then mechanics to get points and
being<00:05:39.950> smart<00:05:40.280> there's<00:05:41.060> some<00:05:41.300> luck<00:05:41.570> in<00:05:41.720> the

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
being smart there's some luck in the

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.350 
being smart there's some luck in the
game<00:05:41.840> with<00:05:42.680> what<00:05:42.890> cards<00:05:43.280> you<00:05:43.400> draw<00:05:43.580> and<00:05:44.150> how

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
game with what cards you draw and how

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.640 
game with what cards you draw and how
you<00:05:44.420> put<00:05:44.570> eyes<00:05:44.840> on<00:05:44.870> the<00:05:45.080> board<00:05:45.290> but<00:05:45.440> there's<00:05:45.560> a

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
you put eyes on the board but there's a

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.590 
you put eyes on the board but there's a
decent<00:05:45.830> amount<00:05:46.190> of<00:05:46.280> strategy<00:05:46.730> and<00:05:46.820> again<00:05:47.060> it's

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
decent amount of strategy and again it's

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.690 
decent amount of strategy and again it's
not<00:05:47.780> a<00:05:47.810> very<00:05:48.080> heavy<00:05:48.380> game<00:05:48.680> I<00:05:48.830> classify<00:05:49.340> this<00:05:49.400> in

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
not a very heavy game I classify this in

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.330 
not a very heavy game I classify this in
the<00:05:49.790> medium<00:05:50.240> weight<00:05:50.480> category<00:05:51.110> but<00:05:51.890> it<00:05:51.980> is<00:05:52.100> one

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
the medium weight category but it is one

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.370 
the medium weight category but it is one
that<00:05:52.520> I<00:05:52.610> enjoy<00:05:53.060> and<00:05:53.330> I<00:05:53.390> would<00:05:53.570> I<00:05:53.750> would<00:05:54.170> like

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
that I enjoy and I would I would like

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.080 
that I enjoy and I would I would like
playing<00:05:54.680> games<00:05:54.830> with<00:05:55.040> the<00:05:55.310> high<00:05:55.490> component

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
playing games with the high component

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.030 
playing games with the high component
quality<00:05:56.420> and<00:05:56.540> great<00:05:56.690> artwork<00:05:57.230> certainly

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
quality and great artwork certainly

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.970 
quality and great artwork certainly
elevated<00:05:58.670> up<00:05:58.820> I<00:05:59.060> I<00:05:59.840> like<00:06:00.290> it<00:06:00.470> better<00:06:00.620> than<00:06:00.830> to

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 
elevated up I I like it better than to

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.980 
elevated up I I like it better than to
cow<00:06:01.160> one<00:06:01.610> although<00:06:02.300> it's<00:06:02.540> really<00:06:02.630> hard<00:06:02.900> to

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
cow one although it's really hard to

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.380 
cow one although it's really hard to
declare<00:06:03.290> the<00:06:03.440> games<00:06:03.590> although<00:06:03.860> to<00:06:04.040> cow<00:06:04.310> one<00:06:05.090> is

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
declare the games although to cow one is

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.290 
declare the games although to cow one is
just<00:06:06.380> a<00:06:06.470> cow<00:06:06.650> I<00:06:06.680> guess<00:06:06.980> is<00:06:07.160> probably<00:06:07.910> a<00:06:08.000> better

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
just a cow I guess is probably a better

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.360 
just a cow I guess is probably a better
game<00:06:08.900> but<00:06:09.800> this<00:06:09.950> one<00:06:10.190> is<00:06:10.340> still<00:06:10.670> fun<00:06:11.240> and<00:06:12.160> if<00:06:13.160> I

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
game but this one is still fun and if I

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.000 
game but this one is still fun and if I
had<00:06:13.610> to<00:06:13.730> pick<00:06:14.000> one<00:06:14.330> to<00:06:14.480> keep<00:06:14.660> I<00:06:14.840> keep<00:06:14.870> this<00:06:15.770> one

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
had to pick one to keep I keep this one

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.560 
had to pick one to keep I keep this one
