00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.260
 Hail Hail Chicken Who's talking is 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.840
 more serious than bringing you today 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.420
 A young man is very fast here. 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.670
 showing my new mouse and in the new 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:23.279
 keyboard I bought the m or m / chip 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.840
 internet and I speak so the name was 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.930
 different 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.679
 the different province at last is a shock 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.500
 me and the guys of the store is very much 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.559
 very good I recommend strong and prices 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.200
 are enrolled price into account for the 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.239
 other stores on the market in the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.379
 computer so I recommend very obvious 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:49.620
 for you guys but I bought a mouse there and 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.239
 keyboard is a capped kit with a 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.550
 mouse but I'll explain to you 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.910
 right through the video because 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.609
 I made this purchase which is a kit of 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:05.640
 keyboard and mouse my max out anyway 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:08.010
 It's for you only the keyboard mouse I bought 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.439
 so this is personal I hope you 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:18.150
 like corn and until the next it's gone and 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:20.850
 said the keyboard in case I 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.470
 I bought this one here that he is a 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.890
 cooler master 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.409
 yes it 's a new coolermaster legend of the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.240
 calls storm and it is a line facing 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.130
 for gamers 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.250
 so what I bought was this 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.820
 devastator right he has an eleven with 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.070
 2,000 dp and it is a luminous keyboard 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:45.540
 along with the mouse as you can 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:50.939
 see here in the photo had in the box 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:53.640
 the keyboard is heavy and it does not 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.119
 it's mechanical I was reminded to point out that 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.810
 it's not mechanical and you have a little something 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.119
 here the caption rises he then becomes 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.509
 You do not want to go on, you have everything. 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:10.200
 right to delete some setbacks in 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:13.680
 black piano here on the side below and 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.430
 also on the other side and above and 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:21.150
 Who is not a normal multimedia kitchens? 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:26.129
 it's a supreme keyboard let's say the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.989
 ipi performs more for me I would prefer 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:32.340
 so because if I can buy in the 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:36.359
 He did not have a bright keyboard and I 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.459
 I bought his buddha so it was very 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:40.439
 more in the purchase itself than a 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.049
 network keyboard joins together with a 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:45.480
 absurd that in 1800 of ipi 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.669
 and this accursed one will stay as a 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.519
 mouse is actually bought to use 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:53.189
 so that's also the cm storm 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.010
 which is a trailer I think it speaks if and 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:59.430
 he has 100 8,200 dp 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.519
 the mouse is the one here he is the big mouse 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.620
 Okay, I'm used to mouse kit. 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.019
 too small then for me for my 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.459
 mother at least here is the big mouse 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:13.530
 it has a USB connector on gold that is okay 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.389
 much better for the connection to be able to 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:21.000
 is passing all the data correctly 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:22.919
 and he is here behind a being alone and 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.949
 if I am not mistaken is the laser show gives a 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:31.620
 look here but a laser sensor and he 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:34.199
 There are three buttons on the side here. 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.040
 It's all rubbery to give you a bigger 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:40.949
 here on the side he is of the 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.479
 team year which gives it a great look 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:48.209
 beautiful if it were the same and if this 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:49.560
 black piano was in the same texture as 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.620
 this one sure would give a 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.979
 much greater precision here in these 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.519
 You have changes of dp itaipu lights. 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:01.799
 when he makes this change he has a 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:04.949
 a certain software you do all the 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:09.569
 changes at last the explorer is a disk 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:11.939
 very good I had already hidden it 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.000
 hence obviously not as good as 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:17.220
 This one on the side we have three buttons 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.079
 and that button if I'm not mistaken is the 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.669
 changing profile changes here and Depend On 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.020
 Now you're back showing them to you. 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:29.500
 the chubby in 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:32.560
 They are bananas, I waited for silver dusk. 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:37.150
 able to show you how to tape the 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:42.240
 keyboard and the mouse is on and the keyboard has 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:46.389
 a luigi help is hanging up here 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.759
 it is completely erased and impossible 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:52.120
 to see the letters and numbers 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:56.229
 At night most days if you want 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:05:00.090
 use yes I think I can use yes 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.090
 if you have a little window around 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:10.900
 they are each lit 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.729
 You can sell a light 11 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:18.699
 It's only from the keyboard that you know 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:23.469
 present in all 11 I've let him 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:24.969
 Little face is all erased because I 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:28.900
 I want to show you how it is 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:31.060
 same and do not show more profitable because 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.630
 he is very advanced how can you 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.340
 see and then this is personal and your keyboard 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.050
 This is the mouse. 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.580
 I hope you have enjoyed video and 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.819
 until the next champions 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.819
 went
