00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.480
 of paris films of their parents with whom 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.190
 it was harder to work with parents or 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.260
 by children 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.470
 Yes, I helped mine 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.540
 parents took part in the movie but really 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.610
 it was difficult with children 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.650
 I wanted so much that they looked and 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.579
 played well so I am all the time 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.579
 worried 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.940
 but 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.410

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.870

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.269
 roasted green tomatoes and realized that not 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.420

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.340
 found the head of the needle view it sounded then 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.980
 a bit like country songs were all 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.170
 sure that in the form of never sing it 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.389
 now with she performed although in her 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.730
 after all, she doesn't sound like 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:43.069
 country music does not sound kevin and claimed 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.900
 that you are a little old-fashioned man what 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.230
 modern trends are harder for you 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.930
 understand everything and began I do not like 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.750
 popularity to remain popular 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.599
 Only have to put energy and 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.260
 i don't like it i don't like to follow 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.299
 for fashion 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.060
 although I like it when people are fashionable 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:04.310
 dress but I'm comfortable here and 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.720
 don't care fashionable or not I just 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.639
 so what is 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.980
 But why are you following Tom Cruise? 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:12.169
 started a page in the Russian social networks 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.799
 if a fan writes you a letter 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:17.150
 note and I started for the sake of curiosity 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.940
 By the way, I used to answer Russian 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.820
 letters but i never read information 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.139

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.710
