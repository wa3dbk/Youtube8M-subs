tank<00:02:18.870> okay<00:02:19.870> so<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.790> reason<00:02:22.180> why<00:02:22.420> I'm<00:02:22.510> telling

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
tank okay so the reason why I'm telling

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
you with that because this hose has

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.740 
you with that because this hose has
tension<00:02:26.350> and<00:02:27.160> once<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:27.640> want<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.300> unplug<00:02:28.600> it

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
tension and once you want you unplug it

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.750 
tension and once you want you unplug it
from<00:02:28.930> here<00:02:29.200> what's<00:02:29.890> going<00:02:30.130> to<00:02:30.160> happen<00:02:30.459> that

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
from here what's going to happen that

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.210 
from here what's going to happen that
tension<00:02:31.239> that<00:02:31.660> holds<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.290> is<00:02:32.830> just<00:02:33.040> going<00:02:33.130> to

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
tension that holds it is just going to

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.280 
tension that holds it is just going to
