 i 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.769
 all 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.420
 1 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.259
 animals of high genetic standard bulls 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.920
 who went through a circuit of tests 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:38.410
 of perfect production efficiency 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:41.350
 animals of the guzerá breed 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.989
 easy to adapt and weather resistant 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.079
 hot the first heads of the race 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.640
 guzerá come from India or to zero is a 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.100
 ancient reason in the country 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.649
 the first imports are from India 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.410
 came mainly guzerá and today that 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.940
 was where the start of the zebu convention 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.760
 teaching in the country 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.079
 then goes back to the beginning of the 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.259
 introduction from scratch 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.479
 he arrived had some producers who 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.700
 started working with the race station 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.800
 Vargas station in uberaba x 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.590
 research began to make the first 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.990
 researches with 10 to verify the question 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.570
 weight playback adaptation 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.570
 milk production aspects so 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.599
 started in uberaba and that's where it went. 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:30.310
 disseminating there is a large nucleus of 

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:32.530
 creation of mines and departure 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.800
 whole was in the Rio de Janeiro in 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.830
 cantagalo doing is rock in the family 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.800
 He opened his family and he opened them. 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.830
 practically they started giving 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.440
 continuity in the production process of 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.229
 milk for being a breed that had little 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.599
 been studied in the late 1970s 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.940
 unesp researchers from single island 

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:57.489
 which is on the border of the state of são 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.369
 paulo with mato grosso do sul started 

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:03.369
 the surveys of the breed the initial herd 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:07.020
 came from the farm is hollow of the river of 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.009
 January family April which is for delight 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.069
 part the animals come from the organization 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.500
 mário franco de uberaba is already a selection of 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.390
 and carlos castro snows here from 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.930
 pereira barreto region near the city 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.730
 next to our and we not only started the 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.209
 milk cattle had cut animals 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.910
 And then we started to 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.330
 work with the selection for milk and 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.670
 for the big defense 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.160
 some structural constraints have 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.650
 with the university to devote to 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.260
 exclusively to research aimed at 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.720
 for beef cattle and was in the year of 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.240
 2006 that the breeding program 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.240
 of the guzerá breed began 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.970
 in the municipality of selvíria mato grosso do 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.900
 south runs an experimental farm 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.010
 with 650 heads occupying an area of 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.599
 thousand hectares 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.150
 the work developed here on the farm 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.959
 is primarily to produce animals of 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.870
 quality 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.780
 It's okay, these animals can be 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.480
 not used for searching and at the end 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.519
 these animals are supplied to the 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.280
 producers at the auction level. 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.470
 objective of the first university 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.299
 produce products with qualities that 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.299
 will be used here in activity 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.849
 and research and in the end these 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.130
 animals are in a certain way 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:30.220
 provided to the company in terms of 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.860
 and it is on this farm that it is made 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.920
 the selection of the best animals is the 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.000
 called circuit of efficiency tests 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.150
 productive 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.849
 this program it has the objective of 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.209
 improve the genetic quality of 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:49.090
 guzerá bulls and cows too 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:51.730
 intended for meat production and the focus 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.109
 this work is to meet the need of 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.000
 national livestock 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:58.030
 after finding animals 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.040
 breeders provide these animals with 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.670
 farmers interested in the production of 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.510
 beef 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:07.060
 the program here happens in three steps 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.690
 how do you want the first step starts with 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.400
 weaning of calves that will one 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.350
 grazing process 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.769
 then these little critters are at a 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.410
 for about 12 months eating 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:24.160
 brachial grass and for four months 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.090
 in the year it receives 300 grams of protein 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.960
 of dryness 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:32.110
 the other part is the confinement of the 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.050
 animals that starts with animals for 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.450
 around 17 months of age 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.780
 these animals go to approximately 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:43.240
 your 21 22 23 months where the race ends 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.889
 confinement and the final part that I 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.169
 said the technical part 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.720
 animals that have passed the proof of 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.340
 pasture and the animals that passed through 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.550
 proof of confinement 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:57.220
 they are 40 qualified he gets a 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.350
 punctuation and depending on that score 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.140
 it is considered large field 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.030
 a medium animal was a discarded animal 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.080
 is castrated and is not supplied to 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.270
 producers 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.760
 one of the main objectives of 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.130
 researchers at unesp was to develop 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.530
 a genetic improvement system and a 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.480
 environment such as the one that represents the 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.750
 reality of national livestock 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.300
 a simple step a dry pasture where the 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.290
 guzerá breed presents excellent 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.930
 results 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.060
 if we think about the environment that 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.570
 exists with Brazilian livestock in Brazil 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.900
 today is step is the brachiaria grass 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.660
 then our situation today being 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.810
 here it is in the southern thicket on the border 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.670
 de são paulo near minas gerais she 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.830
 makes strategic for several points 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.140
 first because it reflects reality 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.480
 of national livestock or grass 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:53.770
 land of low fertility in the 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:56.890
 center west is a place of 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.510
 easy dissemination of livestock to 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.400
 producers in minas gerais 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.800
 that is in the southern thicket are 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.310
 paulo and even in the parana having 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.830
 view that one of the creators that led to 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:12.930
 our race to the paraná took 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.930
 herd of cows out of here
