00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
think I have an understanding of all the

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
think I have an understanding of all the
maps<00:03:40.190> you<00:03:40.340> know<00:03:40.430> when<00:03:40.519> you<00:03:40.609> first<00:03:40.790> get<00:03:40.910> the

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
maps you know when you first get the

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.599 
maps you know when you first get the
game<00:03:41.209> you're<00:03:41.420> like<00:03:41.630> you<00:03:42.530> you<00:03:43.010> don't<00:03:43.220> know<00:03:43.430> how

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
game you're like you you don't know how

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.270 
game you're like you you don't know how
to<00:03:43.639> maneuver<00:03:44.299> on<00:03:44.329> the<00:03:44.660> maps<00:03:44.870> so<00:03:45.319> you<00:03:45.380> tend<00:03:46.160> to

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
to maneuver on the maps so you tend to

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.670 
to maneuver on the maps so you tend to
camp<00:03:46.549> a<00:03:46.670> little<00:03:46.880> bit<00:03:47.000> more<00:03:47.150> but<00:03:47.870> right<00:03:48.230> now<00:03:48.380> I<00:03:48.410> I

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
camp a little bit more but right now I I

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.740 
camp a little bit more but right now I I
like<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.010> think<00:03:49.280> I<00:03:49.489> know<00:03:49.639> the<00:03:50.180> maps<00:03:50.389> pretty

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
like to think I know the maps pretty

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.990 
like to think I know the maps pretty
well<00:03:50.930> now<00:03:51.139> so<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:51.560> know<00:03:51.920> hopefully<00:03:52.489> you<00:03:52.880> guys

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000
