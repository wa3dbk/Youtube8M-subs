00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.249
 Hello and welcome to the stove 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:12.679
 it's cold outside we should make nice mulled wine 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.350
 We have bought a wonderful mediocre wineg wines 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.150
 not in the most expensive head not outsmart I bought it too 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.470
 Food carries 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.660
 the most important thing about one is he does not cook the hair 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.709
 so keep the temperature low middle level 5 6 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.449
 and then nothing can happen there 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.020
 yes what she experienced her death prepared black tea he gives the user a university 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.520
 because I think it's not Irish 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.880
 Thing 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.590
 to let the spices arc schools to graze when you go 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.920
 in the mouth hull train followed &amp; DTK rauszuholen or cloves or or 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.360
 I have here 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.130
 Papola was getting compresses 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.800
 If you ask yourself we can get the pharmacist to the nurse 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.900
 Home he has as well 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.780
 approach her 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.140
 seams 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.600
 more beautiful 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.530
 sign up all open paint here 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:13.920
 we approach 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.740
 are 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.560
 Whole stood always one to two breaks so that the aroma water outlet 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.620
 Spices come and say 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.690
 Troughs or compressor 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:26.840
 moves 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.840
 Two races two times, two more people need it 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.870
 sometimes less is more 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.220
 the aromas are very strong I would take care with the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.640
 spices 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.410
 we threaten them 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.140
 as untreated as organic the same applies to the orange 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.980
 Although the shell that needs to be cut very thin has to be very thin here 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.100
 peeled off who does not have to do with it 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.210
 The white between today also has diverse between today is bitter 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.170
 and that's what the lemon peel should look like 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.820
 that this is the case with RSA and that you have the shells 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.710
 without the bitterns of white between word use can be wonderful 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.930
 I now know our theoretical offer much easier because 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.519
 that can pull 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.700
 and in the meantime 5 I treasure the orange juice and juice 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:23.179
 Lemons gain a huge amount of matte 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:27.689
 Of course I mean the used lemons and oranges as Unseld 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.929
 To take juice and then to enrich it with 8 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:33.929
 Accordingly, everything is normal as for any other that 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:37.559
 because of a lemon ample in addition to half 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.859
 the same thing happens with the oracular 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.799
 to squeeze 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.799
 also Marty Singer 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.969
 no longer cooking very important 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:51.669
 even 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.379
 has her with limited amount of her 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.669
 Max something like he should let a little less sweet her the doers 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.430
 Cost and of our dilution and sanitary dilution in 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.809
 quotes 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.809
 the mulled wine has to draw for another five minutes 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:10.909
 our jersey 8 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.870
 he starts to cook she was able to aim the mulled wine he starts 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.379
 to move wonderfully 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.759
 Well in between 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:21.719
 I present a few aromatics once Rome 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:25.779
 he comes there in the year he was already very close or men paid 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:27.040
 two tablespoons 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.480
 what is going on 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.549
 the finished mulled wine Kothgasser course 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.030
 or they flavored with a nice Vienna I get the taste Grunert 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:37.349
 through it again 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.529
 and here finally again before we and then over costs the fast 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:44.739
 Variant one can the whole was also with teabags and with garbage fix bags 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:45.949
 organize 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:50.209
 but does not taste as good as our variant to align 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.759
 Raw materials are made in the ore our mulled wine aromatic herbs farmer 1 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:00.229
 press it again a bit too 1 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:08.739
 good drink more 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.739
 you get the fpÃ¶ the subtleties yet that was out 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.829
 Fortuna was 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.009
 simply super consumo the user
