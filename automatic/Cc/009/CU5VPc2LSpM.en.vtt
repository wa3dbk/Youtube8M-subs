 our blends 46 a fast flowering and 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.300
 long term 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.169
 here is how we go after 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.060
 a beautiful mixture of flowers the preparation 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.130
 soil and the essential step

 warmed up the temperature must exceed 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.809
 the 1000 degrees at night and the rain of

 like a meadow or a common one 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.360
 seed needs to be in contact with the

 a roll and what to water 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:18.050
 you have to go back to the ground on 15 to 20 cm 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.130
 of depth by motivating a decline or 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.690
 a tiller 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.409
 according to the surface wandered on the surface and 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.240
 refined the inter with a raking not

 sprinkle ground let them grow 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.790
 weeds

 seeds to an inert material like the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.929
 sand for example respect their 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.270
 assaults three quarters of the match 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:06.549
 ordinary for a quarter of the trains of 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.799
 front sow on the fly making sure to 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:13.150
 cross the passages dread the fat 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:16.420
 Tomorrow's heap a handful of mixture 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.530
 corresponds to the coast and discover one to 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.350
 two square meters 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.330
 if you sow large areas 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.420
 divided into several plots of surface 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:30.530
 and ivanic be careful to spread the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.680
 Greek anyway it will then rake

 first fifteen days to favor 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.420
 the lifting of the bowls the density of this 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:56.450
 name should be more important if the 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.560
 nobody needs to be taken off the ground there 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.980
 trunk or plot was summoned early

 after lifting and returning to four 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.470
 month these flowers they need neither water 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.140
 nor the product line tab of 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.600
 treatment let live your mix 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.840
 flowers and the ecosystem that most
