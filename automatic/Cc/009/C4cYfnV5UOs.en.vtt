this is fpse on the Kobe Kairos this is
a<00:00:04.740> PSX<00:00:05.460> emulator<00:00:05.960> which<00:00:06.960> i<00:00:07.080> think<00:00:07.140> is<00:00:07.470> better

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
a PSX emulator which i think is better

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.330 
a PSX emulator which i think is better
than<00:00:07.770> PSX<00:00:08.429> for<00:00:08.700> droid<00:00:08.940> but<00:00:09.809> in<00:00:10.469> my<00:00:11.070> latest

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
than PSX for droid but in my latest

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.459 
than PSX for droid but in my latest
video<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:11.910> could<00:00:12.059> have<00:00:12.210> heard<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:12.900> i<00:00:13.380> was

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
BIOS I do you accept this do you accept

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.799 
BIOS I do you accept this do you accept
that<00:00:44.520> but<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.820> need<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.239> do<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.600> hit<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
menu it hits a little crystal oops and

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.220 
menu it hits a little crystal oops and
go<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.379> system<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.190> then<00:00:53.510> bought<00:00:54.510> like<00:00:54.930> BIOS

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
go to system and then bought like BIOS

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
which I have mine in the NAND but I I'll

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.479 
which I have mine in the NAND but I I'll
give<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.859> link<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.489> BIOS<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.530> but<00:01:04.530> some

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
give you a link to the BIOS to but some

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.820 
give you a link to the BIOS to but some
people<00:01:05.790> may<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.360> problem<00:01:06.750> with<00:01:06.930> IHL<00:01:07.590> e

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
people may have the problem with IHL e

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.710 
people may have the problem with IHL e
mode<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.640> sometimes<00:01:09.119> people<00:01:09.570> will<00:01:09.689> have

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
mode like sometimes people will have

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.649 
mode like sometimes people will have
that<00:01:09.869> selected<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.090> you<00:01:12.090> can't<00:01:12.330> just<00:01:12.510> back

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
that selected and you can't just back

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.140 
that selected and you can't just back
out<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.189> deselect<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.939> and

out of it you have to deselect it and
then<00:01:15.540> hit<00:01:15.950> default<00:01:16.950> configuration<00:01:17.820> save<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
then hit default configuration save and

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.310 
then hit default configuration save and
go<00:01:20.939> ahead<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.210> hit<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:22.310> wait<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> second

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
go ahead and hit that wait a second

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.770 
go ahead and hit that wait a second
default<00:01:25.320> config<00:01:25.710> saved<00:01:26.119> but<00:01:27.119> yeah<00:01:27.509> then<00:01:27.689> you

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
default config saved but yeah then you

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.969 
default config saved but yeah then you
can<00:01:27.900> hit<00:01:28.049> back<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:29.000> choose<00:01:30.000> ISO<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.600> load<00:01:30.979> now

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
can hit back and choose ISO to load now

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.999 
can hit back and choose ISO to load now
I'm<00:01:32.250> going<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> run<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:33.119> Tekken<00:01:33.479> 3<00:01:34.009> which

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
I'm going to run the Tekken 3 which

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.490 
I'm going to run the Tekken 3 which
others<00:01:35.340> came<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.729> grew<00:01:36.030> up<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.140> still

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
others came I grew up on and I still

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
others came I grew up on and I still
even<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:37.890> an<00:01:38.100> IC<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.000> still<00:01:39.240> play<00:01:39.270> today

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
even have an IC and I still play today

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.590 
even have an IC and I still play today
now<00:01:41.520> it's<00:01:41.640> going<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.820> take<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> second<00:01:44.600> Namco

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
now it's going to take a second Namco

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.770 
now it's going to take a second Namco
presents<00:01:46.460> there<00:01:47.460> there's<00:01:47.909> an<00:01:48.030> X<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.659> mean

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
presents there there's an X I mean

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.649 
presents there there's an X I mean
triangles<00:01:50.090> you're<00:01:51.090> not<00:01:51.210> going<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.420> be<00:01:51.479> able<00:01:51.540> to

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
triangles you're not going to be able to

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.539 
triangles you're not going to be able to
see<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.020> sense<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.799> was<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> little<00:01:53.310> dark

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
see that sense of it was a little dark

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.899 
see that sense of it was a little dark
but<00:01:54.479> you'll<00:01:55.020> see<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> second<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.790> it

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
but you'll see it in a second and it

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.450 
but you'll see it in a second and it
just<00:01:57.090> takes<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.479> quick<00:01:57.719> circuit

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.560 

all<00:02:02.000> right<00:02:06.250> if<00:02:07.250> you<00:02:07.400> want<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.670> 8io<00:02:07.970> so<00:02:08.330> just

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
all right if you want the 8io so just

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.590 
all right if you want the 8io so just
let<00:02:08.720> me<00:02:08.810> know

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
let me know

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.030 
let me know
there<00:02:11.600> we<00:02:11.690> go<00:02:12.610> so<00:02:13.610> I'm<00:02:13.670> just<00:02:13.730> going<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.030> move<00:02:14.180> up

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
there we go so I'm just going to move up
