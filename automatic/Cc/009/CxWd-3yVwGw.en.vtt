00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.600 
off some steam and just have a supras
all<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.810> time<00:01:22.049> plus<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.040> good<00:01:23.280> way<00:01:23.549> to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
all the time plus it's a good way to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.810 
all the time plus it's a good way to
practice<00:01:24.119> at<00:01:24.750> using<00:01:25.020> your<00:01:25.380> supers<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.130> PvP<00:01:26.790> a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
practice at using your supers in PvP a

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.609 
practice at using your supers in PvP a
lot<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.240> people<00:01:27.600> don't<00:01:27.840> get<00:01:28.049> them<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.409> often

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
lot of people don't get them that often

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.520 
lot of people don't get them that often
so<00:01:29.460> when<00:01:29.640> they<00:01:29.790> get<00:01:30.060> them<00:01:30.329> they<00:01:30.540> really<00:01:30.960> don't

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
so when they get them they really don't

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.710 
so when they get them they really don't
know<00:01:31.740> how<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.009> use<00:01:32.159> them<00:01:32.520> well<00:01:32.790> enough<00:01:32.939> so

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
know how to use them well enough so

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.359 
know how to use them well enough so
guess<00:01:33.960> what<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.470> would<00:01:34.680> be<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.860> good<00:01:35.130> way<00:01:35.189> to

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
guess what this would be a good way to

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.390 
guess what this would be a good way to
come<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.240> you'll<00:01:36.840> just<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.500> your<00:01:37.799> super

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.219 
come in and you'll just have your super
even<00:01:38.670> if<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.909> don't<00:01:39.270> get<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.689> many<00:01:39.810> kills

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
even if you don't get that many kills

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.140 
even if you don't get that many kills
and<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.560> get<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.829> practice<00:01:41.250> using<00:01:41.549> your<00:01:41.610> super

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
and you get to practice using your super

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.780 
and you get to practice using your super
a<00:01:42.299> lot<00:01:42.960> more<00:01:43.350> other<00:01:43.649> than<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.700> the

a lot more other than that and the

a lot more other than that and the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
gameplay you can see that they are

gameplay you can see that they are
playing<00:01:46.200> on<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> new<00:01:46.890> map<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.820> one<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.240> called

takes<00:01:54.299> place<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> cosmic<00:01:55.290> drawn<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.799> it's

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
takes place in the cosmic drawn and it's

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.069 
takes place in the cosmic drawn and it's
inside<00:01:56.610> those<00:01:56.880> walls<00:01:56.909> like<00:01:57.600> where<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.869> first

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
inside those walls like where you first

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.230 
inside those walls like where you first
start<00:01:58.439> playing<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.920> game<00:01:59.130> in<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.490> area<00:01:59.700> over

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
start playing the game in that area over

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.999 
start playing the game in that area over
there<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.750> another<00:02:01.320> thing<00:02:01.590> from<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
there and another thing from the

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.069 
there and another thing from the
gameplay<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.729> think<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.479> Titan<00:02:03.810> is<00:02:03.930> going

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
gameplay I think that the Titan is going

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.469 
gameplay I think that the Titan is going
to<00:02:04.140> be<00:02:04.320> my<00:02:04.579> favorite<00:02:05.579> super<00:02:06.030> come<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.329> and

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
to be my favorite super come in and

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.950 
to be my favorite super come in and
taken<00:02:06.869> King<00:02:07.140> even

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
taken King even

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.800 
taken King even
though<00:02:08.080> it<00:02:08.619> kind<00:02:08.920> of<00:02:09.039> seems<00:02:09.399> easy<00:02:10.119> to<00:02:10.600> dodge

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
though it kind of seems easy to dodge

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.680 
though it kind of seems easy to dodge
the<00:02:11.200> hammers<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:12.730> seemed<00:02:13.030> like<00:02:13.330> from<00:02:13.540> the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
the hammers it seemed like from the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.840 
the hammers it seemed like from the
perks<00:02:13.930> they<00:02:14.110> had<00:02:14.319> on<00:02:14.620> at<00:02:14.950> least<00:02:15.130> from<00:02:15.370> what<00:02:15.790> I

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
perks they had on at least from what I

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.059 
perks they had on at least from what I
saw<00:02:16.120> in<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.300> stream<00:02:16.569> on<00:02:16.720> today<00:02:16.959> stream<00:02:17.380> they

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
saw in the stream on today stream they

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.740 
saw in the stream on today stream they
were<00:02:18.130> throwing<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.640> hammers<00:02:19.030> on<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.450> floor

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
were throwing the hammers on the floor

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.640 
were throwing the hammers on the floor
they<00:02:19.870> were<00:02:19.959> kind<00:02:20.140> of<00:02:20.200> like<00:02:20.319> you<00:02:20.440> know<00:02:20.500> they

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
they were kind of like you know they

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.930 
they were kind of like you know they
weren't<00:02:20.800> trying<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.069> directly<00:02:21.490> hit<00:02:21.790> the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
weren't trying to directly hit the

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.010 
weren't trying to directly hit the
person<00:02:22.360> they<00:02:22.420> were<00:02:22.510> trying<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.780> make<00:02:22.840> the

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
person they were trying to make the

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.520 
person they were trying to make the
Hammers<00:02:23.350> explode<00:02:23.770> like<00:02:23.950> rockets<00:02:24.489> and<00:02:25.530> to

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
Hammers explode like rockets and to

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.380 
Hammers explode like rockets and to
counter<00:02:26.980> that<00:02:27.190> all<00:02:27.430> you<00:02:27.640> really<00:02:27.760> have<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:28.090> do

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
counter that all you really have to do

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.330 
counter that all you really have to do
is<00:02:28.510> jump<00:02:28.900> for<00:02:29.319> example<00:02:29.770> a<00:02:29.860> warlock<00:02:30.310> and

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
is jump for example a warlock and

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.330 
is jump for example a warlock and
literally<00:02:30.730> stay<00:02:31.090> in<00:02:31.239> air<00:02:31.420> forever<00:02:32.100> Titan<00:02:33.100> can

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
literally stay in air forever Titan can

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.280 
literally stay in air forever Titan can
literally<00:02:33.580> stay<00:02:33.970> like<00:02:34.209> no<00:02:34.420> floating<00:02:34.810> forever

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
literally stay like no floating forever

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.190 
literally stay like no floating forever
and<00:02:35.590> it's<00:02:35.739> really<00:02:36.069> easy<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.550> dodge<00:02:36.819> unless<00:02:37.480> you

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
and it's really easy to dodge unless you

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.809 
and it's really easy to dodge unless you
know<00:02:38.319> the<00:02:38.440> time<00:02:38.650> is<00:02:38.860> going<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.100> hit<00:02:39.340> whoever<00:02:39.580> it

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
know the time is going to hit whoever it

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.430 
know the time is going to hit whoever it
is<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:40.239> flaming<00:02:40.600> time<00:02:40.870> is<00:02:41.080> going<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.290> hit

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
is the flaming time is going to hit

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.860 
is the flaming time is going to hit
direct<00:02:41.830> impacts<00:02:42.370> which<00:02:42.640> probably<00:02:43.510> going<00:02:43.780> to

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
direct impacts which probably going to

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.930 
direct impacts which probably going to
be<00:02:43.959> a<00:02:43.989> little<00:02:44.380> bit<00:02:44.620> hard<00:02:44.890> but<00:02:45.340> I<00:02:45.400> don't<00:02:45.610> know<00:02:45.760> I

be a little bit hard but I don't know I

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.060 
be a little bit hard but I don't know I
know<00:02:46.060> there's<00:02:46.300> a<00:02:46.390> perk<00:02:46.780> that<00:02:47.260> can<00:02:47.500> make<00:02:47.890> the

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070
