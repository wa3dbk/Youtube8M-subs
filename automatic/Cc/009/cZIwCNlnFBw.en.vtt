00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.599
 And many gates I have the song of 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.400
 alipay browser mmog made me 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:34.540
 I wish you a lot of fun with this 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.489
 tutorial ok let's start the chords 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.710
 which we need for the song is and 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.600
 I had come to the first bunch 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.670
 I recommend the same lot easier 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.370
 we need a lot too overstretched 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.330
 chords a first power corp not the 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.199
 are yes on the acoustic guitar 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:52.059
 not to grab him so pleasantly 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:54.699
 So that's what I told the first bunch 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.159
 everyone gripped as he would if he 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.960
 caritas now in the end bund 0 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:01.330
 is that means that we have in the 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.610
 original actual g minor chord on 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.830
 the third bunch I say now 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.409
 know about having broken in the second bunch 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.340
 so it's a fis minor chord otherwise 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.380
 Let's come to the accordionists 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.510
 good bye here could love for 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:18.700
 The whole of need are once one 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:20.770
 F sharp minor d 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.000
 100 m 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.370
 I think the iba and 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.440
 probably everyone can feet 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.510
 I explain very briefly he reaches for the 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.860
 have that index finger in the second 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:40.229
 Butt parried puts his finger on the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.330
 after cable that the fourth bunch on 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.070
 the a side and little finger right in 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.460
 verbund after the cadastre on the g 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.460
 string 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.390
 there are indeed court for the whole song 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.500
 need something else does not happen and 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.990
 Now we are actually playing the whole thing 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.240
 with his octave pass that 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.710
 just work so grab yours 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.240
 Griffe and I just tell you now 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.209
 the pages you change then in the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:20.670
 stop at the F sharp minor chord 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:27.090
 It would be the d accord taking the teaching 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:32.940
 the side and the mark was it would be 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:38.549
 the a and the gsm and the record would be 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:41.360
 it's the mares and the diesel and then it would 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.360
 so first went 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.430
 if you listen carefully but you have that 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.980
 always on time , especially in the past 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.840
 the text starts and the accord 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.220
 change the accord a bit more 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.690
 played there he just takes place 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.290
 flower paston to look at blow 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.010
 answer 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.010
 be my kingdom 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.710
 that's the rhythm of the stanza 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.710
 if I now the text normal super 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.800
 and now comes the next ride 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.390
 call it free now 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.010
 I do not really believe the phrase 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.440
 at least it does not sound like I'm taking it 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.730
 simply the band in song the most 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:11.580
 occurrence the place and always 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.580
 the same is this 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:27.370
 yes so this did work with it 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.850
 he 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.850
 with the normal 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.970
 yes and how does the whole thing in the same 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.970
 rhythm as easy 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.869
 from the change it would be a 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.910
 by 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:04.560
 one day then another half 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.710
 and completely 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.710
 just 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:17.360
 st 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:27.090
 well after that come as the stanza 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:29.480
 then talk again and yes what is that 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.480
 comes to 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.660
 there comes after the second referendum 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.580
 But this interview seems to be before that 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.100
 he still comes with two tones 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.050
 reinspielt yes then come always after 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.090
 the refrain with actually inserted 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.140
 after every park i even play games 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:52.740
 just once the a side 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:54.860
 then the e string bridge is mostly on 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.860
 the bank 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.320
 and it is always the transition into the 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.850
 individual games 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.830
 ok now comes one piece to those 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.120
 I interviewed that is extremely high 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.910
 I do not want that healthy now either 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.260
 work in front of me 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:15.020
 I'll just explain the chords 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:18.410
 So then play our gf fis minor 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.410
 then went to the 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.960
 these 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.909
 and finally the partner in the 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:36.039
 not the end comes again or 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:38.259
 towards the end then again and now 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.789
 a single part that is where these 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:41.949
 melody always on it is this melody 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:44.560
 comes twelve times and the chord sequence the 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:51.719
 you play it is just a day 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.719
 until half a hold the one 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.840
 I think I come from which specially 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.950
 12 times 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:20.460
 and comes at the end of the song 

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:23.880
 okay again that should be it 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.170
 so i hope i could 

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.390
 get back to the dual with the dual again 

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:29.010
