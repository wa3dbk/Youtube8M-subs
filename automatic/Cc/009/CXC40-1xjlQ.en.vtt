 Tell us a little place this place 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.730
 began to build in 1890 and it was inaugurated 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.070
 in the year 1920 this really got 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.480
 built for people in need is what 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.790
 what really is 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.950
 He tells you it's a mansion but it's a 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.770
 site for people in need and because 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.290
 It took 10 years to build 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.780
 it was simply because of the wars of 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.910
 between bands controlled this area of 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.220
 fact there were clashes here during 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.500
 its construction and the people who died 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.800
 their spirits haunt vaguely happened 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.750
 something in this room what happens in 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.540
 this area you hear voices from the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.120
 roof even blows we think they are from 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.520
 the bands but here people died 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.280
 innocent by an old owner also 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.100
 innocent people died after the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.680
 bands wars the owner 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.080
 old man who lived his name of sebastián 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.270
 it is precisely the darkest part of 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.900
 this story talking about that man was 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.020
 bad person is responsible for all this 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.280
 activity of the death of innocent people 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.680
 this man did not want anyone to enter 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.810
 he was a mafia boss who controlled 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.540
 this site people needed that 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.060
 I went in and killed them, I did not accept the help 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.280
 nobody was a twisted man without 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.300
 scruples and because I did those things so 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.460
 horrible 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.950
 because it was a refuge for him was the 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.290
 most wanted criminal of the 30s very 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.390
 known also killed people because 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.920
 I was afraid he was going to tell the police 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.650
 since this site was of people 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.290
 needed to fuck how nasty how 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.390
 he killed them he told his subjects that 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.190
 they hang them after they cut their 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.170
 limbs and hiding them under 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.480
 until the kitchen was there after 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.990
 killed them with the knife and 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.820
 how it ended this man was captured one 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.490
 from his band he told him how soft 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.380
 they would come to capture him they were surrounded 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.630
 of snipers who were going through the 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.520
 thick wall the man finally finished 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.190
 throwing themselves head first from the top 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.950

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.600

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.560

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.160
 paranormal activity 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.230

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.090
 he seemed to see someone's silhouette what 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.370
 I feel people start to feel something 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.739
