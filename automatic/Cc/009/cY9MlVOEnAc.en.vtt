okay<00:05:37.570> I<00:05:37.840> mixed<00:05:38.260> the<00:05:38.380> sodium<00:05:38.830> inside<00:05:38.950> the<00:05:39.250> water

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
okay I mixed the sodium inside the water

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.110 
okay I mixed the sodium inside the water
now<00:05:40.210> kay<00:05:40.540> you<00:05:40.960> do<00:05:41.380> the<00:05:41.500> honors<00:05:41.950> on<00:05:42.190> adding<00:05:42.729> the
