so<00:00:09.389> we're<00:00:09.690> going<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.840> be<00:00:09.960> installing

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.510 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.850 

see<00:00:13.510> tech<00:00:13.840> comfort<00:00:14.650> indicator<00:00:15.280> today<00:00:16.860> under

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
see tech comfort indicator today under

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.890 
see tech comfort indicator today under
the<00:00:17.980> mobile<00:00:18.310> battery<00:00:18.670> that<00:00:18.850> we<00:00:18.940> have<00:00:19.150> that

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
the mobile battery that we have that

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.659 
the mobile battery that we have that
runs<00:00:22.560> our<00:00:23.560> easiest<00:00:24.220> stroller<00:00:24.730> let's<00:00:25.360> see<00:00:25.750> our

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:26.669 
runs our easiest stroller let's see our

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.929 
runs our easiest stroller let's see our
pure<00:00:27.669> sine-wave<00:00:28.000> inverters<00:00:28.660> right<00:00:28.869> here<00:00:29.939> and

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
pure sine-wave inverters right here and

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.050 
pure sine-wave inverters right here and
that<00:00:31.390> runs<00:00:31.689> our<00:00:31.960> cough<00:00:32.290> assist<00:00:32.829> machine<00:00:33.400> which

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.060 
that runs our cough assist machine which

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.770 
that runs our cough assist machine which
is<00:00:35.430> right<00:00:36.430> there

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:48.030 

so<00:00:40.780> I<00:00:41.220> have<00:00:42.220> to<00:00:42.430> detach<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:47.350> yellow<00:00:47.770> wire

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
so I have to detach this yellow wire

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.600 
so I have to detach this yellow wire
that<00:00:48.340> we<00:00:48.460> had<00:00:48.610> for<00:00:48.820> something<00:00:49.180> else<00:00:49.360> and<00:00:50.610> put

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
that we had for something else and put

00:00:51.610 --> 00:01:00.690 
that we had for something else and put
the<00:00:51.880> new<00:00:54.420> comfort<00:00:55.420> indicator<00:00:55.900> on<00:00:59.490> just<00:01:00.490> looks

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
the new comfort indicator on just looks

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.380 
the new comfort indicator on just looks
on<00:01:00.880> with<00:01:01.060> these<00:01:01.860> the<00:01:02.860> eyelets<00:01:03.310> so<00:01:03.610> shouldn't

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
on with these the eyelets so shouldn't

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.870 
on with these the eyelets so shouldn't
take<00:01:04.629> too<00:01:04.659> long<00:01:04.950> and<00:01:05.950> it<00:01:06.040> should<00:01:06.310> give<00:01:06.549> us<00:01:06.580> a

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
take too long and it should give us a

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.080 
take too long and it should give us a
readout<00:01:07.119> on<00:01:07.299> a<00:01:08.850> red<00:01:09.850> yellow<00:01:10.240> or<00:01:10.659> green<00:01:11.170> light

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
readout on a red yellow or green light

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.570 
readout on a red yellow or green light
depending<00:01:13.090> on<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.240> status<00:01:13.689> of<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:13.869> battery

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
depending on the status of the battery

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.510 
depending on the status of the battery
so<00:01:15.580> I'm<00:01:15.640> gonna<00:01:15.760> hook<00:01:15.880> this<00:01:16.030> up<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:18.100> now<00:01:18.220> I<00:01:18.250> have

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
so I'm gonna hook this up so now I have

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:25.110 
so I'm gonna hook this up so now I have
all<00:01:18.700> of<00:01:18.760> our<00:01:20.130> wires<00:01:21.130> off<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.610> battery<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:25.060> is

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
all of our wires off the battery this is

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.770 
all of our wires off the battery this is
the<00:01:25.270> positive<00:01:25.390> terminal<00:01:26.190> that<00:01:27.270> still<00:01:28.270> runs<00:01:28.510> to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
the positive terminal that still runs to

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.469 
the positive terminal that still runs to
our<00:01:28.900> pure<00:01:29.800> sine<00:01:30.040> wave<00:01:30.220> inverter<00:01:30.340> so<00:01:30.940> just<00:01:31.300> let

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
our pure sine wave inverter so just let

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.420 
our pure sine wave inverter so just let
that<00:01:31.630> on<00:01:31.780> there<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:32.050> mark<00:01:32.260> it<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:36.100> now<00:01:36.190> we<00:01:36.220> have

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
that on there to mark it so now we have

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.260 
that on there to mark it so now we have
all<00:01:36.550> the<00:01:36.790> connections<00:01:37.390> in<00:01:37.600> place<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:39.280> our

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
all the connections in place and our

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.500 
all the connections in place and our
green<00:01:41.140> light<00:01:41.350> is<00:01:41.530> blinking<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.880> that<00:01:46.060> tells<00:01:46.270> us

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
green light is blinking so that tells us

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.500 
green light is blinking so that tells us
we<00:01:46.690> do<00:01:46.840> not<00:01:47.020> need<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:47.380> charge<00:01:47.650> the<00:01:47.680> battery

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.720 

and<00:01:54.200> now<00:01:54.320> I<00:01:54.350> got<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.710> just<00:01:54.860> put<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:55.400> all<00:01:55.550> back<00:01:55.850> in

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
and now I got to just put it all back in

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.810 
and now I got to just put it all back in
close<00:01:58.730> up<00:01:58.790> about<00:01:59.300> connections<00:02:00.020> I<00:02:01.180> said<00:02:02.180> the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
close up about connections I said the

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.720 
close up about connections I said the
sine<00:02:04.820> wave<00:02:04.970> inverter<00:02:05.030> here<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:07.280> negative

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
sine wave inverter here the negative

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
sine wave inverter here the negative
terminal<00:02:08.240> and<00:02:08.920> negative<00:02:09.970> or<00:02:10.970> black<00:02:11.240> terminal

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
terminal and negative or black terminal

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.880 
terminal and negative or black terminal
for<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:14.750> comfort<00:02:15.230> indicator<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:17.890> same

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
for the the comfort indicator so same

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.450 
for the the comfort indicator so same
thing<00:02:18.920> on<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.580> positive<00:02:20.060> side<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:25.280> now<00:02:25.400> we

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
thing on the positive side so now we

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:32.370 
thing on the positive side so now we
have<00:02:25.640> everything<00:02:26.090> back<00:02:26.330> in<00:02:26.780> place<00:02:29.740> with<00:02:30.740> our

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
have everything back in place with our

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:45.690 
have everything back in place with our
comfort<00:02:33.380> indicator<00:02:33.920> installed<00:02:34.430> still

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.220 

now<00:02:46.700> with<00:02:46.909> our<00:02:46.939> battery<00:02:47.420> connected<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:50.230> power

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
now with our battery connected and power

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.190 
now with our battery connected and power
inverter<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:52.280> can't<00:02:52.670> see<00:02:53.390> that<00:02:53.569> well<00:02:53.780> when<00:02:54.170> I

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
inverter you can't see that well when I

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:09.949 
inverter you can't see that well when I
flip<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:54.680> on<00:03:05.230> we<00:03:06.230> got<00:03:06.379> a<00:03:06.409> Caucasus<00:03:07.040> running

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.890 

we<00:03:35.860> do<00:03:36.040> usually<00:03:36.610> run<00:03:37.030> with<00:03:37.210> a<00:03:37.300> cop<00:03:37.510> assist

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
we do usually run with a cop assist
