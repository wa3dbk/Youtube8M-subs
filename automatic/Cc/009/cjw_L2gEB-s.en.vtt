00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.220
 Well I tell you, it works a bit 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.800
 workshop trying to adapt what is the 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.230
 art crafts and at play the 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.600
 intention is to rescue many of the 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.150
 lost trades that have been left in 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.449
 time or they have gone caleÃ±o and their 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.519
 portray individuality rescued what 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.570
 what one can do for oneself to 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.250
 give away 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.640
 also rescue a little relationships 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.950
 human 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.500
 It is a way of sharing sharing 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.980
 making us see reflected in that what 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.110
 what do we do 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.110
 and change a little 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.940
 yesterday it lasts three months and there is what 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:14.110
 we do to see everything that would be the 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:16.960
 garment skirt pattern we see 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.100
 the body part of torso and we see 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.009
 screen 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.100
 generally what is done is what is seen 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.350
 called base pattern which is a pattern of 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.100
 body of the person to whom it is going 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.100
 to make the garment 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.390
 we learn to make patterns with 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.450
 our measurements the base pattern is like 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.030
 a pattern of our body on this 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.620
 outline let's do the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.440
 transformations necessary for the 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.080
 model can start help you want is 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.150
 we will see the thing inside the 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.130
 level of each person we are working 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.439
 a little bit with each one 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.450
 and pattern design is usually 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.730
 considered a discipline that rather 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.280
 theoretical 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.470
 then clear to study pattern design 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.500
 Sometimes it can be very heavy 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.400
 much formula much line much drawing 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.890
 technical try all these things that 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.530
 apparently they are very difficult and that in 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.170
 actually they are not so much but try 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.450
 take it say at the user level 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.340
 we aim for a non-formal education 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.250
 and that has to do with the person 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.379
 may think he can take his time 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.170
 to do things and be respect 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:34.170
 the learning processes of each 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.280
 and because we believe that there is also no need 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.510
 suffer to learn but can 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.110
 learn having fun having fun 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.500
 establishing links with 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.500
 companions
