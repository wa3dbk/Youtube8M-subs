that's<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.270> sample<00:00:42.629> right<00:00:42.719> there<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.110> little

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
that's a sample right there that little

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.040 
that's a sample right there that little
keychain<00:00:43.590> there<00:00:44.219> it's<00:00:44.670> much<00:00:45.030> quieter<00:00:45.360> pretty

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
keychain there it's much quieter pretty

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.319

is the linear q sk q s1 and you can see

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.709 
is the linear q sk q s1 and you can see
up<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:02.250> really<00:01:02.550> does<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> very<00:01:03.000> good<00:01:03.239> job<00:01:03.300> that

up it really does a very good job that

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.719 
up it really does a very good job that
while<00:01:03.870> typing<00:01:04.229> while<00:01:04.710> gaming<00:01:05.070> doesn't<00:01:05.580> feel

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
while typing while gaming doesn't feel

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.960 
while typing while gaming doesn't feel
really<00:01:06.090> strange<00:01:06.810> or<00:01:07.290> or<00:01:07.880> difficult<00:01:08.880> to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
really strange or or difficult to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.670 
really strange or or difficult to
actually<00:01:09.420> do<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.689> different<00:01:10.020> tasks<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.560> you

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
do now of course with this keyboard as a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.800 
do now of course with this keyboard as a
gamer<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.979> do<00:01:14.159> have<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.520> larger<00:01:15.180> space<00:01:15.479> bars

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810

gamer you do have that larger space bars
you<00:01:16.020> can<00:01:16.170> even<00:01:16.320> see<00:01:16.590> clearly<00:01:16.770> while<00:01:17.159> I'm

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
space bar to give easy access to the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.320 
space bar to give easy access to the
space<00:01:21.990> bar<00:01:22.259> some<00:01:22.890> people<00:01:23.310> may<00:01:23.520> go<00:01:23.700> well<00:01:24.090> that's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
space bar some people may go well that's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.090

Engine 3 but what you have here with

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.039 
Engine 3 but what you have here with
this<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.860> really<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.340> keyboard<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.240> use<00:02:03.780> is

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
this is really a keyboard that in use is

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.100 
this is really a keyboard that in use is
really<00:02:04.830> quiet<00:02:05.159> really<00:02:05.820> effective<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.630> very

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
really quiet really effective and very

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.919 
really quiet really effective and very
very<00:02:07.590> fast<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.369> something<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.390> really

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
very fast it's something that is really

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.130 
very fast it's something that is really
hard<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.380> explain<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:11.039> video<00:02:11.430> but<00:02:12.420> once<00:02:12.989> you

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
hard to explain on video but once you

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.680 
hard to explain on video but once you
actually<00:02:13.290> use<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.069> keys<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:14.940> very<00:02:15.390> very

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
actually use the keys it's a very very

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.510 
actually use the keys it's a very very
sublime<00:02:16.380> experience<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.100> something<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.459> think

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
sublime experience and something I think

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.580 
sublime experience and something I think
a<00:02:17.760> lot<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.390> people<00:02:18.810> will<00:02:18.930> actually<00:02:19.080> truly

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
a lot of people will actually truly

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.530 
a lot of people will actually truly
appreciate<00:02:20.220> now<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.700> size<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.180> keyboard

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
appreciate now the size of the keyboard

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.020 
appreciate now the size of the keyboard
is<00:02:21.720> small<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.290> if<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.560> check<00:02:22.739> out<00:02:22.920> our<00:02:23.100> boxing

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
is small and if you check out our boxing

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.550 
is small and if you check out our boxing
video<00:02:24.330> it's<00:02:24.540> actually<00:02:24.900> smaller<00:02:25.170> than<00:02:25.440> the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
video it's actually smaller than the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.949 
video it's actually smaller than the
original<00:02:25.650> apex<00:02:26.370> which<00:02:26.550> had<00:02:26.760> more<00:02:27.269> macro<00:02:27.750> key

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
original apex which had more macro key

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.380 
original apex which had more macro key
sets<00:02:28.290> on<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.650> side<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.730> also<00:02:29.940> volume

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
controls on the right hand side of the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.470 
controls on the right hand side of the
keyboard

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
keyboard

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.050 
keyboard
this<00:02:33.600> is<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.750> much<00:02:33.989> slimmer<00:02:34.380> trim<00:02:34.860> down<00:02:35.069> fit<00:02:35.850> and

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
this is a much slimmer trim down fit and

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.759 
this is a much slimmer trim down fit and
feel<00:02:36.390> for<00:02:36.569> the<00:02:36.660> keyboard<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.470> it's<00:02:37.620> actually

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
feel for the keyboard so it's actually

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.890 
feel for the keyboard so it's actually
much<00:02:38.220> easier<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.880> actually<00:02:39.000> fit<00:02:39.300> on<00:02:39.330> frame<00:02:39.690> now

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
much easier to actually fit on frame now

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.890 
much easier to actually fit on frame now
there<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.290> no<00:02:40.680> rest<00:02:41.670> pad<00:02:41.940> for<00:02:42.180> your<00:02:42.300> wrist<00:02:42.540> but

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
there is no rest pad for your wrist but

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.960 
there is no rest pad for your wrist but
I<00:02:43.170> found<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:44.010> easy<00:02:44.250> to<00:02:44.340> actually<00:02:44.550> use<00:02:44.819> the

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
I found it easy to actually use the

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.630 
I found it easy to actually use the
keyboard<00:02:45.450> in<00:02:45.720> gaming<00:02:46.680> session<00:02:47.069> as<00:02:47.190> well<00:02:47.340> just

of things first thing of course we can
do<00:03:01.829> is<00:03:01.950> just<00:03:02.100> change<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.610> illumination<00:03:03.209> we<00:03:04.170> do

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
do is just change the illumination we do

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.050 
do is just change the illumination we do
have<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.500> couple<00:03:04.829> of<00:03:04.890> active<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.579> idle

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
have a couple of active and idle

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.199 
have a couple of active and idle
controls<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:07.110> can<00:03:07.230> actually<00:03:07.410> set<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.910> the

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
controls you can actually set and the

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.319 
controls you can actually set and the
i/o<00:03:09.329> controls<00:03:09.980> set<00:03:10.980> sidles<00:03:11.430> in<00:03:11.579> 60<00:03:11.940> second<00:03:12.269> you

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
i/o controls set sidles in 60 second you

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.150 
i/o controls set sidles in 60 second you
can<00:03:12.450> disable<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:12.989> you<00:03:13.500> can<00:03:13.650> do<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.920> effects

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
can disable that you can do the effects

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.190 
can disable that you can do the effects
if<00:03:14.310> you<00:03:14.370> do<00:03:14.519> things<00:03:15.000> like<00:03:15.150> steady<00:03:15.540> color<00:03:15.930> shift

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
if you do things like steady color shift

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.890 
if you do things like steady color shift
breeding<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:17.060> disable<00:03:18.060> illumination<00:03:18.690> so<00:03:18.810> you

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
breeding and disable illumination so you

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.690 
breeding and disable illumination so you
can<00:03:19.019> actually<00:03:19.320> do<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.590> or<00:03:19.859> you<00:03:20.400> can<00:03:20.549> also

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
can actually do that or you can also

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
can actually do that or you can also
have<00:03:20.970> active<00:03:21.540> effects<00:03:22.130> color<00:03:23.130> shift<00:03:23.660> you<00:03:24.660> can

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
have active effects color shift you can

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.650 
have active effects color shift you can
also<00:03:24.959> do<00:03:25.170> wave<00:03:25.560> speed<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:27.060> what<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.390> want

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
also do wave speed and what you want

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.780 
also do wave speed and what you want
those<00:03:27.930> things<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.410> be<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:29.010> so<00:03:29.609> on<00:03:29.700> our

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
those things to be and so on our

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.400 
those things to be and so on our
software<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.120> can<00:03:30.239> save<00:03:30.450> those<00:03:30.750> different

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
software you can save those different

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.680 
software you can save those different
configurations<00:03:32.010> now<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:33.120> can<00:03:33.239> also<00:03:33.390> pick

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
configurations now you can also pick

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.800 
configurations now you can also pick
from<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.930> very<00:03:34.170> many<00:03:34.500> templates<00:03:34.980> which<00:03:35.400> we

from<00:04:48.120> so<00:04:48.600> that's<00:04:48.780> that<00:04:51.710> mention<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.800> keyboard

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
from so that's that mention the keyboard

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.570 
from so that's that mention the keyboard
is<00:04:53.490> smaller<00:04:54.080> compared<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:55.140> JPEG<00:04:55.470> saw<00:04:55.950> or<00:04:56.160> older

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
is smaller compared to JPEG saw or older

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.640 
is smaller compared to JPEG saw or older
sibling<00:04:56.730> from<00:04:57.090> edge<00:04:57.330> to<00:04:57.360> edge<00:04:57.660> the<00:04:58.500> other

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
sibling from edge to edge the other

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.230 
sibling from edge to edge the other
thing<00:04:58.920> also<00:04:59.100> is<00:04:59.280> looking<00:04:59.400> at<00:04:59.580> elimination

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
thing also is looking at elimination

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.510 
thing also is looking at elimination
it's<00:05:00.690> underneath<00:05:01.170> the<00:05:01.350> keys<00:05:01.740> as<00:05:01.980> well<00:05:02.400> as

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
it's underneath the keys as well as

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.520 
it's underneath the keys as well as
going<00:05:02.910> through<00:05:03.150> the<00:05:03.570> key<00:05:03.870> labels<00:05:04.350> so

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
going through the key labels so

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.110 
going through the key labels so
basically<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:04.980> letters<00:05:05.310> on<00:05:05.460> each<00:05:05.580> keys<00:05:05.910> are

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
basically the letters on each keys are

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.630 
basically the letters on each keys are
also<00:05:06.360> eliminated<00:05:06.630> so<00:05:07.500> you<00:05:07.560> get<00:05:07.830> one<00:05:08.280> potent

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
also eliminated so you get one potent

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.730 
also eliminated so you get one potent
full<00:05:08.850> illumination<00:05:09.600> of<00:05:09.720> across<00:05:10.170> the<00:05:10.470> keyboard

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
full illumination of across the keyboard

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.950 
full illumination of across the keyboard
now<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.580> very<00:05:11.790> top<00:05:12.060> is<00:05:12.240> where<00:05:12.420> you<00:05:12.540> have<00:05:12.780> your
