there and the whole pile group is
attacking<00:00:59.090> him<00:01:01.690> this<00:01:02.690> is<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.020> low-level

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
attacking him this is the low-level

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.280 
attacking him this is the low-level
version<00:01:04.190> of<00:01:04.339> helix<00:01:04.850> he<00:01:05.660> just<00:01:06.020> basically

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
version of helix he just basically

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.830 
version of helix he just basically
stands<00:01:06.890> there<00:01:07.250> he<00:01:07.700> cannot<00:01:07.970> be<00:01:08.180> killed<00:01:08.390> he<00:01:08.630> see

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
stands there he cannot be killed he see

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.830 
stands there he cannot be killed he see
his<00:01:09.050> it's<00:01:09.979> just<00:01:10.280> standing<00:01:10.610> out<00:01:10.729> there<00:01:10.840> it's

his it's just standing out there it's

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.760 
his it's just standing out there it's
totally<00:01:12.320> immortal<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:14.500> this<00:01:15.500> is<00:01:15.650> the

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
totally immortal and this is the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.520 
totally immortal and this is the
low-level<00:01:16.040> version<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:17.000> high<00:01:17.810> level<00:01:17.990> version

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
low-level version the high level version

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.940 
low-level version the high level version
from<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.160> 85<00:01:19.790> heroic<00:01:20.240> instance<00:01:20.950> will

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
from the 85 heroic instance will

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.969 
from the 85 heroic instance will
actually<00:01:22.490> attack<00:01:23.450> you<00:01:23.930> throw<00:01:24.530> bombs<00:01:24.770> around

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
actually attack you throw bombs around

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.530 
actually attack you throw bombs around
and<00:01:25.250> stuff<00:01:25.430> much<00:01:25.670> as<00:01:25.910> he<00:01:26.030> does<00:01:26.180> in<00:01:26.240> the

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
and stuff much as he does in the

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.440 
and stuff much as he does in the
instance<00:01:27.310> this<00:01:28.310> low-level<00:01:28.640> version<00:01:29.119> is<00:01:29.240> quite

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
instance this low-level version is quite

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.170 
instance this low-level version is quite
passive<00:01:31.690> and<00:01:33.130> an<00:01:34.130> interesting<00:01:34.580> side<00:01:34.850> effect

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
passive and an interesting side effect

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.290 
passive and an interesting side effect
of<00:01:35.590> this<00:01:36.590> exploits<00:01:37.430> that<00:01:37.550> no<00:01:37.820> one<00:01:38.000> will<00:01:38.150> be

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
of this exploits that no one will be

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.990 
of this exploits that no one will be
able<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.600> mount<00:01:39.100> because<00:01:40.100> they<00:01:40.490> can't<00:01:40.759> kill

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
able to mount because they can't kill

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.910 
able to mount because they can't kill
helix<00:01:41.450> so<00:01:41.930> they<00:01:42.050> can't<00:01:42.259> get<00:01:42.410> out<00:01:42.440> of<00:01:42.680> combat

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
helix so they can't get out of combat

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.670 
helix so they can't get out of combat
and<00:01:43.729> he's<00:01:44.119> combat<00:01:44.509> radius<00:01:44.690> because<00:01:45.259> he's<00:01:45.440> from

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
and he's combat radius because he's from

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.850 
and he's combat radius because he's from
an<00:01:45.800> instances<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:47.780> entire<00:01:48.140> instance<00:01:48.680> that

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
an instances the entire instance that

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.050 
an instances the entire instance that
urine<00:01:49.280> which<00:01:49.430> is<00:01:49.580> the<00:01:49.700> whole<00:01:49.850> of<00:01:49.880> the

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
urine which is the whole of the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.210 
urine which is the whole of the
background<00:01:50.660> so<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:51.229> actually<00:01:51.560> have<00:01:51.770> to<00:01:51.979> drop

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
background so you actually have to drop

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.660 
background so you actually have to drop
bulk<00:01:52.550> you<00:01:52.970> have<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.240> actually<00:01:53.420> drop<00:01:53.869> combat<00:01:54.670> to

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
bulk you have to actually drop combat to

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.950 
bulk you have to actually drop combat to
be<00:01:55.790> able<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:56.119> mount<00:01:56.300> up<00:01:57.369> okay<00:01:58.369> so<00:01:58.509> this<00:01:59.509> looks

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
be able to mount up okay so this looks

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.969 
be able to mount up okay so this looks
like<00:02:00.170> a<00:02:00.280> bit<00:02:01.280> of<00:02:01.310> fun<00:02:01.640> or<00:02:02.649> just<00:02:03.649> a<00:02:03.740> bit<00:02:03.890> of

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
like a bit of fun or just a bit of

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.139 
like a bit of fun or just a bit of
griefing<00:02:04.399> perhaps<00:02:05.000> but<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:06.500> potential

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
griefing perhaps but the potential

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.309 
griefing perhaps but the potential
applications<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.270> this<00:02:08.390> are<00:02:08.630> quite<00:02:09.020> gang

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
applications of this are quite gang

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.530 
applications of this are quite gang
breaking<00:02:09.830> because<00:02:10.220> you<00:02:10.399> can<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:11.209> can<00:02:11.360> take

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
breaking because you can you can take

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.400 
breaking because you can you can take
her<00:02:11.780> helix<00:02:12.260> into<00:02:12.830> any<00:02:13.340> instance<00:02:14.410> clearing

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
her helix into any instance clearing

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.090 
her helix into any instance clearing
things<00:02:15.530> like<00:02:15.770> dungeons<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:17.709> you<00:02:18.709> may<00:02:18.920> know

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
things like dungeons and you may know

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.890 
things like dungeons and you may know
offer<00:02:19.280> an<00:02:19.760> exploit<00:02:20.180> which<00:02:20.390> was<00:02:20.600> used<00:02:20.750> by

offer an exploit which was used by
shaman's<00:02:21.700> quite<00:02:22.700> recently<00:02:23.270> to<00:02:24.970> maintain

the flame shock would regenerate the
