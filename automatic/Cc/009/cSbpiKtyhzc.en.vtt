 Because my Roiro-chan looks like recording a browser 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:46.380
 I've put url in the summary section so I downloaded it from there and downloaded it 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.160
 When you start up something like a screen comes out 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:54.870
 With iphone connected to a computer 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.570

 Others, such as put in the way and recommendations of Let's play in the grade which is not indebted to the police application after 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:54.420

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:57.090
 It is going to be up for the time being, but I was originally in jailbreak, so I decided to do various things 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:02.460
