00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.300
 oncoming traffic can be seen planted 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.920
 trees that is every piece of land 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.490

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.780
 milk 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.110
 after vata and me honestly very 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.780
 surprising number of frets years here and 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.400
 number of small children 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.610
 the number of pregnant women is huge 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.409
 quantity is a lot that is this 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.630
 what 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.630
 the country develops ult develops 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:44.540
 and on the left side of the truth now it is not 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:49.790
 it can be seen there like in the dark into the dark 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.790
 you in Moscow this is her very center down 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.260
 of course here is a shop and all sorts and 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:00.290
 we talked about the cinema under 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.710
 right son plex with and us this is big 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.410
 complex 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.410
 cinemas which we talked about 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.590
 know all this in the accessibility area and with 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.599
 right side I don't know the camera 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.599
 shows this element on letters with 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.910
 combat metro station 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.360
 that is, it does not burn nothing sparkles 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.870
 ordinary 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.750
 without illumination, even that is , in general 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.710
 know where the exit 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.710
 and the entrance to the subway 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.180
 and there are a lot of them built too 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.940
 of course investors invest in 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.590
 canadian economy 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.769
 already a minister 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.170
 immigration said i was this investor 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.410
 we bring 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.760
 to the fact that they bring money to Canada and 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.680
 invest them in is it 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.700
 it is known that big rich and 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:04.550
 are the representatives of the Chinese are China 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.019
 the chinese even but in general i 'm very 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.240
 respect this nation they really 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.000
 hardworking 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.650
 work as in the account 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.290
 but these are our two parallel cultures 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.300
 west and east 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.170
 if you get used to 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.280
 live and eat what they eat here 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.280
 still in kamikatsu go 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.550
 then maybe you need to get used to it 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.490
 of course this is another culture 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.930
 nothing to do with it over to you about 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.190
 where faith lives very much 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.190
 Chinese representatives 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:48.370
 i was sure you were driving we were there 8 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.950
 hours flew to australia and of course we 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.920
 took a tour of the city drove 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.800
 watched asked what it is because 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.070
 that they wanted to leave some impression 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.610
 from this city in terms of 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:07.110
 architecture to be honest about 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.480
 the same as here all the same 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:12.660
 but the representatives of china there are much 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.660
 more 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.720
 and understand that every nation carries its 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.370
 colt is the spiritual part of the city ​​where he lives 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.370
 therefore the one who chooses he died 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.150
 look a little like that 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.960
 you live among 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.800
 eastern people 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.400
 lie agreement 100 their culture and language 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.400
 mentality 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.330
 besides, I really liked in 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.870
 hangar as relate to the surrounding 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:49.310
 nature is so careful 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:54.520
 neatly awesome unique park 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.520
 around you hoover multilateral 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.729
 but 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:02.590
 per second they ask me to rebuild on 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.409
 right because I wanted to show some 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.770
 very important bottleneck something not yet 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:07.770
 I know 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.970
 will be able to rebuild 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:23.820
 I do not like the Vancouver note 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.820
 that vancouver is standing on the ocean 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.180
 lined up everything went round brew that to me 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.430
 like demolition stands by the ocean 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.789
 mean very wet and wet weather 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.680
 it means it will be so soft 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:46.210
 winter 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:49.509
 damp in summer there will be a lot of rain and 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:54.199
 Do not forget that there is a stormy charge and 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:56.270
 will be consistently frequent 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:57.979
 earthquakes and really when we 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.760
 were in ankara we sat in a restaurant 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:04.580
 had dinner at the fish restaurant on right 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.430
 directly on the surface of the water I'm a very 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:10.190
 interesting then he stood i think whether this 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:13.419
 the wave went either this earthquake so 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.889
 looked puzzled on the basis of a companion 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:18.050
 she also looked at me and became 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:21.010
 look around see how people react 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.010
 in a restaurant 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:27.580
 here on the Yankees on the right is 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:31.319
 Ukrainian bank 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.319
 by the way for those who are from Ukraine 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:37.750
 and all visitors to this restaurant with 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.700
 they also looked at each other with surprise 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:42.490
 and from then looked at the wyrda you saw 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.870
 how swing and swing chandeliers and then 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:48.010
 everyone understood yes it was small 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:50.170
 earthquake ie earthquake there 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.580
 will be felt constantly do not forget 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.430
 because thieves 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:58.000
 Highlands view of course opens 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:01.690
 completely unusual but opens and with 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.880
 ocean side and mountain side and when 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.760
 we flew on a plane I looked down 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:09.190
 eliminator and I only saw beautiful 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.550
 nature is so beautiful interesting 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.550
 the mountains 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:23.380
 so who loves this unusual 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:25.120
 exotics then feel free to choose yourself 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.580
 I asked if I wanted to live for you 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.129
 have bought 

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:32.340
 I said no, after traveling there 

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:34.229
 would not want to live in vancouver first 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.460
 the city is quite expensive the same 

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:38.039
 dear like toronto 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:44.729
 real estate there is exactly such 

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:45.590
 same dear as here in toronto but me 

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:48.030
 arranges 

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.669
 that after all you are a little bit second 

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:53.810
 more people from europe it's me somehow 

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:53.810
 more satisfied 

00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:58.210
 because all the same lives among 

00:07:56.229 --> 00:08:01.740
 Chinese population you will need 

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.740
 know Chinese 

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.090
 go home
