diet<00:00:10.740> as<00:00:11.070> opposed<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.519> what<00:00:11.580> we<00:00:11.700> would<00:00:11.820> spend

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
diet as opposed to what we would spend

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.820 
diet as opposed to what we would spend
normally<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.990> honestly<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.500> think<00:00:13.620> it's

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
normally and honestly I think it's

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.709 
normally and honestly I think it's
probably<00:00:14.040> about<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.460> same<00:00:14.730> other<00:00:15.360> than<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
probably about the same other than the

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.120 
probably about the same other than the
fact<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:16.049> I'm<00:00:16.230> trying<00:00:16.529> like<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> new<00:00:16.920> recipe

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
fact that I'm trying like a new recipe

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.040 
fact that I'm trying like a new recipe
so<00:00:17.520> I'm<00:00:17.609> having<00:00:17.730> invest<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.420> different<00:00:18.869> things

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
so I'm having invest in different things

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.990 
so I'm having invest in different things
that<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.289> would<00:00:19.439> normally<00:00:19.529> beginning<00:00:20.039> but

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
that I would normally beginning but

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.670 
that I would normally beginning but
pretty<00:00:21.210> much<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.480> think<00:00:21.630> it's<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.840> same<00:00:22.109> weesp

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680
