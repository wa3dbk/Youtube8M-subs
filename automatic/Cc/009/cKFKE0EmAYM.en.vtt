releasing is a new game mode and it's

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.270

called<00:01:18.299> clean<00:01:18.659> sweep<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.560> an<00:01:19.710> elimination

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
called clean sweep it's an elimination

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.609 
called clean sweep it's an elimination
type<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.670> game<00:01:20.880> mode<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.360> goes<00:01:21.600> three<00:01:22.200> rounds

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
type of game mode it goes three rounds

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.550

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
so think of it as kind of like a team

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.020 
so think of it as kind of like a team
assault<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:28.439> when<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.829> die<00:01:29.070> that's<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.700> you

listening<00:03:18.650> to<00:03:18.829> the<00:03:18.919> community<00:03:19.040> so<00:03:19.730> anyways

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
listening to the community so anyways

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.379 
listening to the community so anyways
I'll<00:03:20.959> get<00:03:21.139> into<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.379> bit<00:03:21.590> of<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.799> patch

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
I'll get into a bit of the patch

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.250 
I'll get into a bit of the patch
improvements<00:03:23.389> that<00:03:23.480> I've<00:03:23.599> noticed<00:03:24.019> that

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
improvements that I've noticed that

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.199 
improvements that I've noticed that
we're<00:03:25.160> most<00:03:25.340> important<00:03:25.730> that<00:03:25.849> I<00:03:25.879> think<00:03:26.090> that

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
we're most important that I think that

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.930 
we're most important that I think that
you<00:03:26.299> guys<00:03:26.329> would<00:03:26.599> be<00:03:26.720> interested<00:03:26.810> in<00:03:27.639> so<00:03:28.639> I've

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
you guys would be interested in so I've

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.470 
you guys would be interested in so I've
noticed<00:03:29.329> that<00:03:29.419> they've<00:03:31.120> effect<00:03:32.120> they<00:03:32.299> vow

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
noticed that they've effect they vow

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.240 
noticed that they've effect they vow
change<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.989> effect<00:03:33.290> on<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.560> accuracy<00:03:33.859> when

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
change the effect on the accuracy when

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.360 
change the effect on the accuracy when
jumping<00:03:34.489> around<00:03:34.760> so<00:03:35.980> obviously<00:03:36.980> they<00:03:37.220> would

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
jumping around so obviously they would

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.189 
jumping around so obviously they would
reduce<00:03:37.699> the<00:03:37.879> accuracy<00:03:38.299> right<00:03:38.660> now<00:03:38.870> when<00:03:39.109> you

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:39.199 
reduce the accuracy right now when you

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.379 
reduce the accuracy right now when you
jump<00:03:39.470> around<00:03:39.799> there's<00:03:40.220> no<00:03:40.459> real<00:03:40.699> bloom<00:03:41.060> on<00:03:41.269> the

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
jump around there's no real bloom on the

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:44.439 
jump around there's no real bloom on the
crosshair<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:42.639> they've<00:03:43.639> pretty<00:03:44.359> much

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
crosshair and they've pretty much

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.449 
crosshair and they've pretty much
increased<00:03:45.019> that<00:03:45.230> so<00:03:45.500> you<00:03:45.560> get<00:03:45.799> bit<00:03:46.220> less<00:03:46.430> of

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
increased that so you get bit less of

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.580 
increased that so you get bit less of
those<00:03:46.669> halo<00:03:47.090> gunfights<00:03:47.660> when<00:03:47.959> it's<00:03:48.109> one<00:03:48.560> on

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
those halo gunfights when it's one on

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.900 
those halo gunfights when it's one on
one<00:03:49.150> situations<00:03:50.150> I<00:03:50.690> find<00:03:50.930> I<00:03:51.019> do<00:03:51.079> that<00:03:51.349> a<00:03:51.379> lot

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
one situations I find I do that a lot

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.110 
one situations I find I do that a lot
along<00:03:52.910> with<00:03:52.940> um<00:03:53.299> I<00:03:53.540> failed<00:03:53.870> drop<00:03:54.409> shot<00:03:54.620> at<00:03:54.739> 10

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
along with um I failed drop shot at 10

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.759 
along with um I failed drop shot at 10
accidentally<00:03:56.120> knifing<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:56.659> air<00:03:56.780> but<00:03:57.560> I<00:03:57.620> found

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
accidentally knifing the air but I found

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.379 
accidentally knifing the air but I found
that<00:03:57.919> was<00:03:58.069> interesting<00:03:58.579> they've<00:03:59.239> also

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
that was interesting they've also

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:00.909 
that was interesting they've also
increased<00:03:59.930> the<00:03:59.989> points<00:04:00.409> that<00:04:00.500> you<00:04:00.560> need<00:04:00.769> to

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
increased the points that you need to

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.089 
increased the points that you need to
win<00:04:01.099> a<00:04:01.310> sector<00:04:01.730> control<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.329> team<00:04:03.079> assault<00:04:03.409> so

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:04.099 
win a sector control and team assault so

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:06.009 
win a sector control and team assault so
as<00:04:04.430> you<00:04:04.609> know<00:04:04.639> if<00:04:05.000> you<00:04:05.150> play<00:04:05.359> this<00:04:05.389> game<00:04:05.690> to<00:04:05.930> win

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
as you know if you play this game to win

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.170 
as you know if you play this game to win
a<00:04:06.079> team<00:04:06.319> of<00:04:06.440> salt<00:04:06.650> you<00:04:06.769> need<00:04:06.919> 120<00:04:07.609> points<00:04:07.819> now

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
a team of salt you need 120 points now

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.479 
a team of salt you need 120 points now
that's<00:04:08.359> not<00:04:08.859> 1200<00:04:09.859> points<00:04:09.979> that's<00:04:10.340> not

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
that's not 1200 points that's not

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.500 
that's not 1200 points that's not
necessarily<00:04:11.199> 120<00:04:12.199> kills<00:04:12.760> other<00:04:13.760> factors<00:04:14.299> such

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
necessarily 120 kills other factors such

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.149 
necessarily 120 kills other factors such
as<00:04:14.540> head<00:04:14.870> shots<00:04:15.109> which<00:04:15.229> add<00:04:15.500> on<00:04:15.620> another<00:04:15.739> 5

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:16.159 
as head shots which add on another 5

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:18.849 
as head shots which add on another 5
points<00:04:16.190> or<00:04:16.760> melee<00:04:17.120> killed<00:04:17.630> add<00:04:17.959> another<00:04:18.199> five

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
points or melee killed add another five

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.060 
points or melee killed add another five
points<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.370> lad<00:04:19.669> up<00:04:19.820> to<00:04:20.079> the<00:04:21.079> final<00:04:21.739> score<00:04:21.829> for

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
points a lad up to the final score for

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.200 
points a lad up to the final score for
your<00:04:22.190> team

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
your team

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.540 
your team
so<00:04:23.690> they've<00:04:23.840> increased<00:04:24.110> that<00:04:24.350> to<00:04:24.410> 1400<00:04:25.370> points

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
so they've increased that to 1400 points

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.860 
so they've increased that to 1400 points
so<00:04:25.759> that<00:04:25.789> I'll<00:04:25.970> just<00:04:26.090> make<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.419> games<00:04:26.630> go<00:04:26.840> a

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
so that I'll just make the games go a

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.050 
so that I'll just make the games go a
little<00:04:27.080> bit<00:04:27.289> longer<00:04:27.500> which<00:04:28.310> you<00:04:28.639> know<00:04:28.669> I<00:04:28.789> don't

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
little bit longer which you know I don't

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.490 
little bit longer which you know I don't
mind<00:04:29.240> and<00:04:29.479> I<00:04:29.509> hope<00:04:29.630> that<00:04:29.660> you<00:04:29.930> guys<00:04:30.050> don't<00:04:30.289> mind

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
mind and I hope that you guys don't mind

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.749 
mind and I hope that you guys don't mind
that<00:04:30.710> either<00:04:30.889> that<00:04:31.250> means<00:04:31.430> along<00:04:31.639> the

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
that either that means along the

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.670 
that either that means along the
gameplay<00:04:32.120> video<00:04:32.360> videos<00:04:32.990> are<00:04:33.319> for<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:33.530> guys

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
gameplay video videos are for you guys

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.589 
gameplay video videos are for you guys
to<00:04:33.860> watch<00:04:34.039> and<00:04:34.849> they've<00:04:34.970> also<00:04:35.120> done<00:04:35.240> the<00:04:35.449> same

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:35.599 
to watch and they've also done the same

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:37.360 
to watch and they've also done the same
thing<00:04:35.660> for<00:04:35.960> sector<00:04:36.289> control<00:04:36.620> so<00:04:37.099> they've

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
thing for sector control so they've

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.339 
thing for sector control so they've
increased<00:04:37.639> the<00:04:37.880> points<00:04:38.240> to<00:04:38.449> win<00:04:38.660> to<00:04:39.370> 2600<00:04:40.370> from

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
increased the points to win to 2600 from

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.800 
increased the points to win to 2600 from
1800<00:04:42.349> so<00:04:42.530> that's<00:04:42.710> a<00:04:42.830> pretty<00:04:43.009> big<00:04:43.280> jump<00:04:43.580> and<00:04:43.880> I

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
1800 so that's a pretty big jump and I

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.480 
1800 so that's a pretty big jump and I
think<00:04:44.990> that<00:04:45.229> that<00:04:45.500> will<00:04:45.590> extend<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:46.039> game<00:04:46.250> for

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
think that that will extend the game for

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.040 
think that that will extend the game for
about<00:04:46.699> two<00:04:46.940> minutes<00:04:47.150> or<00:04:47.419> so<00:04:47.479> at<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:47.870> moment

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
about two minutes or so at the moment

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.839 
about two minutes or so at the moment
the<00:04:48.319> average<00:04:48.590> game<00:04:48.830> goes<00:04:49.069> for<00:04:49.280> about<00:04:49.370> six

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849 
the average game goes for about six

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:51.400 
the average game goes for about six
minutes<00:04:50.030> so<00:04:50.330> we're<00:04:50.449> looking<00:04:50.539> at<00:04:50.720> about<00:04:50.840> eight

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
minutes so we're looking at about eight

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.670 
minutes so we're looking at about eight
to<00:04:51.650> ten<00:04:51.830> minutes<00:04:51.949> with<00:04:52.639> this<00:04:52.819> change<00:04:53.680> they've

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
to ten minutes with this change they've

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.409 
to ten minutes with this change they've
also<00:04:54.860> decreased<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:55.669> accuracy<00:04:56.180> when

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
also decreased the accuracy when

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.680 
also decreased the accuracy when
shooting<00:04:56.660> from<00:04:56.930> the<00:04:56.990> hip<00:04:57.110> so<00:04:58.039> I<00:04:58.490> did<00:04:59.479> notice

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
shooting from the hip so I did notice

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.659 
shooting from the hip so I did notice
that<00:04:59.870> especially<00:05:00.650> with<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:00.919> pistol<00:05:01.160> you<00:05:01.520> can

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
that especially with the pistol you can

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.460 
that especially with the pistol you can
pretty<00:05:01.820> much<00:05:01.910> hipfire<00:05:02.479> and<00:05:02.690> always<00:05:03.020> get<00:05:03.259> the

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
pretty much hipfire and always get the

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.240 
pretty much hipfire and always get the
kills<00:05:04.009> um<00:05:04.840> so<00:05:05.840> maybe<00:05:06.110> that's<00:05:06.349> adding<00:05:07.009> a<00:05:07.099> bit

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
kills um so maybe that's adding a bit

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.850 
kills um so maybe that's adding a bit
more<00:05:07.310> spread<00:05:08.270> and<00:05:08.539> decreased<00:05:09.259> accuracy<00:05:09.740> you

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
more spread and decreased accuracy you

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.950 
more spread and decreased accuracy you
might<00:05:10.009> have<00:05:10.130> to<00:05:10.340> practice<00:05:11.330> a<00:05:11.449> bit<00:05:11.479> more<00:05:11.840> and

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
might have to practice a bit more and

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.379 
might have to practice a bit more and
you're<00:05:12.080> zooming<00:05:12.410> in<00:05:12.620> now<00:05:12.849> they've<00:05:13.849> also<00:05:14.000> cut

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
you're zooming in now they've also cut

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.270 
you're zooming in now they've also cut
the<00:05:14.599> point<00:05:15.050> from<00:05:15.229> the<00:05:15.349> score<00:05:15.620> chain<00:05:15.860> rewards

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
the point from the score chain rewards

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.450 
the point from the score chain rewards
in<00:05:16.370> half<00:05:16.580> now<00:05:16.880> I'm<00:05:17.690> not<00:05:17.990> entirely<00:05:18.349> sure<00:05:18.560> in<00:05:19.130> our

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
in half now I'm not entirely sure in our

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.820 
in half now I'm not entirely sure in our
interpreting<00:05:20.150> this<00:05:20.330> but<00:05:21.229> I<00:05:21.259> guess<00:05:21.560> we'll<00:05:21.710> have

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
interpreting this but I guess we'll have

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.100 
interpreting this but I guess we'll have
to<00:05:21.979> see<00:05:22.190> what<00:05:22.550> comes<00:05:22.880> from<00:05:23.030> it<00:05:23.180> I<00:05:23.419> hope<00:05:23.960> that

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
to see what comes from it I hope that

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.950 
to see what comes from it I hope that
they<00:05:24.500> don't<00:05:24.680> mean<00:05:24.979> like<00:05:25.389> instead<00:05:26.389> of<00:05:26.539> using<00:05:26.780> a

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
they don't mean like instead of using a

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.020 
they don't mean like instead of using a
UAV<00:05:27.169> get<00:05:27.440> 15<00:05:27.800> points<00:05:28.009> rather<00:05:28.280> than<00:05:28.400> 30<00:05:28.789> or

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
UAV get 15 points rather than 30 or

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.460 
UAV get 15 points rather than 30 or
something<00:05:29.360> like<00:05:29.449> that<00:05:29.509> I<00:05:29.720> really<00:05:30.110> hope<00:05:30.289> that

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
something like that I really hope that

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.219 
something like that I really hope that
that's<00:05:30.650> not<00:05:30.889> the<00:05:30.949> case<00:05:31.570> but<00:05:32.570> you<00:05:32.960> know<00:05:33.080> we'll

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
that's not the case but you know we'll

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.200 
that's not the case but you know we'll
have<00:05:33.320> to<00:05:33.470> see<00:05:33.680> another<00:05:34.490> big<00:05:34.729> one<00:05:34.849> that<00:05:35.060> you

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
have to see another big one that you

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.730 
have to see another big one that you
guys<00:05:35.360> will<00:05:35.479> be<00:05:35.599> happy<00:05:35.870> with<00:05:36.020> and<00:05:36.199> I<00:05:36.289> know<00:05:36.440> my

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
guys will be happy with and I know my

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.740 
guys will be happy with and I know my
friend<00:05:37.039> Daegu<00:05:37.820> colon<00:05:38.120> will<00:05:38.210> be<00:05:38.300> happy<00:05:38.570> but

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
friend Daegu colon will be happy but

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.689 
friend Daegu colon will be happy but
they<00:05:38.900> have<00:05:39.110> actually<00:05:39.590> nerfed<00:05:39.830> the<00:05:40.009> snipers<00:05:40.520> or

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
they have actually nerfed the snipers or

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:42.939 
they have actually nerfed the snipers or
they<00:05:41.270> will<00:05:41.449> be<00:05:41.509> with<00:05:41.780> this<00:05:41.930> patch<00:05:42.169> for<00:05:42.380> pc<00:05:42.770> and

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
they will be with this patch for pc and

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:45.939 
they will be with this patch for pc and
it's<00:05:43.849> actually<00:05:44.150> a<00:05:44.180> 22<00:05:44.990> shot<00:05:45.229> kill<00:05:45.469> to<00:05:45.620> the<00:05:45.710> body

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 
it's actually a 22 shot kill to the body

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.040 
it's actually a 22 shot kill to the body
now<00:05:46.159> when<00:05:46.729> shooting<00:05:46.909> from<00:05:47.120> a<00:05:47.240> long<00:05:47.419> distance<00:05:47.599> I

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
now when shooting from a long distance I

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.810 
now when shooting from a long distance I
was<00:05:48.710> laughing<00:05:48.919> at<00:05:49.159> when<00:05:49.310> Colin<00:05:49.639> was

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
was laughing at when Colin was

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.610 
was laughing at when Colin was
mentioning<00:05:50.270> that<00:05:50.389> he<00:05:50.449> actually<00:05:50.870> did<00:05:51.320> shoot

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
mentioning that he actually did shoot

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.529 
mentioning that he actually did shoot
someone<00:05:51.919> with<00:05:52.070> a<00:05:52.099> sniper<00:05:52.340> rifle<00:05:52.550> in<00:05:53.030> the<00:05:53.060> ankle

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
someone with a sniper rifle in the ankle

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.930 
someone with a sniper rifle in the ankle
and<00:05:53.630> it<00:05:53.780> killed<00:05:54.050> them<00:05:54.199> which<00:05:54.889> um<00:05:55.190> no<00:05:55.759> that's

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
and it killed them which um no that's

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.310 
and it killed them which um no that's
pretty<00:05:56.150> funny<00:05:56.360> so<00:05:56.630> now<00:05:56.780> that's<00:05:56.990> no<00:05:57.169> longer

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
pretty funny so now that's no longer

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.409 
pretty funny so now that's no longer
possible<00:05:57.610> well<00:05:58.610> not<00:05:58.759> now<00:05:59.030> when<00:05:59.270> they<00:05:59.360> do

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
possible well not now when they do

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:00.820 
possible well not now when they do
release<00:05:59.750> a<00:05:59.780> patch<00:05:59.990> you<00:06:00.169> know<00:06:00.259> what<00:06:00.380> I<00:06:00.409> mean<00:06:00.469> and

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
release a patch you know what I mean and

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.670 
release a patch you know what I mean and
it<00:06:01.699> is<00:06:01.940> a<00:06:01.969> one-shot<00:06:02.330> kill<00:06:02.840> to<00:06:03.139> the<00:06:03.259> body<00:06:03.469> at

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
it is a one-shot kill to the body at

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.159 
it is a one-shot kill to the body at
closer<00:06:04.009> range<00:06:04.460> and<00:06:04.729> i<00:06:04.909> think<00:06:05.150> it<00:06:05.270> was<00:06:05.419> i<00:06:05.750> read

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
closer range and i think it was i read

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.260 
closer range and i think it was i read
12<00:06:06.500> meters<00:06:06.979> or<00:06:07.250> eight<00:06:07.460> meters<00:06:07.820> or<00:06:07.940> something

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
12 meters or eight meters or something

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.219 
12 meters or eight meters or something
which<00:06:08.419> i<00:06:08.719> think<00:06:09.289> is<00:06:09.500> fair<00:06:09.740> enough<00:06:10.449> so<00:06:11.449> they've

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:12.229 
which i think is fair enough so they've

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:13.779 
which i think is fair enough so they've
also<00:06:12.409> increased<00:06:12.919> a<00:06:13.009> recoil<00:06:13.460> on<00:06:13.669> the

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789 
also increased a recoil on the

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:17.350 
also increased a recoil on the
semi-automatic<00:06:14.979> rifles<00:06:15.979> in<00:06:16.340> a<00:06:16.820> sniper<00:06:17.090> class

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
semi-automatic rifles in a sniper class

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.350 
semi-automatic rifles in a sniper class
so<00:06:17.750> that's<00:06:18.020> you<00:06:18.229> know<00:06:18.259> the<00:06:18.530> g3<00:06:18.949> the<00:06:19.099> SVD<00:06:19.460> m21

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
so that's you know the g3 the SVD m21

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.689 
so that's you know the g3 the SVD m21
increased<00:06:20.930> recoil<00:06:21.219> you'll<00:06:22.219> see<00:06:22.400> here<00:06:22.610> I'm

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:22.699 
increased recoil you'll see here I'm

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:26.260 
increased recoil you'll see here I'm
tearing<00:06:23.030> it<00:06:23.120> up<00:06:23.180> with<00:06:23.360> the<00:06:23.449> m21<00:06:24.020> and<00:06:25.030> a<00:06:26.030> couple

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.270 
tearing it up with the m21 and a couple

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.719 
tearing it up with the m21 and a couple
more<00:06:26.509> I've<00:06:26.780> noticed<00:06:27.139> is<00:06:27.650> on<00:06:28.039> all<00:06:28.250> the<00:06:28.280> weapons

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:28.729 
more I've noticed is on all the weapons

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:30.329 
more I've noticed is on all the weapons
they've<00:06:28.940> increased<00:06:29.270> the<00:06:29.539> recoil<00:06:30.050> and

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:30.339 
they've increased the recoil and

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:32.930 
they've increased the recoil and
deviation<00:06:31.339> of<00:06:31.400> the<00:06:31.520> spread

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
deviation of the spread

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.480 
deviation of the spread
another<00:06:33.540> massive<00:06:34.050> factor<00:06:34.530> is<00:06:34.710> they've

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
another massive factor is they've

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.010 
another massive factor is they've
increasing<00:06:36.060> a<00:06:36.120> mortal<00:06:36.420> life<00:06:36.570> from<00:06:36.750> when<00:06:36.930> you

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
increasing a mortal life from when you

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.620 
increasing a mortal life from when you
spawn<00:06:37.290> from<00:06:37.470> 1.6<00:06:38.070> to<00:06:38.280> 1.9<00:06:38.700> seconds<00:06:39.210> and<00:06:39.480> that

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
spawn from 1.6 to 1.9 seconds and that

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.110 
spawn from 1.6 to 1.9 seconds and that
might<00:06:39.840> not<00:06:40.110> sound<00:06:40.350> a<00:06:40.530> lot<00:06:40.710> but<00:06:41.370> it<00:06:41.490> actually<00:06:41.640> is

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
might not sound a lot but it actually is

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.880 
might not sound a lot but it actually is
so<00:06:42.420> that<00:06:42.600> will<00:06:42.720> kind<00:06:42.930> of<00:06:42.990> help<00:06:43.050> with<00:06:43.500> the<00:06:43.710> whole

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:43.890 
so that will kind of help with the whole

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:45.200 
so that will kind of help with the whole
spawn<00:06:44.250> killing<00:06:44.520> thing<00:06:44.790> it'll<00:06:44.940> give<00:06:45.090> you<00:06:45.180> a

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:45.210 
spawn killing thing it'll give you a

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:47.030 
spawn killing thing it'll give you a
chance<00:06:45.270> a<00:06:45.750> bit<00:06:45.990> longer<00:06:46.200> to<00:06:46.410> run<00:06:46.590> out<00:06:46.770> of<00:06:46.800> your

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040 
chance a bit longer to run out of your

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.030 
chance a bit longer to run out of your
spawn<00:06:47.310> if<00:06:47.460> you<00:06:47.550> spawn<00:06:47.820> out<00:06:48.000> in<00:06:48.180> an<00:06:48.390> open<00:06:48.480> area

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:49.040 
spawn if you spawn out in an open area

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.590 
spawn if you spawn out in an open area
so<00:06:50.040> overall<00:06:50.430> I<00:06:50.460> think<00:06:50.580> that<00:06:50.910> dice<00:06:51.210> is

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 
so overall I think that dice is

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.170 
so overall I think that dice is
listening<00:06:52.440> to<00:06:52.560> the<00:06:52.650> community<00:06:53.000> making<00:06:54.000> some
