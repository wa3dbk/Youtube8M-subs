to this he would have had to resign the

an orange jumpsuit badly fitting right
now<00:04:45.390> but<00:04:45.990> I<00:04:46.020> think<00:04:46.140> that<00:04:46.380> like<00:04:46.710> what<00:04:46.980> this

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
now but I think that like what this

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.160 
now but I think that like what this
points<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.730> is<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:47.880> fact<00:04:48.210> that<00:04:48.300> separation<00:04:49.020> of

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
points to is the fact that separation of

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:51.530 
points to is the fact that separation of
church<00:04:49.380> and<00:04:49.620> state<00:04:49.680> is<00:04:50.220> kind<00:04:50.790> of<00:04:50.940> an<00:04:51.090> illusion

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
church and state is kind of an illusion

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.030 
church and state is kind of an illusion
because<00:04:51.660> the<00:04:51.930> fact<00:04:52.140> of<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.380> matter<00:04:52.440> is<00:04:52.800> people

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
because the fact of the matter is people

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.670 
because the fact of the matter is people
talk<00:04:53.640> about<00:04:53.910> God<00:04:54.240> every<00:04:54.810> day<00:04:54.840> in<00:04:55.380> whatever

I<00:05:04.140> would<00:05:04.530> have<00:05:04.560> died<00:05:04.860> of<00:05:04.890> alcohol<00:05:05.580> poisoning

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
I would have died of alcohol poisoning

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.470 
I would have died of alcohol poisoning
and<00:05:06.810> you<00:05:07.410> know<00:05:07.560> to<00:05:07.950> say<00:05:08.190> that<00:05:08.460> it's<00:05:08.760> not<00:05:09.030> part

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
and you know to say that it's not part

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.020 
and you know to say that it's not part
of<00:05:09.630> it<00:05:09.810> is<00:05:10.020> alive<00:05:10.590> because<00:05:10.860> you<00:05:11.100> know<00:05:11.400> if<00:05:11.610> Obama

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
of it is alive because you know if Obama

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.630 
of it is alive because you know if Obama
had<00:05:12.180> put<00:05:12.570> his<00:05:12.750> hand<00:05:12.990> down<00:05:13.110> on<00:05:13.440> the<00:05:13.530> Quran<00:05:14.250> on

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
had put his hand down on the Quran on

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.850 
had put his hand down on the Quran on
the<00:05:14.940> inauguration<00:05:15.570> instead<00:05:16.440> of<00:05:16.530> a<00:05:16.620> Bible

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
the inauguration instead of a Bible

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.490 
the inauguration instead of a Bible
there<00:05:17.280> would<00:05:17.460> be<00:05:17.490> rioting<00:05:18.120> so<00:05:18.720> I<00:05:18.750> think<00:05:19.080> that

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
there would be rioting so I think that

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.830 
there would be rioting so I think that
when<00:05:19.710> he<00:05:19.920> speaks<00:05:20.280> out<00:05:20.520> it<00:05:20.760> reminds<00:05:21.330> us<00:05:21.450> we

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
when he speaks out it reminds us we

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.480 
when he speaks out it reminds us we
haven't<00:05:22.050> really<00:05:22.440> gotten<00:05:22.680> that<00:05:22.860> far<00:05:23.280> from
