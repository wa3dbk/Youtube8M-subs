00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
to update on last week so I just decided

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.399 
to update on last week so I just decided
to<00:00:25.990> don't<00:00:26.990> do<00:00:27.199> an<00:00:27.289> unnecessary<00:00:27.949> episode<00:00:28.519> and

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:29.409 
to don't do an unnecessary episode and

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:33.940 
to don't do an unnecessary episode and
but<00:00:30.409> for<00:00:31.009> that<00:00:31.189> I've<00:00:31.519> now<00:00:31.880> got<00:00:32.270> some<00:00:32.860> kind<00:00:33.860> of

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
but for that I've now got some kind of

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.520 
but for that I've now got some kind of
bigger<00:00:34.370> things<00:00:34.730> to<00:00:35.270> come<00:00:35.390> so<00:00:35.870> let's<00:00:36.110> get
