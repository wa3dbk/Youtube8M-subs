you take what glass or what about

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.219 
you take what glass or what about
analyzing<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.060> place<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.719> this<00:02:03.990> and

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
analyzing it and place it like this and

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.920 
analyzing it and place it like this and
it<00:02:04.740> gives<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.310> water<00:02:05.939> bottle<00:02:06.240> from<00:02:06.540> Alice's

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
it gives you a water bottle from Alice's

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.700 
it gives you a water bottle from Alice's
so<00:02:07.079> they<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.469> obviously

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
so they can obviously

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.530 
so they can obviously
kid<00:02:08.890> stuff<00:02:09.130> like<00:02:09.340> that<00:02:09.370> when<00:02:10.000> where<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.390> hell

that wonderful now I don't know whether
these<00:03:06.850> big<00:03:07.150> spotted<00:03:07.660> than<00:03:07.810> what<00:03:07.960> like<00:03:08.140> the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
these big spotted than what like the

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.430 
these big spotted than what like the
wild<00:03:08.770> like<00:03:09.010> out<00:03:09.280> here<00:03:09.340> somewhere<00:03:09.820> I<00:03:10.420> looked<00:03:11.290> at

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
wild like out here somewhere I looked at

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.750 
wild like out here somewhere I looked at
how<00:03:11.590> it's<00:03:11.770> either<00:03:11.980> but<00:03:12.220> then<00:03:12.340> again<00:03:12.460> they<00:03:12.640> are

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
how it's either but then again they are

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.150 
how it's either but then again they are
that<00:03:12.940> small<00:03:13.180> that<00:03:13.330> I<00:03:13.450> might<00:03:14.110> miss<00:03:14.380> them<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:15.040> I

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
that small that I might miss them and I

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.710 
that small that I might miss them and I
presume<00:03:15.520> that<00:03:15.580> they<00:03:15.850> do<00:03:15.910> but<00:03:16.330> I<00:03:16.360> don't<00:03:16.450> know

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
presume that they do but I don't know

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.190 
presume that they do but I don't know
what<00:03:16.960> biomes<00:03:17.520> they<00:03:18.520> would<00:03:18.730> naturally<00:03:19.240> sported

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
what biomes they would naturally sported

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.200 
what biomes they would naturally sported
or<00:03:20.470> anything<00:03:20.980> like<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.190> I<00:03:21.370> presume<00:03:21.850> planes

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
or anything like that I presume planes

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.900 
or anything like that I presume planes
or<00:03:22.710> siblings<00:03:23.710> where<00:03:23.890> sheep<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.370> pigs<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.760> all

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
or siblings where sheep and pigs and all

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.060 
or siblings where sheep and pigs and all
that<00:03:25.090> spawn<00:03:25.390> more<00:03:27.120> but<00:03:28.120> yeah<00:03:28.270> that's<00:03:28.510> the
