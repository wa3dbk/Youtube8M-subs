00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.690 
then all of a sudden it starts to rise
to<00:02:34.450> high<00:02:34.600> night<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.320> converted<00:02:36.130> cortisol

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
to high night and converted cortisol

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.870 
to high night and converted cortisol
then<00:02:37.630> maybe<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.530> guys<00:02:38.739> might<00:02:39.130> consider<00:02:39.760> the

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
then maybe you guys might consider the

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.840 
then maybe you guys might consider the
fact<00:02:40.269> that<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:41.680> have<00:02:41.769> metabolic<00:02:42.040> derangement

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
fact that you have metabolic derangement

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.190 
fact that you have metabolic derangement
and<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.630> have<00:02:43.870> been<00:02:44.050> your<00:02:45.040> whole<00:02:45.250> life

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.259 

it<00:02:50.200> takes<00:02:50.409> a<00:02:50.530> whole<00:02:50.769> lifetime<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.640> create

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
it takes a whole lifetime to create

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.720 
it takes a whole lifetime to create
metabolic<00:02:52.659> damage<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.319> so<00:02:53.980> at<00:02:54.189> a<00:02:54.220> very<00:02:54.340> young

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
metabolic damage and so at a very young

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.660 
metabolic damage and so at a very young
age<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.780> already<00:02:56.379> started<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:56.980> try<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.340> heal

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
age I already started to try to heal

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.750 
age I already started to try to heal
those<00:02:57.939> things<00:02:58.269> actually<00:02:59.140> sleep<00:03:00.040> ever<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.640> was

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
cortisol and I was very aware of stomach

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.710 
cortisol and I was very aware of stomach
and<00:03:07.540> in<00:03:08.319> the<00:03:08.829> digestive<00:03:09.280> system<00:03:09.359> so<00:03:10.359> the<00:03:10.510> very

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
that I did before was to get lean to get

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.390 
that I did before was to get lean to get
down<00:03:43.450> to<00:03:43.689> nine<00:03:44.019> percent<00:03:44.560> body<00:03:44.680> fat<00:03:44.829> I<00:03:45.220> would

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
down to nine percent body fat I would

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.080 
down to nine percent body fat I would
cut<00:03:45.549> my<00:03:45.700> calories<00:03:46.470> car<00:03:47.470> Keller's<00:03:47.859> and<00:03:48.370> that's

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
cut my calories car Keller's and that's

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.270 
cut my calories car Keller's and that's
how<00:03:49.269> I<00:03:49.510> would<00:03:49.720> be<00:03:49.840> lean<00:03:50.049> and<00:03:50.079> then<00:03:50.590> I'd<00:03:50.889> go<00:03:51.069> work

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
how I would be lean and then I'd go work

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.860 
how I would be lean and then I'd go work
out<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.700> then<00:03:51.819> I<00:03:52.030> would<00:03:52.269> come<00:03:52.420> home<00:03:52.569> and<00:03:52.780> just
