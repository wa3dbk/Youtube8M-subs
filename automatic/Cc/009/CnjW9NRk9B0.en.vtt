00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.699
 passion for classical music

 different formations and artists among 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.260

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:33.210
 guay with his show jean sÃ©bastien 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:35.309

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.240
 finished to what feeling 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.040
 this piece will have made you think 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.270
 it's a concert in the heart of which is 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.160
 placed listen to it 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.900
 listened to it in the music start 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.690
 from milk costs everything can 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.239
 to start 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.180
 in this concert I try to arouse 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.630
 children's imagination 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.490
 make them reveal the part as well as 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.680
 awakening music in them 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.960
 my most intimate wish and the most 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.240
 strong is to be able to give keys 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.460
 listened to children and their parents well 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.080
 heard for them to feel at home 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.370
 the music is that they can with its 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.150
 keys open the doors of music 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.210
 throughout their lives 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.700
 you have all heard this silence taste 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.590
 and this silence that he has a character there is 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.660
 the character of which allows the 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.610
 music to exist is good because we 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.860
 get to know bac a little bit 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.720
 better than we already know enough with 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.290
 friends 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.410

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.500

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.729

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.780
 piece and we learned a lot of things 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.610
 she involved the children of the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.830
 passion always with the orchestrated of 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.060

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.250
 impressive end we can 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.810
 limitations 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.139
 I can not understand how their 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.060
 headphones for target a young chef 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:48.980
 orchestra is 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.270
 very involved and I found on crate 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.350

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.210
 very very beautiful it's not the first 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.410
 year that I do not drink and every year 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.410

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.050
 and 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.050
 e 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.709
 fun but this time more 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.989
 electric direction the garden room 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.760
 of glass for the passions amplify a 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.200
 show of retranscription of works 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.860
 classics by young musicians 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.860
 Nantes 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.420
 the ena 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.050
 in fact the idea is that there are seven 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.160
 groups that gather around the 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.510
 crazy day theme so this 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.150
 year is from rebirth to 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.080
 twentieth century on the theme of passions 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.850
 and from there everyone composes 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.490
 close 5 6 minutes of music by resuming 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.880
 works and transforming them to 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.500
 their sauce but between each group there 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.480
 has a lot of technique there are some 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.640
 guitars that leaves drummers who 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.740
 changing and so is there a time 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.500
 techniques that need a little filled up and 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.550
 we are between the groups precisely 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.870
 for the plateau changes for 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.450
 hide tray changes 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.050
 finally to make an introduction 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.790
 a conclusion 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.209
 and here is to put some kind of polish 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.209
 final for there to be a side 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.209

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.250
