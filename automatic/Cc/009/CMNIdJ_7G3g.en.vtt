00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:06.430
 Iranian and welcome to when he is I am the tester and we play 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.939
 today 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.379
 there is 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.400
 Scariolo is the rudea should definitely be 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:16.349
 to step 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.779
 Opel closes the board anyway, it's easy 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.289
 This is even a player from German wander a developer and out 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.160
 Germany has driven me and has asked if I'm the fourth time 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.619
 would imagine 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.430
 but I did that but now that I have more time now 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.500
 I have now decided it is not postponed but now comes 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.670
 finally your video 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.810
 So what's up in this is Ford's offerings 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.080
 In order to go first there is also the option there are not many everyday change 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.830
 on 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.230
 French percent English and German 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.150
 then there are also companies but we also do that and here we can 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.120
 still no cost if here 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.929
 around 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:03.230
 want to play with Linde tilt sensor or 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.280
 but rather with the partner 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.280
 then you can choose between free departure 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.510
 So slalom is free 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.400
 then little Spirou is to collect their packages and this is about the 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.950
 championship 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.410
 Gold now just waiting for you to wait and see the game NPD 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.380
 and Neustadt 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.720
 we can see very well what i have all i have brews 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.450
 Silver and gold whose difficulties 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.210
 she already mastered her, I just took a break and mastered myself 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.160
 and here and here, too, and here in society, that's seven 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.540
 more deer off 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.640
 Departures Boullier endeavor is and you see my best time and 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.430
 I just have to play the first message to show it 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.880
 Therefore, this little skier of the game is not really percent 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.500
 heavier or too 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.690
 at all this she also beautifully described everything here we can 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.380
 how can you steer here? "on this Bakken 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.360
 Do these two Gedeon where he wanted Uli above 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.230
 that is really 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.850
 Percent and solved 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.200
 to bake with the yen the bumps August given the natural foods 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:14.989
 and then it stops 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.909
 the computer so the app notices what the computer thinks the app remembers 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:23.389
 you got stuck around here, so you have to drive from 9 again so well 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:24.759
 meant that one 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:28.699
 into the game I'll be hot-tempered, of course he is not needed time 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:30.909
 Operation need 25 seconds 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.259
 when it's over 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:36.379
 I had lost about 19 seconds but I like it 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.379
 just silver and died again to show us again 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.699
 as I said around 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:44.689
 Percent by the 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.039
 held by this act 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:48.589
 I scarcely miss this sentence Schumm 4 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:50.159
 Here you can yours 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.099
 Skiers tax 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.609
 been strict among students 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.129
 over the ice 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.159
 I think that percent is very nice 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.739
 is synonymous animated really nice constantly something has made it and me 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.050
 took 20 seconds 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.479
 I've got 21 hours of it 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.279
 good, I won 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:12.879
 wal-mart about my time improved badly 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.950
 Well then there is still such a back 8 from ride that we do not 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:19.739
 a very nice one 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.419
 to force please here 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:27.109
 that made it a bit easy to keep but also makes percent fini fun so 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.419
 Percent of every pilgrim at winter time might be more appropriate for this 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:32.060
 game 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.690
 Although the winter time, but as I said I have so many eggs too 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.819
 So I also testify to the pillory developer who does not cover letters and 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.010
 therefore 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.090
 took it a bit longer then Duden again then one 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.849
 one of the developers 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.279
 but we are around it is quite easy to take to the place and continue 

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.459
 and the sawed as I said there are also with all here but I have 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.859
 not all released sometimes not as running in the seventh game have played 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.329
 just touched a bit 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.929
 Percent here too 

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:05.669
 around 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:09.359
 Whom is easy to drive through this though, and it is said by the 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.429
 Middle by then it is counted 

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:14.219
 if now a hermaphrodite process is natural 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:15.539
 not so good 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:19.129
 but as he himself with the fact control massively into the taz control St 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:22.129
 better control the police do not 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.919
 think the destruction is the better promotion 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.400
 like the Danes 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.200
 percent 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.550
 because percent the here the the control Dietel disturbances 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.340
 what role of the market make the destruction and show that these means 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.360
 Control works 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.159
 then we have here 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:43.159
 we just have to 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:45.259
 So I find the goal 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:46.430
 not so good 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.690
 As I said I am a bit awkward in the product mix because that is 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.690
 Of course it's not that great 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.830
 It will be March so with taxation it is already a lot 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.830
 difficult 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.760
 Even the Stones are very beautiful old compatriot Jure Steinforth then heard 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.749
 that too and 

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:13.480
 the people roar 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.529
 drives through the finish 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:16.789
 everything very nice Prell adjourned 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:21.399
 and even if they are not expensive so where is the daughter it was still 81 cents like 

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:23.000
 I do not know what it looks like now 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.999
 I would have to look 

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:26.879
 then four weeks were normal again 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:29.180
 in the family Dieter Lenzen too 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.080
 and if you have customers to our ears 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.809
 Nobody knew where, then the challenge here 

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:36.800
 here you have to 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.150
 here you have to collect the parcels again as well as slalom about the 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.800
 Packages are approaching some places hiding this idea would have to be here now 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.029
 gather in 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:50.029
 around and 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.150
 and that's the whole percent at 7 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.939
 Euro that was close 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:05:59.860
 I'm not dead 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.029
 Unfortunately all packages poor forgot a package and but I think I have s 

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:06.349
 still not on 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:09.349
 No, I have to collect all the packages otherwise it is 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:12.719
 who is trying to poll percent 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:15.989
 good percent as always it is never to annotate stars do not give 

00:06:15.989 --> 00:06:17.250
 If you forget me like that 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.499
 Cool finds our full pot trend even on Facebook 

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:22.949
 can you on Facebook 1 No 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:25.259
 Percent there percent and 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:29.009
 omit how great we find little or how bad we do not find or what 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:30.419
 fits can do better 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:31.999
 Environment on YouTube 

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:35.259
 PrÃ¶ll that is not so great I have now done on Facebook 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.529
 around there will also find videos the developer Infinity and not kill 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:42.300
 have appeared for example from witches or 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.830
 the other videos that may not be private 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:50.060
 for example, I would have been glad that he has come to three parents 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.619
 or Glen is wrong 

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:55.599
 We can also enjoy the same thing we want together 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:59.189
 As always, but never arrive the decent not forget on YouTube
