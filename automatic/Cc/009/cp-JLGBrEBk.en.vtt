choose a ceramic as a material a first
of<00:01:13.890> all<00:01:14.010> color<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:15.000> can<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.360> things<00:01:15.570> with

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
of all color you can do things with

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.480 
of all color you can do things with
ceramic<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.500> can't<00:01:16.799> do<00:01:17.009> with<00:01:17.159> metal

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
ceramic that you can't do with metal

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.280 
ceramic that you can't do with metal
like<00:01:17.700> there's<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.210> white<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.869> black<00:01:19.080> one

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
like there's a white one and a black one

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.469 
like there's a white one and a black one
you<00:01:19.500> could<00:01:19.979> do<00:01:20.130> black<00:01:20.310> with<00:01:20.520> met<00:01:20.939> with<00:01:21.150> metal

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
you could do black with met with metal

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.760 
you could do black with met with metal
but<00:01:21.570> not<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:22.020> finish<00:01:22.350> thing<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.710> you

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
but not this finish thing and you

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.289 
but not this finish thing and you
definitely<00:01:23.159> can't<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> white<00:01:23.820> watch<00:01:24.030> with

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
definitely can't do a white watch with

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.120 
definitely can't do a white watch with
metal<00:01:24.600> if<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:25.080> wanted<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.680> these<00:01:25.890> types

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
metal if you wanted to have these types

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.580 
metal if you wanted to have these types
of<00:01:26.280> colors<00:01:26.520> all<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.360> had<00:01:27.600> really<00:01:27.990> before<00:01:28.409> this

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
of colors all you had really before this

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.370 
of colors all you had really before this
was<00:01:28.920> plastic<00:01:29.909> because<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.600> mixture<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
was plastic because a mixture of the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.950 
was plastic because a mixture of the
sort<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.619> shininess<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.820> sense<00:01:33.150> they

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
sort of shininess and in a sense they

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.170 
sort of shininess and in a sense they
kind<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.380> look<00:01:34.619> plastic<00:01:35.280> yet<00:01:35.490> first<00:01:35.700> people

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
kind of look plastic yet first people

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.490 
kind of look plastic yet first people
were<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.420> who's<00:01:36.600> going<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.900> want<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.259> watch

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
were like who's going to want this watch

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.830 
were like who's going to want this watch
it<00:01:37.710> looks<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:38.070> it's<00:01:38.220> plastic<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.420> it's<00:01:39.600> not

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
it looks like it's plastic but it's not

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.870 
it looks like it's plastic but it's not
ceramic<00:01:40.560> has<00:01:40.680> some<00:01:40.860> interesting<00:01:41.100> qualities

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
ceramic has some interesting qualities

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.389 
ceramic has some interesting qualities
in<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.659> it's<00:01:42.810> very<00:01:43.140> very<00:01:43.409> scratch<00:01:43.829> resistant

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
in that it's very very scratch resistant

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.130 
in that it's very very scratch resistant
so<00:01:44.549> what<00:01:44.700> would<00:01:44.850> happen<00:01:45.240> with<00:01:45.329> rato<00:01:45.630> owners

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
so what would happen with rato owners

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.010 
so what would happen with rato owners
for<00:01:46.380> example<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.759> they<00:01:48.390> would<00:01:48.659> have

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
for example is that they would have

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.499 
for example is that they would have

are the 38 millimeter size the larger

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.470 
are the 38 millimeter size the larger
side<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.710> 42<00:02:26.400> millimeter<00:02:26.910> so<00:02:27.150> there's<00:02:27.330> an

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
side is 42 millimeter so there's an

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.150 
side is 42 millimeter so there's an
identical<00:02:27.960> version<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.530> each<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.800> these<00:02:28.890> and

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
and 42 millimeters we asked Chanel we

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.490 
and 42 millimeters we asked Chanel we
said<00:02:33.210> we<00:02:33.300> wanted<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.600> review<00:02:33.960> these<00:02:34.080> they<00:02:34.260> send

one on there I think you can appreciate

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.110 
one on there I think you can appreciate
that's<00:05:07.810> clearly<00:05:08.650> much<00:05:09.070> more<00:05:09.100> masking<00:05:10.030> and

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
that's clearly much more masking and

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.780 
that's clearly much more masking and
watch<00:05:10.300> compared<00:05:11.140> to<00:05:12.010> the<00:05:12.160> white<00:05:12.370> one<00:05:12.580> it's

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
watch compared to the white one it's

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.220 
watch compared to the white one it's
just<00:05:12.910> it's<00:05:13.240> just<00:05:13.300> a<00:05:13.510> lot<00:05:13.660> more<00:05:13.690> masculine

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
just it's just a lot more masculine

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.480 
just it's just a lot more masculine
that's<00:05:14.410> fine<00:05:14.590> that's<00:05:14.800> why<00:05:14.980> they<00:05:15.100> have<00:05:15.250> white

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
that's fine that's why they have white

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.740 
that's fine that's why they have white
and<00:05:15.669> then<00:05:15.760> black<00:05:16.030> and<00:05:16.240> now<00:05:16.300> they<00:05:16.390> have<00:05:16.510> grey

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
and then black and now they have grey

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.630 
and then black and now they have grey
and<00:05:17.020> like<00:05:17.470> I<00:05:17.590> said<00:05:17.650> the<00:05:17.890> largest<00:05:18.070> this<00:05:18.430> version

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
and like I said the largest this version

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.490 
and like I said the largest this version
comes<00:05:18.970> in<00:05:19.300> 42<00:05:19.780> so<00:05:19.960> it's<00:05:20.050> a<00:05:20.080> little<00:05:20.260> bit<00:05:20.350> larger

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
comes in 42 so it's a little bit larger

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.950 
comes in 42 so it's a little bit larger
there<00:05:20.919> but<00:05:21.760> it's<00:05:21.910> just<00:05:22.030> it's<00:05:22.300> a<00:05:22.390> fantastic

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
there but it's just it's a fantastic

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.890 
there but it's just it's a fantastic
watch<00:05:23.169> and<00:05:23.410> I<00:05:24.150> don't<00:05:25.150> know<00:05:25.270> I<00:05:25.300> just<00:05:25.390> I<00:05:25.630> fell<00:05:25.840> in

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
watch and I don't know I just I fell in

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.090 
watch and I don't know I just I fell in
love<00:05:26.050> with<00:05:26.110> this<00:05:26.230> a<00:05:26.260> while<00:05:26.440> ago<00:05:26.740> and<00:05:26.830> it's<00:05:26.919> kind

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
love with this a while ago and it's kind

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.070 
love with this a while ago and it's kind
of<00:05:27.130> never<00:05:27.370> never<00:05:27.820> kind<00:05:28.120> of<00:05:28.210> faded<00:05:28.630> and<00:05:28.750> I<00:05:28.810> think

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
of never never kind of faded and I think

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.469 
of never never kind of faded and I think
today<00:05:29.410> if<00:05:29.710> I<00:05:30.280> would<00:05:30.460> have<00:05:30.610> approached<00:05:31.180> these

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
today if I would have approached these

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.510 
today if I would have approached these
watches<00:05:31.900> I<00:05:31.990> think<00:05:32.200> I<00:05:32.290> might<00:05:32.500> have<00:05:32.620> a<00:05:32.680> slightly

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
watches I think I might have a slightly

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.040 
watches I think I might have a slightly
different<00:05:33.729> view<00:05:34.060> I<00:05:34.120> wouldn't<00:05:34.419> be<00:05:34.479> as<00:05:34.570> excited

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
different view I wouldn't be as excited

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.620 
different view I wouldn't be as excited
because<00:05:35.200> I'd<00:05:35.410> seen<00:05:35.740> so<00:05:36.010> much<00:05:36.250> but<00:05:36.520> this<00:05:37.270> you

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
because I'd seen so much but this you
