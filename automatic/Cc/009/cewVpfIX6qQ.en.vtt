00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.939
 let's prepare strawberry popsicles and 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.400
 Spanish special selection orange 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:11.429
 ingredients we need are 250 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.469
 grams of strawberries 2 oranges of juice 50 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.740
 grams of sugar 100 milliliters of water 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.060
 and molds for powders we started 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.160
 adding the sugar to the water 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.529
 and we will heat it in the microwave 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.279
 so that the sugar dissolves in the 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:30.650
 water for 5 minutes at maximum power 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.130
 meanwhile we cut the oranges and 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.810
 we squeeze them well the juice 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.420
 all the juice that comes out we cover it 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.860
 with a film and we reserve it until 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.190
 after 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.800
 let's continue grinding the strawberries 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.110
 or strawberries with a blender or 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.590
 crusher what you have, you have to 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.400
 leave them well beaten that remain 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.070
 liquid 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.280
 and this strawberry juice we add it to a 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.280
 bowl 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.650
 we take out the quick syrup that we have 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.690
 prepared 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.670
 as we see if there is any remainder of 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.950
 sugar without dissolving and with the help of a 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.670
 we're going to throw in the mixture of 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.920
 strawberries 100 milliliters of our syrup 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.530
 of course we move it well 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.770
 and as we have prepared the molds 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.810
 for poles we are going to throw calculating for 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.810
 that we get three stripes of colors 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.290
 now we are going to take it to the freezer and 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.020
 we will have it the necessary time until 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.079
 that freezes completely 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.570
 once this is done we will take it out and with the 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:47.479
 orange juice put on a weight 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.479
 we will add 50 ml of syrup 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.540
 we move it well and we repeat the process and 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.500
 let's throw enough so that 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.390
 cover two thirds this is the 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.760
 delicate part because we have to have in 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.410
 When we take it out, it should not be 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.210
 of having frozen completely to be able to 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.460
 stick the stick 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.340
 then we will add what we have left of 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:16.260
 mix of strawberries we will wash the stick with 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:19.360
 very careful and we will freeze again 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.700
 until the time to serve and ready now 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.130
 we have our poles with the flag 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.980
 Spanish that we have prepared for this 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:31.170
 eurocopa and that are our way of 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.170
 support the selection to win
