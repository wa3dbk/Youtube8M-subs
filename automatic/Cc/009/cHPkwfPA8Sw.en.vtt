you<00:00:31.199> say<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.529> perimeter<00:00:31.920> you'll

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
you say to the perimeter you'll

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.530 
you say to the perimeter you'll
sometimes<00:00:32.489> find<00:00:32.700> yourself<00:00:33.120> popping<00:00:33.450> up

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
sometimes find yourself popping up

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.790 
sometimes find yourself popping up
behind<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.989> big<00:00:34.140> group<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.380> people<00:00:34.440> instead

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
of in the middle of them so then you can

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.900 
of in the middle of them so then you can
kill<00:00:36.239> them<00:00:36.300> all<00:00:39.110> so<00:00:40.110> after<00:00:40.890> each<00:00:41.190> kill<00:00:41.460> was

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
kill them all so after each kill was

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.420 
kill them all so after each kill was

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
the bullets or hear the death or

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.560 
the bullets or hear the death or
anything<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.969> doesn't<00:00:48.210> do<00:00:48.270> them<00:00:48.329> any<00:00:48.450> good

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
anything but it doesn't do them any good

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.799 
anything but it doesn't do them any good
if<00:00:48.960> you're<00:00:49.230> not<00:00:49.350> there<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.160> just<00:00:50.250> run<00:00:50.430> away

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
if you're not there so you just run away

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.880 
if you're not there so you just run away

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
so I move quickly stay behind cover

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.720 
so I move quickly stay behind cover
basically<00:00:55.890> just<00:00:56.129> running<00:00:56.370> around<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.670> a
