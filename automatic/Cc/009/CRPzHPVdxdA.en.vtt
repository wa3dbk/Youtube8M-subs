actually this unit actually comes in
three<00:02:35.650> different<00:02:35.680> variants<00:02:36.310> this<00:02:36.970> is<00:02:37.090> the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
three different variants this is the

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.900 
three different variants this is the
18,000<00:02:37.780> image<00:02:38.020> unit<00:02:38.560> another<00:02:38.920> one<00:02:39.100> is<00:02:39.220> 13,000

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
18,000 image unit another one is 13,000

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.030 
18,000 image unit another one is 13,000
and<00:02:40.030> another<00:02:40.330> one<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.540> 15,000<00:02:41.170> image<00:02:41.470> so

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
and another one is 15,000 image so

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.230 
and another one is 15,000 image so
depending<00:02:42.520> on<00:02:42.520> your<00:02:42.700> budget<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.180> the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
depending on your budget and the

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.730 
depending on your budget and the
requirement<00:02:44.020> you<00:02:44.080> can<00:02:44.170> actually<00:02:44.440> go<00:02:44.590> with

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
requirement you can actually go with

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.710 
requirement you can actually go with
these<00:02:44.980> options<00:02:45.430> apart<00:02:46.180> from<00:02:46.270> that<00:02:46.360> you<00:02:46.540> cannot

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
these options apart from that you cannot

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.450 
these options apart from that you cannot
expect<00:02:47.020> this<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.380> come<00:02:47.560> with<00:02:47.770> full<00:02:48.070> battery

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
expect this to come with full battery

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.210 
expect this to come with full battery
out<00:02:48.640> out<00:02:49.420> of<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.660> box<00:02:49.870> so<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:50.680> have<00:02:51.100> to

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
out out of the box so you have to

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.800 
out out of the box so you have to
actually<00:02:51.340> charge<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:51.850> up<00:02:51.970> but<00:02:52.180> as<00:02:52.360> you<00:02:52.540> can<00:02:52.630> see

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
actually charge it up but as you can see

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.030 
actually charge it up but as you can see
here<00:02:52.990> right<00:02:53.170> now<00:02:53.459> it's<00:02:55.350> quite<00:02:56.350> confusing<00:02:56.860> in

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
here right now it's quite confusing in

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.270 
here right now it's quite confusing in
terms<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.550> LEDs<00:02:58.060> here<00:02:58.480> because<00:02:59.280> depending

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
terms of the LEDs here because depending

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.460 
terms of the LEDs here because depending
on<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:00.610> way<00:03:00.730> you<00:03:00.760> start<00:03:01.150> seeing<00:03:01.360> it<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.810> this

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
on the way you start seeing it it this

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.320 
on the way you start seeing it it this
ad<00:03:02.709> shows<00:03:03.100> a<00:03:03.130> different<00:03:03.550> result<00:03:03.670> so<00:03:03.970> probably

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
ad shows a different result so probably

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.350 
ad shows a different result so probably
it's<00:03:04.540> actually<00:03:04.900> out<00:03:05.020> of<00:03:05.050> charge<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:06.360> because

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
it's actually out of charge and because

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.120 
it's actually out of charge and because
of<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.630> shipment<00:03:08.080> they<00:03:08.620> generally<00:03:08.950> do<00:03:09.100> not

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
of the shipment they generally do not

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.520 
of the shipment they generally do not
charge<00:03:09.400> these<00:03:09.670> devices<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.350> reason

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
charge these devices and that the reason

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.770 
charge these devices and that the reason
I<00:03:11.590> feel<00:03:11.800> that<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.130> actually<00:03:12.310> has<00:03:12.760> got<00:03:13.330> no<00:03:13.480> power

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
I feel that it actually has got no power

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.720 
I feel that it actually has got no power
or<00:03:13.989> no<00:03:14.230> charge<00:03:14.500> out<00:03:14.650> of<00:03:14.680> it<00:03:14.890> you<00:03:15.370> can<00:03:15.520> start

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
or no charge out of it you can start

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.600 
or no charge out of it you can start
connecting<00:03:16.510> it<00:03:16.840> here<00:03:17.650> on<00:03:17.830> any<00:03:18.280> of<00:03:18.430> these

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
connecting it here on any of these

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.729 
connecting it here on any of these
outputs<00:03:19.090> like<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.720> samsung<00:03:19.989> galaxy<00:03:20.290> s4

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
outputs like the samsung galaxy s4

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.190 
outputs like the samsung galaxy s4
supports<00:03:21.160> up<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.310> 2<00:03:21.550> amps<00:03:21.850> out<00:03:22.000> of<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.360> the

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 
supports up to 2 amps out of the the

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.479 
supports up to 2 amps out of the the
charging<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:23.770> can<00:03:23.890> actually<00:03:24.010> connect<00:03:24.400> it

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
charging so you can actually connect it

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.250 
charging so you can actually connect it
here<00:03:24.520> too<00:03:24.910> quickly<00:03:25.360> charging<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.840> device<00:03:25.930> and

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
here too quickly charging the device and

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.440 
here too quickly charging the device and
that's<00:03:27.100> the<00:03:27.220> reason<00:03:27.370> most<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:28.030> times<00:03:28.239> when

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
that's the reason most of the times when

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.780 
that's the reason most of the times when
you<00:03:28.540> connect<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:29.489> smartphone<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:30.670> your

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
you connect the smartphone to your

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.850 
you connect the smartphone to your
laptop<00:03:31.360> you<00:03:31.600> find<00:03:32.049> that<00:03:32.320> it<00:03:32.440> is<00:03:32.470> actually

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
laptop you find that it is actually

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.590 
laptop you find that it is actually
taking<00:03:33.100> a<00:03:33.130> lot<00:03:33.370> of<00:03:33.400> time<00:03:33.730> for<00:03:34.000> charging<00:03:34.510> the

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
taking a lot of time for charging the

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.300 
taking a lot of time for charging the
device<00:03:34.690> but<00:03:35.440> in<00:03:35.530> this<00:03:35.650> case<00:03:35.830> that<00:03:36.100> won't

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
device but in this case that won't

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.160 
device but in this case that won't
happen<00:03:36.489> and<00:03:36.970> apart<00:03:37.570> from<00:03:37.630> that<00:03:37.750> when<00:03:37.959> you<00:03:38.019> talk

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
happen and apart from that when you talk

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.080 
happen and apart from that when you talk
about<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.739> charge<00:03:39.190> which<00:03:39.430> comes<00:03:39.670> on<00:03:39.880> this

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
about the charge which comes on this

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.680 
about the charge which comes on this
divide<00:03:40.989> a<00:03:41.400> portable<00:03:42.400> battery<00:03:42.790> it<00:03:43.239> actually

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
divide a portable battery it actually

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.009 
divide a portable battery it actually
would<00:03:43.989> charge<00:03:44.290> you<00:03:44.350> collect<00:03:44.980> iPhone<00:03:45.430> 5<00:03:45.730> or

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
would charge you collect iPhone 5 or

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.140 
would charge you collect iPhone 5 or
like<00:03:47.019> you<00:03:47.200> can<00:03:47.350> see<00:03:47.530> it's<00:03:47.739> saying<00:03:48.070> charging<00:03:48.519> it

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
like you can see it's saying charging it

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.670 
like you can see it's saying charging it
is<00:03:49.269> generally<00:03:49.690> started<00:03:50.170> with<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.320> charging

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
is generally started with the charging

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.530 
is generally started with the charging
and<00:03:50.830> it's<00:03:51.459> at<00:03:51.580> seventy-five<00:03:52.030> percent<00:03:52.269> right

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
and it's at seventy-five percent right

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.289 
and it's at seventy-five percent right
now<00:03:52.720> so<00:03:53.230> over<00:03:53.560> like<00:03:53.769> if<00:03:54.100> you<00:03:54.370> have<00:03:54.640> apple

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
now so over like if you have apple

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.920 
now so over like if you have apple
iphone<00:03:55.570> 5<00:03:55.810> 4<00:03:56.380> then<00:03:56.890> it<00:03:57.130> would<00:03:57.280> take<00:03:57.430> around<00:03:57.930> 12

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
iphone 5 4 then it would take around 12

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.110 
iphone 5 4 then it would take around 12
charge<00:03:59.680> cycles<00:04:00.130> by<00:04:00.280> or<00:04:00.489> you<00:04:00.519> can<00:04:00.790> charge<00:04:01.030> your

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120
