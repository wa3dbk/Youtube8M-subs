00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 is the following jadson just from 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.620
 Corinthians is said that the main 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.840
 difference that he felt so he already 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.880
 premiered by Corinthians and was the 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.500
 of the supporter and such that the supporter 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.730
 knows someone who plays together with the team 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.550
 You have not made it through Sao Paulo yet. 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.949
 but has been here for about a 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.160
 week little over a week you 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.560
 already feel different from the environment 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.939
 you faced on corinthians for 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.710
 environment you can face now 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.109
 that the site is facing here in the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.320
 Paulo 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:38.579
 the first good afternoon to everyone 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.920
 about the fact that the crowd is I did not have the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:47.219
 first contact with them in favor 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:50.160
 playing for sao paulo but I know I 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.110
 I watched and watched the games of 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.180
 Sao Paulo last year 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.530
 the crowd was a fundamental factor 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.020
 So that you are paulo of this turn 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.600
 I can not wait to play it at are 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.369
 Paul I can not wait to wear this 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.260
 shirt he has this shirt inside the game and 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.990
 I already have a wish I hope he 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:19.170
 success in Corinthians and that he 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.880
 Be happy in what he can do. 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.340
 no corinthians 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.640
 ok to your right you are a player 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.920
 talented and on his return to football 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.369
 you have been accused many times 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.829
 to prioritize their social life and not 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.470
 prioritize their professional life 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.509
 Do you really admit that this happened? 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.180
 lacked some commitment and 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.700
 Do you understand that this opportunity? 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.500
 that is sao paulo is a resumption in 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.060
 career 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:54.090
 I think most have some things 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.890
 about my respect but I'm a 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.500
 Person, I'm very hardworking. 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.759
 the whole year in my ex-club I always 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.250
 I arrived and I was always the first to 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.759
 arrive and the last one to leave 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.929
 and I have a feeling so I know a lot 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.610
 early from home 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.900
 I know that 11 years I learned many 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.189
 things 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:21.780
 and I left my mother crying at the time 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:23.760
 Right at the bus station asking me a thousand 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.209
 Sometimes I wanted to leave. 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.470
 so I learned a lot of what is 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:34.620
 that I feel in victory I 'm one I feel 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.359
 The happiest guy in the world in defeat me. 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.799
 i feel nothing 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:44.189
 It is with every game that I go into the field 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:49.069
 I try to give my best and that I 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:52.260
 I work a lot and I think most do not 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.409
 did not see what I did too 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.560
 in the number it excludes I worked a lot and did not 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:00.930
 I look forward to joining with the shirt 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.510
 São Paulo in the official game to show the 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.389
 my value to 14 even propose the 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.030
 director the fact here 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:11.010
 good afternoon, you can work, you go 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.049
 take a short time to show 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.760
 Pro work before calling Scolari 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.620
 for the world cup 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.500
 Do you believe that it gives time and another 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.870
 question is already quickly feeling that 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.099
 You leave the Corinthians and come to Sao 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:32.340
 Paulo in the first month was thus 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:34.129
 São Paulo I'm now a São Paulo player. 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.750
 Paulo 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:39.720
 I can not wait to work, I do not see the 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.579
 time to demonstrate my worth within 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.669
 I know I have to wait for a 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:47.400
 little to play but every training to 

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:49.620
 It's a game, I face every 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.560
 every day I think I wake up I 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.620
 I think ours is not the time to play 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.690
 so I'm going to work very very strong 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.159
 I came here to do history together 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.930
 with São Paulo 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.069
 I'm going to work very hard, I want to do 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.090
 many goals 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.620
 I want to take my courage to the crowd. 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.680
 I think what happened to me 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.540
 in corinthians and I am very grateful to 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.810
 corinthians 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.130
 corinthians physically recovered me 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.389
 gave all structure that I could 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.070
 play a whole year without injuries but today 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.870
 I 'm a São Paulo player then 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.889
 Do you think I'm Paul? I want to work a lot. 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.900
 on here 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:33.689
 and I want to demonstrate the value that the 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.759
 his right in these last two years 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:39.210
 great technicians work with you on the 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:41.879
 its exclusive and some terms used 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.460
 by them is for example clinically 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:45.509
 has nothing physically and has nothing 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.789
 now it's up to him 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:51.990
 He has to want some more in. 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:54.330
 field is and now playing is with him 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.610
 what is this what want something else 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.199
 now it is with him that theoretically in the 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.509
 understanding of the two technicians 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.969
 work with you, you did not do it today 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:05.460
 that's why you're here and a second 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:06.300
 question you ask yourself in some 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.099
 time 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:14.550
 Well, I'm going to play the game again. 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:17.400
 football I played one day I committed is the 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.860
 brazil went to corinthians is the 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.089
 Corinthians who physically recover me 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.689
 but I did not have the sequence I wanted 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:26.629
 land is detained from having played a 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:31.020
 game sequence 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:32.819
 then it is I think one minute I 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.349
 I played the time I always played 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:37.650
 I tried to show my best 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:42.569
 I ended up doing 17 goals and I ended up 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:45.539
 I ended up being the top scorer of Corinthians 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:46.889
 with one less time played but I 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:48.419
 I always worked I always gave my 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.409
 better but I did not have a sequence that 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.409
 the tub's advice 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:59.279
 I'm always the same 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:01.979
 I had a period not very well in the 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:04.860
 europe at the end of the 12 years I've had 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:06.180
 the end date must address in Europe 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.099
 did not go very well 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.659
 I did not have the sequence I 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:12.479
 wanted me to wish that I wanted to have 

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:15.089
 a case of last year's injuries I went 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.159
 for me is an essential factor because I 

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:21.270
 I do not think so what I that I 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:25.819
 I would then but changed everything changed 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:30.479
 now one is a new challenge will make it 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:32.370
 lot 11 champion in a club 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:35.940
 was three-time world champion so I do not see 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.889
 It's time to play games for São Paulo 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.060
 Duck please here on your left side 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:40.980
 we live in a 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.990
 the sport globe wanted you to talk 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.630
 on top of this sequence you expect 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.970
 having here is in Sao Paulo if that too 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.430
 gives you a greater hope of achieving 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.770
 a place in the Brazilian national team since 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.440
 clear selection has this problem and 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.210

 of an attacker this can help you 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.320
 also start suddenly bursting 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:03.590
 In São Paulo, there is a vacancy in the 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.590
 world
