00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.480
 I would like you to teach me 5 things about 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.549
 what they have in their portfolio if I know 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:18.300
 that they will want to lower him if not so 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.699
 me so that the fear of the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.550
 five things that I have in my portfolio is 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.800

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.060
 let's go and eat tacos because 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.060

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:36.690

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.640

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.310
 a good little bag not so much but we 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.240
 we are small because it is the essence 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.020
 so the mascara to touch me the course 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.020
 in the life 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.130
 I have it too I have your load is 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.960
 little makeup as you can see me 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.550
 I bring as much makeup because I 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.500
 I say prevented if it's going to leave after 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.150
 humanity if I go to the cinema if I saw 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.160
 I love eating a lot of makeup 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.400
 my poster or can you be someone else has 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.270
 fallen this that girls seriously my 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.640
 mobile 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.640
 it's an extension of my hand 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:59.840
 let's talk to me but I have one 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.840
 which is like Carlos but it's a lot 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.050
 two 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.440
 things that happen in your head 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.900
 took pictures and showed them to everyone 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.540
 you guys usually carry 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.770
 food in the wallet 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.310
 let's say we take food but always 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.010
 carry a bottle of water 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.810
 water carries 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.400
 Do not bring water, I'll tell you once 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.800
 see my portfolio I'm not for water with my 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.390
 camera because the water was close to me and I 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.310
 I messed up the camera and I cried 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.740
 like for a week and finally 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.970
 They took my anti bacterial gel because 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.350
 I always walk on the street 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.350
 block eating 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:13.240
 antibacterial gel I put it like none 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.240
 great cookies mom case 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.510
 and the disinfectant I do not like 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.070
 carry because you know that the preserves give me 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:31.790
 a little more so do not do what I do 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.320
 It is a moisturizer because yes because 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.880
 my skin always dry up so 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:43.280
 I have to be throwing - tender 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:44.960
 moisturizing valverde on the street but if 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.580
 I'm in a restaurant or at home a 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.580
 friend, we are always with the case 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.640
 to see this planet mind May 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.500
 I always bring as I try to find 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.860
 as small containers for my perfume 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.630
 to not load it like all this 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.460
 we are already looking and I am very little 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.110
 practice because I brought the next one 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.550
 concert for me to be great 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.530
 smaller versions but in this case 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.350
 I bring the full perfume there are other 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.320
 people who can bring pepper gas 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.060
 for safety with some girls I think 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.560
 which is a lack then very important 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.450
 who brings us to his cell phone in his 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.970
 wallet 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:24.560
 all though for more time in my hand 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.330
 that in the portfolio to be honest 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.190
 I hope we miss anything 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.419
 minus the cell phone 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.770
 although sometimes he is always losing 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:36.350
 the cell phone in the wallet but it's like 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:41.020
 when it sounds and looks for everything we can 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.020
 achieve the car 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.620
 and for short girls like me is to use 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:50.360
 small wallets and especially those that 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.199
 they are crossed done you are aggression I have 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.610
 heard that the tallest girls and 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:57.470
 you know that those who have the corridita 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.750
 So they are very practical because you have left 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:03.139
 hands without too many and simply 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:05.000
 to start and useful for men who 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:07.580
 are not to say they want to be 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.280
 curious in the bags of women is 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.169
 because sometimes we are women and all 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.729
 it happens to us that we have 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.729
 our towels or tampons 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:23.300
 [Laughs] 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:38.860
 world football but they know that they now sell 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.870
 some small cases so that all 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.850
 the Mexicans and we can how it leaves very 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.170
 clear angular about people is so 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.690
 nice that sometimes seem like a 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.610
 gift and exact but as they saw all 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.310
 we have something in common that is our 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.080
 Cell phones are sometimes our camera 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.350
 lip gloss things that can not 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.910
 missing women I would like me to 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.920
 comment what things can not be missing in 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.890
 your bag not in a squid the things of your 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.890
 bag and send it to with the new hashtag 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.600
 or hashtag look and do not forget to like it and 

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.300
 share it with all your friends or 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.249
 goodbye friends 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:15.489
 [Music] 

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:15.489
 ah
