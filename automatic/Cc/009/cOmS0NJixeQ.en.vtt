guys<00:00:11.639> today<00:00:12.030> we're<00:00:12.180> going<00:00:12.270> to<00:00:12.330> be<00:00:12.510> comparing

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
guys today we're going to be comparing

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.420 
guys today we're going to be comparing
side<00:00:13.740> by<00:00:13.949> side<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:15.270> Android<00:00:16.020> wear<00:00:16.350> app<00:00:16.619> versus

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
side by side the Android wear app versus

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.689 
side by side the Android wear app versus
the<00:00:17.609> gear<00:00:18.420> manager<00:00:18.779> app<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:20.100> today<00:00:20.550> we're

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
the gear manager app so today we're

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.189 
the gear manager app so today we're
really<00:00:20.820> going<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.060> compare<00:00:21.330> just<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.990> apps

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
really going to compare just the apps

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.710 
really going to compare just the apps
themselves<00:00:22.619> not<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.699> watches<00:00:24.210> but<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.599> apps

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
themselves not the watches but the apps

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.870 
themselves not the watches but the apps
themselves<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.410> really<00:00:25.949> make<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.699> watch

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
themselves that really make the watch

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.290 
themselves that really make the watch
connected<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.660> your<00:00:27.810> device<00:00:28.279> so<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.609> Android

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
connected to your device so on Android

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.780 
connected to your device so on Android
wear<00:00:31.009> since<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.310> newer<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.730> two

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
wear since it is the newer of the two

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.900 
wear since it is the newer of the two
it's<00:00:33.240> a<00:00:33.420> very<00:00:33.960> very<00:00:34.460> simplistic<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.670> its

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
it's a very very simplistic in its

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.630 
it's a very very simplistic in its
design<00:00:36.680> you<00:00:37.680> can<00:00:37.710> connect<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.310> your<00:00:38.400> watch

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
design you can connect to your watch

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.730 
design you can connect to your watch
right<00:00:38.970> up<00:00:39.090> here<00:00:39.240> at<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.390> top<00:00:39.590> you<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.710> a

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.740 
right up here at the top you have a

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.680 
right up here at the top you have a
settings<00:00:41.400> portion<00:00:41.820> which<00:00:42.000> goes<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.240> little<00:00:42.540> bit

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
settings portion which goes a little bit

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.650 
settings portion which goes a little bit
more<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.050> depth<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:44.030> right<00:00:45.030> here<00:00:45.360> you

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
more in depth and right here you

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.740 
more in depth and right here you
actually<00:00:45.930> can<00:00:46.470> set<00:00:47.070> what<00:00:47.520> apps<00:00:47.760> launch<00:00:48.300> where

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
actually can set what apps launch where

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.820 
actually can set what apps launch where
so<00:00:49.410> if<00:00:50.070> you're<00:00:50.970> if<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.540> set<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.990> timer<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.650> it

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
so if you're if you set a timer is it

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.990 
so if you're if you set a timer is it
gonna<00:00:52.950> be<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.100> clock<00:00:53.310> or<00:00:53.580> is<00:00:53.700> going<00:00:53.790> to<00:00:53.910> be

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
gonna be the clock or is going to be

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.530 
gonna be the clock or is going to be
another<00:00:54.210> app<00:00:54.510> if<00:00:55.010> you<00:00:56.030> set<00:00:57.030> your<00:00:57.060> heart<00:00:57.390> rate

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
another app if you set your heart rate

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.260 
another app if you set your heart rate
is<00:00:57.720> it<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.380> the<00:00:58.650> fit<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.970> Google

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
is it going to be the fit of the Google

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.060 
is it going to be the fit of the Google
fit<00:01:00.480> app<00:01:00.690> or<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.080> going<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.290> be<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.590> heart<00:01:01.890> rate

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
fit app or is going to be the heart rate

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.600 
fit app or is going to be the heart rate
app<00:01:02.310> so<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.600> how<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> basically<00:01:05.220> out<00:01:05.339> is

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
app so this is how the basically out is

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.640 
app so this is how the basically out is
I<00:01:05.729> don't<00:01:05.909> have<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.450> lift<00:01:06.840> one<00:01:07.080> which<00:01:07.320> would<00:01:07.470> be

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
I don't have the lift one which would be

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.639 
I don't have the lift one which would be
for<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.950> call<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> car<00:01:08.609> but<00:01:09.539> this<00:01:09.719> is<00:01:09.929> it<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.409> I

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
for the call a car but this is it and I

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:13.730 
for the call a car but this is it and I
just<00:01:10.710> says<00:01:11.070> browse<00:01:11.399> compatible<00:01:12.149> apps<00:01:12.740> however

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
just says browse compatible apps however

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.800 
just says browse compatible apps however
it<00:01:14.009> doesn't<00:01:14.249> have<00:01:14.520> all<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.789> compatible<00:01:15.630> apps

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
it doesn't have all the compatible apps

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.989 
it doesn't have all the compatible apps
lists<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.350> here<00:01:16.679> which<00:01:17.219> makes<00:01:17.429> me<00:01:17.640> think<00:01:17.670> this

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:17.999 
lists on here which makes me think this

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:19.969 
lists on here which makes me think this
is<00:01:18.299> more<00:01:18.539> of<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.810> featured<00:01:19.320> list<00:01:19.679> and

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
is more of like a featured list and

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.969 
is more of like a featured list and
that's<00:01:20.369> about<00:01:20.579> it<00:01:21.049> to<00:01:22.049> get<00:01:22.200> real<00:01:22.380> in-depth

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
that's about it to get real in-depth

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.410 
that's about it to get real in-depth
