of narrow and long person kind of like

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.160 
of narrow and long person kind of like
the<00:01:02.739> corset<00:01:03.100> then<00:01:03.370> it<00:01:03.790> will<00:01:04.000> fit<00:01:04.239> you<00:01:04.390> but<00:01:04.960> if

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
the corset then it will fit you but if

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.160 
the corset then it will fit you but if
you<00:01:05.290> were<00:01:05.820> pear-shaped<00:01:06.820> you<00:01:07.060> know<00:01:07.240> wider<00:01:07.840> hips

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
you were pear-shaped you know wider hips

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.160 
you were pear-shaped you know wider hips
then<00:01:08.800> I<00:01:09.220> probably<00:01:09.910> wouldn't<00:01:10.420> recommend<00:01:10.510> this

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
then I probably wouldn't recommend this

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.710 
then I probably wouldn't recommend this
corset<00:01:11.620> for<00:01:11.680> you<00:01:12.040> because<00:01:12.550> this<00:01:13.180> seems<00:01:13.420> to<00:01:13.690> be

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
corset for you because this seems to be

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.990 
corset for you because this seems to be
almost<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.830> same<00:01:14.950> pattern<00:01:15.790> as<00:01:15.940> the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
almost the same pattern as the

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.060 
almost the same pattern as the
sweetheart<00:01:16.780> of<00:01:16.960> course<00:01:17.230> it<00:01:17.409> except

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
sweetheart of course it except

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.800 
sweetheart of course it except
lengthened<00:01:18.820> so<00:01:19.300> that<00:01:19.750> means<00:01:20.020> that<00:01:20.380> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
lengthened so that means that the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.300 
lengthened so that means that the
circumference<00:01:22.810> of<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.409> bust<00:01:23.650> and<00:01:23.950> of<00:01:24.190> the

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
circumference of the bust and of the

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.610 
circumference of the bust and of the
hips<00:01:24.640> aren't<00:01:25.300> really<00:01:25.540> widened<00:01:26.140> as<00:01:26.320> they<00:01:26.470> go

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
hips aren't really widened as they go

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.780 
hips aren't really widened as they go
down<00:01:26.920> it's<00:01:27.520> just<00:01:27.670> basically<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.720> same

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
down it's just basically the same

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.980 
down it's just basically the same
circumference<00:01:30.790> that<00:01:31.030> it<00:01:31.150> would<00:01:31.270> be<00:01:31.420> if<00:01:31.659> it

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
circumference that it would be if it

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.649 
circumference that it would be if it
were<00:01:32.080> shorter<00:01:32.590> and<00:01:32.770> up<00:01:32.979> here<00:01:33.430> so<00:01:33.970> I<00:01:34.330> feel

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
were shorter and up here so I feel

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.780 
were shorter and up here so I feel
fairly<00:01:35.170> comfortable<00:01:35.470> on<00:01:36.010> my<00:01:36.160> hips<00:01:36.400> right<00:01:36.610> now

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
fairly comfortable on my hips right now

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.090 
fairly comfortable on my hips right now
in<00:01:37.120> terms<00:01:37.510> of<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:38.050> circumference<00:01:38.710> and<00:01:39.010> you

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
in terms of the circumference and you

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.010 
in terms of the circumference and you
know<00:01:39.190> that<00:01:39.400> the<00:01:39.610> space<00:01:39.880> that<00:01:39.910> it<00:01:40.240> gives<00:01:40.420> me<00:01:40.600> the

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
know that the space that it gives me the

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.020 
know that the space that it gives me the
only<00:01:41.200> thing<00:01:41.500> that<00:01:41.650> I<00:01:41.680> can<00:01:42.070> complain<00:01:42.460> about<00:01:42.520> is

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
only thing that I can complain about is

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.210 
only thing that I can complain about is
just<00:01:43.480> the<00:01:43.630> placement<00:01:44.170> of<00:01:44.260> the<00:01:44.440> bones<00:01:44.650> right<00:01:45.010> on

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
just the placement of the bones right on

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.730 
just the placement of the bones right on
the<00:01:45.370> side<00:01:45.580> here<00:01:45.940> it<00:01:46.090> says<00:01:46.510> to<00:01:46.660> be<00:01:46.780> seems<00:01:47.500> to<00:01:47.620> be

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
the side here it says to be seems to be

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.250 
the side here it says to be seems to be
sitting<00:01:48.070> right<00:01:48.220> on<00:01:48.820> my<00:01:48.880> iliac<00:01:49.450> crest<00:01:49.840> so<00:01:50.080> it's

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
sitting right on my iliac crest so it's

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.170 
sitting right on my iliac crest so it's
kind<00:01:50.500> of<00:01:50.590> digging<00:01:51.160> right<00:01:51.490> into<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:51.970> bones

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
kind of digging right into the bones

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.330 
kind of digging right into the bones
there<00:01:52.420> if<00:01:52.570> I<00:01:52.630> had<00:01:52.750> a<00:01:52.780> little<00:01:52.960> bit<00:01:53.140> more<00:01:53.340> padding

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
there if I had a little bit more padding

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.700 
there if I had a little bit more padding
in<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:54.520> area<00:01:54.820> or<00:01:55.120> if<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.990> bones<00:01:56.230> were<00:01:56.470> just

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
in the area or if the bones were just

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.430 
in the area or if the bones were just
shifted<00:01:57.100> maybe<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.670> centimeter<00:01:58.270> off<00:01:58.900> of<00:01:59.260> that

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
shifted maybe a centimeter off of that

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.530 
shifted maybe a centimeter off of that
area<00:01:59.890> this<00:02:00.250> would<00:02:00.520> be<00:02:00.730> infinitely<00:02:01.300> more

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
area this would be infinitely more

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.510 
area this would be infinitely more
comfortable<00:02:02.080> so<00:02:02.770> here's<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.160> long<00:02:03.340> length

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
comfortable so here's the long length

and<00:05:44.710> even<00:05:45.710> though<00:05:46.130> this<00:05:46.400> is<00:05:46.460> a<00:05:46.610> longline

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
and even though this is a longline

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.610 
and even though this is a longline
corset<00:05:47.600> and<00:05:47.750> therefore<00:05:48.110> it<00:05:48.199> has<00:05:48.349> to<00:05:48.380> go

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
corset and therefore it has to go

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.040 
corset and therefore it has to go
through<00:05:48.919> more<00:05:49.099> axis<00:05:49.610> in<00:05:49.849> this<00:05:50.000> corset<00:05:50.449> I<00:05:50.630> feel

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
through more axis in this corset I feel

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.900 
through more axis in this corset I feel
that<00:05:51.289> these<00:05:51.530> laces<00:05:51.979> are<00:05:52.280> long<00:05:52.520> enough<00:05:52.699> I

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
that these laces are long enough I

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.460 
that these laces are long enough I
believe<00:05:53.180> that<00:05:53.330> they<00:05:53.419> give<00:05:53.630> you<00:05:53.720> about<00:05:54.020> 8

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
believe that they give you about 8

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.550 
believe that they give you about 8
meters<00:05:54.800> of<00:05:55.190> lacing<00:05:55.639> so<00:05:56.000> it's<00:05:56.479> not<00:05:56.720> like<00:05:57.020> I'm

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
meters of lacing so it's not like I'm

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
meters of lacing so it's not like I'm
not<00:05:57.830> able<00:05:58.099> to<00:05:59.229> open<00:06:00.229> the<00:06:00.620> corset<00:06:01.130> wide<00:06:01.310> enough

not able to open the corset wide enough

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.040 
not able to open the corset wide enough
to<00:06:01.639> actually<00:06:02.060> get<00:06:02.210> the<00:06:02.330> corset<00:06:02.690> on<00:06:02.720> or

to actually get the corset on or
anything<00:06:03.229> like<00:06:03.470> that<00:06:03.530> when<00:06:04.520> you<00:06:04.639> tie<00:06:04.820> it<00:06:04.880> up

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
anything like that when you tie it up

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.700 
anything like that when you tie it up
you<00:06:05.240> might<00:06:05.389> feel<00:06:05.690> that<00:06:05.720> the<00:06:06.199> laces<00:06:06.530> are

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
you might feel that the laces are

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.070 
you might feel that the laces are
