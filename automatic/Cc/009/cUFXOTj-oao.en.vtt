video wanted to show you a few of the

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.880 
video wanted to show you a few of the
possibilities<00:00:06.120> for<00:00:06.359> attack<00:00:06.720> options<00:00:06.990> using

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
possibilities for attack options using

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.440 
possibilities for attack options using
the<00:00:08.010> framework<00:00:08.460> of<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.820> attack<00:00:09.000> triangle

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
the framework of the attack triangle

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.700 
the framework of the attack triangle
that<00:00:09.510> we<00:00:09.599> talked<00:00:09.780> about<00:00:09.900> in<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.230> previous<00:00:10.380> video

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
that we talked about in a previous video

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.740 
that we talked about in a previous video
so<00:00:11.040> let's<00:00:11.670> go<00:00:11.790> ahead<00:00:11.969> we'll<00:00:12.150> pull<00:00:12.360> up<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.540> rink

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
so let's go ahead we'll pull up the rink

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.650 
so let's go ahead we'll pull up the rink
and<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:13.620> can<00:00:13.740> see<00:00:13.860> we've<00:00:13.980> got<00:00:14.070> our<00:00:14.219> basic

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
and that you can see we've got our basic

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.240 
and that you can see we've got our basic
offensive<00:00:15.660> attack<00:00:15.900> formation<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.619> that

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
offensive attack formation that that

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.010 
offensive attack formation that that
were<00:00:17.369> shoe<00:00:17.850> before<00:00:18.150> which<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.330> f1<00:00:18.810> that's

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
were shoe before which is f1 that's

man and within this framework there are

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.810 
man and within this framework there are
literally<00:00:25.680> literally<00:00:26.250> endless

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
literally literally endless

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.429 
literally literally endless
possibilities<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:28.080> know<00:00:28.109> different

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
possibilities of you know different

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.570 
possibilities of you know different
combinations<00:00:28.920> different<00:00:29.070> things<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.429> you

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
combinations different things that you

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.930 
combinations different things that you
can<00:00:29.699> do<00:00:30.349> to<00:00:31.349> gain<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.040> advantage<00:00:32.189> over<00:00:32.669> your

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
can do to gain that advantage over your

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.180 
can do to gain that advantage over your
opponent<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.930> offensive<00:00:34.320> zone<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.980> let's

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
opponent in the offensive zone so let's

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.410 
opponent in the offensive zone so let's
just<00:00:35.340> go<00:00:35.460> through<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.700> few<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.969> them<00:00:36.059> really

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
just go through a few of them really

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.720 
just go through a few of them really
quickly<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.100> then<00:00:38.100> that'll<00:00:38.370> kind<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.579> give

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
quickly and then that'll kind of give

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.040 
quickly and then that'll kind of give
you<00:00:38.820> an<00:00:38.879> idea<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.239> what<00:00:39.450> we're<00:00:39.600> what<00:00:39.899> we're

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
you an idea of what we're what we're

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.770 
you an idea of what we're what we're
talking<00:00:40.290> about<00:00:40.350> here<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:41.360> let's<00:00:42.360> just<00:00:42.600> go

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
talking about here so let's just go

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.420 
talking about here so let's just go
ahead<00:00:42.809> with<00:00:43.230> we'll<00:00:43.500> start<00:00:43.530> with<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> very<00:00:44.190> basic

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
ahead with we'll start with a very basic

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.119 
ahead with we'll start with a very basic
ones<00:00:45.050> let's<00:00:46.050> say<00:00:46.170> f1<00:00:46.350> drives<00:00:46.770> wide<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:49.129> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
ones let's say f1 drives wide and the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.350 
ones let's say f1 drives wide and the
defenseman<00:00:50.460> doesn't<00:00:50.820> go<00:00:50.879> with<00:00:51.030> him<00:00:51.180> or<00:00:51.300> he

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
defenseman doesn't go with him or he

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.660 
defenseman doesn't go with him or he
beats<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.719> defenseman<00:00:52.110> wide<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.739> he<00:00:53.250> cuts<00:00:53.520> to

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
beats that defenseman wide so he cuts to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.569 
beats that defenseman wide so he cuts to
the<00:00:53.789> net<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.420> takes<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.870> shot<00:00:55.110> ok<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:56.370> that's

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the net and takes a shot ok so that's

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.880 
the net and takes a shot ok so that's
here<00:00:56.789> that's<00:00:57.270> your<00:00:57.449> very<00:00:57.690> baseline<00:00:58.530> most

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
here that's your very baseline most

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.000 
here that's your very baseline most
basic<00:00:59.539> possible<00:01:00.539> version<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.989> this<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.500> I'm

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
basic possible version of this and I'm

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.860 
basic possible version of this and I'm
pretty<00:01:02.070> straightforward<00:01:02.760> there<00:01:02.910> let's<00:01:03.719> take

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
pretty straightforward there let's take

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.539 
pretty straightforward there let's take
another<00:01:04.019> possible<00:01:04.710> version<00:01:05.070> let's<00:01:05.220> say<00:01:05.369> that

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
another possible version let's say that

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.910 
another possible version let's say that
our<00:01:06.080> our<00:01:07.080> f1<00:01:07.530> drives<00:01:07.830> wide<00:01:09.200> our<00:01:10.200> f2<00:01:10.650> drives

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
our our f1 drives wide our f2 drives

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.190 
our our f1 drives wide our f2 drives
wide<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:12.049> the<00:01:13.049> F<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.920> beat<00:01:14.549> his<00:01:14.790> defenseman<00:01:15.420> F

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
wide and the F to beat his defenseman F

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.039 
wide and the F to beat his defenseman F
one's<00:01:16.650> defenseman<00:01:17.189> stayed<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:17.729> him<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.659> and

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
one's defenseman stayed with him but and

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.910 
one's defenseman stayed with him but and
now<00:01:19.170> we've<00:01:19.350> got<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.500> possible<00:01:20.040> pass<00:01:20.939> across<00:01:21.920> so

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
now we've got it possible pass across so

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.820 
now we've got it possible pass across so
basically<00:01:23.400> F<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.909> speed<00:01:24.540> turn<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.080> 2<00:01:25.229> onto<00:01:25.409> into

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
basically F to speed turn to 2 onto into

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.670 
basically F to speed turn to 2 onto into
a<00:01:25.860> two-on-one<00:01:26.540> pass<00:01:27.540> across<00:01:27.840> one<00:01:28.170> type<00:01:28.380> shot

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
a two-on-one pass across one type shot

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.520 
a two-on-one pass across one type shot
for<00:01:29.340> Shaffer<00:01:29.729> as<00:01:29.970> well<00:01:30.150> ok<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.079> we're<00:01:31.380> going

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
for Shaffer as well ok so we're going

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.440 
for Shaffer as well ok so we're going
we're<00:01:31.740> going<00:01:31.860> from<00:01:32.040> basic<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.790> more<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.329> more

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
we're going from basic to more and more

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.010 
we're going from basic to more and more
complex<00:01:33.810> here<00:01:34.130> ok<00:01:35.130> let's<00:01:35.670> say<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.090> f1<00:01:36.780> driver

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
complex here ok let's say that f1 driver

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.010 
complex here ok let's say that f1 driver
drove<00:01:37.500> wide<00:01:37.770> f2<00:01:38.340> drove<00:01:38.610> wide<00:01:38.850> both<00:01:39.450> defenseman

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
drove wide f2 drove wide both defenseman

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.670 
drove wide f2 drove wide both defenseman
stayed<00:01:40.290> with<00:01:40.500> their<00:01:40.619> guys<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.670> now<00:01:42.320> because<00:01:43.320> of

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
stayed with their guys so now because of

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.319 
stayed with their guys so now because of
that<00:01:43.710> we've<00:01:44.040> got<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.220> lane<00:01:44.490> open<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.060> middle

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
that we've got a lane open in the middle

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.590 
that we've got a lane open in the middle
for<00:01:45.840> f3<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.470> slide<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.700> let's<00:01:48.270> just<00:01:48.420> say

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
for f3 to slide in and let's just say

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.399 
for f3 to slide in and let's just say
that<00:01:48.750> we<00:01:48.840> do<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> little<00:01:49.490> little<00:01:50.490> drop<00:01:50.610> pass<00:01:52.610> and

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
that we do a little little drop pass and

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.899 
that we do a little little drop pass and
threes<00:01:55.409> got<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> big<00:01:55.799> booming<00:01:56.100> slap<00:01:56.340> shot<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:56.759> he

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
threes got a big booming slap shot so he

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.450 
threes got a big booming slap shot so he
walks<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.860> that's<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.950> one-timer

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
walks in and that's a one-timer

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.999 
walks in and that's a one-timer
rip<00:01:59.880> from<00:02:00.149> there<00:02:00.360> from<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.689> high<00:02:00.840> slot<00:02:01.049> so

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
rip from there from the high slot so

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.770 
rip from there from the high slot so
that's<00:02:02.159> another<00:02:02.399> option<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.180> got<00:02:03.329> your<00:02:03.479> f2

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
that's another option you got your f2

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.610 
that's another option you got your f2
already<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.649> net<00:02:04.799> for<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.979> rebound

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
obviously after f1 does that he's going

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.380

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
you get away with but possibility of a

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.150 
you get away with but possibility of a
legal<00:02:34.090> pick<00:02:34.270> gives<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.660> guy<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.810> second<00:02:35.650> you

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
legal pick gives that guy a second you

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.620 
legal pick gives that guy a second you
know<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.460> little<00:02:36.670> bit<00:02:36.760> of<00:02:36.850> an<00:02:36.970> extra<00:02:37.150> second<00:02:37.600> to

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
know a little bit of an extra second to

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.210 
know a little bit of an extra second to
get<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:37.930> shot<00:02:38.140> off<00:02:38.170> so<00:02:38.890> that's<00:02:39.010> another

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
get that shot off so that's another

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.300 
get that shot off so that's another
option<00:02:39.990> but<00:02:40.990> it<00:02:41.230> works<00:02:41.440> even<00:02:41.770> if<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:42.010> don't<00:02:42.190> do

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
option but it works even if you don't do

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.090 
option but it works even if you don't do
the<00:02:42.430> legal<00:02:42.580> pick<00:02:42.850> so<00:02:43.500> either<00:02:44.500> way<00:02:44.710> that's<00:02:44.860> fine

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
the legal pick so either way that's fine

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.600 
the legal pick so either way that's fine
let's<00:02:46.030> let's<00:02:46.720> go<00:02:46.870> ahead<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.260> say<00:02:47.500> we'll<00:02:48.430> get<00:02:48.580> a

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
let's let's go ahead and say we'll get a

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.400 
let's let's go ahead and say we'll get a
little<00:02:48.760> bit<00:02:48.940> more<00:02:49.150> complex<00:02:49.630> here<00:02:49.900> let's<00:02:50.290> say

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
little bit more complex here let's say

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.290 
little bit more complex here let's say
that<00:02:50.440> f3<00:02:50.980> got<00:02:51.160> delayed<00:02:51.550> in<00:02:51.610> the<00:02:51.850> neutral<00:02:52.150> zone

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
that f3 got delayed in the neutral zone

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.650 
that f3 got delayed in the neutral zone
so<00:02:52.540> he's<00:02:52.720> not<00:02:52.870> there<00:02:53.080> as<00:02:53.200> an<00:02:53.320> option<00:02:54.450> f1<00:02:55.450> can

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
so he's not there as an option f1 can

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.870 
so he's not there as an option f1 can
use<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.870> delay<00:02:56.320> tactic<00:02:56.740> which<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.460> basically<00:02:57.760> a

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
use a delay tactic which is basically a

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.820 
use a delay tactic which is basically a
misdirection<00:02:58.390> so<00:02:58.840> he's<00:02:59.020> got<00:02:59.200> no<00:02:59.410> options

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
misdirection so he's got no options

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.890 
misdirection so he's got no options
basically<00:03:00.040> his<00:03:00.910> defenseman<00:03:01.420> has<00:03:01.540> done<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.720> good

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
basically his defenseman has done a good

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.110 
basically his defenseman has done a good
job<00:03:01.960> at<00:03:02.470> sealing<00:03:03.010> off<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.610> middle<00:03:03.790> so<00:03:04.000> he

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
job at sealing off the the middle so he

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.700 
job at sealing off the the middle so he
can't<00:03:04.330> cut<00:03:04.480> through<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.870> net<00:03:05.050> there's<00:03:05.530> no

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
can't cut through to the net there's no

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.320 
can't cut through to the net there's no
passing<00:03:06.070> option<00:03:06.310> across<00:03:06.580> so<00:03:07.000> he<00:03:07.090> can<00:03:07.210> do<00:03:07.300> a

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
passing option across so he can do a

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.210 
passing option across so he can do a
delay<00:03:07.660> tactic<00:03:08.140> which<00:03:08.320> is<00:03:08.440> basically<00:03:08.740> just<00:03:08.830> a

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
delay tactic which is basically just a

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.080 
delay tactic which is basically just a
little<00:03:09.370> misdirection

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
little misdirection

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.990 
little misdirection
it<00:03:10.540> gives<00:03:11.020> f3<00:03:11.709> an<00:03:11.860> extra<00:03:12.190> second<00:03:12.610> to<00:03:12.640> get<00:03:12.850> in

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
it gives f3 an extra second to get in

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.510 
it gives f3 an extra second to get in
now<00:03:13.540> when<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.810> see<00:03:14.020> a<00:03:14.050> delay<00:03:14.350> tactic<00:03:14.830> f3<00:03:15.370> this

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
now when you see a delay tactic f3 this

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.600 
now when you see a delay tactic f3 this
is<00:03:15.670> now<00:03:15.820> a<00:03:15.850> good<00:03:16.239> chance<00:03:16.540> for<00:03:16.660> f3<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.320> alter<00:03:17.890> his

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
is now a good chance for f3 to alter his

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.580 
is now a good chance for f3 to alter his
point<00:03:19.060> of<00:03:19.120> attack<00:03:19.450> so<00:03:19.840> instead<00:03:20.080> of<00:03:20.140> coming<00:03:20.350> in

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
point of attack so instead of coming in

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.320 
point of attack so instead of coming in
right<00:03:20.920> off<00:03:21.130> that<00:03:21.310> guy's<00:03:21.550> inside<00:03:21.910> shoulder

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
right off that guy's inside shoulder

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.630 
right off that guy's inside shoulder
since<00:03:22.810> he<00:03:23.050> got<00:03:23.200> delayed<00:03:23.440> now<00:03:24.280> this<00:03:24.459> guy<00:03:24.610> is

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
since he got delayed now this guy is

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.520 
since he got delayed now this guy is
facing<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.480> opposite<00:03:25.870> way<00:03:26.050> cuz<00:03:26.230> he's<00:03:26.350> done<00:03:26.500> a

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
facing the opposite way cuz he's done a

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.320 
facing the opposite way cuz he's done a
misdirection<00:03:26.980> now<00:03:27.700> would<00:03:27.850> be<00:03:27.880> a<00:03:28.000> good<00:03:28.120> time

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
misdirection now would be a good time

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.080 
misdirection now would be a good time
for<00:03:28.360> f3<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.110> come<00:03:29.320> in<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.739> slide<00:03:30.640> it<00:03:30.790> in<00:03:30.880> or<00:03:30.970> to

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
for f3 to come in and slide it in or to

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.540 
for f3 to come in and slide it in or to
where<00:03:31.209> it's<00:03:31.300> the<00:03:31.390> middle<00:03:31.800> because<00:03:32.800> that<00:03:33.100> that

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
where it's the middle because that that

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.300 
where it's the middle because that that
option<00:03:33.880> will<00:03:34.239> be<00:03:34.360> a<00:03:34.390> much<00:03:34.900> greater<00:03:35.890> passive

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
option will be a much greater passive

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.250 
option will be a much greater passive
option<00:03:36.610> than<00:03:37.090> just<00:03:37.120> passing<00:03:37.810> to<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.930> guy<00:03:38.050> that's

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
option than just passing to a guy that's

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.680 
option than just passing to a guy that's
you<00:03:38.410> know<00:03:38.590> right<00:03:38.800> beside<00:03:39.130> him<00:03:39.280> so<00:03:39.850> in<00:03:40.390> this

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
you know right beside him so in this

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.240 
you know right beside him so in this
case<00:03:40.989> f3<00:03:41.350> would<00:03:41.440> probably<00:03:41.770> slide<00:03:41.980> in<00:03:42.190> the

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
case f3 would probably slide in the

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.580 
case f3 would probably slide in the
middle<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.820> you<00:03:42.970> can<00:03:43.000> get<00:03:43.239> a<00:03:43.270> little<00:03:43.590> pass

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
middle and you can get a little pass

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
middle and you can get a little pass
across<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.810> a<00:03:47.020> one-time<00:03:47.350> shot<00:03:50.160> okay<00:03:51.160> which<00:03:51.459> is

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
across and a one-time shot okay which is

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.120 
across and a one-time shot okay which is
another<00:03:51.880> good<00:03:52.090> option<00:03:52.830> continuing<00:03:53.830> along<00:03:53.920> the

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
another good option continuing along the

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.630 
another good option continuing along the
same<00:03:54.340> framework<00:03:56.130> there's<00:03:57.130> another<00:03:57.370> option

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
same framework there's another option

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.390 
same framework there's another option
that<00:03:57.910> can<00:03:58.060> be<00:03:58.420> a<00:03:58.450> possibility<00:03:59.050> as<00:03:59.320> well<00:03:59.560> if<00:03:59.920> f3

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
that can be a possibility as well if f3

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.940 
that can be a possibility as well if f3
reads<00:04:00.670> it<00:04:00.850> and<00:04:01.300> you<00:04:02.050> know<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.260> play<00:04:02.530> presents

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
reads it and you know the play presents

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.420 
reads it and you know the play presents
itself<00:04:03.220> f3<00:04:03.820> can<00:04:04.000> actually<00:04:04.300> come<00:04:04.540> in<00:04:04.750> and<00:04:05.430> call

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
itself f3 can actually come in and call

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.870 
itself f3 can actually come in and call
for<00:04:06.640> a<00:04:06.850> cycle<00:04:07.660> whoops<00:04:08.590> sorry<00:04:09.010> I'm<00:04:09.519> getting<00:04:09.700> my

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
for a cycle whoops sorry I'm getting my

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.360 
for a cycle whoops sorry I'm getting my
mouse<00:04:10.090> messed<00:04:10.390> up<00:04:10.570> here<00:04:10.780> I<00:04:11.100> might<00:04:12.100> have<00:04:12.250> to

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
mouse messed up here I might have to

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.030 
mouse messed up here I might have to
redo<00:04:12.580> this<00:04:12.700> line<00:04:13.260> actually<00:04:14.260> corrected<00:04:14.799> it<00:04:14.890> for

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
redo this line actually corrected it for

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.660 
redo this line actually corrected it for
me<00:04:15.190> yeah<00:04:15.609> let<00:04:15.820> me<00:04:15.850> do<00:04:16.090> it

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
me yeah let me do it

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.280 
me yeah let me do it
okay<00:04:18.670> so<00:04:18.730> after<00:04:18.910> you<00:04:19.090> can<00:04:19.239> come<00:04:19.420> in<00:04:19.630> call<00:04:20.049> for<00:04:20.260> a

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
okay so after you can come in call for a

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.610 
okay so after you can come in call for a
cycle<00:04:20.799> and<00:04:20.980> then<00:04:21.810> execute<00:04:22.810> a<00:04:22.840> giving<00:04:23.110> go<00:04:23.260> after

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
cycle and then execute a giving go after

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.470 
cycle and then execute a giving go after
that<00:04:23.770> so<00:04:24.490> it<00:04:24.790> would<00:04:24.940> look<00:04:25.060> something<00:04:25.120> like

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
that so it would look something like

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.100 
that so it would look something like
this

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
this

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.010 
this
f1<00:04:26.500> cycles<00:04:27.010> back<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:28.450> we'll<00:04:28.570> talk<00:04:28.720> more<00:04:28.870> about

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
f1 cycles back and we'll talk more about

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.500 
f1 cycles back and we'll talk more about
cycling<00:04:29.440> in<00:04:29.889> our<00:04:30.040> video<00:04:30.490> specifically<00:04:31.240> about

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
cycling in our video specifically about

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.060 
cycling in our video specifically about
cycling<00:04:31.810> but<00:04:32.139> you<00:04:32.230> could<00:04:32.350> do<00:04:32.440> a<00:04:32.470> little<00:04:32.620> cycle

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
cycling but you could do a little cycle

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:38.280 
cycling but you could do a little cycle
then<00:04:33.760> f3<00:04:34.980> swings<00:04:36.180> this<00:04:37.180> way<00:04:37.389> a<00:04:37.419> little<00:04:37.960> bit

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
then f3 swings this way a little bit

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.740 
then f3 swings this way a little bit
after<00:04:38.980> I've<00:04:39.430> run<00:04:39.639> cycles<00:04:40.300> and<00:04:40.450> he's<00:04:40.570> gonna

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
after I've run cycles and he's gonna

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.720 
after I've run cycles and he's gonna
drive<00:04:41.050> through<00:04:41.410> the<00:04:41.530> scene<00:04:41.800> this<00:04:42.310> is<00:04:42.460> another

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
drive through the scene this is another

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.629 
drive through the scene this is another
way<00:04:42.940> of<00:04:42.970> exploiting<00:04:43.450> the<00:04:43.690> scene<00:04:44.460> we<00:04:45.460> always

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
way of exploiting the scene we always

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.100 
way of exploiting the scene we always
talk<00:04:45.820> about<00:04:45.850> the<00:04:46.120> scene<00:04:46.360> it's<00:04:46.570> really<00:04:46.840> if<00:04:46.990> you

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
talk about the scene it's really if you

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.360 
talk about the scene it's really if you
use<00:04:47.380> it<00:04:47.500> effectively<00:04:47.710> it's<00:04:48.040> a<00:04:48.070> really<00:04:48.280> good

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
use it effectively it's a really good

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.970 
use it effectively it's a really good
place<00:04:48.610> to<00:04:48.669> exploit<00:04:49.240> on<00:04:49.480> the<00:04:49.600> ice<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:50.560> a<00:04:50.680> little

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
place to exploit on the ice and a little

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:57.360 
place to exploit on the ice and a little
pass<00:04:51.130> out<00:04:51.460> and<00:04:52.590> one-time<00:04:53.590> shot<00:04:56.220> notice<00:04:57.220> the

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
pass out and one-time shot notice the

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.040 
pass out and one-time shot notice the
quick<00:04:57.580> release<00:04:57.730> shots<00:04:58.180> are<00:04:58.390> really<00:04:58.600> effective

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
quick release shots are really effective

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.140 
quick release shots are really effective
in<00:04:59.590> the<00:04:59.680> offensive<00:04:59.980> zone<00:05:00.130> so<00:05:00.730> there's<00:05:00.940> another

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
in the offensive zone so there's another

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.000 
in the offensive zone so there's another
possible<00:05:01.660> option<00:05:01.810> a<00:05:02.290> a<00:05:02.380> little<00:05:02.800> bit<00:05:02.890> more

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
possible option a a little bit more

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.920 
possible option a a little bit more
complex<00:05:03.400> option<00:05:03.610> but<00:05:03.910> that<00:05:04.030> stems<00:05:04.360> off<00:05:04.570> the

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
complex option but that stems off the

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.500 
complex option but that stems off the
you<00:05:05.560> know<00:05:05.650> still<00:05:05.890> sounds<00:05:06.100> off<00:05:06.220> the<00:05:06.370> same<00:05:06.610> set

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
you know still sounds off the same set

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.990 
you know still sounds off the same set
up<00:05:07.630> of<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.870> attack<00:05:08.140> attack<00:05:08.800> triangle<00:05:09.220> instead

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
up of the attack attack triangle instead

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.580 
up of the attack attack triangle instead
of<00:05:10.180> a<00:05:10.270> one<00:05:10.450> time<00:05:10.600> shot<00:05:10.630> you<00:05:11.050> can<00:05:11.200> also<00:05:11.350> pass

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
of a one time shot you can also pass

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.469 
of a one time shot you can also pass
across<00:05:11.919> stuff<00:05:12.100> to<00:05:12.340> FFT<00:05:12.760> is<00:05:12.790> still<00:05:13.090> available

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
across stuff to FFT is still available

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.909 
across stuff to FFT is still available
but<00:05:14.410> that's<00:05:14.590> another<00:05:14.770> option<00:05:15.070> for<00:05:16.050> you<00:05:17.050> coming

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
but that's another option for you coming

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:19.010 
but that's another option for you coming
in<00:05:18.010> the<00:05:18.100> zone<00:05:18.250> if<00:05:18.370> that<00:05:18.490> presents<00:05:18.639> itself

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
in the zone if that presents itself

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.750 
in the zone if that presents itself
continuing<00:05:20.020> along<00:05:20.080> those<00:05:20.470> same<00:05:20.500> lines<00:05:20.800> of

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
continuing along those same lines of

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.900 
continuing along those same lines of
thinking<00:05:23.250> let's<00:05:24.250> say<00:05:24.550> that<00:05:26.580> instead<00:05:27.580> of

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
thinking let's say that instead of

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.560 
thinking let's say that instead of
turning<00:05:28.120> back<00:05:28.210> f1<00:05:28.930> decides<00:05:29.410> to<00:05:29.590> drive<00:05:29.800> it<00:05:29.950> deep

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
turning back f1 decides to drive it deep

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.380 
turning back f1 decides to drive it deep
so<00:05:31.570> f1<00:05:31.780> drives<00:05:32.229> deep<00:05:32.760> and<00:05:33.760> now<00:05:33.970> he<00:05:34.120> gets<00:05:34.300> to

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
so f1 drives deep and now he gets to

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.860 
so f1 drives deep and now he gets to
about<00:05:34.539> here<00:05:35.970> there's<00:05:36.970> another<00:05:37.240> opportunity

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
about here there's another opportunity

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.680 
about here there's another opportunity
for<00:05:37.990> a<00:05:38.080> cycle<00:05:38.440> there<00:05:39.270> which<00:05:40.270> would<00:05:40.479> just<00:05:40.660> be

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
for a cycle there which would just be

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.600 
for a cycle there which would just be
always<00:05:41.080> cycle<00:05:41.590> back<00:05:41.710> off<00:05:41.919> towards<00:05:42.220> the<00:05:42.280> boards

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
always cycle back off towards the boards

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.640 
always cycle back off towards the boards
you<00:05:43.600> don't<00:05:43.720> want<00:05:43.840> to<00:05:43.900> cycle<00:05:44.169> back<00:05:44.289> towards<00:05:44.590> the

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
you don't want to cycle back towards the

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.260 
you don't want to cycle back towards the
middle<00:05:44.890> because<00:05:44.979> that's<00:05:45.370> where<00:05:45.940> the<00:05:46.030> pressure

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
middle because that's where the pressure

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.560 
middle because that's where the pressure
is<00:05:46.390> that<00:05:46.630> you're<00:05:46.720> trying<00:05:46.960> to<00:05:47.020> get<00:05:47.289> away<00:05:47.410> from

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
is that you're trying to get away from

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.820 
is that you're trying to get away from
after<00:05:49.570> this<00:05:49.750> happens<00:05:50.169> this<00:05:50.320> is<00:05:50.380> getting<00:05:50.650> into

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
after this happens this is getting into

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.980 
after this happens this is getting into
a<00:05:50.890> little<00:05:50.950> bit<00:05:51.130> more<00:05:51.280> complex<00:05:51.780> concept<00:05:52.780> here

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
a little bit more complex concept here

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.140 
a little bit more complex concept here
but<00:05:53.560> as<00:05:53.680> he<00:05:53.830> cycles<00:05:54.310> after<00:05:54.430> he<00:05:54.669> cycles<00:05:55.030> he's

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
but as he cycles after he cycles he's

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.810 
but as he cycles after he cycles he's
gonna<00:05:55.330> drive<00:05:55.539> around<00:05:55.810> to<00:05:56.050> the<00:05:56.140> back<00:05:56.320> post<00:05:56.820> f2

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
gonna drive around to the back post f2

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.880 
gonna drive around to the back post f2
reads<00:05:58.150> that<00:05:58.300> there<00:05:58.479> was<00:05:58.720> a<00:05:58.750> cycle<00:05:59.289> so<00:05:59.440> he<00:05:59.620> fills

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
reads that there was a cycle so he fills

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.580 
reads that there was a cycle so he fills
in<00:06:00.130> the<00:06:00.880> middle<00:06:01.390> lane<00:06:01.539> for<00:06:01.750> the<00:06:01.810> high<00:06:01.900> slot<00:06:02.169> and

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
in the middle lane for the high slot and

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.930 
in the middle lane for the high slot and
f3<00:06:03.580> has<00:06:03.789> come<00:06:04.060> in<00:06:04.270> to<00:06:05.260> pick<00:06:05.710> up<00:06:05.740> the<00:06:06.010> cycle<00:06:06.490> so

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
f3 has come in to pick up the cycle so

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.420 
f3 has come in to pick up the cycle so
now<00:06:07.090> you've<00:06:07.270> still<00:06:07.570> got<00:06:07.720> a<00:06:07.750> triangle<00:06:08.340> and<00:06:09.340> you

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
now you've still got a triangle and you

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.250 
now you've still got a triangle and you
can<00:06:09.640> work<00:06:09.880> it<00:06:09.970> out<00:06:12.000> and<00:06:13.000> whatever<00:06:13.810> options

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.260 
can work it out and whatever options

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.529 
can work it out and whatever options
present<00:06:14.650> themselves<00:06:14.979> here<00:06:15.490> that<00:06:16.180> may<00:06:16.330> be<00:06:16.390> a

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
present themselves here that may be a

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:18.090 
present themselves here that may be a
pass<00:06:16.750> across<00:06:16.900> that<00:06:17.229> may<00:06:17.350> be<00:06:17.410> another<00:06:17.650> cycle

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
pass across that may be another cycle

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.460 
pass across that may be another cycle
usually<00:06:19.060> I<00:06:19.240> do<00:06:19.300> that<00:06:19.510> in<00:06:19.630> green<00:06:19.780> let's<00:06:20.320> see<00:06:20.410> if

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
usually I do that in green let's see if

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.550 
usually I do that in green let's see if
we<00:06:20.560> can<00:06:20.680> change<00:06:20.830> that<00:06:20.950> color<00:06:21.280> here

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.770 

there<00:06:26.560> we<00:06:26.680> go<00:06:26.770> okay<00:06:27.699> but<00:06:28.389> yeah<00:06:28.479> there<00:06:28.660> are<00:06:28.750> a

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:28.780 
there we go okay but yeah there are a

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.200 
there we go okay but yeah there are a
lot<00:06:28.900> of<00:06:28.930> different<00:06:29.260> options<00:06:29.470> from<00:06:29.949> there

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
lot of different options from there

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:40.830 
lot of different options from there
let's<00:06:32.080> get<00:06:32.199> these<00:06:32.350> zeros<00:06:32.680> out<00:06:32.860> of<00:06:32.979> here<00:06:39.060> okay

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
let's get these zeros out of here okay

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.960 
let's get these zeros out of here okay
there's<00:06:41.229> another<00:06:41.440> option<00:06:41.889> that<00:06:42.070> works<00:06:42.610> really

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 
there's another option that works really

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.580 
there's another option that works really
well<00:06:43.090> and<00:06:43.479> guys<00:06:43.900> I'm<00:06:44.050> just<00:06:44.229> kind<00:06:44.380> of<00:06:44.410> laying

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590 
well and guys I'm just kind of laying

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.930 
well and guys I'm just kind of laying
this<00:06:44.800> all<00:06:44.949> out<00:06:45.160> so<00:06:45.370> you<00:06:45.460> can<00:06:45.610> kind<00:06:45.790> of<00:06:45.820> go

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
this all out so you can kind of go

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.390 
this all out so you can kind of go
through<00:06:46.180> this<00:06:46.440> you<00:06:47.440> know<00:06:47.530> like<00:06:47.680> let<00:06:48.040> your<00:06:48.130> team

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 
through this you know like let your team

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.710 
through this you know like let your team
know<00:06:48.430> what<00:06:48.910> the<00:06:49.000> different<00:06:49.300> options<00:06:49.419> aren't

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
know what the different options aren't

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.140 
know what the different options aren't
and<00:06:49.900> then<00:06:50.050> it's<00:06:50.560> up<00:06:50.770> to<00:06:50.800> the<00:06:51.010> players<00:06:51.280> to<00:06:51.820> read

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
and then it's up to the players to read

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.120 
and then it's up to the players to read
and<00:06:52.300> react<00:06:52.510> as<00:06:52.750> they<00:06:52.810> enter<00:06:53.560> the<00:06:53.590> zone<00:06:53.860> what's

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:54.130 
and react as they enter the zone what's

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.820 
and react as they enter the zone what's
open<00:06:54.310> what<00:06:54.760> you<00:06:54.940> know<00:06:55.060> what's<00:06:55.660> open<00:06:55.840> and<00:06:56.530> all

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:56.830 
open what you know what's open and all

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.460 
open what you know what's open and all
of<00:06:56.949> this<00:06:57.630> works<00:06:58.630> within<00:06:58.870> the<00:06:58.930> same<00:06:59.169> framework

00:06:59.460 --> 00:06:59.470 
of this works within the same framework

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.800 
of this works within the same framework
of<00:07:00.039> the<00:07:00.160> attack<00:07:00.370> triangle<00:07:00.760> so<00:07:01.270> another<00:07:01.449> option

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:01.810 
of the attack triangle so another option

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.700 
of the attack triangle so another option
that<00:07:01.840> I<00:07:02.650> kind<00:07:03.039> of<00:07:03.070> like<00:07:03.250> is<00:07:04.289> using<00:07:05.289> the<00:07:05.380> points

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710 
that I kind of like is using the points

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.590 
that I kind of like is using the points
so<00:07:06.340> f1<00:07:06.520> can<00:07:06.850> come<00:07:07.000> in<00:07:07.180> do<00:07:07.360> a<00:07:07.389> little

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:07.600 
so f1 can come in do a little

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.600 
so f1 can come in do a little
misdirection

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:09.610 
misdirection

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.560 
misdirection
maybe<00:07:10.060> f3<00:07:10.720> has<00:07:10.990> driven<00:07:11.229> down<00:07:12.030> for<00:07:13.030> a<00:07:13.060> possible

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:13.570 
maybe f3 has driven down for a possible

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.189 
maybe f3 has driven down for a possible
cycle<00:07:14.080> down<00:07:14.169> low<00:07:15.270> which<00:07:16.270> is<00:07:16.419> I<00:07:16.539> think<00:07:16.750> that's<00:07:17.020> a

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 
cycle down low which is I think that's a

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:19.969 
cycle down low which is I think that's a
really<00:07:17.380> good<00:07:17.560> option<00:07:17.740> there<00:07:18.360> and<00:07:19.360> then

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:19.979 
really good option there and then

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:22.469 
really good option there and then
hopefully<00:07:20.979> your<00:07:21.370> defensemen<00:07:21.880> aren't<00:07:22.090> dogging

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 
hopefully your defensemen aren't dogging

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:23.640 
hopefully your defensemen aren't dogging
it<00:07:22.570> up<00:07:22.690> the<00:07:22.810> eye<00:07:22.840> so<00:07:23.050> hopefully<00:07:23.380> they're<00:07:23.530> up

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:23.650 
it up the eye so hopefully they're up

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.500 
it up the eye so hopefully they're up
there<00:07:23.830> ready<00:07:24.400> to<00:07:24.610> provide<00:07:24.789> some<00:07:25.090> outlet

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:25.510 
there ready to provide some outlet

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.629 
there ready to provide some outlet
passes<00:07:25.900> on<00:07:25.990> the<00:07:26.080> blue<00:07:26.229> line<00:07:26.380> for<00:07:26.590> you<00:07:26.680> and<00:07:26.889> that

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:27.639 
passes on the blue line for you and that

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:29.610 
passes on the blue line for you and that
can<00:07:27.789> be<00:07:27.910> another<00:07:28.150> potential<00:07:28.599> option<00:07:28.960> it<00:07:29.470> has<00:07:29.590> a

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:29.620 
can be another potential option it has a

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.779 
can be another potential option it has a
pass<00:07:29.860> to<00:07:30.010> the<00:07:30.099> point<00:07:31.320> okay<00:07:32.320> and<00:07:32.560> then<00:07:33.490> you<00:07:33.669> know

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:33.789 
pass to the point okay and then you know

00:07:33.789 --> 00:07:35.460 
pass to the point okay and then you know
from<00:07:33.940> there<00:07:34.030> maybe<00:07:34.360> the<00:07:34.510> point<00:07:34.810> maybe<00:07:35.200> the<00:07:35.320> D

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:35.470 
from there maybe the point maybe the D
