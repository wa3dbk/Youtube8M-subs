technology that's advanced even more
since<00:00:15.120> demigod<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.170> allows<00:00:17.160> us<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.580> go<00:00:17.699> in

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
since demigod and allows us to go in

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.550 
since demigod and allows us to go in
here<00:00:17.850> command<00:00:18.420> units<00:00:18.840> right<00:00:19.109> now<00:00:19.289> we've<00:00:19.529> got

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
here command units right now we've got

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.070 
here command units right now we've got
some<00:00:19.859> tanks<00:00:20.279> some<00:00:20.609> UEF<00:00:20.939> tanks<00:00:21.330> fighting<00:00:21.720> these

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
some tanks some UEF tanks fighting these

some tanks some UEF tanks fighting these
cybron<00:00:22.680> bots<00:00:23.279> on<00:00:23.580> top<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.000> platform<00:00:24.240> and

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
cybron bots on top of this platform and

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.650 
cybron bots on top of this platform and
getting<00:00:25.380> overwhelmed<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.130> destroyed<00:00:27.000> so

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
getting overwhelmed and destroyed so

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.990 
getting overwhelmed and destroyed so
this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> bit<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.320> concern<00:00:28.680> why<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
this is a bit of a concern why the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.550 
this is a bit of a concern why the
gunships<00:00:30.480> came<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:30.990> these<00:00:31.140> cyber<00:00:31.410> and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
gunships came in these cyber and

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.319 
gunships came in these cyber and
gunships<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.130> we're<00:00:32.610> able<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.820> wipe<00:00:32.969> us<00:00:33.210> out

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
gunships and we're able to wipe us out

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.030 
gunships and we're able to wipe us out
so<00:00:33.540> we<00:00:33.570> need<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.870> bring<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.140> some<00:00:34.320> support<00:00:34.739> what

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
so we need to bring in some support what

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.280 
so we need to bring in some support what
better<00:00:35.399> way<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.670> bring<00:00:35.940> support<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.660> then<00:00:37.110> with

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
better way to bring support in then with

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.770 
better way to bring support in then with
the<00:00:37.440> unit<00:00:37.829> cannon<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.790> unit<00:00:39.090> cannon<00:00:39.510> allows

the unit cannon the unit cannon allows
us<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.110> fire<00:00:40.379> units<00:00:40.829> clear<00:00:41.070> across<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.520> map<00:00:41.730> we

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
us to fire units clear across the map we

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.549 
us to fire units clear across the map we
can<00:00:42.239> select<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.660> structure<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.170> can<00:00:43.290> queue<00:00:43.530> up

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
can select the structure we can queue up

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.310 
can select the structure we can queue up
units<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.760> can<00:00:44.940> then<00:00:45.090> launch<00:00:45.660> them<00:00:45.989> all<00:00:46.170> at

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
units we can then launch them all at

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.590 
units we can then launch them all at
once<00:00:46.350> they<00:00:46.710> come<00:00:46.829> out<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.039> these<00:00:47.129> cool

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600

once they come out of these cool
magazine<00:00:48.600> unit<00:00:49.379> magazines<00:00:49.920> fire<00:00:50.820> them<00:00:51.059> out

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
magazine unit magazines fire them out

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.880 
magazine unit magazines fire them out
there<00:00:51.360> here<00:00:51.539> they<00:00:51.660> are<00:00:51.840> canisters<00:00:52.590> break

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
assault bots in the mix allowing us to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.229 
assault bots in the mix allowing us to
take<00:01:00.809> out<00:01:01.020> these<00:01:01.230> gunships<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.129> here's<00:01:03.059> some

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
take out these gunships and here's some

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.640 
take out these gunships and here's some
more<00:01:03.390> coming<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.049> just<00:01:04.110> wicked<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
more coming in it's just wicked and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.440 
more coming in it's just wicked and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
again you know with full strategic zoom

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.210 
again you know with full strategic zoom
and<00:01:06.720> watch<00:01:06.840> those<00:01:07.080> big<00:01:07.290> arcs<00:01:07.619> because<00:01:08.070> our

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
and watch those big arcs because our

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.870 
and watch those big arcs because our
units<00:01:08.520> flight<00:01:08.820> clear<00:01:09.119> across<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.450> map<00:01:10.880> all

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
units flight clear across the map all

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.039 
units flight clear across the map all
right<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.240> see<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.720> we're<00:01:12.840> very

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
right you can see that we're very

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.710 
right you can see that we're very
rapidly<00:01:14.060> mixing<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.180> up<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.420> with<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.570> big

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
rapidly mixing it up here with a big

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.980 
rapidly mixing it up here with a big
battle<00:01:15.900> we've<00:01:16.170> got<00:01:16.320> UEF<00:01:16.860> gunships<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.490> cybron

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
battle we've got UEF gunships and cybron

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.719 
battle we've got UEF gunships and cybron
gunships<00:01:18.990> both<00:01:19.290> mixing<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.950> up<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.700> can

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
gunships both mixing it up and you can

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.359 
gunships both mixing it up and you can
see<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.090> whole<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.740> wonderful<00:01:23.340> to

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
see the whole the this just wonderful to

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.190 
see the whole the this just wonderful to

Supreme Commander real-time simulation

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.980 
Supreme Commander real-time simulation
every<00:01:31.229> shot<00:01:31.590> calculated<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.610> 3d<00:01:33.090> everything

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
every shot calculated in 3d everything

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.700 
every shot calculated in 3d everything
carefully<00:01:34.290> uh<00:01:35.450> it's<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.689> non<00:01:36.990> determinate

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
carefully uh it's it's non determinate

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.499 
carefully uh it's it's non determinate
which<00:01:38.310> means<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.729> don't<00:01:38.909> know<00:01:39.119> four<00:01:39.329> shots

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
which means we don't know four shots

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.609 
which means we don't know four shots
going<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.720> hit<00:01:39.840> or<00:01:39.930> miss<00:01:39.960> until<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
simulation actually gets there just like

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.380 
simulation actually gets there just like

you<00:03:45.060> built<00:03:45.330> a<00:03:45.420> lot<00:03:45.540> of<00:03:45.660> tech<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.930> they<00:03:46.080> weren't

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
you built a lot of tech to they weren't

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.070 
you built a lot of tech to they weren't
useful<00:03:46.769> enough<00:03:47.190> last<00:03:47.790> part<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.269> game<00:03:48.450> so

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
useful enough last part of the game so

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.630 
useful enough last part of the game so
what<00:03:49.320> we've<00:03:49.470> done<00:03:49.500> now<00:03:49.920> with<00:03:50.160> our<00:03:50.280> with<00:03:50.610> our

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
tech tree as we've said if you build a

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.530 
tech tree as we've said if you build a
tank<00:03:52.799> early<00:03:53.280> on<00:03:53.310> you'll<00:03:53.940> be<00:03:54.060> able<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.239> go<00:03:54.360> in

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
tank early on you'll be able to go in

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.810 
tank early on you'll be able to go in
here<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:54.930> do<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:55.320> bunch<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.739> upgrades<00:03:56.220> on<00:03:56.459> that

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
here and do a bunch of upgrades on that

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.120 
here and do a bunch of upgrades on that
same<00:03:57.209> tank<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:57.959> use<00:03:58.110> it<00:03:58.290> in<00:03:58.410> the<00:03:58.560> late<00:03:58.769> stage

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130

game and when you implement an upgrade

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.720 
game and when you implement an upgrade
it<00:04:01.440> goes<00:04:01.680> across<00:04:01.920> all<00:04:02.190> units<00:04:02.580> that<00:04:02.700> are

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
remember how the Rockettes got

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.420 
remember how the Rockettes got
completely<00:04:33.630> mauled<00:04:34.020> by<00:04:34.290> those<00:04:34.500> gunships<00:04:34.950> well

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
completely mauled by those gunships well

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.580 
completely mauled by those gunships well
we<00:04:35.520> can<00:04:35.670> do<00:04:35.790> upgrades<00:04:36.210> we<00:04:36.630> can<00:04:36.810> add<00:04:36.960> some<00:04:37.290> a

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
we can do upgrades we can add some a

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.680 
we can do upgrades we can add some a
longer<00:04:38.160> barrel<00:04:38.460> we<00:04:38.760> get<00:04:38.910> more<00:04:39.090> range<00:04:39.360> we<00:04:39.570> get

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
longer barrel we get more range we get

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.540 
longer barrel we get more range we get
more<00:04:39.870> muzzle<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.680> muzzle<00:04:40.950> velocity<00:04:41.310> gives<00:04:41.490> us

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
more muzzle the muzzle velocity gives us

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.890 
more muzzle the muzzle velocity gives us
more<00:04:41.670> firepower<00:04:41.940> we<00:04:42.480> want<00:04:42.660> even<00:04:42.870> more

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
more firepower we want even more

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.320 
more firepower we want even more
firepower<00:04:43.410> we'd<00:04:43.800> go<00:04:43.920> to<00:04:43.980> triple<00:04:44.430> barrel<00:04:44.640> we

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
firepower we'd go to triple barrel we

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.030 
firepower we'd go to triple barrel we
want<00:04:45.600> to<00:04:45.720> take<00:04:45.900> on<00:04:46.140> some<00:04:46.170> of<00:04:46.440> those<00:04:46.590> nasty

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 
want to take on some of those nasty

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.350 
want to take on some of those nasty
gunships<00:04:47.430> we<00:04:47.640> can<00:04:47.760> go<00:04:47.850> to<00:04:47.940> anti-aircraft

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
gunships we can go to anti-aircraft

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.590 
gunships we can go to anti-aircraft
capability<00:04:48.980> right<00:04:49.980> on<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.700> rock<00:04:50.910> head<00:04:51.150> so

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
capability right on the rock head so

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.380 
capability right on the rock head so
you'll<00:04:52.470> be<00:04:52.980> able<00:04:53.010> to<00:04:53.460> send<00:04:53.880> out<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.060> group<00:04:54.270> of

you'll be able to send out a group of

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.000 
you'll be able to send out a group of
Tanks<00:04:54.750> knowing<00:04:55.140> that<00:04:55.290> they<00:04:55.440> won't<00:04:55.560> get<00:04:55.770> mauled

by by a gunship quite so easily in

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.210 
by by a gunship quite so easily in
bombers<00:05:00.570> and<00:05:00.720> such<00:05:00.960> and<00:05:01.230> here<00:05:01.680> we<00:05:01.710> go<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:02.040> rock

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
bombers and such and here we go the rock

bombers and such and here we go the rock
hits<00:05:02.460> are<00:05:02.550> now<00:05:02.640> going<00:05:02.880> to<00:05:02.970> finish<00:05:03.420> up<00:05:03.720> and

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
hits are now going to finish up and

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.770 
hits are now going to finish up and
taking<00:05:04.680> out<00:05:04.830> these<00:05:05.010> illuminant<00:05:06.000> gunships<00:05:06.510> and

taking out these illuminant gunships and
you<00:05:07.170> can<00:05:07.290> see<00:05:07.440> that<00:05:07.590> here<00:05:07.920> not<00:05:08.460> getting

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
you can see that here not getting

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.850 
you can see that here not getting
whupped<00:05:09.510> quite<00:05:09.900> so<00:05:10.110> badly<00:05:10.320> as<00:05:10.620> they<00:05:10.800> were

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
whupped quite so badly as they were

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.610 
whupped quite so badly as they were
before<00:05:11.630> again<00:05:12.630> all<00:05:12.750> of<00:05:12.780> this<00:05:13.020> is<00:05:13.140> happening<00:05:13.320> in

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
before again all of this is happening in

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.730 
before again all of this is happening in
3d<00:05:13.920> space<00:05:14.040> with<00:05:14.430> with<00:05:15.150> a<00:05:15.200> true<00:05:16.200> simulation<00:05:17.630> and

3d space with with a true simulation and
this<00:05:19.740> game<00:05:20.010> is<00:05:20.420> roughly<00:05:21.420> nine<00:05:21.570> months<00:05:21.810> into

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
this game is roughly nine months into

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.310 
this game is roughly nine months into
development<00:05:22.440> so<00:05:22.860> we've<00:05:23.220> got<00:05:24.020> you<00:05:25.020> know<00:05:25.140> we're

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
development so we've got you know we're

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.500 
development so we've got you know we're
probably<00:05:25.790> you<00:05:26.790> know<00:05:26.850> we're<00:05:26.970> coming<00:05:27.060> out<00:05:27.240> early

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
probably you know we're coming out early
