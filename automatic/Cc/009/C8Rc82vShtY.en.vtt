the camera for centering which is the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.610 
the camera for centering which is the
most<00:00:36.660> difficult<00:00:37.850> tend<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.940> achieve<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:40.170> got

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
most difficult tend to achieve so I got

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.350

a<00:00:40.649> really<00:00:40.980> good<00:00:41.160> deal<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.090> feel

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
a really good deal on this and I feel

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.819 
a really good deal on this and I feel
like<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.629> could<00:00:42.809> make<00:00:42.989> money<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.530> wanted<00:00:43.770> to

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.350 
like I could make money if I wanted to
sell<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.190> but<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.430> is<00:00:44.610> another<00:00:44.850> car<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.120> I'm

just<00:00:45.480> going<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.660> keep<00:00:45.780> my<00:00:45.989> collection<00:00:46.170> forever

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
just going to keep my collection forever

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.430 
just going to keep my collection forever
you<00:00:48.149> know<00:00:48.239> graded<00:00:48.629> perfect<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.200> know<00:00:49.260> there's

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
you know graded perfect you know there's

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.819 
you know graded perfect you know there's
I<00:00:49.530> think<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.860> 100<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.280> think<00:00:50.430> there<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.670> 129<00:00:51.829> in

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
I think is 100 I think there is 129 in

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.439 
I think is 100 I think there is 129 in
the<00:00:52.949> entire<00:00:53.250> world<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.699> are<00:00:53.789> graded<00:00:53.969> back<00:00:54.300> at

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the entire world that are graded back at

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.610 
the entire world that are graded back at
9.5<00:00:55.140> or<00:00:55.469> above<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.899> think<00:00:57.899> there's<00:00:58.050> two<00:00:58.289> tens

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
9.5 or above I think there's two tens

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.760 
9.5 or above I think there's two tens
this<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.219> has<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> ten<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:01.500> I'm<00:01:01.620> pretty

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
this one has a ten on it so I'm pretty

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.979 
this one has a ten on it so I'm pretty
happy<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.129> have<00:01:02.370> been<00:01:03.239> able<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.510> afford<00:01:03.600> this

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
happy to have been able to afford this

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.329 
happy to have been able to afford this
and<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.409> able<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.619> buy<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.799> from<00:01:04.949> my<00:01:05.070> collection

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
and be able to buy it from my collection

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.109 
and be able to buy it from my collection
but<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.740> think<00:01:07.740> there's<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.700> hundred<00:01:08.880> and

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
but I think there's like a hundred and

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.149 
but I think there's like a hundred and
something<00:01:09.420> PSA<00:01:10.290> tens<00:01:10.650> which<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
something PSA tens which is the

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.760 
something PSA tens which is the
equivalent<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.729> 9.5<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.450> think<00:01:12.780> with<00:01:12.930> 210<00:01:13.409> so

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
equivalent of a 9.5 I think with 210 so

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.800 
equivalent of a 9.5 I think with 210 so
this<00:01:13.920> one's<00:01:14.100> almost<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.760> PSA<00:01:15.240> ten<00:01:15.509> where<00:01:15.689> it's

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
this one's almost a PSA ten where it's

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.450 
this one's almost a PSA ten where it's
got<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.170> know<00:01:16.229> it's<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.560> ten<00:01:16.830> centering<00:01:17.340> and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
got you know it's a ten centering and

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.280 
got you know it's a ten centering and
then<00:01:17.939> all<00:01:18.180> nine<00:01:18.420> point<00:01:18.689> five<00:01:18.869> s<00:01:19.049> all<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.229> way

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
then all nine point five s all the way

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.660 
then all nine point five s all the way
around<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.740> mean<00:01:19.860> I've<00:01:20.009> looked<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.430> thing

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
around but I mean I've looked this thing

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.969 
around but I mean I've looked this thing
under<00:01:21.150> my<00:01:21.200> girlfriend's<00:01:22.200> loops<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.860> use

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
under my girlfriend's loops that you use

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.910 
under my girlfriend's loops that you use
for<00:01:23.420> looking<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.540> people's<00:01:24.810> mouths<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.860> a

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
for looking in people's mouths to be a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.640 
for looking in people's mouths to be a
dentist<00:01:26.250> which<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.729> dental<00:01:26.939> school<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.650> I

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
dentist which is in dental school and I

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.770 
dentist which is in dental school and I
can't<00:01:29.159> find<00:01:29.310> any<00:01:29.579> flaws<00:01:29.909> whatsoever<00:01:30.299> with

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
can't find any flaws whatsoever with

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.870 
can't find any flaws whatsoever with
this<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:30.960> think<00:01:31.200> if<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.380> sent<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.829> very<00:01:32.700> easily

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
this I think if I sent it in very easily

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.200 
this I think if I sent it in very easily
great<00:01:33.180> at<00:01:33.299> PSA<00:01:33.689> ten<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.650> if<00:01:34.860> not<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.759> bumped<00:01:36.119> up

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
great at PSA ten and if not we bumped up

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.240 
great at PSA ten and if not we bumped up
to<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.479> least<00:01:36.659> one<00:01:37.259> or<00:01:37.409> two<00:01:37.439> more<00:01:37.740> cans<00:01:38.009> on
