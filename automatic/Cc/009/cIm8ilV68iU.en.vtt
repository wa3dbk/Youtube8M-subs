I think that should be good right there
and<00:07:02.120> as<00:07:02.419> you<00:07:02.570> see<00:07:02.780> over<00:07:03.230> here<00:07:03.260> we've<00:07:03.440> got<00:07:03.470> a

and as you see over here we've got a
little<00:07:03.830> gap<00:07:04.010> in<00:07:04.220> between<00:07:04.669> the<00:07:05.090> spindle<00:07:05.710> and

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710 
little gap in between the spindle and

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.330 
little gap in between the spindle and
the<00:07:06.800> ball<00:07:06.980> joint<00:07:07.960> called<00:07:08.960> up<00:07:09.169> for<00:07:09.919> wheel<00:07:10.100> parts

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340 
the ball joint called up for wheel parts

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.180 
the ball joint called up for wheel parts
see<00:07:10.700> if<00:07:10.760> that<00:07:11.030> was<00:07:11.180> normal<00:07:11.600> and<00:07:11.960> they<00:07:12.860> gave<00:07:13.040> me

see if that was normal and they gave me
okay<00:07:13.960> um<00:07:14.960> so<00:07:15.320> that<00:07:15.650> should<00:07:15.830> be<00:07:15.919> good

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.310 
okay um so that should be good
