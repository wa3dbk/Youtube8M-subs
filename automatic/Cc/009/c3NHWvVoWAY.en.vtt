hello welcome to today's lick which is

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.380 
hello welcome to today's lick which is
basically<00:00:17.480> a<00:00:17.570> string<00:00:17.930> sleeping<00:00:18.290> licked<00:00:18.619> with

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
basically a string sleeping licked with

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.970 
basically a string sleeping licked with
some<00:00:20.390> tapping<00:00:20.810> at<00:00:20.930> the<00:00:20.960> end<00:00:21.640> i'm<00:00:22.640> using<00:00:23.599> this

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
some tapping at the end i'm using this

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.729 
some tapping at the end i'm using this
shape<00:00:26.050> to<00:00:27.050> be<00:00:27.200> three<00:00:27.439> notes<00:00:27.619> per<00:00:27.860> string

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
shape to be three notes per string

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.459 
shape to be three notes per string
pentatonic<00:00:30.739> i'd<00:00:31.070> say<00:00:31.689> i'm<00:00:32.689> starting<00:00:33.079> on<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.440> a

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
pentatonic i'd say i'm starting on the a

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.000 
pentatonic i'd say i'm starting on the a
string<00:00:33.590> 7<00:00:34.430> 10<00:00:34.850> 12<00:00:35.300> and<00:00:35.600> then<00:00:35.780> i<00:00:35.960> skip<00:00:36.649> the<00:00:36.829> t<00:00:36.980> and

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
string 7 10 12 and then i skip the t and

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.340 
string 7 10 12 and then i skip the t and
jump<00:00:37.460> right<00:00:37.640> to<00:00:37.700> the<00:00:37.850> AL<00:00:38.390> to<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.690> to<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:39.079> g

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
jump right to the AL to the to the g

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.130 
jump right to the AL to the to the g
string<00:00:39.670> 7<00:00:40.670> 9<00:00:40.940> 12<00:00:42.850> I'm<00:00:43.850> tuned<00:00:44.239> down<00:00:44.749> a<00:00:44.809> half<00:00:45.079> step

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
string 7 9 12 I'm tuned down a half step

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.750 
string 7 9 12 I'm tuned down a half step
by<00:00:45.440> the<00:00:45.499> way<00:00:45.679> again<00:00:46.390> and<00:00:47.949> I'd<00:00:48.949> skip<00:00:49.489> the<00:00:49.519> B

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
by the way again and I'd skip the B

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.099 
by the way again and I'd skip the B
string<00:00:49.999> and<00:00:50.239> jump<00:00:50.960> to<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:51.350> high<00:00:51.679> school<00:00:52.179> 7<00:00:53.179> 10

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
string and jump to the high school 7 10

00:00:54.109 --> 00:01:05.300 
string and jump to the high school 7 10
12<00:00:54.679> so<00:00:55.609> that<00:00:55.819> would<00:00:56.059> be

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.310 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:12.270 

the<00:01:06.310> pattern<00:01:06.640> itself<00:01:07.000> is<00:01:07.810> nice<00:01:10.830> exercise<00:01:11.830> I

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
the pattern itself is nice exercise I

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.450 
the pattern itself is nice exercise I
guess<00:01:12.520> are<00:01:12.880> a<00:01:13.030> nice<00:01:13.270> lick<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:15.189> way<00:01:15.340> I'm

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
guess are a nice lick the way I'm

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.130 
guess are a nice lick the way I'm
picking<00:01:15.759> this<00:01:15.909> is<00:01:16.149> basically<00:01:16.869> it's<00:01:17.080> just

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
picking this is basically it's just

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.770 
picking this is basically it's just
hammer-ons<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:17.979> pull-offs<00:01:18.539> just<00:01:19.539> every<00:01:19.750> time

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
hammer-ons and pull-offs just every time

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.719 
hammer-ons and pull-offs just every time
I<00:01:21.149> go<00:01:22.149> to<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.659> next<00:01:22.840> string<00:01:23.200> I<00:01:23.470> use<00:01:24.399> a<00:01:24.430> Down

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
I go to the next string I use a Down

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.670 
I go to the next string I use a Down
stroke<00:01:24.909> so<00:01:25.270> it's<00:01:25.420> down<00:01:25.689> Hammer<00:01:26.020> hammer<00:01:26.140> down

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
stroke so it's down Hammer hammer down

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.330 
stroke so it's down Hammer hammer down
Hammer<00:01:27.039> hammer<00:01:27.310> down<00:01:28.119> Hammer<00:01:28.750> hammer<00:01:29.340> and
