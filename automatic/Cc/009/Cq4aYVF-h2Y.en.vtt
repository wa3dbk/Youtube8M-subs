 and want to do a little multi part 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.609

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:44.090
 gamertag in the comments or else 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:46.479

 so I personally have not met any 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.670
 big problems with young mc steam 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.580
 it works very well at the wrong time the 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.379
 connection I have trackmania nation 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.200
 you will see it works very well 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:09.200
 except when I have the capture software 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.360
 image the savak taxes end of 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:19.709
 the screen recording it must 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:21.600
 little but also not in principle all 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.700
 the applications that are listed in front of 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.700
 operate in principle 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.130
 a little more 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:05:00.020
 he remembered password yes to the 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:05:01.400
 weird like product so I'm not going 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.020
 show you a multiplayer game 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:08.169
 because I am what not to 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.169
 find or numidy in public 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.560
 so here's my recollection 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:25.090
 should it be normal to say that you know 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:25.090

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.020
