00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
and easy way and it it it's good enough

there<00:01:19.579> is<00:01:19.700> a<00:01:19.729> little<00:01:19.939> gap<00:01:20.270> here<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.170> we've

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
there is a little gap here so we've

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.859 
there is a little gap here so we've
developed<00:01:21.710> a<00:01:22.070> little<00:01:22.220> way<00:01:22.490> just<00:01:22.820> to<00:01:23.000> push<00:01:23.659> that

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
developed a little way just to push that

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.679 
developed a little way just to push that
up<00:01:23.930> which<00:01:24.320> will<00:01:24.500> show<00:01:24.710> you<00:01:24.770> now<00:01:25.040> okay<00:01:25.850> so

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
up which will show you now okay so

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.330 
up which will show you now okay so
that's<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:27.079> quick<00:01:27.290> way<00:01:27.470> of<00:01:27.500> changing<00:01:28.070> again

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
that's the quick way of changing again

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.969 
that's the quick way of changing again
on<00:01:29.049> okay<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.200> other<00:01:30.229> way<00:01:30.439> takes<00:01:30.710> about<00:01:30.860> a

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
on okay the other way takes about a

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.740 
on okay the other way takes about a
minute<00:01:31.189> longer<00:01:31.549> so<00:01:31.939> it's<00:01:32.119> probably<00:01:32.540> worth

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
minute longer so it's probably worth

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.710 
minute longer so it's probably worth
doing<00:01:33.549> right<00:01:34.549> so<00:01:34.909> this<00:01:35.090> section<00:01:35.600> of<00:01:35.689> the

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
doing right so this section of the

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.319 
doing right so this section of the
center<00:01:36.140> console<00:01:36.649> here<00:01:36.950> is<00:01:37.220> just<00:01:37.820> clipped<00:01:38.119> in

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
center console here is just clipped in

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.130 
center console here is just clipped in
and<00:01:38.509> it<00:01:38.689> literally<00:01:39.200> just<00:01:39.640> pulls<00:01:40.640> up<00:01:40.939> okay<00:01:41.570> so

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140
