it<00:00:24.269> here<00:00:24.600> in<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.750> minute<00:00:24.779> but<00:00:25.650> what<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.279> is

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
it here in a minute but what it is is

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.609 
it here in a minute but what it is is
it's<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.880> 12<00:00:27.869> string<00:00:28.170> guitar<00:00:29.060> that's<00:00:30.060> just<00:00:30.689> up

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
it's a 12 string guitar that's just up

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.130 
it's a 12 string guitar that's just up
an<00:00:31.890> octave<00:00:32.059> so<00:00:33.059> it's<00:00:33.329> like<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> 12<00:00:33.899> string

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
an octave so it's like a 12 string

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.240 
an octave so it's like a 12 string
guitar<00:00:35.030> that's<00:00:36.500> an<00:00:37.500> octave<00:00:38.010> up<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:39.710> I<00:00:40.710> was

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
guitar that's an octave up and I was

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.869 
guitar that's an octave up and I was
just<00:00:41.719> going<00:00:42.719> over<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.460> procedure<00:00:44.460> for

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
just going over the procedure for

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.970 
just going over the procedure for
stringing<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.450> here's<00:00:45.750> here's<00:00:46.620> kind<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.890> a

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
stringing this here's here's kind of a

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.750 
stringing this here's here's kind of a
weird<00:00:47.250> thing<00:00:48.079> now<00:00:49.079> those<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.100> us<00:00:50.399> who<00:00:50.579> have<00:00:50.730> had

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
weird thing now those of us who have had

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.200 
weird thing now those of us who have had
a<00:00:50.940> lot<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.149> 12-string<00:00:51.750> guitars<00:00:52.940> you<00:00:53.940> know<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
a lot of 12-string guitars you know the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.349 
a lot of 12-string guitars you know the
the<00:00:55.199> thinner<00:00:55.440> string<00:00:56.539> goes<00:00:58.940> on<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.149> top

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
the thinner string goes on the top

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.350 
the thinner string goes on the top
typically<00:01:03.830> if<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.979> look<00:01:05.010> here<00:01:05.700> at<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.850> second

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
typically if you look here at the second

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.910 
typically if you look here at the second
string<00:01:06.570> you'll<00:01:06.780> see<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.290> slot<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
string you'll see that the slot on the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:16.820 
string you'll see that the slot on the
bottom<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:09.470> a<00:01:10.470> thinner<00:01:11.250> slot<00:01:15.409> but<00:01:16.409> then<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
bottom is a thinner slot but then on the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.530 
bottom is a thinner slot but then on the
next<00:01:16.979> one<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.400> one<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.759> top<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> thinner

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
next one the one on the top is a thinner

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.219 
next one the one on the top is a thinner
slot<00:01:19.040> on<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.100> D<00:01:20.430> string<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.840> I'm<00:01:21.900> just<00:01:22.049> going

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
slot on the D string so I'm just going

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.010 
slot on the D string so I'm just going
to<00:01:22.259> string<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.710> typical<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.970> regular<00:01:24.720> 12

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
to string this typical of a regular 12

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.200 
to string this typical of a regular 12
string<00:01:25.350> point<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:27.270> thin<00:01:27.720> string<00:01:29.030> being<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
string point the thin string being the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.550 
string point the thin string being the
one<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.869> top

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.830 

it's<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.710> original<00:01:35.860> case<00:01:36.310> by<00:01:36.610> the<00:01:36.670> way<00:01:39.840> so

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
it's the original case by the way so

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.620 
it's the original case by the way so
