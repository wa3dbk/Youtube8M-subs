00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.910
 hello everyone today we are going to teach you 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.720
 how to open the ports to have 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.590
 image 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.539
 If you have an image, I can not 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.230
 enter directly from the browser 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.280
 to the router and you have to do it through 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.210
 the page of movistar imagenio 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.210
 we'll see 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.059
 let's google movistar 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.530
 We stretch the first page 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.830
 let's go on top in the 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.830
 seeker and we put alejandra 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.300
 search for 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.220
 the first page that a salt 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.720
 and we pass to it the one that is configured to 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.549
 reuter configurator 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.640
 We put our number 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.640
 phone 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.399
 we give you to accept 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.979
 we wait a while 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:49.910
 It may take a little time 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.910
 have patience 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.240
 perfect 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.390
 well then we have three sections 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.289
 the first is the technical file where 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.910
 we get the router model manufacturer 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.340
 of firmware what it puts here 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.110
 information 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:22.010
 then the configuration section 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.920
 where we have 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.200
 do not upload the wifi network ports 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.080
 password profiles 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:34.670
 and where we have the administrator here 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:38.280
 ports good then I have all 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:43.270
 these open that are 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:46.990
 those of steam to play online games 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:51.780
 and then I will expose the list of ports to 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:56.310
 open in the in the tutorial 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.760
 and let's move on to see how to open a 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.980
 Market Stall 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.220
 first we give you here set up a 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.910
 new port 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:11.709
 so then depending on if we want 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:17.770
 open a tcp or a 9 but we select 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:20.210
 any masters our internal address 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:26.140
 good if you do not know 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:26.140
 the internal ip address of start 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.290
 with the cmd 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.590
 this is very important if you have a 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.590
 view 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.270
 windows vista windows 7 you have to put 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.240
 execute as an administrator 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.690
 because if he does not let us do some 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.690
 things 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.750
 and we put the ip command with 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.569
 we give to enter 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.640
 and many things will come out 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:15.190
 but what interests us is good in my 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.250
 case I have the computer connected with 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.560
 ethernet 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.890
 so we have to come here 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.190
 ethernet adapter area connection 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:29.640
 local 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:32.640
 and what interests us is this address 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.640
 ipv4 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:36.020
 and we put it here 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:55.670
 19 2.168 point 1.33 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.430
 that happens to be the same as 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.430
 the good example we close 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.450
 so 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:12.870
 you have two options open a range of 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:15.430
 doors where you put the first port 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:19.969
 what do you want to open 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:22.729
 until the one you want to open 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:26.200
 or open individual ports that is 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:30.490
 arranging the port one by one 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:34.080
 so for example let's acquire a 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.080
 single port 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:42.249
 and I do not know I invented it 

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.249
 in 15 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.830
 67 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:53.509
 and then we're going to see that this portal 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:56.479
 have some errors for example when 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:59.800
 we try to select the box 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:02.749
 down to put it then it does not let us 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.470
 select from above good what 

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:11.030
 we can do 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:11.030
 is and select the port 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:19.990
 hit him then hold down the 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:25.240
 mouse click the mouse down and put 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:27.090
 control and then we have the 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:32.030
 two doors 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.030
 and finally we give you to create 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:40.700
 perfect good as you see we have the 

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:44.810
 last port that we have put 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:47.770
 what is an internal ip address and the 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:51.080
 internal external port that we have put 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:54.650
 then yes 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.220
 you do not want to make mistakes, we mark the 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.130
 port 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.090
 and eliminate the posts marked you 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:05.610
 I assure you to accept 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.610
 and perfect we no longer have it 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:11.360
 so 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.360
 of this portal 

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:21.020
 for a little more remarkable 

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:25.760
 if you want to configure sea filters 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:30.520
 change web web password 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.520
 here we have the list of max 

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.729
 for 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:37.630
 so put if we want to put a 

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:40.969
 max filter 

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:44.529
 and nothing more 

00:07:40.969 --> 00:07:44.529
 at the basic level 

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:50.900
 so this is all when 

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:54.139
 we ended up closing 

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:59.050
 and nothing else I hope that it has served you 

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:59.050
 of help and until next time
