00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.940
 This is our question from our Facebook follower Enes Anlayışlı 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.060
 - A lot of people supported him. 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.400
 &lt;What are the subtleties of the stomach and stomach melt? &gt; 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.140
 - Let us tell you what to do step by step immediately 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.800
 - Let's break it into two. 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.140
 - Nutrition 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.340
 most important rule 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.120
 you will certainly know how many calories you have consumed per day and how many calories you have spent 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.600
 Go to our site, use the ruler in the profile analysis section under the start menu 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.480
 Calculate your daily calorie need 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.160
 and every day 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.420
 This way you should properly and at a rate you need to lose weight and surely 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.660
 so what we eat what we eat 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.600
 most important rule 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.040
 remove sugary, starchy, bakery products from your life 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.940
 bagels, bread, pies, pastry and even fruits 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.000
 limit the fruits at least 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.520
 limit one or a maximum of two medium fruits per day 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.360
 So what are you going to eat plenty of vegetables and protein foods 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.760
 what are these meat lean red meat chicken fish lentil type legumes 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.200
 milk and dairy products are better to be lean 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.160
 consume plenty of them 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:26.240
 other than that, your body should increase your nutrition against food. 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.500
 3 meals a day, 3 meals a day 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.080
 and try to keep their clocks close together up to 3 down 5 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.240
 Try to eat yimi every day, ie at around the same time. 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.000
 this will accelerate your metabolism and minimize the body's desire to retain fat. 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.800
 Also try to eat your meals at home as much as possible. 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.480
 because it is quite difficult to know what is in the foods you eat outside 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:58.520
 Do not risk your work and if possible, take your meals from home to school or work yourself and make sure that what you eat is healthy and low-calorie 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.340
 first rule of activity 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.160
 start walking, walk half an hour per day 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.780
 increase your walking time if you are already walking. 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.600
 Rule 2 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.080
 start training regularly 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.920
 This training is a must and must do both cardio exercises 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.240
 should include weight exercises 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.000
 cardio exercises, especially as you know, accelerates our metabolism and is very effective in fat burning 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.760
 So why do we have to do weight training, why do we need to do weight training? 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.240
 see now if you don't work out weight training and just try to burn fat with cardio 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.440
 but you lose muscle mass in your body as well as fat 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.880
 and this is the last thing we want to know, because building muscle mass is a very difficult and time consuming business 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.200
 plus, it also accelerates the metabolism in weight studies and triggers fat burning further. 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:00.840
 Do cardio exercises. Do your weight work and if you want to start to apply our level 1 programs on our website 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.480
 and make it a habit.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.400

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.360
 Put yourself a note on your computer screen 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.480
 Get off your desk every 20 minutes for a glass of water and walk 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.040

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.640
