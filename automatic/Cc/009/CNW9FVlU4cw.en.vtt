00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.460
 put your finger in front of the lens 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.750
 small spontaneous tutorial what can you do 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:26.779
 make when on the windshield 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.390
 it is not so easy to see it 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:35.960
 but you are happening to me today 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:38.900
 will see there is already broken here 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.760
 he is the windshield broken and he 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.390
 I show you how to make that jump 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.690
 there is because of me could go on 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:53.270
 moment there is how to jump this 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:57.290
 Now that's what he's doing 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:02.260
 runs and simply by the outside 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:07.430
 press and then neat against it 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.820
 should actually pulled out 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.820
 become 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.860
 always well under the jump to the emergency and 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.060
 lead the way to it 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.350
 to do so at the jump 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.750
 convince you to do what you do 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:33.450
 namely wanted to continue, I'll show down 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.450
 the result is okay 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.750
 Part 2 of I have a jump in the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.750
 disc 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.770
 you can keep so you times 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.770
 that would be a dream 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.060
 it does not make much difference that 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.080
 all this stuff does not have that 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.080
 pass on windshield 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.330
 pow 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:46.290
 this is almost what you should show 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:49.410
 otherwise the thing was almost jesus once 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:58.370
 to the over- and of course too 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:58.370
 so spontaneously filmed
