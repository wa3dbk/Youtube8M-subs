00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
and for heater I have a I think it's a

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.990 
and for heater I have a I think it's a
hundred<00:01:35.190> watt<00:01:37.190> hang<00:01:38.190> on<00:01:38.370> the<00:01:38.490> back<00:01:38.670> here

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
hundred watt hang on the back here

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.980

piggyback heater it it keeps the tank at
a<00:01:43.020> constant<00:01:43.470> temp<00:01:43.800> of<00:01:45.470> 75<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.500> think<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.220> says

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
a constant temp of 75 I think it says
