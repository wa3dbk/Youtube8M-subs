character<00:01:54.719> on<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.869> screen<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.439> going<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.770> be

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
character on the screen is going to be

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.859 
character on the screen is going to be
following<00:01:56.189> my<00:01:56.369> movements<00:01:56.850> pretty<00:01:57.659> much

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
following my movements pretty much

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.270 
following my movements pretty much
exactly<00:01:58.200> as<00:01:58.999> I<00:01:59.999> swing<00:02:00.420> my<00:02:00.450> controller<00:02:01.280> Walter

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
exactly as I swing my controller Walter

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.639 
exactly as I swing my controller Walter
there<00:02:02.429> swings<00:02:02.880> his<00:02:03.060> racket<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.630> hits<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.530> out

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
there swings his racket and hits it out

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.649 
there swings his racket and hits it out
unfortunately<00:02:05.159> it's<00:02:06.119> really<00:02:06.210> cool<00:02:06.509> because

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
unfortunately it's really cool because

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.139 
unfortunately it's really cool because
it<00:02:07.109> gives<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.409> visceral<00:02:07.979> feeling<00:02:08.670> of

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
it gives you a visceral feeling of

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.180 
it gives you a visceral feeling of
playing<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.140> game<00:02:10.349> you're<00:02:10.890> much<00:02:11.039> more

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
playing the game you're much more

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.770 
playing the game you're much more
connected<00:02:11.580> with<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.000> experience<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.569> if<00:02:12.690> you

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
connected with the experience and if you

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.680 
connected with the experience and if you
were<00:02:12.900> just<00:02:13.170> kind<00:02:13.349> of

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
were just kind of

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.630 
were just kind of
mashing<00:02:14.080> buttons<00:02:14.320> as<00:02:14.860> we're<00:02:15.160> used<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.430> on

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
mashing buttons as we're used to on

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.850 
mashing buttons as we're used to on
older<00:02:16.060> controllers<00:02:16.600> now<00:02:17.140> you'll<00:02:17.290> also<00:02:17.470> notice

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
older controllers now you'll also notice

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.590 
older controllers now you'll also notice
here<00:02:18.160> these<00:02:18.310> graphics<00:02:18.820> are<00:02:19.120> pretty

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
here these graphics are pretty

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.560 
here these graphics are pretty
simplistic<00:02:19.990> and<00:02:20.920> kind<00:02:21.520> of<00:02:21.550> cartoony<00:02:22.210> compared

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
simplistic and kind of cartoony compared

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.420 
simplistic and kind of cartoony compared
to<00:02:22.660> what<00:02:22.780> we've<00:02:22.900> come<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.200> expect<00:02:23.440> and<00:02:23.950> it's

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
to what we've come to expect and it's

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.080 
to what we've come to expect and it's
definitely<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:26.350> step<00:02:26.920> below<00:02:27.160> what<00:02:27.640> you'd<00:02:27.790> see

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
definitely a step below what you'd see

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.440 
definitely a step below what you'd see
on<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.660> PlayStation<00:02:29.200> 3<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.980> Xbox<00:02:30.520> 360

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.780 
on the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360
the<00:02:32.290> thing<00:02:32.530> Nintendo<00:02:32.890> is<00:02:32.950> delivering<00:02:33.370> here<00:02:33.610> is

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
the thing Nintendo is delivering here is

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.000 
the thing Nintendo is delivering here is
fun<00:02:34.300> however<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:35.050> this<00:02:35.530> does<00:02:35.710> not<00:02:35.740> represent

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
fun however and this does not represent

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.030 
fun however and this does not represent
the<00:02:36.370> peak<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.240> Wiis<00:02:37.800> functionality<00:02:38.800> there

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
the peak of the Wiis functionality there

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.680 
the peak of the Wiis functionality there
are<00:02:39.250> games<00:02:39.580> with<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.790> lot<00:02:40.000> better<00:02:40.180> graphics

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
are games with a lot better graphics

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.470 
are games with a lot better graphics
such<00:02:41.290> as<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:42.160> new<00:02:42.340> Legend<00:02:42.670> of<00:02:42.730> Zelda<00:02:43.090> game<00:02:43.240> for

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
such as the new Legend of Zelda game for

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.420 
such as the new Legend of Zelda game for
instance<00:02:43.570> it's<00:02:44.500> still<00:02:44.740> not<00:02:44.890> quite<00:02:45.100> up<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.340> the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
instance it's still not quite up to the

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.720 
instance it's still not quite up to the
level<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:45.850> a<00:02:45.940> 360<00:02:46.630> or<00:02:46.810> ps3<00:02:47.110> it's<00:02:47.710> not<00:02:47.890> HD<00:02:48.400> but

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
level of a 360 or ps3 it's not HD but

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.130 
level of a 360 or ps3 it's not HD but
definitely<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.180> step<00:02:49.390> above<00:02:49.510> what<00:02:49.960> we<00:02:50.050> were

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
definitely a step above what we were

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.290 
definitely a step above what we were
looking<00:02:50.410> at<00:02:50.530> this<00:02:51.400> is<00:02:51.520> also<00:02:51.820> one<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.120> games

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
looking at this is also one of the games

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.360 
looking at this is also one of the games
that<00:02:52.390> uses<00:02:52.750> both<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.920> wireless<00:02:54.220> controller

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
that uses both the wireless controller

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.400 
that uses both the wireless controller
and<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.880> nunchuck<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:56.080> just<00:02:56.200> gives<00:02:56.320> you

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
and the nunchuck and it just gives you

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.140 
and the nunchuck and it just gives you
more<00:02:56.710> control<00:02:56.950> options<00:02:57.790> than<00:02:57.940> you<00:02:58.030> know

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
more control options than you know

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.030 
more control options than you know
otherwise<00:02:58.300> have<00:02:58.810> both<00:02:59.530> of<00:02:59.650> these<00:02:59.710> are<00:02:59.920> motion

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
otherwise have both of these are motion

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.220 
otherwise have both of these are motion
sensitive<00:03:00.670> they<00:03:00.910> have<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.060> thumb<00:03:01.330> stick<00:03:01.630> extra

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
sensitive they have a thumb stick extra

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.380 
sensitive they have a thumb stick extra
buttons<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:02.980> it<00:03:03.310> just<00:03:03.460> gives<00:03:03.610> you<00:03:03.700> more<00:03:04.330> ways

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
instance later in the game we can even

instance later in the game we can even
use<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:10.420> controller<00:03:10.870> for<00:03:11.320> casting<00:03:12.160> our
