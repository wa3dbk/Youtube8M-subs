00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.170 
that goes right down low so you can get
your<00:01:31.860> hand<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.250> there<00:01:32.310> that's<00:01:32.640> really<00:01:32.970> good

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
and obviously this big flat over there

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.100 
and obviously this big flat over there
to<00:02:08.550> keep<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.850> all<00:02:08.970> nice<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.209> protected<00:02:09.959> so

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
to keep it all nice and protected so

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.470 
to keep it all nice and protected so
higher<00:02:10.709> protection<00:02:11.220> rod<00:02:11.400> holes<00:02:11.850> let's<00:02:12.300> have<00:02:12.450> a

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
higher protection rod holes let's have a

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.540 
higher protection rod holes let's have a
look<00:02:12.630> at<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.780> rest<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.110> range<00:02:13.430> next<00:02:14.430> up

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
look at the rest of the range next up

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.160 
look at the rest of the range next up
its<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.760> bait<00:02:15.000> storage<00:02:15.450> systems<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.080> to

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
its the bait storage systems and to

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.509 
its the bait storage systems and to
start<00:02:16.380> with<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.590> simplest<00:02:16.890> one<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.400> one

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
start with the simplest one and the one

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.580 
start with the simplest one and the one
I<00:02:17.550> use<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:17.880> most<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.569> air<00:02:18.690> dry<00:02:18.930> bag<00:02:19.230> made<00:02:19.560> a

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
I use the most the air dry bag made a

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.860 
I use the most the air dry bag made a
really<00:02:19.980> robust<00:02:20.370> material<00:02:21.000> nice<00:02:21.269> handles<00:02:21.780> on

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
really robust material nice handles on

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.180 
really robust material nice handles on
it<00:02:21.900> as<00:02:22.019> well<00:02:22.200> so<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.440> can<00:02:22.590> hang<00:02:22.769> it<00:02:22.800> up<00:02:22.980> in<00:02:23.070> a

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
it as well so you can hang it up in a

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.130 
it as well so you can hang it up in a
tree<00:02:23.459> that'll<00:02:24.060> take<00:02:24.209> ten<00:02:24.480> Keir<00:02:24.720> boilies

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
tree that'll take ten Keir boilies

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.350 
tree that'll take ten Keir boilies
believe<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.560> or<00:02:25.680> not<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.700> next<00:02:26.940> one<00:02:27.090> down

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
believe it or not and the next one down

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.840 
believe it or not and the next one down
is<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.930> bucket<00:02:28.320> bag<00:02:28.560> got<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.040> stiff<00:02:29.370> room<00:02:29.670> on

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
is the bucket bag got a stiff room on

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.310 
is the bucket bag got a stiff room on
there<00:02:30.060> I've<00:02:30.150> just<00:02:30.299> got<00:02:30.450> some<00:02:30.600> boil<00:02:30.840> ease<00:02:31.049> in<00:02:31.200> it
