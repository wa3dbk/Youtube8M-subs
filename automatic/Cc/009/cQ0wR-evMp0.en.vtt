00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.379
 video of bgs brazil game show the fair 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.670
 of games that rolled here in São Paulo in 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.460
 last week 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.170
 but first I want to explain why I 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.210
 I could not test many games I did not say 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.699
 For you, I got there in the morning. 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.250
 in three he lost the time in three or 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.630
 four hours because I did not buy the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.940
 ticket to the press and bought only 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.950
 for one day and got very 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.450
 very full on Saturday unfortunately no 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.280
 I was able to check every show, check the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.530
 games that I also wanted but not 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.450
 next year being in são paulo and 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.219
 I'll be back in rio de janeiro and I'm going 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.260
 buy a ticket for the press already 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.600

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.640
 every day and so bring more 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.620
 videos for you and show more game 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.780
 it's okay, this is it guys, let's go 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.620
 check out the video where I'm 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.660
 testing the fusion with the wheel of the xbox 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.910
 I thought it was very good, I did not know it. 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.610
 sensational is very sensitive is a bit 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.040
 hard to fly can see that I'm even going 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.200
 hit a lot there I'll stay last 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.420
 I will not tire the guys but I did not go 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.580
 it was worth it was sensational to test and if 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.720
 this flyer play the formalism I 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.450
 swear I enjoyed both anxious now 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.920
 I want to buy it and the graph is very 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.409
 good to see the details is fine 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.420
 did the textures have a glow a 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.850
 very strong heart very very nice 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.560
 same and the gameplay has a lot of good me 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.360
 I tested the bid 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.860
 I also see here on the internet a 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.560
 list of other cars that will have a 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:40.020
 game in several classic old cars 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:43.409
 also has the mercedes 300 sl of 1954 has 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.890
 a jaguar and type s 1 61 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:52.350
 shelby snake daytona 65 chevrolet 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.759
 impala of 64 are several recalls are some 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:01.150
 stronger and more for the system 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:03.400
 ferrari f40 87 and a lamborghini r 581 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.020
 so there is a good variety of chaos for 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.190
 we play 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.050
 one thing that called my 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.680
 attention is that the game will be a world 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.630
 Open 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.940
 I'll give you a freedom and you'll have 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.310
 also a day and night system 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.270
 a huge variety of lanes not 65 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.760
 types of surfaces between mud stones 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.170
 there's no way, there's not enough clue 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.550
 people can check 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.400
 It's going to happen in Colorado. 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.430
 United States you will also be able to 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.730
 negotiate cars will have garages of 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.470
 painting for you to customize and also 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.810
 several other types of services that you 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.160
 will be able to use during the game and for 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.220
 while this is what I have information 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.260
 I still can not say much about the game. 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.290
 thing I tested only one clue is 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.390
 a race only when you release the game leave 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.940
 Then I'll be able to test some points 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.180
 negative and positive things 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.130
 more concrete but for me it is note 8 game 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.260
 It is really cool to play graphic is 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.060
 excellent very nice indeed 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.680
 Okay, I recommend this first time. 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.370
 recommended that you buy when 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.230
 leaves 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.530
 it's worth you'll have fun will have 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.930
 a quality game and he leaves on the 18th of 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.900
 december exclusive for xbox not like 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.580
 I already told you and he will also have a way 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.810
 multiplayer so you can play with 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:22.330
 your friends online and that's it folks 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.850
 You check out a video I made there. 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.370
 in formal testing bgs where with 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.340
 microsoft steering wheel the wheel of xbox 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.709
 I like to suck damn it's very sensitive 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.540
 It's difficult to drive, but you will. 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.600
 taking the mothers slowly there you pick 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.090
 It's a good practice and I'd rather go for a 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.380

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.080
