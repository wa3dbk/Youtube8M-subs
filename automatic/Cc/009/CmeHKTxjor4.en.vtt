left foot forward side together and then
right<00:00:20.679> foot<00:00:20.980> backwards<00:00:21.669> side<00:00:22.269> together<00:00:22.539> and

right foot backwards side together and

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.230 
right foot backwards side together and
you<00:00:23.169> would<00:00:23.320> be<00:00:23.529> right<00:00:23.800> that<00:00:24.609> is<00:00:24.820> perfectly

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
you would be right that is perfectly

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.060 
you would be right that is perfectly
correct<00:00:25.630> especially<00:00:25.900> if<00:00:26.320> I'm<00:00:26.439> dancing<00:00:26.679> a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
correct especially if I'm dancing a

reverse<00:00:27.910> or<00:00:28.300> a<00:00:28.359> left<00:00:29.259> turning<00:00:29.740> figure<00:00:30.429> let<00:00:31.269> me

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
reverse or a left turning figure let me

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.479 
reverse or a left turning figure let me
show<00:00:31.480> you<00:00:31.539> what<00:00:31.659> I<00:00:31.689> mean<00:00:31.869> so<00:00:32.169> we<00:00:32.349> go<00:00:32.560> left<00:00:33.220> foot

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
show you what I mean so we go left foot

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.970 
show you what I mean so we go left foot
forward<00:00:33.910> side<00:00:34.570> together<00:00:34.870> right<00:00:35.650> foot

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
forward side together right foot

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.760 
forward side together right foot
backwards<00:00:36.670> side<00:00:37.330> together<00:00:37.720> if<00:00:38.260> we're<00:00:38.650> going

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
backwards side together if we're going

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.110 
backwards side together if we're going
to<00:00:38.830> do<00:00:39.010> something<00:00:39.280> that's<00:00:39.520> turning<00:00:39.790> to<00:00:40.000> the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
to do something that's turning to the

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.060 
to do something that's turning to the
right<00:00:40.420> that's<00:00:41.140> going<00:00:41.380> to<00:00:41.470> be<00:00:41.590> totally

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
right that's going to be totally

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.430 
right that's going to be totally
reversed<00:00:42.460> so<00:00:43.150> we<00:00:43.360> would<00:00:43.540> be<00:00:43.690> going<00:00:44.020> say<00:00:44.260> with

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
reversed so we would be going say with

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.610 
reversed so we would be going say with
the<00:00:44.560> right<00:00:44.740> foot<00:00:45.070> forward<00:00:45.910> side<00:00:46.750> together<00:00:47.080> and

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
the right foot forward side together and

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.310 
the right foot forward side together and
we'll<00:00:48.100> with<00:00:48.190> the<00:00:48.280> left<00:00:48.520> foot<00:00:48.790> we<00:00:49.030> go<00:00:49.320> backwards

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
we'll with the left foot we go backwards

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.670 
we'll with the left foot we go backwards
side<00:00:51.010> together<00:00:51.430> let's<00:00:51.940> just<00:00:52.120> do<00:00:52.210> that<00:00:52.360> again

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
side together let's just do that again

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.320 
side together let's just do that again
with<00:00:53.680> the<00:00:53.800> right<00:00:54.010> foot<00:00:54.250> we're<00:00:54.580> going<00:00:54.610> forward

with the right foot we're going forward

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.350 
with the right foot we're going forward
forward<00:00:55.990> side<00:00:56.950> together<00:00:57.370> with<00:00:57.880> the<00:00:57.970> left<00:00:58.180> foot

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
forward side together with the left foot

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.810 
forward side together with the left foot
we're<00:00:58.510> going<00:00:58.750> backwards<00:00:58.990> backwards<00:00:59.890> side

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
we're going backwards backwards side

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.090 
we're going backwards backwards side
together<00:01:01.510> again<00:01:02.020> one<00:01:02.800> two<00:01:03.610> three<00:01:04.540> four<00:01:05.320> five

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
together again one two three four five

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.260 
together again one two three four five
six<00:01:06.970> one<00:01:07.150> more<00:01:07.299> time<00:01:07.509> one<00:01:07.960> two<00:01:08.640> three<00:01:09.640> four

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
six one more time one two three four

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.149 
six one more time one two three four
five<00:01:11.049> six<00:01:11.920> this<00:01:12.729> is<00:01:12.909> a<00:01:13.079> natural<00:01:14.159> turning

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
five six this is a natural turning

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.349 
five six this is a natural turning
figure<00:01:15.549> for<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:15.820> waltz

figure for the waltz

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:18.870 
figure for the waltz
now<00:01:16.600> it's<00:01:17.229> the<00:01:17.409> same<00:01:17.710> if<00:01:17.920> you're<00:01:18.039> a<00:01:18.070> man<00:01:18.399> or<00:01:18.729> if

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
now it's the same if you're a man or if

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.880 
now it's the same if you're a man or if
you're<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.149> lady<00:01:19.450> the<00:01:20.079> difference<00:01:20.469> is<00:01:20.619> just

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
you're a lady the difference is just

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.620 
you're a lady the difference is just
that<00:01:21.069> one<00:01:21.369> is<00:01:21.520> dancing<00:01:21.939> the<00:01:21.969> forward<00:01:22.420> half

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
that one is dancing the forward half

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.319 
that one is dancing the forward half
while<00:01:23.289> the<00:01:23.469> other<00:01:23.710> is<00:01:23.979> dancing<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.609> backward

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
while the other is dancing the backward

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:28.109 
while the other is dancing the backward
half<00:01:25.539> right<00:01:26.200> now<00:01:26.229> our<00:01:26.710> number<00:01:27.100> one<00:01:27.130> goal<00:01:27.579> is<00:01:27.609> to

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
half right now our number one goal is to

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.450 
half right now our number one goal is to
get<00:01:28.270> you<00:01:28.479> out<00:01:28.509> of<00:01:28.929> the<00:01:29.049> program<00:01:29.259> that<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.280> root

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
get you out of the program that the root

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.270 
get you out of the program that the root
has<00:01:31.119> to<00:01:31.149> go<00:01:31.479> backwards<00:01:32.079> because<00:01:32.590> you<00:01:32.889> can<00:01:33.069> see

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
has to go backwards because you can see

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.209 
has to go backwards because you can see
it<00:01:33.460> can<00:01:33.789> go<00:01:34.030> forward<00:01:34.329> as<00:01:34.689> well<00:01:34.990> now<00:01:35.619> we<00:01:35.679> have<00:01:36.069> to

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:36.219 
it can go forward as well now we have to

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:38.760 
it can go forward as well now we have to
use<00:01:36.369> a<00:01:36.399> change<00:01:36.939> step<00:01:37.389> to<00:01:38.049> put<00:01:38.259> these<00:01:38.499> two

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
use a change step to put these two

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.620 
use a change step to put these two
actions<00:01:39.039> the<00:01:39.490> left<00:01:39.759> and<00:01:39.999> the<00:01:40.090> right<00:01:40.359> together

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
actions the left and the right together

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.959 
actions the left and the right together
which<00:01:41.530> we<00:01:41.710> will<00:01:41.829> work<00:01:42.009> on<00:01:42.249> in<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.579> different

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
which we will work on in a different

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.999 
which we will work on in a different
lesson<00:01:43.179> one<00:01:43.600> more<00:01:43.749> time<00:01:43.960> here<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:44.499> we'll<00:01:44.859> do

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
lesson one more time here and we'll do

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.069 
lesson one more time here and we'll do
it<00:01:45.039> with<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.219> music<00:01:45.340> this<00:01:45.759> time<00:01:45.999> just<00:01:46.630> dancing
