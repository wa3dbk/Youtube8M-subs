00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.330
 hello personal voice analysis is from the book 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.270
 in the fields of mediumship psychographics 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:20.470
 of chico xavier by the spirit andré luiz 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.330
 this book was launched in 1955 and 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.320
 together with the other books of 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.949
 andré luís 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.579
 the so-called life collection in the world 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.980
 spiritual 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:34.030
 Good. Let's start with the cover. This is a 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:38.890
 edition of the 90's an edition if not 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.770
 I'm mistaken in 1993 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.590
 the measurement therefore somewhat 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.920
 old leaf are already here a little 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.510
 yellow and everything else but I think 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.219
 I can make some comments here in 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.129
 relation to the cover 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:57.460
 Good, I always found the book covers. 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.739
 de andré luis special edited salir 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.010
 in the 90's which was a great lesson 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.140
 They made it horrible I do not know where 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.260
 personal pursuit of this kind of art is a 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.490
 thing I think that impoverishes more 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.200
 these books all the books of André 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.030
 luis edit this format first 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.950
 small much smaller 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.930
 You can see the books here. 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.439
 d today, maybe a format that was 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.960
 common at the time and the cover designs are 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.939
 very ugly here for example a lot of 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.180
 face that I can not even identify 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:30.100
 if the west is the same you position 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.240
 different from 6 are several people 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.460
 similar 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.670
 It's something I find very very ugly. 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.799
 not an attractive mistake from the point of view 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.780
 here of aesthetics with everything as always 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.829
 we really care about here is the 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.229
 content 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.479
 despite the cover at least for me to be 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.070
 Yes an interesting tactic 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.990
 especially those who do not know 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:57.549
 the work is good, it reminds him of 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:58.869
 285 pages 285 is not such a book. 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.729
 great to read 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.810
 the advantage of it that has chapters 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.329
 What's the use of being tired? 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.520
 to read the chapters are well 

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:11.380
 and that of all the books of 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.230
 andré luis that I read him without a doubt is the 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.900
 simpler is what language is 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.069
 Of course he does not have those dialogues. 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.719
 long 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.150
 It appears in the wave of the Andrew luis 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:25.510
 session, the 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.760
 too moralistic aces you were going 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.980
 tired of always reading the same thing 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.739
 every time this book does not have it 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.099
 dialogues are short but they are profound 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.950
 do not lose in depth because they are 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:41.409
 and the history of this book in a nutshell 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.870
 is the following andré luís and his 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:47.230
 companion is hilarious accompanied by a 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.719
 spirit called to those who appear to them 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.760
 as an instructor intends to visit 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:54.310
 several spiritist houses accompanying the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.349
 mediumship jobs 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.060
 so he's doing the descriptions 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.180
 still from the spiritual point of view 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.159
 what he is observing and the 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.889
 experiences you have chosen then 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.810
 he deals with many things to 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:11.159
 to talk about prayer is about psychography 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.370
 will talk about the disobsession meetings 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:18.370
 to talk about a series of subjects on 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.409
 the aspect of the spirit's point of view 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.840
 mindful of the organization of the 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:25.389
 jobs as things happened 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.290
 It is very interesting and as always new 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.209
 by andré luís 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.819
 there's always something high tech one 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.590
 futuristic thing and this book is that 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.959
 it features a fairly 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.139
 strange called psychopath 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.919
 would be kind of google glass today 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.790
 in day 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:44.470
 adapted to the role of the person who 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.250
 put on glasses a kind of a 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.560
 glasses 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.379
 he could see what was going on inside 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.720
 the head of people and is a resource there 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.139
 that the spirits used to try 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.759
 understand the process better 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:01.030
 Then you put 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:03.579
 these glasses and from that you saw the 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.780
 chemical reactions the electrical reactions in the 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.349
 brain a very very thing 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.949
 interesting that he's in here and how 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.810
 always have some controversial rations 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:16.900
 but what caught my eye without a doubt 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.509
 it is the moral teaching contained in this book in 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.240
 more in the most varied aspects of 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:24.969
 houses that he attends the situations that 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.180
 he notes he takes a lot of cool and 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:30.190
 That's a lot for us here. 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.780
 if I'm not mistaken it's the sixth or seventh 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.670
 collection book 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.650
 andré luis I'll read if he 's there in 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.870
 house will do a book crossing with him 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.030
 and I moved forward with my account 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.970
 that I had not read and decided to see 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.830
 so it's a very interesting book for 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.660
 who has an interest in knowing another 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.190
 aspect of the same unit that whoever 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.560
 know the opinion of that spirit 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.320
 respect of the mediumistic facts with 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.970
 I sure do recommend this book is not 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.280
 Of course the study book is not a book. 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.750
 which will replace the book of middle and 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.389
 nothing of the kind but it's a very 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.580
 Do you like to read a book that at the same time 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.620
 time shows the backstage of the house 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.750
 spiritist of the most varied houses 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.280
 spirits and that it will not 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.790
 present a lot of curious history 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.960
 about the people who were 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.320
 attending the works 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.810
 It's a book that I would give 7 note to him. 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.510
 so have nothing much 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.940
 exciting or more scandalous 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.580
 revolutionary of one more book half 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.770
 very simple term to read a lot 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.500
 tasty but that brings beyond 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:35.290
 relevant information and I think 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.280
 relevant from the point of view of 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.080
 mediumship 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.970
 the advantage of this book in fact in 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.250
 relation to all others is that this will 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:45.490
 show from the point of view of the spirit 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.440
 processes how does example happen 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.570
 we know the theory that shows how the 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.760
 psychographics may exist but is it 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.350
 will show how this actually happens 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.180
 as the spirit approaches 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.490
 How was that the head of the middle 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.070
 how is it that it shows the 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.410
 stages of the process he describes a 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.140
 so that gives us understand how 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.760
 that these things take place then it is a 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.900
 very interesting book for those who 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:12.039
 has an interest in the psychic question then 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:17.010
 this is personal 

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:17.010
 a hug and until the next Czech book
