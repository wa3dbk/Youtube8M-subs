 water milk in a cup and 1 a knife 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:49.820
 and also know that we can start 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.820
 to think with 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.770
 look at the evil 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:01.100
 I'll start when milk is glass with 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.140
 milk and let's see what will happen is 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.810
 that I did not see what happens I know that 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:15.420

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:20.240

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.360

 we put a certain amount of 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:46.610
 coca cola without making too much fuss 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.610

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:04.680
 Now we're going to put a milk 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.680
 It's good, but a thousand times. 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.700
 Look, I'm going to say nothing or anything. 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:25.880
 every junk in which the milk did not read anything 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:30.250
 for who knows a coca cola and chlorine that 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:33.800
 will be against what will happen oz 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.770
