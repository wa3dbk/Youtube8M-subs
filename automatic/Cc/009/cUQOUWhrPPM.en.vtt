season<00:02:29.959> this<00:02:30.080> would<00:02:30.290> be<00:02:30.410> relevant<00:02:30.739> but<00:02:31.069> i

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
season this would be relevant but i

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.729 
season this would be relevant but i
think<00:02:31.819> you<00:02:32.060> would<00:02:32.209> be<00:02:32.330> super<00:02:32.840> empathetic<00:02:33.530> if

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
think you would be super empathetic if

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.500 
think you would be super empathetic if
it<00:02:34.040> was<00:02:34.190> during<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.670> cold<00:02:34.910> while<00:02:35.239> you<00:02:35.330> read

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.360 
it was during the cold while you read
this<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:36.140> this<00:02:36.739> is<00:02:36.769> a<00:02:36.920> definite

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
this so this is a definite

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.160 
this so this is a definite
recommendation<00:02:38.120> no<00:02:38.239> matter<00:02:38.390> what<00:02:38.629> season<00:02:38.870> it

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
recommendation no matter what season it

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.309 
recommendation no matter what season it
is<00:02:39.290> but<00:02:39.590> I<00:02:39.620> do<00:02:39.739> highly<00:02:40.730> recommend<00:02:40.970> that<00:02:41.840> this

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
is but I do highly recommend that this

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.229
