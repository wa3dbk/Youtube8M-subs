00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:22.220
 Bread day is the scent I got off nowadays ... Continued to last year 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.730
 We will come to Toshihiro Yoshida players Nurburgring 24-hour challenge champion 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.620
 Better was 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.130
 Super station 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:32.780
 Congratulations on it-it's great- 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:35.540
 Well today I am not an Impreza, but with the fc 7 ps model 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.960
 I want to make an impression though 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:43.500
 What kind of model is it to say that cheese comes out first 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:49.170
 That Subaru 's sti's own 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.000
 It is a car that has been variously seasoned, but most of the suspension has changed 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.980
 Strengthen the brake 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.970
 After we're on the nbr challenge to the bottom, just like the car you're riding 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.330
 various 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.490
 I put a place where things of work 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.960
 The model is like that of a s model 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:10.479
 In 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.020
 Anyway, it's a pity I'm also reading this scene It 's about 7-seater 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:17.440
 so 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:20.460
 Also I What happens when if Migidai players is whether to use I'm looking forward to my Yes it dyne 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.460
 Let's go pension 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.159
 EXIGA is it yes 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:41.530
 It had been out of state language Fushi escape 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:45.250
 That a new model change has been made, but Exiga will not 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:51.720
 After all that car and I are riding 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:56.940
 It was early and there was a lot of smooth movement smoothly 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.159
 It was already that these kind of ghosts before and after say that it is really smooth 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.539
 Say no 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:07.310
 A round of nails that I raced during that time lf collaboration 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.310
 Do you also that this kind of course course 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:16.890
 9 y number of schools 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:22.950
 Well it's a bit thinner here than that, but it's narrow but it's narrow 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:27.940
 I do not anxiety feeling riding something even pretty or oh I'd covered good 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:35.310
 I think this ts because I'm a volunteer player 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:39.989
 Many that I'd also still refers Bee plants are equipped with a taste of the matter sti 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.760
 Our nbr are also attached to the 2-bay number of car 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:47.970
 that 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:52.590
 There are various surrounding parts to make the run strong, but 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.650
 Is Yao applied to the general and refreshing to the car? 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.650
 Hmm 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:06.530
 This car is also attached to that kind of car and what is attached to the car in reverse is od of that race 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.129
 Is there anything cool about feedback ? 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.400
 Let's go back and forth with each other at school 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.690
 Let's make a good car as Subaru 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.400
 There is a part that 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.210
 0 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.430
 At something 10 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:24.570
 Well there is also a class because it is a driver of Yoshida, but it is okay if I get more speed 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.930
 I think 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:32.680
 You're jealousy, but you're really fine 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:36.480
 The speed range was high 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.480
 Do not let the speedometer 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:48.060
 I think family is also it is also still sound South engine This is really nbr 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:54.840
 That Impreza says what change I have done before now 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:56.220
 I use an engine, but it's really an engine with a long history of Subaru 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.050
 What 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.890
 All the way this ends plant appearance 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:06.670
 Kke there is a player also Tokoro After eating challenge Te 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:11.319
 After all I say that it is an edge that can not be cut 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:14.920
 Because I think from before Janken, I think what that difference is like 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:21.410
 Well then I played this same one more and more 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:23.650
 After it is Toka the king of peopleæˆ€it is Toka Serve more the low-speed ship 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.650
 boiling 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.100
 As a manufacturer or sti 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:34.720
 As we are trying various things 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:42.810
 Even in light of Toko to say or was fuel consumption or was the environment N bond 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:42.810
 I'm become necessary is the middle of this era absolutely ne Pitte has improved 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:50.080
 It is quite aggressive but good preparation 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:55.620
 Yes scary but not fun 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:58.740
 A sense of security is still weird After all there are few rolls Eh 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:02.430
 In it means this land in a single 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.790
 Even if the first floor with poor road of th 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:09.140
 Part that fits with 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:14.450
 After all, only the nose dive is strange when braking 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:18.770
 If it's a car that is sinking only in the front, I think it's all right from the seat 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:23.590
 Then it is not the cause of getting sick 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:26.950
 It's not there, so I'm going to step on the brake Sae . 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:30.600
 That person sinks down only the front 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:33.490
 In the car as a whole will sink 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:37.330
 Really various 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.009
 What 's paddle or Aso Nde this 7-seater now 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:44.610
 I was able to fish 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:45.810
 Nde So that even if many that various passenger 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.900
 Perhaps 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.680
 There is no 4 and it is comfortable 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.680
 7 N long-distance 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:06:00.449
 Of course, the child shakes to some extent to the side, but the country is Aday most at all 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.449
 Ne 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:07.190
 There was a 7 seater there, I forgot this and I can not really think 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.360
 7-seater 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:14.169
 If you do not look at the Well behind I mean sports car 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.880
 It's a sedan-like type but it's a minivan and it looks like 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:17.860
 Really 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:22.500
 so 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:26.880
 Even if it is such a minivan Subaru after all in a minivan 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:31.889
 What is it? It is the balance of this whole car 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:34.430
 After all it is good of awd but also 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:38.240
 Strange extra ne 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:44.570
 It is disjointed moving all What Na code 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:47.310
 Oh yes there is already a lot of minivans, but if it is stretched it seems that the legs are falling apart 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:52.950
 I'm moving 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:54.240
 It is a feeling that a person who is really following this mark will shake as well. 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:57.940
 It has become 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:00.220
 I have a car, but this is really already 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.169
 Left and right 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.819
 Good back and forth movement 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:05.819
 Or Rutteyuu is consistent 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.050
 There has never been one more wheel moving strangely
