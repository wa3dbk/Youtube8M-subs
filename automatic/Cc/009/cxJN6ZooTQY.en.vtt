clones everything but they all sound the
exact<00:01:18.020> same<00:01:18.320> it's<00:01:18.979> because<00:01:19.070> of<00:01:19.430> the

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
exact same it's because of the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.580 
exact same it's because of the
modulation<00:01:19.940> look<00:01:20.450> at<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.780> set<00:01:21.049> listen<00:01:21.470> it's

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
modulation look at the set listen it's

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.649 
modulation look at the set listen it's
Darth<00:01:21.830> Vader<00:01:22.070> without<00:01:22.400> the<00:01:22.549> mask<00:01:22.700> mask<00:01:23.360> like
