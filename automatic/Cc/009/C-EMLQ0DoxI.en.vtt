as they're about to return the flag
right<00:01:33.420> as<00:01:33.570> they<00:01:33.689> were<00:01:33.780> about<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.500> know

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
right as they were about to you know

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.080 
right as they were about to you know
capture<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.040> flag<00:01:35.250> or<00:01:35.430> things<00:01:35.610> like<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.909> so

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
capture the flag or things like that so

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.819 
capture the flag or things like that so
I<00:01:36.119> don't<00:01:36.540> know<00:01:36.600> like<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:37.170> both<00:01:37.380> game<00:01:37.590> types

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
I don't know like I like both game types

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.010 
I don't know like I like both game types
I<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.250> think<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.759> miss<00:01:39.090> capture<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.540> flag<00:01:39.780> a

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
I just I think I miss capture the flag a

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.719 
I just I think I miss capture the flag a
little<00:01:40.470> bit<00:01:40.590> more<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.979> that's<00:01:41.159> gonna<00:01:41.310> be<00:01:41.520> back

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
little bit more and that's gonna be back

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.600 
little bit more and that's gonna be back
in<00:01:41.909> advanced<00:01:42.869> warfare<00:01:43.079> which<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.799> very<00:01:44.220> very

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
in advanced warfare which is very very

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.590 
in advanced warfare which is very very
exciting<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.180> really<00:01:45.360> funny<00:01:45.540> because

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
exciting it's really funny because

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.080

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
that is a first little look at

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.190 
that is a first little look at
multiplayer<00:02:13.090> we<00:02:13.510> get<00:02:13.629> to<00:02:13.720> see<00:02:13.810> a<00:02:13.840> little<00:02:14.049> bit

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
multiplayer we get to see a little bit

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.130 
multiplayer we get to see a little bit
of<00:02:14.409> what<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.400> Engram<00:02:15.879> screen<00:02:16.870> is<00:02:16.989> gonna

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
of what the the Engram screen is gonna

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.690 
of what the the Engram screen is gonna
look<00:02:17.290> like<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.590> scoreboard<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.220> Sentinels

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
look like the scoreboard the Sentinels

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.550 
look like the scoreboard the Sentinels
versus<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.180> Atlas<00:02:19.629> those<00:02:19.900> are<00:02:20.019> the<00:02:20.140> two<00:02:20.319> main

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
versus the Atlas those are the two main

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.199 
versus the Atlas those are the two main
factions<00:02:21.129> I<00:02:21.250> guess<00:02:21.400> or<00:02:21.549> at<00:02:21.640> least<00:02:21.760> two<00:02:21.909> of<00:02:21.939> the

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
factions I guess or at least two of the

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.240 
factions I guess or at least two of the
factions<00:02:22.659> in<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.840> game<00:02:23.019> and<00:02:23.829> like<00:02:23.920> I<00:02:24.040> said

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
factions in the game and like I said

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.100 
factions in the game and like I said
most<00:02:24.400> importantly<00:02:24.599> capture<00:02:25.599> the<00:02:25.689> flag<00:02:25.900> is

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
most importantly capture the flag is

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.869 
most importantly capture the flag is
returning<00:02:26.560> in<00:02:26.799> Call<00:02:27.099> of<00:02:27.129> Duty<00:02:27.430> advanced
