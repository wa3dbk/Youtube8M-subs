00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.620 
50% of the way of the ball yeah okay
that's<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.070> good<00:00:35.219> example<00:00:35.309> if<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.420> clock

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
that's a good example if it's a clock

00:00:36.630 --> 00:01:02.209 
that's a good example if it's a clock
first<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.170> want<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.380> be<00:00:37.440> hitting<00:00:37.620> nine<00:01:01.129> just<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
first you want to be hitting nine just a

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.529 
first you want to be hitting nine just a
demonstration<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.969> what<00:01:03.090> would<00:01:03.239> look<00:01:03.420> like

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
demonstration of what would look like

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.920 
demonstration of what would look like
without<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:04.049> left<00:01:04.199> hand<00:01:04.379> side<00:01:08.270> okay<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.330> let's

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
without the left hand side okay so let's

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.770 
without the left hand side okay so let's
follow<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.290> white<00:01:10.439> there<00:01:10.790> okay<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.299> we're

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
follow the white there okay so we're

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.149 
follow the white there okay so we're
down<00:01:12.869> tight<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> black<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:13.920> as<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.130> can

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
down tight to the black here as you can

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.910 
down tight to the black here as you can
see<00:01:14.310> now<00:01:15.270> let's<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.110> get<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> glue<00:01:16.560> out<00:01:16.590> and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
see now let's just get the glue out and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.929 
see now let's just get the glue out and
then<00:01:17.009> we<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.250> demonstrate<00:01:17.400> ways<00:01:17.729> like

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
then we can demonstrate ways like

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.480 
then we can demonstrate ways like
website<00:01:21.470> okay<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.799> balls<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> similar

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
website okay so the balls in the similar

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.280 
website okay so the balls in the similar
position<00:01:23.610> now<00:01:24.570> playing<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:24.990> we've<00:01:25.140> left

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
position now playing this we've left

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.550 
position now playing this we've left
hand<00:01:25.530> side<00:01:26.930> okay<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:27.960> as<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.200> can<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
hand side okay so as you can see the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.109 
hand side okay so as you can see the
white<00:01:28.710> pulled<00:01:29.070> up<00:01:29.189> perfectly<00:01:29.700> therefore

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
white pulled up perfectly therefore

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.910 
white pulled up perfectly therefore
those<00:01:30.240> two<00:01:30.270> Reds<00:01:30.600> slightly<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> bit<00:01:31.560> short<00:01:31.829> on

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
those two Reds slightly a bit short on

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
point okay so this is where he's

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.370 
point okay so this is where he's
striking<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.100> white<00:01:53.250> ball<00:01:53.490> from<00:01:55.310> just<00:01:56.310> pop<00:01:56.490> on

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
striking the white ball from just pop on

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:04.219 
striking the white ball from just pop on
okay<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.439> left<00:01:59.340> hand<00:01:59.460> side<00:01:59.640> nine<00:02:00.509> o'clock<00:02:03.229> and

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
okay so left hand side nine o'clock and

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.539 
okay so left hand side nine o'clock and
that's<00:02:04.469> where<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.799> weights<00:02:04.950> go<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.310> as<00:02:05.430> you

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
that's where the weights go and as you

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.740 
that's where the weights go and as you
can<00:02:05.670> see<00:02:05.729> it's<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.750> nice<00:02:06.930> little<00:02:07.049> popping

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
can see it's a nice little popping

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.020 
can see it's a nice little popping
and<00:02:08.440> South<00:02:08.800> outflow<00:02:09.220> would<00:02:09.369> left-hand<00:02:09.760> side

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
and South outflow would left-hand side

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.910 
and South outflow would left-hand side
okay<00:02:10.960> can<00:02:11.260> you<00:02:11.320> think<00:02:11.440> of<00:02:11.530> anything<00:02:11.740> else

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
okay can you think of anything else

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.150 
okay can you think of anything else
toward<00:02:12.630> off<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.840> block<00:02:14.050> okay<00:02:14.470> wedge<00:02:14.980> on<00:02:15.130> the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
toward off the block okay wedge on the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:23.090 
toward off the block okay wedge on the
white<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:19.750> is<00:02:19.960> when<00:02:21.570> triangle<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.630> pack<00:02:22.870> of

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
white this is when triangle the pack of

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:34.290 
white this is when triangle the pack of
five<00:02:24.100> or<00:02:24.280> six<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.490> triangle<00:02:33.970> right<00:02:34.030> way

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
five or six is a triangle right way

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:48.200 
five or six is a triangle right way
around<00:02:45.210> okay<00:02:46.210> so<00:02:46.270> once<00:02:46.480> again<00:02:46.570> ninety-four

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
around okay so once again ninety-four

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.300 
around okay so once again ninety-four
back<00:02:49.210> in<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.420> whites

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
back in the whites

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.830 
back in the whites
let's<00:02:51.310> looks<00:02:51.610> more<00:02:51.940> on<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.180> reaction<00:02:52.330> of<00:02:52.720> the

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
let's looks more on the reaction of the

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.560 
let's looks more on the reaction of the
white<00:02:53.080> when<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.650> block<00:02:53.890> gets<00:02:54.130> hit<00:02:54.400> this<00:02:55.330> could

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
white when the block gets hit this could

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.640 
white when the block gets hit this could
be<00:02:55.660> hard<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:55.900> see

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.130 

okay<00:03:00.130> so<00:03:00.190> nine<00:03:00.490> o'clock<00:03:01.060> stain<00:03:01.660> down<00:03:01.840> on<00:03:02.020> you

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
okay so nine o'clock stain down on you

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.230 
okay so nine o'clock stain down on you
shot<00:03:03.360> this<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:06.190> can<00:03:06.310> see<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.520> whites<00:03:06.730> still

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
shot this you can see the whites still
