00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.450
 Hello dear friends with you Joe 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.190
 savkin and today tell you about the game 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.080
 which is called blue clan 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.849
 I hope I said the name correctly 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.609
 because with English I have absolutely 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.640
 bad but I tried and slipped me not 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.939
 throw what about the game itself 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.080
 This is a direct demonstration of the engine under 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.050
 name and spotlight 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.179
 so in essence, to call it a game 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.640
 This is not a demonstration but the developers 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.000
 somehow position this thing like 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.160
 player i really like physical engines and 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.469
 euphoria is one of those engines that 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.960
 that's right here's a favorite we love what 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.039
 salt of this engine is this engine in real 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.989
 time models realistic in general 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.480
 the behavior of the model 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.829
 that is, the engine gives the model 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.379
 virtual skeleton virtual 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.320
 muscles now you see on the screen 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.869
 a small demonstration of this engine 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.659
 engine was used in games like 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:12.479
 gta 5 gta 4 red dead redemption star 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.049
 wars the force unleashed 2 and in the first 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.979
 parts, too, was that is the engine in general 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.820
 makes the game more realistic and simple 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.540
 just wild 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.060
 I love this engine 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.280
 what can you do in this game as in 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.890
 quotes the game can do all sorts of 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.650
 obscene things that still don't 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.640
 not looking at anything amusing that is possible 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.690
 let's take a trampoline make our 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.660
 ninja man 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.729
 for getting on it and here it is 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.830
 way to balance if you don’t 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.720
 get to balance it rather 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.000
 just like that this way will come back 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.370
 and it’s very funny to roll again 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.800
 this is done in physics looks very 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.130
 nice and deductible in real time 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.479
 as I said before and you can type 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.490
 experience can make money again 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.130
 nato on the fact that we jump on the trampoline 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.420
 we get money for it and that money 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.570
 you can spend on all sorts of other 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.580
 entertainment with physics then we have here 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.120
 dropped the bag we raise it 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.520
 five coins fell out of it 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.650
 can be spent on other things 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.410
 entertainment as i said now we 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.450
 let's say a pear will also beat here 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.600
 there are some more obscure sorts of things 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.790
 which I have not yet opened, but later 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.920
 open here we have the level indicated 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.630
 we have another level 2 this whole thing 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.080
 open level with 5 kg net very 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.299
 funny thing totally free i 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.840
 I advise you to download it not to play 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.970
 I think that it will take you more 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.099
 how many evenings but in general thing 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.160
 amusing that is why it seems to me that 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.319
 that in the near future this engine we 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.989
 we will see at all in every second game 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.260
 he is certainly dear as far as i know 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.090
 but nevertheless he is very cool 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.230
 try to do something sometime 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.500
 such intercourse 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.019
 dad with my throw back there 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.560
 he is generally on the idea oh he can catch on 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:21.349
 very nice for these twigs here already 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.730
 cling buddy Well Well if you honor 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:28.489
 so clumsy here he caught only 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.099
 but that did not last long in general 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:33.049
 very cool engine if you if you 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.880
 I like it in this game, I also 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.690
 I recommend to download star wars force 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.180
 unleashed 2 and the first part too 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.160
 here he finally caught it all 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.319
 done again in physics that is it 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.780
 not pre- prepared but animation and 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.150
 this is exactly what I like about this engine. 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.180
 that is, there are games in which it is admissible 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.620
 but you shoot the dude 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.750
 prepared animations 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.680
 moves back there let's say yes from him 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.750
 such an animation 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.780
 here everything is deducted in real 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.000
 time engine that is here you are not 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.150
 see one and say repetitive 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.829
 scenes of a bullet in the chest 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.780
 let's say everything is always different here 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.700
 happens depending on which 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.950
 part of the chest you will enter or there tube 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.500
 let's say here the bullets of course there is no 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.459
 now by the way I give an example on the same 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.799
 playing max payne 3 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.990
 there also was this engine you shoot at 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.720
 leg he is allowed is taken by foot and 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:30.139
 somehow beautifully moving away in physics here is our 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.599
 Now the character generally sat here in 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.380
 other games in other games of this engine 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.660
 no and 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.230
 let's five 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:41.200
 there is no such engine 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.060
 of course in the seed spectacularly so that 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.160
 guys I advise you to download 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.930
 and also advise you to subscribe to my 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.420
 channel leave a comment 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.420
 and wait for the next release bye
