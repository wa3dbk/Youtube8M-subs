00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
all right this here's the crack down to

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.309 
all right this here's the crack down to
demo<00:00:04.020> and<00:00:04.520> yes<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.790> know<00:00:05.850> they<00:00:06.120> fix<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.660> they

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
demo and yes I know they fix the they

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.370 
demo and yes I know they fix the they
made<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.529> patch<00:00:07.830> for<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:09.019> infinite<00:00:10.019> kind

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
made a patch for the infinite kind

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.270 
made a patch for the infinite kind
glitch<00:00:10.889> but<00:00:11.340> uh<00:00:11.900> just<00:00:12.900> don't<00:00:13.170> update<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.920> you

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
glitch but uh just don't update and you

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.300 
glitch but uh just don't update and you
can<00:00:14.460> solve<00:00:14.700> infinite<00:00:15.150> time<00:00:15.560> and<00:00:16.560> all<00:00:16.830> my<00:00:17.010> stuff

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
can solve infinite time and all my stuff

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.700 
can solve infinite time and all my stuff
maxed<00:00:17.760> out<00:00:17.910> and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710
