fold verse three bit of 76 and in the
scrum<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> 32<00:00:17.640> 18<00:00:18.090> over<00:00:18.420> 190<00:00:18.930> for<00:00:19.199> three<00:00:19.829> bit

scrum is a 32 18 over 190 for three bit

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.259 
scrum is a 32 18 over 190 for three bit
of<00:00:20.099> 6%<00:00:20.550> fold<00:00:21.210> verse<00:00:21.419> 3<00:00:21.689> bet<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.109> 50%<00:00:23.089> so<00:00:24.089> in<00:00:24.210> this

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
of 6% fold verse 3 bet of 50% so in this

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.999 
of 6% fold verse 3 bet of 50% so in this
situation<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:25.050> definitely<00:00:25.409> like<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.679> squeeze

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:26.009 
situation I definitely like the squeeze

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.069 
situation I definitely like the squeeze
it's<00:00:26.460> definitely<00:00:26.939> one<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.089> those<00:00:27.300> where<00:00:27.630> I

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.079 
it's definitely one of those where I

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:29.569 
it's definitely one of those where I
don't<00:00:28.470> think<00:00:28.679> I'm<00:00:28.769> going<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.949> make<00:00:29.069> much<00:00:29.369> money

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
don't think I'm going to make much money

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.069 
don't think I'm going to make much money
against<00:00:29.909> cold<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.449> just<00:00:30.720> don't<00:00:30.869> think<00:00:30.989> they're

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
against cold I just don't think they're

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.179 
against cold I just don't think they're
going<00:00:31.169> to<00:00:31.230> make<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.409> tremendous<00:00:31.890> amount<00:00:32.070> of

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
going to make a tremendous amount of

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.160 
going to make a tremendous amount of
mistakes<00:00:32.579> but<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:33.000> do<00:00:33.149> expect<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:33.989> able<00:00:34.079> to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
mistakes but I do expect to be able to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.080 
mistakes but I do expect to be able to
get<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.350> lot<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.710> value<00:00:35.040> from<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.520> scrum<00:00:35.820> and

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
get a lot of value from in the scrum and

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.930 
get a lot of value from in the scrum and
the<00:00:37.020> fact<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.560> am<00:00:37.800> three<00:00:38.280> betting<00:00:38.580> here

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
the fact that I am three betting here

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.330 
the fact that I am three betting here
means<00:00:39.330> I<00:00:39.600> actually<00:00:40.110> discount<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.010> fact<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
means I actually discount the fact the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.220 
means I actually discount the fact the
cold<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.820> going<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.090> combat<00:00:42.420> me<00:00:42.600> by<00:00:42.810> doing<00:00:42.870> much

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
cold is going to combat me by doing much

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.110 
cold is going to combat me by doing much
for<00:00:43.470> betting<00:00:43.650> he<00:00:44.100> sees<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.550> I'm<00:00:44.670> squeezing

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
for betting he sees that I'm squeezing

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.670 
for betting he sees that I'm squeezing
in<00:00:45.270> with<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> fish<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:46.170> I'm<00:00:46.290> out<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.470> position

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
in with a fish that I'm out of position

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.560 
in with a fish that I'm out of position
against<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.460> fish<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:47.970> I'm<00:00:48.060> probably<00:00:48.300> not

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
against that fish so I'm probably not

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.110 
against that fish so I'm probably not
super<00:00:49.080> weak<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.560> sus<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.400> kind<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
super weak and sus it's kind of a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.360 
super weak and sus it's kind of a
disincentive<00:00:51.540> for<00:00:51.930> him<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.500> mess<00:00:52.860> with<00:00:53.010> me<00:00:53.220> and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
disincentive for him to mess with me and

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.180 
disincentive for him to mess with me and
go<00:00:53.490> for<00:00:53.700> a<00:00:53.730> lot<00:00:53.880> of<00:00:53.970> cold<00:00:54.180> for<00:00:54.480> bets<00:00:54.720> so<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:56.130> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
go for a lot of cold for bets so in a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.920 
go for a lot of cold for bets so in a
situation<00:00:56.700> like<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.850> totally<00:00:57.450> on<00:00:57.570> board<00:00:57.810> of

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
situation like this totally on board of

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.690 
situation like this totally on board of
the<00:00:58.020> squeeze<00:00:58.320> sighs<00:00:58.680> looks<00:00:58.980> just<00:00:59.220> fine<00:00:59.460> we'll

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
the squeeze sighs looks just fine we'll

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.190 
the squeeze sighs looks just fine we'll
just<00:00:59.730> play<00:01:00.000> poker<00:01:00.240> from<00:01:00.480> here<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.960> again

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
just play poker from here and again

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.170 
just play poker from here and again
really<00:01:01.740> focusing<00:01:02.220> on<00:01:02.310> getting<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> scrum

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
really focusing on getting in the scrum

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.319 
really focusing on getting in the scrum
to<00:01:03.510> ourselves<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.579> do<00:01:05.790> actually<00:01:06.030> end<00:01:06.299> up

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:06.329 
to ourselves so we do actually end up

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:08.330 
to ourselves so we do actually end up
getting<00:01:06.600> him<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.960> ourselves<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:07.890> he<00:01:08.010> decides

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
getting him to ourselves but he decides

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.540 
getting him to ourselves but he decides
to<00:01:08.430> go<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.940> the<00:01:09.030> back<00:01:09.210> raise<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.810> ships<00:01:10.550> so

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
to go for the back raise and ships so

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.310 
to go for the back raise and ships so
this<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.790> kind<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.000> an<00:01:12.120> awkward<00:01:12.420> situation<00:01:12.480> but

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
this is kind of an awkward situation but

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.210 
this is kind of an awkward situation but
one<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.620> I<00:01:13.650> want<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.890> talk<00:01:14.070> about

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
one that I want to talk about

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.130 
one that I want to talk about
nonetheless<00:01:14.550> if<00:01:15.090> nothing<00:01:15.540> else<00:01:15.690> just<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.080> you

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
nonetheless if nothing else just so you

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.440 
nonetheless if nothing else just so you
know<00:01:16.350> how<00:01:16.440> to<00:01:16.470> proof<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.330> this

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
know how to proof it so in this

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.930 
know how to proof it so in this
situation<00:01:18.659> we<00:01:19.409> are<00:01:19.650> getting<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:20.400> point<00:01:20.640> four

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
situation we are getting one point four

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.490 
situation we are getting one point four
to<00:01:21.060> one<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> call<00:01:21.479> which<00:01:21.900> means<00:01:22.140> we<00:01:22.260> need<00:01:22.350> at

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
to one on a call which means we need at

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.620 
to one on a call which means we need at
least<00:01:22.710> 41<00:01:23.190> percent<00:01:23.729> equity<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.210> break-even

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
least 41 percent equity to break-even

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.050 
least 41 percent equity to break-even
which<00:01:25.260> means<00:01:25.590> ideally<00:01:26.370> we<00:01:26.520> want<00:01:26.729> more<00:01:27.000> than

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
which means ideally we want more than

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.590 
which means ideally we want more than
just<00:01:27.300> 41<00:01:27.930> percent<00:01:28.880> hopefully<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> significant

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
just 41 percent hopefully a significant

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.450 
just 41 percent hopefully a significant
buffer<00:01:30.960> just<00:01:31.260> so<00:01:31.440> we<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.770> ensure<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.130> this

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
buffer just so we can ensure that this

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.789 
buffer just so we can ensure that this
is<00:01:32.700> going<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.180> be<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.479> profitable<00:01:33.810> call<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:34.650> us

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
is going to be a profitable call for us

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.910 
is going to be a profitable call for us
making<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.909> bunch<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.210> breakeven<00:01:36.780> calls<00:01:37.020> for<00:01:37.409> 60

a<00:01:40.650> super<00:01:41.040> good<00:01:41.190> thing<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:42.210> make<00:01:42.600> sure<00:01:42.630> that

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
a super good thing so make sure that

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.149 
a super good thing so make sure that
whenever<00:01:43.170> you're<00:01:43.440> doing<00:01:43.710> something<00:01:43.920> whether

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
whenever you're doing something whether

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.010 
whenever you're doing something whether
it's<00:01:44.370> shoving<00:01:44.729> yourself<00:01:45.090> or<00:01:45.299> calling<00:01:45.690> a<00:01:45.780> shove

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
it's shoving yourself or calling a shove

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.080 
it's shoving yourself or calling a shove
whatever<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:47.040> you're<00:01:47.310> not<00:01:47.700> just

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
whatever it be that you're not just

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.640 
whatever it be that you're not just
making<00:01:48.210> breakeven<00:01:49.140> place<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.560> you're

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
making breakeven place that you're

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.000 
making breakeven place that you're
actually<00:01:49.830> making<00:01:50.130> profitable<00:01:50.820> plays<00:01:51.950> so<00:01:52.950> to

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
actually making profitable plays so to

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.560 
actually making profitable plays so to
solve<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.700> pull<00:01:53.970> out<00:01:54.000> poker<00:01:54.360> stove

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
solve this we just pull out poker stove

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.560 
solve this we just pull out poker stove
plug<00:01:55.080> in<00:01:55.200> our<00:01:55.229> hand<00:01:55.530> or<00:01:55.740> did<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.520> then<00:01:56.940> we<00:01:57.210> just

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
plug in our hand or did and then we just

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.820 
plug in our hand or did and then we just
give<00:01:57.869> our<00:01:58.140> opponents<00:01:58.830> a<00:01:58.920> range<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.700> hands<00:01:59.880> so

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
give our opponents a range of hands so

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.230 
give our opponents a range of hands so
let's<00:02:01.830> just<00:02:02.040> run<00:02:02.250> worst-case<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.000> I'll<00:02:03.060> talk

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
let's just run worst-case and I'll talk

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.179 
let's just run worst-case and I'll talk
about<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:03.869> one<00:02:04.290> second<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.770> may<00:02:04.920> totally

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
about this in one second you may totally

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.010 
about this in one second you may totally
disagree<00:02:05.729> with<00:02:05.760> this<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.240> actually<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.510> do<00:02:06.630> too

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
disagree with this and actually I do too

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.839 
disagree with this and actually I do too
but<00:02:07.770> just<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.159> you<00:02:08.250> know<00:02:08.369> what<00:02:08.519> this<00:02:08.670> looks

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
but just so you know what this looks

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.880 
but just so you know what this looks
like<00:02:09.030> against<00:02:09.479> pretty<00:02:09.869> much<00:02:10.080> another<00:02:10.439> ange

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
like against pretty much another ange

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.380 
like against pretty much another ange
notice<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.490> we<00:02:11.610> don't<00:02:11.819> have<00:02:12.000> anywhere

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
notice that we don't have anywhere

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.890 
notice that we don't have anywhere
here<00:02:12.510> enough<00:02:12.720> equity<00:02:13.460> now<00:02:14.460> I<00:02:14.790> said<00:02:15.390> as<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.750> was

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
here enough equity now I said as I was

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.510 
here enough equity now I said as I was
doing<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.440> this<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.770> an<00:02:17.069> incorrect

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
doing this that this is an incorrect

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.180 
doing this that this is an incorrect
range<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:18.990> wouldn't<00:02:19.350> say<00:02:19.590> it<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.890> for<00:02:20.160> a

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
range and I wouldn't say it is for a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.850 
range and I wouldn't say it is for a
couple<00:02:20.430> reasons<00:02:20.459> one<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.480> this<00:02:22.200> person<00:02:22.620> does

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
couple reasons one is this person does

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.040 
couple reasons one is this person does
have<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.160> three<00:02:23.490> bet<00:02:23.640> percentage<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.569> because

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
have a three bet percentage so because

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.320 
have a three bet percentage so because
they<00:02:25.230> do<00:02:25.290> in<00:02:25.650> fact<00:02:25.950> three<00:02:26.340> bet<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.850> makes<00:02:27.120> me

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
they do in fact three bet it makes me

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.550 
they do in fact three bet it makes me
think<00:02:27.569> that<00:02:27.630> they're<00:02:27.810> probably<00:02:27.990> gonna<00:02:28.260> three

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
think that they're probably gonna three

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.440 
think that they're probably gonna three
bet<00:02:28.770> some<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.190> their<00:02:29.370> strong<00:02:29.610> stuff<00:02:30.000> most

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
bet some of their strong stuff most

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.480 
bet some of their strong stuff most
likely<00:02:30.720> things<00:02:31.140> like<00:02:31.320> aces<00:02:31.680> kings<00:02:31.890> queens<00:02:32.160> Ace

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
likely things like aces kings queens Ace

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.360 
likely things like aces kings queens Ace
King<00:02:32.760> unless<00:02:33.720> he<00:02:34.050> can<00:02:34.230> really<00:02:34.530> really<00:02:34.980> put<00:02:35.220> us

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
King unless he can really really put us

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.880 
King unless he can really really put us
on<00:02:35.610> being<00:02:36.330> an<00:02:36.540> aggressive<00:02:36.720> squeezer<00:02:37.290> it's

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
on being an aggressive squeezer it's

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.710 
on being an aggressive squeezer it's
unlikely<00:02:38.340> in<00:02:38.580> my<00:02:38.670> opinion<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.150> he<00:02:39.270> flats<00:02:39.570> a

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
unlikely in my opinion that he flats a

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.750 
unlikely in my opinion that he flats a
lot<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:40.020> this<00:02:40.140> stuff<00:02:40.350> he<00:02:40.980> does<00:02:41.220> have<00:02:41.459> a<00:02:41.489> three

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
lot of this stuff he does have a three

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.300 
lot of this stuff he does have a three
bet<00:02:41.940> percentage<00:02:42.420> he<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.930> running<00:02:43.310> fishing

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
bet percentage he is running fishing

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.340 
bet percentage he is running fishing
numbers<00:02:44.670> but<00:02:44.940> definitely<00:02:45.390> not<00:02:45.480> super<00:02:45.870> passive

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
numbers but definitely not super passive

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.250 
numbers but definitely not super passive
fishy<00:02:46.620> so<00:02:47.520> I<00:02:47.910> don't<00:02:48.270> really<00:02:48.480> think<00:02:48.600> that<00:02:49.050> he's

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
fishy so I don't really think that he's

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.560 
fishy so I don't really think that he's
going<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.950> show<00:02:50.550> up<00:02:50.790> with<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.060> lot<00:02:51.300> of<00:02:51.330> his

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
going to show up with a lot of his

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.840 
going to show up with a lot of his
strong<00:02:51.870> stuff<00:02:52.200> which<00:02:52.440> means<00:02:52.650> I<00:02:53.130> think<00:02:53.489> that

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
strong stuff which means I think that

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.840 
strong stuff which means I think that
when<00:02:54.300> he<00:02:54.450> decides<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:54.989> call<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:56.160> open<00:02:56.700> raise

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
when he decides to call the open raise

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.949 
when he decides to call the open raise
in<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.180> first<00:02:57.420> place

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
in the first place

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.810 
in the first place
I<00:02:57.989> think<00:02:58.650> more<00:02:58.830> often<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.280> not<00:02:59.400> that's<00:02:59.670> going

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
I think more often and not that's going

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.640 
I think more often and not that's going
to<00:02:59.880> be<00:03:00.000> things<00:03:00.239> like<00:03:00.390> set<00:03:00.810> mine<00:03:00.989> sooty

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
to be things like set mine sooty

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.770 
to be things like set mine sooty
connectors<00:03:02.130> may<00:03:02.610> be<00:03:02.670> some<00:03:02.940> ACE<00:03:03.269> Queenie's

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
connectors may be some ACE Queenie's

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.680 
connectors may be some ACE Queenie's
jacking<00:03:04.260> queen<00:03:04.560> type<00:03:04.860> stuff<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.940> if<00:03:06.269> we<00:03:06.420> run

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
jacking queen type stuff and if we run

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.110 
jacking queen type stuff and if we run
our<00:03:07.100> range<00:03:08.100> against<00:03:08.550> something<00:03:08.700> like<00:03:08.910> that

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
our range against something like that

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.080 
our range against something like that
let's<00:03:09.390> say<00:03:09.860> fully<00:03:10.860> squeen<00:03:11.370> ace<00:03:11.760> Jack<00:03:12.060> suited

now what if it's a little bit different
let's<00:03:32.160> take<00:03:32.430> out<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.880> ace<00:03:33.209> queen<00:03:33.600> let's<00:03:34.049> put

let's take out the ace queen let's put

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.710 
let's take out the ace queen let's put
in<00:03:34.709> just<00:03:35.100> a<00:03:35.250> couple<00:03:35.430> combos<00:03:35.940> of<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.329> let's

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
in just a couple combos of that let's

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.539 
in just a couple combos of that let's
give<00:03:37.019> him<00:03:37.290> well<00:03:37.590> maybe<00:03:37.799> some<00:03:38.010> jacks<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.489> tens

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
give him well maybe some jacks and tens

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.430 
give him well maybe some jacks and tens
maybe<00:03:39.180> he<00:03:39.329> didn't<00:03:39.540> three<00:03:39.810> about<00:03:39.959> that<00:03:40.170> and

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
maybe he didn't three about that and

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.680 
maybe he didn't three about that and
let's<00:03:40.560> take<00:03:40.829> out<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.190> CD<00:03:41.640> connector<00:03:42.060> see<00:03:42.570> how

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
let's take out the CD connector see how

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.390 
let's take out the CD connector see how
we<00:03:42.750> do<00:03:43.049> I<00:03:43.350> notice<00:03:43.799> that<00:03:43.920> we're<00:03:44.100> still<00:03:44.280> doing

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
we do I notice that we're still doing

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.020 
we do I notice that we're still doing
just<00:03:44.880> just<00:03:45.150> fine<00:03:45.860> so<00:03:46.860> notice<00:03:47.190> that<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.459> am<00:03:47.579> again

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
just just fine so notice that I am again

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.449 
just just fine so notice that I am again
being<00:03:48.269> very<00:03:48.390> linear<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:49.140> logical<00:03:49.620> what<00:03:50.250> kind

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
being very linear and logical what kind

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.520 
being very linear and logical what kind
of<00:03:50.519> range<00:03:50.700> did<00:03:51.030> he<00:03:51.150> call<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.870> open<00:03:52.140> raise<00:03:52.290> with

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
of range did he call the open raise with

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.770 
of range did he call the open raise with
what<00:03:52.799> kind<00:03:52.980> of<00:03:53.010> range<00:03:53.190> would<00:03:53.340> he<00:03:53.459> shove<00:03:54.120> here

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
what kind of range would he shove here

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.490 
what kind of range would he shove here
and<00:03:55.160> even<00:03:56.160> if<00:03:56.370> we<00:03:56.489> take<00:03:56.730> say<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.120> range<00:03:57.600> give<00:03:58.380> or

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
and even if we take say a range give or

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.069 
and even if we take say a range give or
take<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:58.860> is<00:03:59.040> very<00:03:59.700> very<00:03:59.940> weighted<00:04:00.420> towards

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
take that is very very weighted towards

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.530 
take that is very very weighted towards
those<00:04:01.380> decent<00:04:02.280> pairs<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:03.090> are<00:04:03.180> obviously

the<00:04:58.690> big<00:04:58.870> hand<00:04:59.080> saying<00:04:59.409> he's<00:04:59.650> king<00:05:00.039> or<00:05:00.340> say<00:05:00.610> a

pocket queens or pocket kings I

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:04.320 
pocket queens or pocket kings I
definitely<00:05:03.490> want<00:05:03.610> to<00:05:03.639> note<00:05:03.819> that<00:05:03.849> as<00:05:04.150> well

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
definitely want to note that as well

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.270 
definitely want to note that as well
that<00:05:04.360> he<00:05:04.659> doesn't<00:05:05.050> automatically<00:05:05.740> three<00:05:06.099> bet

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
that he doesn't automatically three bet

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.909 
that he doesn't automatically three bet
those<00:05:06.460> hands<00:05:06.759> preflop<00:05:07.270> obviously<00:05:08.199> as<00:05:08.319> he<00:05:08.740> will

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
those hands preflop obviously as he will

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:10.860 
those hands preflop obviously as he will
three<00:05:09.190> bathin<00:05:09.460> most<00:05:09.639> the<00:05:09.789> time<00:05:10.000> but<00:05:10.270> that<00:05:10.449> he

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
three bathin most the time but that he

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.020 
three bathin most the time but that he
doesn't<00:05:11.139> automatically<00:05:11.680> do<00:05:11.949> it<00:05:12.099> and<00:05:12.400> a<00:05:12.819> big

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
doesn't automatically do it and a big

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.309 
doesn't automatically do it and a big
part<00:05:13.180> of<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.300> reason<00:05:13.509> why<00:05:13.599> I<00:05:13.630> did<00:05:13.930> look<00:05:14.139> at<00:05:14.289> his

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:14.319 
part of the reason why I did look at his

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.830 
part of the reason why I did look at his
three<00:05:14.710> bet<00:05:14.860> percentage<00:05:15.280> preflop<00:05:15.729> was<00:05:16.539> really

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
three bet percentage preflop was really

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.779 
three bet percentage preflop was really
to<00:05:16.930> get<00:05:17.080> an<00:05:17.169> idea<00:05:17.440> if<00:05:17.770> he's<00:05:17.919> likely<00:05:18.250> to<00:05:18.430> three

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
to get an idea if he's likely to three

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.640 
to get an idea if he's likely to three
bet<00:05:19.000> hands<00:05:19.330> like<00:05:19.509> aces<00:05:19.780> kings<00:05:20.050> queens<00:05:20.289> ace

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
bet hands like aces kings queens ace

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.290 
bet hands like aces kings queens ace
king<00:05:20.949> the<00:05:21.490> more<00:05:21.699> I<00:05:21.729> think<00:05:21.849> he's<00:05:22.060> going<00:05:22.210> to

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
king the more I think he's going to

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.450 
king the more I think he's going to
three<00:05:22.479> about<00:05:22.599> those<00:05:22.870> means<00:05:23.740> the<00:05:24.009> more<00:05:24.250> than

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
three about those means the more than

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.860 
three about those means the more than
his<00:05:24.550> flat<00:05:24.849> car<00:05:25.090> range<00:05:25.360> is<00:05:25.539> a<00:05:25.569> little<00:05:25.780> bit

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
his flat car range is a little bit

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.600 
his flat car range is a little bit
weaker<00:05:26.199> and<00:05:26.469> obviously<00:05:26.889> the<00:05:27.039> happier<00:05:27.430> I<00:05:27.490> am

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
weaker and obviously the happier I am

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.939 
weaker and obviously the happier I am
stacking<00:05:28.060> it<00:05:28.330> off<00:05:28.449> in<00:05:28.690> this<00:05:28.840> spot<00:05:29.050> once<00:05:29.800> he
