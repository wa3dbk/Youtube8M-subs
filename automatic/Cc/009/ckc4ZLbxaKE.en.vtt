would<00:01:47.120> suggest<00:01:47.300> this<00:01:47.990> one<00:01:48.440> why<00:01:50.140> because<00:01:51.140> if

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
would suggest this one why because if

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.640 
would suggest this one why because if
you<00:01:51.470> go<00:01:51.680> this<00:01:51.860> one<00:01:52.190> is<00:01:52.420> is<00:01:53.420> it<00:01:53.810> small<00:01:54.320> tiny

difference between you know a thousand
99<00:01:57.760> 1199<00:01:58.760> you<00:01:59.659> get<00:01:59.810> faster<00:02:00.229> processor<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.300> of

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
99 1199 you get faster processor and of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.710 
99 1199 you get faster processor and of
course<00:02:02.750> a<00:02:03.110> problem<00:02:03.890> fast<00:02:04.190> processor<00:02:05.150> you've

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
course a problem fast processor you've

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.259 
course a problem fast processor you've
got<00:02:05.870> lots<00:02:06.140> of<00:02:06.350> screen<00:02:06.740> you<00:02:07.340> got<00:02:07.550> longer<00:02:07.850> live

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
got lots of screen you got longer live

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.330 
got lots of screen you got longer live
for<00:02:08.299> the<00:02:08.599> battery<00:02:08.929> this<00:02:09.049> one<00:02:09.170> gives<00:02:09.379> 25<00:02:09.889> hours

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
for the battery this one gives 25 hours

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.050 
for the battery this one gives 25 hours
and<00:02:10.579> 57<00:02:11.269> hours<00:02:11.389> and<00:02:11.840> of<00:02:12.409> course

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
and 57 hours and of course

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.089 
and 57 hours and of course
few<00:02:13.360> people<00:02:13.540> are<00:02:13.870> aware<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:14.260> this<00:02:14.530> for<00:02:14.980> this

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
few people are aware of this for this

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.520 
few people are aware of this for this
one<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.370> get<00:02:15.580> larger<00:02:16.030> trackpad<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:17.349> can

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
one you get larger trackpad you can

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.860 
one you get larger trackpad you can
launch<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.890> glass<00:02:18.250> multi-touch<00:02:18.910> trackpad<00:02:19.120> so

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
launch the glass multi-touch trackpad so

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.620 
launch the glass multi-touch trackpad so
it's<00:02:20.050> much<00:02:20.290> easier<00:02:20.470> if<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.910> have<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.060> big<00:02:22.360> hand

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
it's much easier if you have a big hand

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.059 
it's much easier if you have a big hand
it's<00:02:23.560> easier<00:02:24.099> to<00:02:24.310> do<00:02:24.400> multi-touch<00:02:24.940> gesture

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
it's easier to do multi-touch gesture

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.920 
it's easier to do multi-touch gesture
okay<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:28.420> i<00:02:28.690> would<00:02:29.530> suggest<00:02:30.480> if<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:31.630> want<00:02:31.810> to

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
okay so i would suggest if you want to

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.500 
okay so i would suggest if you want to
buy<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.170> new<00:02:32.500> macbook<00:02:32.890> air<00:02:34.830> 2012<00:02:35.830> i<00:02:36.510> would

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
buy the new macbook air 2012 i would

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.430 
buy the new macbook air 2012 i would
suggest<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:39.160> one<00:02:40.769> 1199<00:02:42.540> 1100<00:02:43.540> I<00:02:43.720> would<00:02:44.319> not

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
suggest this one 1199 1100 I would not

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.979 
suggest this one 1199 1100 I would not
urge<00:02:44.560> anyone<00:02:44.890> because<00:02:45.160> this<00:02:45.340> one<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:46.750> one
