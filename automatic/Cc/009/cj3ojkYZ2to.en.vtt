00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you're not gonna need a lot of pins but

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.099 
you're not gonna need a lot of pins but
you<00:00:59.609> know<00:00:59.699> everyone<00:00:59.969> someone<00:01:00.210> beginner<00:01:00.840> might

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
you know everyone someone beginner might

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.319 
you know everyone someone beginner might
break<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.530> might<00:01:01.680> break<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.070> pin<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.489> it

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
break you might break the pin and it

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.570 
break you might break the pin and it
comes<00:01:03.660> out<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.290> kind<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.710> clicks<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.250> it's<00:01:05.430> kind

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
comes out it kind of clicks in it's kind

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.710 
comes out it kind of clicks in it's kind
of<00:01:05.610> like<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.939> got<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> little<00:01:06.510> like<00:01:08.720> mechanism

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
of like a got a little like mechanism

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.410 
of like a got a little like mechanism
that<00:01:09.840> little<00:01:10.110> spring<00:01:10.439> load<00:01:10.650> Taipa<00:01:11.130> like<00:01:11.939> clip

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
that little spring load Taipa like clip

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.810 
that little spring load Taipa like clip
that<00:01:12.840> holds<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.320> there<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:14.430> then<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.670> can

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
that holds it in there but then you can

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.399 
that holds it in there but then you can
turn<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.119> around<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.659> break<00:01:15.869> one<00:01:16.020> side<00:01:16.259> you

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
turn it around if you break one side you

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.020 
turn it around if you break one side you
turn<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.710> around<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.009> other<00:01:17.100> side<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.580> it

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
turn it around to the other side and it

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.580 
turn it around to the other side and it
comes<00:01:18.180> with<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> replaceable<00:01:18.840> one<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.500> you

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
comes with a replaceable one so that you

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.840 
comes with a replaceable one so that you
got<00:01:19.740> another<00:01:19.979> one<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.340> got<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> total<00:01:20.790> of

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
got another one so you got a total of

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.149 
got another one so you got a total of
four<00:01:20.909> pins<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.570> goes<00:01:21.720> into<00:01:21.900> one<00:01:22.140> tool<00:01:22.380> so

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
four pins it goes into one tool so

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.890 
four pins it goes into one tool so
you're<00:01:23.640> automatically<00:01:24.270> getting<00:01:24.600> a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
you're automatically getting a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.100 
you're automatically getting a
replacement<00:01:25.409> pin<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.430> comes<00:01:26.670> with<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.110> put

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
replacement pin that comes with it put

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.300 
replacement pin that comes with it put
that<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.439> know<00:01:28.530> what<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.680> would<00:01:28.829> recommend<00:01:28.920> I

else maybe like a piece of tie wrap or
something<00:01:41.820> right<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.090> here<00:01:42.270> it'd<00:01:42.570> be<00:01:42.659> nice<00:01:42.840> if

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
something right in here it'd be nice if

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
able to hold this bear pit but you get

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.999

alright<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.090> chain<00:01:48.600> tool<00:01:48.869> here<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.320> go<00:01:49.470> this

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
alright so chain tool here we go this

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.899 
alright so chain tool here we go this
happens<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.009> be<00:01:50.070> an<00:01:50.189> eight-speed<00:01:50.549> piece<00:01:50.790> of

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
happens to be an eight-speed piece of

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.370 
happens to be an eight-speed piece of
chain<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.329> got<00:01:51.479> here<00:01:51.659> you're<00:01:52.049> gonna<00:01:52.229> line

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
chain that I got here you're gonna line

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.920 
chain that I got here you're gonna line
it<00:01:52.409> up<00:01:52.590> right<00:01:52.649> in<00:01:52.829> there<00:01:53.100> now<00:01:53.490> now<00:01:53.820> hold<00:01:54.720> this

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
it up right in there now now hold this

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.749 
it up right in there now now hold this
down<00:01:55.200> with<00:01:55.470> your<00:01:55.590> thumb<00:01:55.920> right<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.219> here<00:01:56.610> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
make sure that you line the pin up right

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.620 
make sure that you line the pin up right
in<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.250> middle<00:02:02.520> if<00:02:02.759> you're<00:02:02.880> not<00:02:03.090> quite<00:02:03.390> there

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
you gotta turn into a watchmaker a

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.370 
you gotta turn into a watchmaker a
little<00:02:06.090> bit<00:02:06.240> boom

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
little bit boom

you're looking good and then you're

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.850 
you're looking good and then you're
gonna<00:02:09.330> start<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.660> twister<00:02:10.229> on<00:02:10.289> through<00:02:10.709> you

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
gonna start to twister on through you

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.199 
gonna start to twister on through you
can<00:02:11.009> see<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.370> starting<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.700> push<00:02:11.970> out<00:02:12.180> the

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
can see it's starting to push out the

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.570 
can see it's starting to push out the
pin

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.650 

and<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:15.700> starts<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.060> come<00:02:16.090> all<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.570> way

pin you gotta be careful now sometimes
Shimano<00:03:06.250> you<00:03:06.760> have<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.090> use<00:03:07.240> a<00:03:07.270> specific<00:03:07.630> pin

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
Shimano you have to use a specific pin

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.270 
Shimano you have to use a specific pin
for<00:03:09.220> Shimano<00:03:09.940> in<00:03:10.330> order<00:03:10.690> to<00:03:10.810> do<00:03:10.960> this<00:03:11.140> to<00:03:12.100> put

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
for Shimano in order to do this to put

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.190 
for Shimano in order to do this to put
the<00:03:12.370> pin<00:03:12.550> back<00:03:12.580> through<00:03:13.030> so<00:03:13.540> this<00:03:13.900> happens<00:03:14.170> to

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
the pin back through so this happens to

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.830 
the pin back through so this happens to
be<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.320> KMC<00:03:14.920> yeah<00:03:15.460> you<00:03:15.520> can<00:03:15.790> put<00:03:15.940> your<00:03:16.060> pin<00:03:16.240> put

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
be a KMC yeah you can put your pin put

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.229 
be a KMC yeah you can put your pin put
your<00:03:17.080> pin<00:03:17.980> right<00:03:18.160> through<00:03:18.459> a<00:03:18.670> lot<00:03:18.910> of<00:03:19.030> times

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
your pin right through a lot of times

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.729 
your pin right through a lot of times
you're<00:03:19.390> using<00:03:19.570> it<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:19.810> shorten<00:03:20.380> it<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.590> then

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
you're using it to shorten it and then

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.010 
you're using it to shorten it and then
you<00:03:20.860> would<00:03:20.920> use<00:03:21.100> a<00:03:21.130> quick<00:03:21.459> link<00:03:21.730> or<00:03:21.910> uh<00:03:21.970> hey

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
you would use a quick link or uh hey

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.330 
you would use a quick link or uh hey
yeah<00:03:23.290> that's<00:03:23.470> take<00:03:23.680> well<00:03:23.830> quick<00:03:24.040> links
