00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.910
 Here is the point that comes 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.330
 If it is a single digit 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:11.370

 Yoshimi degree of revenue and become another this three digits will go first 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:14.760
 The first act to withdraw from pain stimulation 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.760
 Once such Fu anti-added to the pain stimulus but is eye is not open 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.950
 It is 100's if you do 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.180
 3-200 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:31.569
 For pain stimulation

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:39.210
 Pain stimulation 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.210

 I And then it does not react with the become the other 3-300 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.650
 Zu' pain stimulus 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.650

 It is 300 's that does not react at all 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:14.050
 This is really already 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:18.280
 In the state of consciousness used often in practice 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:20.150
 Please remember the points there as it will be a measure 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.840

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.590
 State 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.860
 I think the point will be the point 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:53.370
