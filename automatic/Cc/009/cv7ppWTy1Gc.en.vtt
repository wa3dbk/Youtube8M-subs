Hello and welcome to SamsungMania.cz

00:00:03.724 --> 00:00:11.023
Samsung Galaxy W has got a new FW update, which we can call "Value Pack"

00:00:11.724 --> 00:00:24.023
Phone didn't get latest Android ICS, but has Android 2.3.6 with some added value and minor improvements.

00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:29.023
Let's look, what news this FW upgrade brings

00:00:29.724 --> 00:00:37.023
First change is vissible while unlocking, it is called Face unlock

00:00:37.724 --> 00:00:54.023
Samsung added blink recognition to ensure noone can unlock your phone with your photograph.

00:00:55.724 --> 00:01:06.023
I am going to try it now

00:01:06.724 --> 00:01:12.023
It is important to fit your head into prepared cut-out section, one blink and phone is unlocked.

00:01:12.724 --> 00:01:28.023
If your face is unknown, you can unlock phone the other way, which you have to set while registering four face.

00:01:29.724 --> 00:01:47.023
In Settings - Accessibility there is new option called Font Size. You can set it for calendar, contacts, memo and messages. 

00:01:47.724 --> 00:01:54.023
"Very big" is bigger than "normal", but don't expect some huge differences.

00:01:56.724 --> 00:02:04.023
Among other changes, there are new Apps - Google+, Google Books and Google Chat

00:02:07.724 --> 00:02:47.023
I find cellphone quite quick, image transitions are smoother, there is new lockscreen - to show it, I have to disable screen lock.

00:02:48.724 --> 00:02:57.023
Now we can see different animation while unlocking

00:02:57.724 --> 00:03:03.023
You can expect the same what you could expect with older FW version

00:03:04.724 --> 00:03:10.023
Update improves several functions and brings some minor improvements

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:15.023
It is officialy the final stage, Galaxy W can be in

00:03:15.724 --> 00:03:27.023
We expect no more updates for Galaxy W, ICS is for Galaxy W users inaccessible.

00:03:28.724 --> 00:03:32.023
Thanks for watching.
