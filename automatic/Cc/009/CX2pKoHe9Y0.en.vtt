with<00:01:56.960> it<00:01:57.850> or<00:01:58.850> else<00:01:59.030> it<00:01:59.960> will<00:02:00.110> dry<00:02:00.380> up<00:02:04.420> all<00:02:05.420> we

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
with it or else it will dry up all we

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.910 
with it or else it will dry up all we
need<00:02:05.750> is<00:02:05.960> just<00:02:07.479> little<00:02:08.479> tiny<00:02:09.020> dab<00:02:09.320> of<00:02:09.500> glue<00:02:09.619> not

need is just little tiny dab of glue not

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.900 
need is just little tiny dab of glue not
too<00:02:10.220> much<00:02:10.990> we'll<00:02:11.990> work<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.440> glue<00:02:12.650> around<00:02:13.340> on

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
too much we'll work the glue around on

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.140 
too much we'll work the glue around on
the<00:02:14.060> tip<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.830> we<00:02:16.010> have<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.310> be<00:02:16.460> quick<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:17.000> get

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
the tip and we have to be quick to get

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.240 
the tip and we have to be quick to get
it<00:02:17.270> centered<00:02:18.070> because<00:02:19.070> it<00:02:19.400> dries<00:02:19.670> really<00:02:19.850> fast

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
it centered because it dries really fast

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.010 
it centered because it dries really fast
now<00:02:22.250> we<00:02:22.310> are<00:02:22.610> going<00:02:22.850> to<00:02:22.940> file<00:02:23.180> down<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.510> edges

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.630 

and<00:02:27.020> we're<00:02:27.320> using<00:02:27.530> a<00:02:27.770> grinder<00:02:28.190> but<00:02:28.370> you<00:02:28.460> can

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
and we're using a grinder but you can

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.550 
and we're using a grinder but you can
use<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:29.000> exacto<00:02:29.450> knife<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.810> cut<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.080> down<00:02:30.260> or

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
use the exacto knife to cut it down or

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:47.270 
use the exacto knife to cut it down or
any<00:02:31.490> other<00:02:31.700> tip<00:02:32.570> cutting<00:02:32.960> tools

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.160 

now<00:02:48.280> we're<00:02:48.459> using<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.909> very<00:02:49.090> light<00:02:50.340> brillo<00:02:51.340> pad

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
now we're using a very light brillo pad

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:00.270 
now we're using a very light brillo pad
to<00:02:53.170> clean<00:02:53.379> up<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.799> edges<00:02:56.250> clean<00:02:57.250> up<00:02:59.280> that's

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
to clean up the edges clean up that's

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.050 
to clean up the edges clean up that's
clean<00:03:00.640> we're<00:03:00.909> going<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.120> reseal<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:03.190> wood<00:03:03.489> and

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
clean we're going to reseal the wood and

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.619 
clean we're going to reseal the wood and
burnish<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.690> edges<00:03:05.049> of<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.319> tip<00:03:05.530> so<00:03:05.560> that

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
burnish the edges of the tip so that

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.009 
burnish the edges of the tip so that
doesn't<00:03:07.629> create<00:03:07.930> any<00:03:08.140> mushrooming<00:03:09.750> since<00:03:10.750> we

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
doesn't create any mushrooming since we

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.880 
doesn't create any mushrooming since we
are<00:03:11.140> using<00:03:11.319> a<00:03:11.620> soft<00:03:11.860> tip<00:03:16.319> and<00:03:17.319> now<00:03:17.560> we're<00:03:17.739> going

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
are using a soft tip and now we're going

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
are using a soft tip and now we're going
to<00:03:17.950> use<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.989> piece<00:03:19.989> of<00:03:20.019> leather<00:03:20.349> to<00:03:20.739> burnish<00:03:21.670> the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
to use a piece of leather to burnish the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.050 
to use a piece of leather to burnish the
edges<00:03:22.769> and<00:03:23.769> that<00:03:23.950> seals<00:03:24.750> leather

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
edges and that seals leather

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:37.369 
edges and that seals leather
once<00:03:28.060> that's<00:03:28.299> done<00:03:29.040> all<00:03:30.040> we<00:03:30.280> have<00:03:30.459> to<00:03:30.609> do<00:03:30.790> is

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:48.589 

make<00:03:38.379> sure<00:03:38.410> that<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:38.980> leathers<00:03:39.340> rough
