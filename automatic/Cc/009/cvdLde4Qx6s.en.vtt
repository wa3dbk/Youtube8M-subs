00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Hello today I have been for a long time 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.940
 again the witch you and that 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.030
 just my monthly favorites from 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.200
 march or february and january because 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.030
 I've been fighting for so long 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.650
 Anyway, I still wanted you 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.299
 say that I was more happy 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.640
 so many of you hangout 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.320
 Been and gone through so many things 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.699
 have and the link of it is natural 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.010
 again in the infobox 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.760
 I love you and we catch right away 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.380
 on 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.510
 I thought we're just starting today 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.990
 times with fashion and although I have as 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.059
 first time this pullover by h &amp; m is 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.800
 this is a crap poly i have 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.920
 in my spring make-up and outfit 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.570
 shown video and yes I have so 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.739
 a lot you could think I have 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.600
 nothing else to watch because I 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.640
 the so often wear moment has faith 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.180
 i cost 15 euro at h &amp; m i like that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.649
 very 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.610
 the only problem is that the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.719
 sometimes pretty fast 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.520
 running mesh gets a bit stupid though 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.680
 that can be fixed again and again like that 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.620
 bit to picture and I have 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.860
 very much like combined with a skater 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.760
 it's also rock by h &amp; m and me 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.830
 I also have the heated ones are worn 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.630
 that is of course in the infobox where 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.909
 otherwise rather with zipper behind 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.520
 I just like it very much 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.500
 just comfortable and very chilly my 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.409
 favorite it was this month ago 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.820
 chain this chain is from primark and 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.369
 which has some pretty much everyone 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.759
 but I do not care because I love her 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.900
 and I have applied so 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.340
 now we come a little bit more 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.810
 in the field of beauty and there I have 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.210
 first my favorite care the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.400
 last month is the be more 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.100
 broad customers who in fact always 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.680
 in the evening after having a face 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.840
 make-up and so on and give it on and 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.329
 pampered moisturizer blog blog 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.409
 blog what you promise 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:51.780
 but I like her very much makes my 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.790
 house has a reputation instead of this 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.820
 have loved that month is that patrice 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.710

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.369
 apricot I wear this too today 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.130
 my cheeks 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.630
 I simply wore them a lot 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.880
 You probably already have mask in 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.569
 my top 5 drug products video 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.069
 seen that it is the line 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.230
 can volume express mascara in 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.090
 waterproof mascara what madness like 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.769
 has the momentum and whenever I wear it 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.629
 she even two-tiered with one more 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.609
 another mascara of eating together the 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.099
 i really like this product here was one 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:24.439
 this small rescuer this month is the 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.510
 kts camouflage cream anyway all just 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:28.280
 time favorite actually because my skin 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.959
 rested moment right and I have 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.359
 children around us was that you see for 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.739
 luck in the camera not but there what 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.439
 with my skin completely out of trouble 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.510
 persuades redness and so and yes that is 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:40.090
 a small savior in need and have 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.489
 you can quickly cover very much 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.230
 and highly recommended and another 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.540
 little life saver this month was 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.699
 the fit with concealer from bailey den 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.230
 I really did that after I really did 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:53.510
 10 tomorrow the product has sneaked around 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.459
 for half a year already I have 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.569
 bought me and I'm from something 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.680
 satisfied because i have a concealer 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.389
 wanted because I hold mine too 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.189
 I can sleep with dark circles 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:03.530
 Not much, that's why it comes to me 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:07.069
 just right the dect really good 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.230
 that lasts a long time I would say and that 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.060
 simply does not slip back and forth are 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.409
 you what i mean that just looks in 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.639
 order and that's what I like best 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:18.709
 with the lever in uk together or with so 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:19.970
 a concealer left it went very well 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.459
 well i always do not have these things 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.930
 liked but meanwhile I find the 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.909
 pretty cool because it makes you real 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.699
 distribute well and with that I have that 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.439
 always applied what I last 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:34.129
 have loved these months very much 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:35.840
 wholegrain patties from aldi bio has 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.699
 not one of you against aldi talk 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.379
 they are available in many varieties and 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:42.409
 I really like the taste 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:44.419
 Otherwise, I'm not that on the trip 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.859
 but actually the subjects so tasty with 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.870
 a bit of vegetables or salad and 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.009
 they are really full so you can 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.840
 like to try tasting very very 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:52.040

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.579

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.579
 held 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.030
 Now I have a few youtubers 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:01.129

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.500
 But I know that I like very much, for example 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:06.439

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.780

 look at it 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.680
 and then I looked at him and was 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.510
 really baff the guy has so horny music 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.960
 and I just like that 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:02.090
 really really like and the 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.770
 music videos are just great so the 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.630
 Quality is really good and good 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.880
 I can heartily like you 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.470
 I really like my favorite app for 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.990
 I'll show you this month too 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.850
 again immediately and that is called the app 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:18.920
 I want to show you square rallye 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:20.840
 I'll just open it up and 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.550
 this just because that if you 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.710
 want to upload instagram picture 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.600
 and that is not in the lot of format 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.050
 then you can just picture yourself 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.050
 choose 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.660
 I will take a week then sees 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.720
 that at the moment so that out 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.490
 wheat temples from my last hangout 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:49.990
 video and you can then just 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:52.539
 Select here and the whole thing easy 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.539
 suitable for the square format 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:57.160
 that's really handy and practical 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:00.539
 then you can just click here 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:03.070
 instagram and upload that directly 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:04.780
 He would recommend I do not have a filter too 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.550
 because otherwise it will be the same 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.370
 then ran animal becomes very funny 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:11.050
 and then you can just do that 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.300
 upload and you have a picture 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.160
 that is actually in the format but 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.900
 not really either and this app 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.430
 I think that's really practical and now 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.199
 can you tell me something? 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.280
 I could then become your favorite month 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.720
 maybe a little bit through me 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.490
 Test it if you have one or two good ones 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.780
 recommendation for me maybe you have too 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.300
 just something against my skin 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.039
 like to watch my live hangout 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.780
 if somehow nothing to do if 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:33.550
 that goes an hour or you look 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.900
 again my team hitec to the 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.419
 I hear you here next to me 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.560
 my shoulder and we are then 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:40.560
 he'll be back soon
