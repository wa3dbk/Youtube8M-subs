 you are super excited when you see the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.750
 title of the video right now because 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.900
 I will use the products of the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.200

 of bone crisis all products today 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.460
 I show how to make this look if it's 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.670
 not an atypical group that high schools have 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.480
 tendency to calmly and me 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.800
 it's really a different 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.660
 applications so I'm going to show you 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.149
 that there are plenty of ways that we can 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.649
 to wear these products there so if you are 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.250
 interested in learning how to complete 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.540
 this look here when we looked at 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.219
 start by applying the agreement the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.440
 most of the Christian I would say it's 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.710
 a rosy white wine very very pale but 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.719
 super quickly t he definitely can 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.309
 cry so I'm having fun everywhere on the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.140
 mobile eyelid I apologize it's a 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.219
 little bit blurry for now but it's going 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.219
 improve I swear to you 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.750
 then I calmly return 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.100
 quickly can be in the pale color of 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.570
 courtroom again and then I'm going to 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:12.030
 climb now in the hollow of the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:13.890
 eyelid to go to grow and 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.660
 lighten their throat applies his 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.110
 generously in the inner corner of 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.090
 the eye 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.260
 it's a tactic that I do almost 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.760
 in everything magnifying glass because I 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.760
 find a max to grow eyes 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.610
 then you used the second 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.900
 darkest color in the palette 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.850
 manage it's a purple gray 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.200
 I'm going to start defining the 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.729
 hollow of the eyelid but just a little 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.680
 higher so I would say that so it's 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.180
 here it's not necessarily a code 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.810
 crisis I would rather say it's a 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.720
 smoky crisis so really a color a 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.060
 pale semi base would say then I apply that 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.890
 with going back and forth on a right side 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.440
 left without necessarily going 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.320
 touching the outer points of the eye or 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.790
 if the application I go up a lot to 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.900
 start of my worry it's really a 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.009
 application that is perhaps not 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.380
 everyone but I really think that 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.380
 it gave me a je ne sais quoi to look 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.820
 as a transition color I'm going 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.399
 take the pink call peach color 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.590
 is a super nice color still nacry 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.480
 but it's so jhelil you go 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.500
 want you want to put not all these 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.500
 faces I swear 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.390
 there we are not there with the pac like 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.860
 we say in good Quebec I will go 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.150
 take the darkest color the 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.050
 palette is a plum color that's me 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.640
 reminds of shaded colors to 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.840
 eyelids that wadding had been there 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.630
 years of years years 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.740
 yes I am very very old I'll brief 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.320
 take a small brush then really to 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.670
 cut them out or dig the raw of my 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.990
 popular strength I could say because 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.300
 that these failures and her mum raw 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.070
 natural and then I really make sure 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.880
 faults applied on the outer corners 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.800
 and internal 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.970
 we leave without colors but really 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.100
 played at school goes up after the anthem is 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.430
 a lot of pigmentation in the crime to 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.430
 eyelids 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.510
 after with a very flared brush and 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.970
 as flashy as the games were going 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.290
 diffuse the color so swallowed smoke I 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.850
 will just make further movements of 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.170
 right on the left we really want 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.270
 defend either we do not want lines 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.900
 separate but saves me redefine 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.550
 line 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.990
 then and as can see right now 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.450
 also I will go to sureda them 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.680
 fumiters hours a little closer to the 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.450
 beginning of my fate so so just in 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.890
 below you have to go up the 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.150
 color as high you do not eat was going 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:27.170
 really for a lot anyway 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:28.220
 intense once it was difficult to 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.380
 color we miss the 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.210
 pigmentation so manage applies the 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.100
 color again the beautiful brunette 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.720
 this time I'm going with a brush a 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.850
 little bit more pointed but still very 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:43.040
 blurry girl so I still live the same 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:44.570
 movements that before I had to redefine 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.490
 the hollow of the eyelid 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.050
 this time applying the agreement the 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.070
 most is so pigmented 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.690
 some cases not to go art is 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.580
 applied just below will take 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.780
 really that's gonna come gobble up monf 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.780
 10-year flood of paper 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.020
 and yes I can not hide anything 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.490
 repeat the same steps i'm going to go 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.110
 take the darkest color 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.090
 this time with a brush a lot 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.130
 smaller I 'll see it really is 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.520
 apply it to the eyelid 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:16.740
 just for really intense is added 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.740
 of the dimension the friends the dimension 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.020
 so do not forget the 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.270
 lower and upper roots so 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.490
 never believe the darkest really 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.470
 still smoke enough and I think that 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.780
 Too much too defined but I want 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.419
 definitely go buy a runner 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.100
 at this point we go flush with the eyelashes 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.750
 inferior then I really got that 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.960
 a lot pigmentation especially in the 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.340
 lower outer corner like you I'm going 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.600
 say lower in the video that's to 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.630
 you from tales and tell me in the 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.630
 comments 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.550
 we take the pink peach color then 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.870
 joy to apply her under the color that 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.419
 do if it's gonna just really make a 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.940
 bond degrades y writes even more a look 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.100
 smoky another trick to awaken the 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.750
 look at using a pencil in the 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.190
 mucosa that is of a fleshy color or 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.910
 white today I'm with my 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.780
 graphic fat pencil from chez mac 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.009
 I wanted a little more 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.850
 definition on the flush of the eyelashes 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.430
 lower 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.410
 so I was applying a little black the 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.720
 velvet black color from among what i 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.639
 a site I return with my move 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.410
 just to really go smoke all 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.310
 alone that is not so intense but 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.310
 still quite dark 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.010
 now we take my favorite product 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.040
 from the collection I was going to take bloch 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.650
 agglo on the glos side the highlight pretty 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.780
 little under the eyebrow to raise 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.220
 still that's all I'm the piece 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.220
 in the inner corner of the eye 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:50.090
 then we go to the fossils that are 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:53.000
 totally optional three lots not but 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.300
 j right now three fossils on each 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.940
 eye 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.250
 so yes I like the drama ok we go to 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.630
 blush which for me a very color 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.250
 romantic I do not know why this is the 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.860
 word that comes to mind when I see 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:07.130
 this blush has it so I apply that on the 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.660
 cheekbones cheeks we finish cheeks 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.120
 with the highlight which is a color 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.199
 low stake because I had a 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.940
 highlight its colors in my kit 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:18.139
 before so I 'm very happy to have 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:20.289
 this duo there now at this moment you 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:22.490
 see poking their lip pencils 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:23.330
 waterproof she's what i in the 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.740
 natural color 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.120
 I will not lie to you now that 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.830
 I look at the look I think I do not 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.060
 I did not use them creating lips but 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.060
 short if what I'm doing right now 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.430
 at that moment I realized 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:39.050
 that the color was maybe a little 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.960
 too dark at my end so I was at 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.789
 usa teen with a lip and personal 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.159
 then I was applying some of my 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:52.129
 graphic novel canso at the student center 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:53.659
 to create a little more dimension and 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:55.490
 the cherry on the sundae it's 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:57.889
 the application of lipstick honda 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:00.520
 alex everywhere on my beautiful big 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:00.520
 lips 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:05.689
 so here it is here is the loft 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:07.759
 it's because we normally see it 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:10.909
 many countries alternating with 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:12.469
 accentuate on the outside finished you go out me 

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:14.509
 I exist he speaks instead I have 

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:16.939
 decided to redefine the flood of mapouka 

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:19.370
 but really not the outer side 

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:21.199
 so I get started when you can 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.819
 use these products we can hesitate 

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:23.870
 as you want me I should 

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:25.729
 out of the ordinary 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.789
 so I hope you liked to forget 

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:30.560
 not to go get friday alex are 

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:33.169
