00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.300
 thank you all know how to say 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.040
 here with a kids contest why how 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.780

 really very very warm and will give you 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.950

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.500

 the sims 3 starter pack for pc 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.140
 then I personally decided these 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.729
 titles because I find them among the most 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.860
 interesting of these three platforms 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.330
 for the moment and also embrace a 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.400
 little what my tastes are 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.810
 so if you don't like anyone 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.670
