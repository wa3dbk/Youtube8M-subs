00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.850
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.650
 new video today I want you 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.150
 explain how I flaming draw 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.350
 or to shine properly 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.470
 bring 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.480
 here i have the example of ebru you 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.850
 You may know Frauenkanal e-books 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.790
 beauty lounge and i want you today 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.640
 show we were properly stressed or 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.530
 small smile lines and then not 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.390
 with too strong lines or too weak 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.640
 line but that face really 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.469
 you get a right shape you have 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.829
 already quite good the comparison 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.680
 left side is already as good as finished 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.120
 and if the right side is here first 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.910
 not even see anything here 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.800
 Somehow funny and here is missing 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.810
 whole and if you're at the end of the videos 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.370
 See what that looks like then you will 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.070
 see what a difference that makes 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.440
 if not just eyes and mouth 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.890
 on the picture can be seen but also 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.590
 above all, so cheer small laugh lines 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.239
 that's all extremely important to the skin 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.780
 is most of the case with most 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.700
 women very very soft around that best 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.070
 I have panthers table 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.290
 Here I have the skin color I am waiting for 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.620
 hope that would be very burned bright 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.620
 his 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.810
 So I'm from some pastel sera 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.730
 burned raises and used one for it 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.470
 Eyeshadow applicator in it by one 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.660
 little bit of color not too much 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.890
 this here is not consuming what 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.990
 you see that is unfortunately for me 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.050
 erupted as it once down me 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.640
 but that's how it survived 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.980
 It does not take much of that 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.080
 namely our primer you know 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.790
 i use very very long paper though 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.300
 in that I am still soft pastel 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.950
 you will be able to go further 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.370
 everyone else hopes that cells 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.080
 to take 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.869
 we have to make sure that it stops 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.280
 unwilling Klumpp one on paper 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.740
 soft in the past too soft 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.140
 pastel taken other but panthers 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.380
 it clearly the most and on that 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.380
 best 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.850
 so if you did that, you need 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.230
 he does not care much either 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.420
 take care that they are always some 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.850
 blood &amp; honor also handles it 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.210
 nothing smeared and then I take 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:49.350
 here from polycom oz deep meat 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:51.530
 color keeps and starts simple 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.380
 all are not extremely bright 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:59.390
 just to paint and to prime 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.390
 then to layer the whole thing 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.510
 the first layer is've done so 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.570
 I stressed a bit of dollars because of it 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:36.180
 in general, the darker it gets 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:37.740
 next color and tim brown and now 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.780
 again the same game from the beginning 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.460
 Of course not at all places but 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.170
 really only the places you need 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.100
 and take care that you do not 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:50.070
 spotty will try all this too 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.610
 make that really even 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.610
 hinkriegt 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.220
 Of course, the whole thing goes on here, me 

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.610
 finish this at this point 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.110
 battery last for an hour 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:10.840
 the result may be interesting 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.160
 that likes to do the speed painting times 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.930
 take a closer look 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.940
 otherwise I would say that 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.140
 maybe even a tutorial in hair 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:22.480
 if that interests you 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:24.130
 write me the comments rated that 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.760
 video is commented and then we see 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.760
 us again next time
