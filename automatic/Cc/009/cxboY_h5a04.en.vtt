think i'd have leg our arms as legs

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.319 
think i'd have leg our arms as legs
because<00:04:17.060> then<00:04:17.299> I<00:04:17.419> can<00:04:17.479> like<00:04:17.630> have<00:04:18.139> four<00:04:18.530> arms

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
because then I can like have four arms

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.270 
because then I can like have four arms
but<00:04:20.329> then<00:04:20.419> i'd<00:04:20.539> also<00:04:20.720> have<00:04:21.049> four<00:04:21.409> legs<00:04:21.709> if<00:04:22.070> you

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
but then i'd also have four legs if you

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.999 
but then i'd also have four legs if you
turn<00:04:22.610> it<00:04:22.639> round<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.120> other<00:04:23.240> way<00:04:23.509> i<00:04:23.960> know<00:04:24.680> i

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:25.009 
turn it round the other way i know i

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.969
