00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 this is another idea now you see 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.930
 poor people like more gifts 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.000
 between them as soon as people 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.830
 they care about what you do when 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.550
 perceives the brightness of the 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.349
 your eyes 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.759
 and why are you interested? 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.619
 when it is possible to answer and 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.230
 to follow as soon as the purchase in the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.730
 identification then when you have to 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.740
 like what you do where the 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.000
 The machine you do when you talk in your 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.750
 service at your job you have to 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 shake 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.820
 You have to sweat other people. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.380
 They like to buy from winning people. 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.770
 I will not necessarily say people 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.100
 connect people is progressive people 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.440
 near the difference between the word 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.700
 winners the word sellers and only 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.079
 a letter 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.910
 now if you do not like to help 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.170
 people, do not you like to work with? 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.059
 sales does not matter 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.340
 you can be part of another group of 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.800
 sellers of winners or better you 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.460
 You have to work because you like to 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.620
 if working with sales is key 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.359
 Do you like what you like 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.520
 help people something else 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.920
 fundamental is also the conviction 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.750
 You have to believe what you 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.299
 do what you see you have to be the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.390
 first to buy their idea from their 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.070
 services the talent your product is there the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.630
 you invent if you do not have 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.960
 your client will realize the 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.659
 truth is always stronger do not have 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.400
 conviction of what you then you 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.320
 you have to believe in what you 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.610
 is now selling something else not 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.100
 just believe 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.020
 you have to be believed their 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.579

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.570
 when the customer arrives at the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.460
 for example he speaks so looks who has 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.509

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.939
