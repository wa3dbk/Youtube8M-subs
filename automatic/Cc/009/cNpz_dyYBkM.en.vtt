 in election year a promise repeats itself 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.899
 in S達o Paulo 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.780
 all the candidates guarantee that 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.849
 invested in the subway in recent years 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.790
 however the mesh grew only 1 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.500
 kilometer and a half a year in 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:20.730
 counterpart the single ticket and the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.090
 of charters dumped more passengers 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.160
 the three indices are three million and six hundred 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.349
 thousand trips a day with a camera 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.029
 hidden the newspaper Gazette leaked 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.120

 agglomeration reaches nine people per 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.430
 square meter double of the considered 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.680
 ideal 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.460
 I now see the reality in the subway of s達o 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.989
 paulo east of s達o paulo station 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.780
 corinthians itaquera 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.390
 It's seven and twenty in the morning and it's already 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.520
 Ratchet and I and the Fake Videographer 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.070
 bacelar we are two in the midst of thousands 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.250
 of passengers 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.890
 the second obstacle to enter the subway 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.120
 in the first station of the line the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.120
 wagon is already full 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:15.759
 the chance of training and each new season 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.119
 more people the door closes and opens several 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.119
 times 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.100
 the system is slow and the subway 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.780
 we stopped to wait for the move 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:39.060
 secret of day 5 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.060
 always the same influence in your home 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.390
 so I do not want you to take the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.390
 subway 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.250
 for a lot of people I did not know 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.840
 there the people 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:01.110
 S達o Paulo has 69 kilometers of lines 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.780
 subway stations that receive 3.6 million 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.560
 people per day at peak times 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.560
 thing gets ugly 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:19.900
 It's normal , Brazil came home from 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:22.480
 We only had to fight a lot and 17 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.300
 and we have not arrived yet, it 's all very much 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.890
 Tight and chat with passengers 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.890
 we started hearing the voices 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.710
 We came to know and to rush to get the 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.350
 on the blue line to paradise 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:51.060
 the view of the station is bleak and the 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.060
 people never stop arriving 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.189
 This is the queue to board the subway. 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.120
 comes many people come in and many 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:03.120
 they stay out 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.660
 the door does not close the employee has to 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.660
 give a fuck 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.940
 4 Be a partner 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:26.660
 already happened was that we arrived at the station 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.930
 paradise, the name seems ironic to this 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.930
 height 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.810
 our journey ends here on the avenue 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.390
 after almost two hours of the 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.129
 beginning there and flirting a day that is 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.549
 considered by the passengers themselves 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:56.769
 quieter since many people will 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.170
 work by car on Friday to 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.099
 go out at night or to travel after 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.750
 office hour 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.329
 according to the press office of the 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.849
 subway with the inauguration of the new 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:09.159

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:12.730
 distribution of passengers in the 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:16.260
 and consequently more comfort 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.260
