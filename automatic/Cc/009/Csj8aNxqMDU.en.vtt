00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:09.110
 Oops that nap and today I'm going to do a 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.160
 tutorial that will be very useful for 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.570
 who does serves as a series does not map 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.529
 adventure is not 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.089
 and will show that the result of this already 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:24.640
 once for who 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:24.640
 Who comes here for this purpose? 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:32.450
 good how are you seeing cnpc here 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:34.399
 all cute that I put because 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.350
 This is an adventure map that I am 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:41.899
 doing and a part of the adventure is 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.829
 consists of vines here to exchange with cnpc 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:49.640
 and how did I do it looks the person 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.159
 come on fishing fish something and trade 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.670
 This is going to be the game currency, right? 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:58.879
 score and she comes here swaps too 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.399
 I placed to be able to exchange food right up 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.250
 she needs it in the middle of the 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.439
 food and the main purpose that was a 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.070
 bucket that was to change a fish for a 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.130
 bucket 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.130
 I was fucking I took an egg was 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.530
 slashed and killed and did not know what time 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.960
 ia 2011 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.060
 So I just went to the internet for a premiere. 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.229
 I thought English and I thought it would be cool 13 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.829
 in Portuguese, what's this? 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:31.479
 how we will do this has 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.479
 here is a chest 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.100
 with this here is going to be the item that the 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.260
 person will give to the npc can be can 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.480
 use these two spaces 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.520
 this is going to be the item that mp goes 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:55.030
 Anyhow, I did it here. 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:02:00.300
 This one is ready and I think 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.300
 which has just one more nÃ© equal here too 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:12.130
 that 's good because I think it's this business 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.740
 very interesting because it will help 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.580
 just who is making an adventure map 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.950
 you can also have a serving kit type 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.660
 ah I do not want to put that shock 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.730
 I give you shopping I think it's ugly 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:31.240
 I think it's a good idea to do this. 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:35.430
 but the person will come will kill the cnpc 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:38.320
 Everyone there I tell you not this program 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.950
 that we use to make this little 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.739
 exchange inpc 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.870
 he leaves he thinks immortal of an obese 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:53.140
 You can hit him so much that you 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:56.890
 I wish he was going to die I 'm never there too 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.840
 in my serve person comes change opens more 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.810
 a space of exchange because we do not 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.480
 What if there is some exchange that 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.620
 so it can affect the Serbian economy 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.000
 between steels 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.700
 then this program has a feature 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.739
 he puts another trade with nothing 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.310
 here the person can not use the last one 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.650
 trade lot not open more and now I will 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.989
 to go to this program that goes such 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.400

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.500
 program very light I think not 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.050
 very fond of hannah indy processor and 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.550

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.520
 does not indicate the character was leaving me 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.040

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.260
