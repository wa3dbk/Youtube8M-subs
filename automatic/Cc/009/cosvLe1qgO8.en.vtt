00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:57.129 
could not be solved just by looking at
the<00:05:46.800> psychological<00:05:47.220> part<00:05:47.729> of<00:05:47.819> the<00:05:47.880> experience

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:57.139 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:59.540 

the<00:05:58.139> cognitive<00:05:58.650> science<00:05:59.009> platform<00:05:59.250> was<00:05:59.520> built

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
the cognitive science platform was built

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.080 
the cognitive science platform was built
and<00:06:00.180> I<00:06:00.330> think<00:06:00.590> we<00:06:01.590> accomplished<00:06:02.130> to<00:06:02.550> establish

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
and I think we accomplished to establish

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.390 
and I think we accomplished to establish
an<00:06:03.389> interdisciplinary<00:06:03.930> research<00:06:04.889> cluster

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
interested in cognitive in cognition and

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.550 
interested in cognitive in cognition and
cognitive<00:06:37.919> processes<00:06:38.780> but<00:06:39.780> of<00:06:39.990> course<00:06:40.349> only

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
cognitive processes but of course only

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.709 
cognitive processes but of course only
from<00:06:40.949> a<00:06:41.099> rather<00:06:41.520> limited<00:06:41.759> perspective<00:06:42.539> and

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:42.719 
from a rather limited perspective and

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:44.330 
from a rather limited perspective and
the<00:06:43.229> interesting<00:06:43.620> thing<00:06:43.800> about<00:06:43.830> cognitive

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
the interesting thing about cognitive

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.719 
the interesting thing about cognitive
science<00:06:44.880> is<00:06:45.030> that<00:06:45.780> if<00:06:46.319> we<00:06:46.590> add<00:06:46.740> some<00:06:47.580> other

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:47.729 
science is that if we add some other

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:49.370 
science is that if we add some other
disciplines<00:06:48.270> like<00:06:48.569> neuroscience<00:06:49.259> or

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
disciplines like neuroscience or

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.129 
disciplines like neuroscience or
philosophy<00:06:50.009> a<00:06:50.219> completely<00:06:51.210> new<00:06:51.389> space<00:06:51.780> of

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:52.139 
philosophy a completely new space of

philosophy a completely new space of
theories<00:06:52.949> and<00:06:53.280> possible<00:06:54.120> models<00:06:54.539> is<00:06:55.020> opening

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 
theories and possible models is opening

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:10.780 
theories and possible models is opening
up<00:06:55.590> and<00:06:55.800> that's<00:06:55.979> what<00:06:56.159> we're<00:06:56.310> interested<00:06:56.400> in
