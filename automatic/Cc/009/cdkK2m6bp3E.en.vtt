00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello dear friends with you bomb and 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.660
 today we will learn to set on 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.610
 mycraft fashion first 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.849
 actually you need the mod you 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.719
 want to install here you can download from 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:19.320
 any site that's dedicated to Maynkraft well 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.670
 and actually you, for example, downloaded the mod itself 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.470
 here I am, for example, downloaded a mod on fireworks 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.130
 first, let's go to the minecraft folder 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.239
 ben and let's open the minicrapt george using 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.059
 any archiver actually himself 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.620
 maykravt jar here contains all the important 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.360
 information for mycraft here and first 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.620
 queue need to delete folder 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.280
 meta-inf as it interferes with the work themselves 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.969
 mods here it is necessary to install 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.969
 modloader 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.780
 installation is just the most elementary need 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:05.220
 transfer files from the archive with the mod to 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:08.820
 the acre jar itself here is my gift set and 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:14.189
 for my own fashion is still needed 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.380
 mod audiomod here actually raven 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.909
 audiomod 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.799
 it may also be required for many 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.570
 other mods which are required 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:30.049
 reproduce so let's say no sounds from 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.049
 maynkrafta itself also carries 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:37.740
 audiomod is ready and now proper 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.540
 let's get to the very fashion of fireworks here 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.280
 there are mods that need 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.229
 install only in minecraft.jar then 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.869
 there is now for example my files are transferred 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:51.210
 everything is ready installed here as well 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.280
 there are files in which is present 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:59.009
 actually some more files more precisely 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.470
 folders for example here maykravt jesus urse 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.360
 be 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.420
 There are files that are necessary for 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.960
 the actual developers of this 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.320
 fashion 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.650
 Well, for others, if there is such 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:15.160
 here is for example a folder with minecraft that 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:23.160
 it means it is necessary to throw off itself 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:30.400
 select the folder is thrown and 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:37.470
 confirm the replacement of all the would I am now ready 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.470
 we run minecraft and check 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.080
 I am actually a client clean so I 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.080
 immediately create a new world 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:02.819
 here own appeared in the world 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:05.010
 generated and i actually forgot 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:09.829
 install toomanyitems 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:15.989
 sorry let's try again 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:17.969
 open the jar pen and install 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.669
 toomanyitems is actually a mod which 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:26.219
 allows you to give out fish and things in 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:38.189
 minecraft I completely forgot about him like that 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:40.139
 all set and check all 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:45.959
 proper toomanyitems installed and 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:51.209
 Now we are looking for this mod with fireworks 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:57.349
 so what is this server mod 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:57.349
 installed and check its work 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:08.180
 all mod set sounds have sounds 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.260
 Congratulations, you have installed a modic on a mairaft 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.340
 I hope you will no longer have this 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:21.890
 problems well and that's it with you 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:21.890
