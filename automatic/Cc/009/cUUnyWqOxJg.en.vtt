00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello my friends from youtube here I am 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.589
 to show you a how-to tutorial 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.719
 recycle our shoes when we have 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.420
 a special event and we do not have the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.969
 money to go buy some sandals 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.949
 new or a pair of new shoes and 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.369
 we want that at the same time combine with what 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.529
 we have put I had the delivery of 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.289
 certified a few days ago and for 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.109
 course I found myself in this predicament 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.779
 precisely and this is what I did 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.790
 I hope you like it and I leave a 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.770
 shows more or less how to do it 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.530
 for those who want to recycle their 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.809
 footwear good here I have a couple of 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.789
 sandals that I have already decorated in another 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:48.590
 opportunity these sandals are black 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:52.020
 the decorated with a few beads 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.719
 sequins some accessories in plastic 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.230
 shaped like stars and also 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.109
 some canutillos I have used yarn 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.730
 black color because the base itself is 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.979
 black color 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.840
 and I have also made the decoration in 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.970
 the back as to combine 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.070
 What I was looking for now is that 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.450
 sandals will be combined with 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.710
 this dress that is black and white 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.259
 remember that the sandals have already 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.720
 of itself a black background and what I have 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.630
 used is material that combines we have 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.810
 the tapes and that's how the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.540
 finished work 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.600
 these are the blank beads 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.390
 pearl here are the pearls that is 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.390
 which I have also used of course 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.329
 several needles because the material with the 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.220
 which we are working in half hard the 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.799
 thread as much as possible also make it 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.740
 reinforced and here I also have some 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.320
 white beads here I have already removed 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.259
 all the decoration previously 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.170
 used that was for an event that I 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:59.119
 I put a dress with those colors has 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.890
 the sandal was completely black and 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:07.670
 I have started to sew of course 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.540
 it is important to do it with care to 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.810
 that we do not hurt ourselves I repeat the material 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.120
 with which it is made is quite hard 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.650
 I have not used a very thick needle because 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.990
 I also did not want the material to remain 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.320
 marked and what I have tried to do in 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.510
 this opportunity is to do the sewing 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.540
 on the same stitching as you 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.690
 you can observe already has in itself the 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.440
 sandal and that way I have avoided 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.440
 having to force the hand too much and 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.750
 the fingers when sewing because I've 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:51.170
 stitched instead of sticking because it gives you another 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:54.230
 completion because I can also after 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.390
 when I want to change this cut 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.600
 simply the centuries and it will not be 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.690
 very damaged the material if I use a 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.820
 glue is different because after 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.180
 one when it releases the material it goes 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.860
 raising the base that we have then 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.730
 for that reason 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.830
 I have worked threading and sewing 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.160
 important 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:23.060
 that you also use the 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.980
 creativity in this type of work for 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.160
 according to what you want to put 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.320
 these materials are very cheap is for 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.840
 supposedly much cheaper than going to 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.060
 buy a pair of new sandals and the 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:39.260
 most important that we end up doing 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:42.860
 something unique that of course is not 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.820
 get in any store in the country in 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.610
 argentina a pair of new sandals you 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.500
 it costs half of what it is 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.480
 currently the minimum salary of 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.379
 any employee 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.510
 and you have to think about it well when you go 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.629
 and buy a pair of new sandals 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.530
 so what we have to do here is 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:08.239
 make the most of what is the 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.200
 recycled and of course also the 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:14.209
 originality of all this good and here 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.609
 As you can see , the work is already 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.669
 finished using a few ribbons 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.430
 It's not a lot of money that I've spent 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:26.240
 It has become or 50 pesos and I think 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.820
 I am exaggerating when in proportion a 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.919
 pair of new sandals are around 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:36.639
 of the 300 and the 700 thousand pesos you 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:41.600
 notice that I have spent very little 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:44.060
 between thread needle beads and 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.630
 supposed tape and in some sectors 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.940
 as my sandal and has years of being 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.880
 permanently recycled I've used 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.880
 also a little bit of glue in those 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.960
 sectors that are already wanting to get out 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.150
 or take off 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.009
 that has been all for now many 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.020
