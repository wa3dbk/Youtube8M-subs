00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
that there's a background on this one I

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.810 
that there's a background on this one I
did<00:00:20.670> end<00:00:21.000> up<00:00:21.119> doing<00:00:21.510> some<00:00:21.779> surgery<00:00:22.020> on<00:00:22.820> my

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
did end up doing some surgery on my

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.880 
did end up doing some surgery on my
Digimon<00:00:24.180> here<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.019> switched<00:00:25.439> out<00:00:25.619> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
Digimon here and I switched out the

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
Digimon here and I switched out the
normal<00:00:27.140> you<00:00:28.140> know<00:00:28.170> background<00:00:29.010> that's<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.699> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
normal you know background that's on the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.130 
normal you know background that's on the
nanos<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.529> stuck<00:00:32.239> this<00:00:33.239> background<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.930> I

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
nanos and stuck this background in I

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.990 
nanos and stuck this background in I
felt<00:00:34.770> rather<00:00:34.920> cheated<00:00:35.370> because<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> lot<00:00:35.969> of

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
felt rather cheated because a lot of

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.750 
felt rather cheated because a lot of
these<00:00:36.270> nano<00:00:36.780> dinos<00:00:37.230> do<00:00:37.440> actually<00:00:37.980> come<00:00:38.190> with<00:00:38.730> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
these nano dinos do actually come with a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.979 
these nano dinos do actually come with a
nice<00:00:38.969> background<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.890> this<00:00:40.890> one<00:00:41.040> didn't<00:00:41.250> and

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
nice background and this one didn't and

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.750 
nice background and this one didn't and
the<00:00:42.989> person<00:00:43.350> who<00:00:43.620> sold<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.129> me<00:00:44.309> on<00:00:44.430> eBay

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
the person who sold this to me on eBay

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.180 
the person who sold this to me on eBay
kind<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.809> showed<00:00:46.050> me<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.440> wrong<00:00:46.590> picture<00:00:46.829> kind

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
kind of showed me the wrong picture kind

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.450 
kind of showed me the wrong picture kind
of<00:00:47.280> lied<00:00:47.430> about<00:00:47.550> it

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
of lied about it

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.250 
of lied about it
so<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.879> know<00:00:51.000> whatever<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.629> works<00:00:52.020> really

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
so you know whatever it works really

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.720 
so you know whatever it works really
well

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
well

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.850 
well
so<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:54.449> decided<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.960> it's<00:00:55.440> not<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.680> big

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
so I just decided that it's not a big

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.410 
so I just decided that it's not a big
deal

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
deal

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.740 
deal
interestingly<00:00:58.379> enough<00:00:59.300> this<00:01:00.300> one<00:01:00.510> doesn't

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
interestingly enough this one doesn't

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.439 
interestingly enough this one doesn't
have<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.989> reset<00:01:01.410> button<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:02.210> don't<00:01:03.210> know<00:01:03.300> what

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
have a reset button I don't know what

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.870 
have a reset button I don't know what
happened<00:01:03.809> there<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.170> just<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.580> get<00:01:05.850> a

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
happened there I just have to get a

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.560 
happened there I just have to get a
q-tip<00:01:06.180> my<00:01:06.720> q-tip<00:01:08.090> but<00:01:09.090> he<00:01:09.210> would<00:01:09.299> call<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.510> a

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
q-tip my q-tip but he would call it a

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.170 
q-tip my q-tip but he would call it a
paperclip<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.670> take<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> end<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.090> and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
paperclip and take the end of it and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.700 
paperclip and take the end of it and
stick<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.479> down<00:01:12.600> there<00:01:12.659> all<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> way<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.500> push

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
stick it down there all the way and push

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.960 
stick it down there all the way and push
it<00:01:15.470> kinda<00:01:16.470> has<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.799> button<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.250> pops<00:01:17.460> up

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
it kinda has like a button that pops up

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.270 
it kinda has like a button that pops up
maybe<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.840> was<00:01:18.960> done<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.619> purpose<00:01:19.860> but<00:01:20.220> I

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
maybe that was done on purpose but I

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.179 
maybe that was done on purpose but I
really<00:01:20.490> don't<00:01:20.640> think<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:22.140> about<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
really don't think so and so about the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.609 
really don't think so and so about the
nano<00:01:23.369> Dino<00:01:23.670> anyway<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.330> really<00:01:25.200> really<00:01:25.439> like

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
nano Dino anyway I really really like

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.990 
nano Dino anyway I really really like
the<00:01:25.770> nano<00:01:25.979> Dino<00:01:27.259> you<00:01:28.259> know<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:29.189> very<00:01:29.880> very

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the nano Dino you know it it's very very

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.600 
the nano Dino you know it it's very very
different<00:01:30.420> compared<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.290> all<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.189> other<00:01:32.340> ones

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
different compared to all the other ones

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.960 
different compared to all the other ones
it<00:01:33.329> actually<00:01:33.780> has<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.700> distinction<00:01:35.700> between

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
it actually has a distinction between

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.690 
it actually has a distinction between
day<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.420> night<00:01:36.710> you<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.950> name<00:01:38.280> your<00:01:38.310> nano

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
day and night you can name your nano

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.289 
day and night you can name your nano
Dino<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.930> name<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.200> nano<00:01:40.380> baby<00:01:40.650> as<00:01:40.890> well

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
Dino you can name the nano baby as well

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.929 
Dino you can name the nano baby as well
but<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:43.009> think<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.130> one<00:01:44.280> does<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.549> pretty<00:01:44.729> well

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
but I think this one does it pretty well

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.160 
but I think this one does it pretty well
so<00:01:45.750> you've<00:01:45.960> got<00:01:46.110> your<00:01:46.200> food<00:01:47.899> so<00:01:48.899> right<00:01:49.049> now

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
so you've got your food so right now

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.980 
so you've got your food so right now
it's<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.860> know<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.220> meal<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.990> little

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
it's just you know the meal and little

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.620 
it's just you know the meal and little
drumstick<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.770> as<00:01:53.520> he<00:01:53.670> gets<00:01:53.790> older<00:01:53.970> he<00:01:54.149> starts

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
drumstick and as he gets older he starts

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.179 
drumstick and as he gets older he starts
eating<00:01:54.840> goats<00:01:55.110> that's<00:01:55.470> one<00:01:55.619> thing<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.950> saw<00:01:56.100> in

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
eating goats that's one thing I saw in

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.459 
eating goats that's one thing I saw in
the<00:01:56.250> packaging<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.119> as<00:01:57.420> he<00:01:57.659> aged<00:01:57.869> as<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
the packaging is it as he aged as the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.859 
the packaging is it as he aged as the
age<00:01:58.829> progresses<00:01:59.399> he<00:01:59.939> gets<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.390> different<00:02:00.540> meal

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
age progresses he gets a different meal

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.679 
age progresses he gets a different meal
plan<00:02:03.140> so<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.670> can<00:02:05.670> when<00:02:06.240> he<00:02:06.299> goes<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.509> sleep

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
plan so you can when he goes to sleep

it has a very different almost I think

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.690 
it has a very different almost I think
it's<00:03:56.940> is<00:03:57.060> more<00:03:57.239> like<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.450> Giga<00:03:57.690> pet<00:03:57.959> the<00:03:58.700> the

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
it's is more like a Giga pet the the

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.890 
it's is more like a Giga pet the the
index<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.510> then<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.050> menu<00:04:01.230> itself<00:04:02.750> you<00:04:03.750> can

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
index and then the menu itself you can

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.600 
index and then the menu itself you can
see<00:04:04.110> that<00:04:04.320> that<00:04:04.470> looks<00:04:04.769> a<00:04:04.860> lot<00:04:05.010> like<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.430> Giga

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
see that that looks a lot like the Giga

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.699 
see that that looks a lot like the Giga
pet<00:04:05.880> Giga<00:04:06.690> pet<00:04:07.670> so<00:04:08.670> they<00:04:08.820> they<00:04:09.030> did<00:04:09.440> take<00:04:10.440> a<00:04:10.500> new

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.910 

and<00:04:20.090> I<00:04:20.120> believe<00:04:20.360> this<00:04:20.540> game<00:04:20.750> takes<00:04:20.990> a<00:04:21.170> like<00:04:21.890> a

and I believe this game takes a like a
little<00:04:22.250> like<00:04:22.640> a<00:04:22.670> month<00:04:22.940> or<00:04:23.090> so<00:04:23.240> to<00:04:23.300> complete<00:04:25.210> so

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
little like a month or so to complete so

little like a month or so to complete so
you've<00:04:26.390> got<00:04:27.070> your<00:04:28.070> discipline<00:04:29.920> mm-hmm

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
you've got your discipline mm-hmm

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.430 
you've got your discipline mm-hmm
you're<00:04:31.790> hungry<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:32.540> you're<00:04:32.960> happy<00:04:34.630> and<00:04:35.630> this

you're hungry and you're happy and this

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.190 
you're hungry and you're happy and this
is<00:04:36.590> to<00:04:36.740> discipline<00:04:37.220> him<00:04:37.430> and<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:38.840> whole<00:04:38.990> fun

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
is to discipline him and the whole fun

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.410 
is to discipline him and the whole fun
of<00:04:39.230> this<00:04:39.470> is<00:04:39.620> just<00:04:39.800> seeing<00:04:39.980> him<00:04:40.220> develop<00:04:41.000> get

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
of this is just seeing him develop get

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.390 
of this is just seeing him develop get
bigger<00:04:42.400> his<00:04:43.400> face<00:04:43.640> changes<00:04:44.150> quite<00:04:44.330> a<00:04:44.390> bit

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
bigger his face changes quite a bit

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.160 
bigger his face changes quite a bit
which<00:04:46.400> I<00:04:46.520> do<00:04:46.580> like<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:47.720> thing<00:04:47.930> is<00:04:48.050> I've

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
which I do like the thing is I've

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.200 
which I do like the thing is I've
noticed<00:04:48.440> that<00:04:48.500> he's<00:04:48.680> a<00:04:48.710> lot<00:04:49.010> also<00:04:49.310> a<00:04:49.580> lot<00:04:49.910> more

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
noticed that he's a lot also a lot more

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.450 
noticed that he's a lot also a lot more
complicated<00:04:51.050> to<00:04:51.200> take<00:04:51.410> care<00:04:51.650> of<00:04:51.800> them<00:04:52.070> the

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
complicated to take care of them the

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.170 
complicated to take care of them the
other<00:04:52.760> nanos<00:04:53.180> he's<00:04:54.080> a<00:04:54.110> lot<00:04:54.320> more<00:04:54.500> demanding<00:04:55.180> I

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
other nanos he's a lot more demanding I

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.880 
other nanos he's a lot more demanding I
would<00:04:56.600> be<00:04:56.690> able<00:04:56.750> to<00:04:56.990> basically<00:04:57.140> neglect<00:04:57.740> my

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
would be able to basically neglect my

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.350 
would be able to basically neglect my
Nano<00:04:58.100> and<00:04:58.460> it<00:04:58.520> would<00:04:58.640> still<00:04:58.880> grow<00:04:59.030> up<00:04:59.120> and<00:04:59.270> be

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
Nano and it would still grow up and be

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.830 
Nano and it would still grow up and be
fine<00:04:59.570> it's<00:05:00.320> not<00:05:00.530> the<00:05:00.680> same<00:05:00.860> with<00:05:01.070> him<00:05:01.390> I<00:05:02.390> do

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
fine it's not the same with him I do

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.960 
fine it's not the same with him I do
like<00:05:03.140> the<00:05:03.290> beginning<00:05:03.650> animation<00:05:04.460> let's<00:05:04.850> see

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
like the beginning animation let's see

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.180 
like the beginning animation let's see
if<00:05:05.060> I<00:05:05.120> can<00:05:05.270> actually<00:05:05.390> show<00:05:05.690> that<00:05:05.720> to<00:05:06.110> you<00:05:06.200> when

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
if I can actually show that to you when

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.740 
if I can actually show that to you when
he's<00:05:07.310> hatching<00:05:07.460> it<00:05:07.820> actually<00:05:08.150> shows<00:05:08.720> a

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
he's hatching it actually shows a

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.510 
he's hatching it actually shows a
hatching<00:05:09.380> process<00:05:11.710> let's<00:05:12.710> see<00:05:13.040> do<00:05:13.220> I<00:05:13.250> have

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
hatching process let's see do I have

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:24.340 
hatching process let's see do I have
anything<00:05:13.850> that's<00:05:16.600> perhaps<00:05:17.600> sharp<00:05:18.590> enough<00:05:23.350> do

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
anything that's perhaps sharp enough do

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.720 
anything that's perhaps sharp enough do
i<00:05:24.410> or<00:05:25.100> do<00:05:25.280> I<00:05:25.310> not

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
i or do I not

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:41.080 
i or do I not
I<00:05:26.060> had<00:05:26.660> a<00:05:26.690> big<00:05:26.990> thing<00:05:35.620> all<00:05:36.620> right<00:05:40.030> all<00:05:41.030> right

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
I had a big thing all right all right

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:49.600 
I had a big thing all right all right
let's<00:05:41.690> do<00:05:41.840> this<00:05:46.720> yes<00:05:47.720> I<00:05:47.870> love<00:05:48.080> this<00:05:48.200> part<00:05:48.610> show

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
let's do this yes I love this part show

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:56.320 
let's do this yes I love this part show
so<00:05:49.880> it<00:05:50.030> shows<00:05:50.240> you<00:05:50.360> the<00:05:50.450> beginning<00:05:55.180> so<00:05:56.180> it

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:56.330 
so it shows you the beginning so it

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.530 
so it shows you the beginning so it
shows<00:05:56.600> the<00:05:56.630> egg<00:05:57.020> here<00:05:57.460> and<00:05:58.460> it's<00:05:58.610> exciting<00:05:58.970> and

00:05:59.530 --> 00:05:59.540 
shows the egg here and it's exciting and

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:05.470 
shows the egg here and it's exciting and
good<00:06:00.230> minute<00:06:00.560> or<00:06:00.680> so<00:06:00.860> to<00:06:00.890> hatch<00:06:03.940> yep<00:06:04.970> see

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.480 
good minute or so to hatch yep see

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.940 
good minute or so to hatch yep see
that's<00:06:06.020> basically<00:06:06.410> what<00:06:06.590> you<00:06:06.680> see<00:06:06.710> at<00:06:06.920> night

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
that's basically what you see at night

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.530 
that's basically what you see at night
before<00:06:07.250> he<00:06:07.490> goes<00:06:07.520> to<00:06:07.790> bed<00:06:07.910> and<00:06:07.970> then<00:06:08.270> you<00:06:08.360> see

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:08.540 
before he goes to bed and then you see

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.650 
before he goes to bed and then you see
that<00:06:08.570> it<00:06:08.780> turns<00:06:08.930> to<00:06:09.050> darkness<00:06:10.330> so<00:06:11.330> I<00:06:11.360> just

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
that it turns to darkness so I just

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.810 
that it turns to darkness so I just
really<00:06:12.110> really<00:06:12.500> like<00:06:12.680> the<00:06:12.950> detail<00:06:13.460> that<00:06:13.700> they

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
really really like the detail that they

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.680 
really really like the detail that they
put<00:06:14.000> into<00:06:14.150> this<00:06:14.420> particular<00:06:14.720> toy<00:06:16.330> and<00:06:17.330> there

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
put into this particular toy and there

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:24.010 
put into this particular toy and there
goes<00:06:17.870> the<00:06:18.050> Sun<00:06:18.230> again<00:06:22.450> and<00:06:23.450> I<00:06:23.660> like<00:06:23.840> that

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.020 
goes the Sun again and I like that

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.659 
goes the Sun again and I like that
actually<00:06:24.230> rises<00:06:24.830> in<00:06:24.920> the<00:06:24.950> east<00:06:25.190> and<00:06:25.370> sets<00:06:25.610> in

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:25.669 
actually rises in the east and sets in

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:28.390 
actually rises in the east and sets in
the<00:06:25.790> west<00:06:25.940> and<00:06:26.800> door<00:06:27.800> can<00:06:27.980> have<00:06:28.070> to<00:06:28.190> notice

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 
the west and door can have to notice

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.480 
the west and door can have to notice
that

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490

excited<00:07:05.240> for<00:07:05.600> this<00:07:05.900> one<00:07:06.110> to<00:07:06.320> actually<00:07:06.530> finally

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.190 
excited for this one to actually finally

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.420 
excited for this one to actually finally
grow<00:07:07.550> up<00:07:08.200> he's<00:07:09.200> actually<00:07:09.680> a<00:07:09.920> lot<00:07:10.070> of<00:07:10.130> different

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430 
grow up he's actually a lot of different

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.730 
grow up he's actually a lot of different
coloring<00:07:10.880> then<00:07:14.230> you<00:07:15.230> know<00:07:15.320> I<00:07:15.350> thought<00:07:15.590> it

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:15.740 
coloring then you know I thought it

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.930 
coloring then you know I thought it
would<00:07:15.830> be<00:07:15.890> about<00:07:16.010> the<00:07:16.160> same<00:07:16.340> color<00:07:16.610> but<00:07:16.820> it's

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:16.940 
would be about the same color but it's

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:22.870 
would be about the same color but it's
not<00:07:17.000> this<00:07:17.990> is<00:07:18.140> the<00:07:18.560> Nano<00:07:18.740> Kitty<00:07:21.730> which<00:07:22.730> says

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 
not this is the Nano Kitty which says

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.300 
not this is the Nano Kitty which says
the<00:07:23.060> Nano<00:07:23.240> Dino<00:07:23.510> which<00:07:23.780> is<00:07:23.900> a<00:07:23.930> lot<00:07:24.140> darker<00:07:24.320> so

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:25.310 
the Nano Dino which is a lot darker so
