think<00:00:04.980> that<00:00:05.430> we<00:00:05.549> are<00:00:05.670> going<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:06.060> have<00:00:06.359> to

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
think that we are going to have to

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.040 
think that we are going to have to
return<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.950> a<00:00:07.980> very<00:00:08.700> deep<00:00:09.050> spiritual

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
return to a very deep spiritual

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.440 
return to a very deep spiritual
understanding<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:11.190> what<00:00:11.460> it<00:00:11.580> means<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:12.059> be<00:00:12.210> a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
understanding of what it means to be a

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.640 
understanding of what it means to be a
conscious<00:00:13.580> being<00:00:14.599> to<00:00:15.599> be<00:00:15.750> able<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.470> not<00:00:16.619> only

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
conscious being to be able to not only

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.040 
conscious being to be able to not only
live<00:00:17.010> on<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:17.340> planet<00:00:17.369> peacefully<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.570> not

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
live on this planet peacefully and not

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.050 
live on this planet peacefully and not
blow<00:00:19.380> each<00:00:19.529> other<00:00:19.710> up<00:00:19.859> over<00:00:20.189> sectarian

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
blow each other up over sectarian

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.720 
blow each other up over sectarian
differences<00:00:21.619> but<00:00:22.619> also<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:23.010> go<00:00:23.220> into<00:00:23.430> space

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
differences but also to go into space

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.910 
differences but also to go into space
because<00:00:24.330> when<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.779> look<00:00:25.019> into<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.410> eyes<00:00:25.560> of

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
because when you look into the eyes of

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.390 
because when you look into the eyes of
an<00:00:26.039> extraterrestrial<00:00:27.140> life-form<00:00:28.189> they<00:00:29.189> may

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
an extraterrestrial life-form they may

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.040 
an extraterrestrial life-form they may
be<00:00:29.460> very<00:00:29.580> different<00:00:29.939> from<00:00:30.390> us<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.779> many<00:00:30.929> ways

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
be very different from us in many ways

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.319 
be very different from us in many ways
but<00:00:31.920> if<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.160> see<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.759> being<00:00:33.059> is

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
but if you see that that being is

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.090 
but if you see that that being is
conscious<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.530> light<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.860> that

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
conscious and the light of that

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.889 
conscious and the light of that
conscious<00:00:35.640> spirit<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.300> same<00:00:36.540> as<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
conscious spirit is the same as the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.799 
conscious spirit is the same as the
conscious<00:00:37.350> light<00:00:37.980> within<00:00:38.370> yourself<00:00:38.850> then<00:00:39.690> you

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
conscious light within yourself then you

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.740 
conscious light within yourself then you
can<00:00:39.960> find<00:00:40.230> some<00:00:40.559> common<00:00:40.829> basis<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.570> is

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
can find some common basis and that is

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.420 
can find some common basis and that is
going<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.050> be<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> common<00:00:43.710> basis<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.280> is

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
going to be the common basis and this is

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.990 
going to be the common basis and this is
why<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.640> motto<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.120> C<00:00:45.690> SETI<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.590> one<00:00:47.520> universe

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
why the motto of C SETI is one universe

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.770 
why the motto of C SETI is one universe
one<00:00:48.270> people<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.930> within<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:50.219> the

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
one people that within the the

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.360 
one people that within the the
understanding<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> true<00:00:52.379> nature<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.890> mind

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
understanding of the true nature of mind

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.880 
understanding of the true nature of mind
the<00:00:54.090> true<00:00:54.360> nature<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.899> conscious<00:00:55.350> mind<00:00:55.620> is

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the true nature of the conscious mind is

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.160 
the true nature of the conscious mind is
that<00:00:56.039> it's<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.219> singularity<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:57.989> may

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
that it's a singularity and that we may

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.660 
that it's a singularity and that we may
see<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.559> though<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.890> have<00:00:59.039> my<00:00:59.070> individuality

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
see it though I have my individuality

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.270 
see it though I have my individuality
you<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.420> yours<00:01:00.719> everyone<00:01:01.170> does<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.070> say

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
you have yours everyone does but I say

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.810 
you have yours everyone does but I say
our<00:01:02.430> individuality<00:01:03.090> ZAR<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:04.820> different

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
our individuality ZAR like different

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.350 
our individuality ZAR like different
beautiful<00:01:06.659> windows<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:08.610> Cathedral<00:01:08.909> of

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
beautiful windows in a Cathedral of

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.960 
beautiful windows in a Cathedral of
different<00:01:10.140> shapes<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.650> colors<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
different shapes and colors but the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.969 
different shapes and colors but the
light<00:01:12.210> streaming<00:01:13.049> through<00:01:13.290> those<00:01:13.439> windows<00:01:13.830> is

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
light streaming through those windows is

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.490 
light streaming through those windows is
from<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.369> single<00:01:14.700> source<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.900> if<00:01:16.259> we

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
from a single source and so if we

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.740 
from a single source and so if we
understand<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.280> single<00:01:17.700> source<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.360> of

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
understand the single source of the of

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.530 
understand the single source of the of
the<00:01:18.960> origins<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:19.740> our<00:01:19.890> conscious<00:01:20.369> being<00:01:20.640> this

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
the origins of our conscious being this

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.630 
the origins of our conscious being this
is<00:01:21.750> true<00:01:21.960> not<00:01:22.110> only<00:01:22.170> for<00:01:22.409> humans<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.520> it's

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
is true not only for humans but it's

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.520 
is true not only for humans but it's
also<00:01:23.790> true<00:01:24.330> very<00:01:24.720> much<00:01:24.900> true<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.409> these

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
also true very much true for these

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.890 
also true very much true for these
visitors<00:01:25.920> they<00:01:26.549> understand<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.330> because

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
visitors they understand that because

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.230 
visitors they understand that because
you<00:01:28.200> cannot<00:01:28.560> travel<00:01:28.979> at<00:01:29.400> multiples<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.119> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
you cannot travel at multiples of the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.170 
you cannot travel at multiples of the
speed<00:01:30.540> of<00:01:30.570> light<00:01:31.070> without<00:01:32.070> crossing<00:01:32.670> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
speed of light without crossing the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.200 
speed of light without crossing the
light<00:01:33.600> barrier<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.350> when<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.979> do<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.880> enter

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
light barrier and when you do you enter

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.179 
light barrier and when you do you enter
into<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.600> area<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> Mystics<00:01:37.860> used<00:01:38.070> to

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
into this area that the Mystics used to

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.850 
into this area that the Mystics used to
call<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.520> etheric<00:01:39.030> astral<00:01:39.590> conscious<00:01:40.590> realm

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
call the etheric astral conscious realm

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.580 
call the etheric astral conscious realm
and<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:42.090> you're<00:01:42.329> dealing<00:01:42.509> with<00:01:42.750> civilizations

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
and so you're dealing with civilizations

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.130 
and so you're dealing with civilizations
who<00:01:43.740> understand<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.299> think<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.930> is

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
who understand that and I think that is

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.139 
who understand that and I think that is
the<00:01:46.320> big<00:01:46.530> test<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:47.100> our<00:01:47.189> civilization<00:01:47.880> at<00:01:48.000> this

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
the big test of our civilization at this

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.719 
the big test of our civilization at this
time<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:49.020> we<00:01:49.439> understand<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.130> deeply

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
time is that we understand that deeply

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.819 
time is that we understand that deeply
enough<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.780> really<00:01:51.990> just<00:01:52.079> changed<00:01:52.710> our

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
enough that it really just changed our

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.219 
enough that it really just changed our
paradigm<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.790> when<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.210> do<00:01:54.390> we're<00:01:54.990> not<00:01:55.020> going

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
paradigm and when we do we're not going

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.840 
paradigm and when we do we're not going
to<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.350> blowing<00:01:55.560> each<00:01:55.799> other<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.100> because<00:01:56.670> of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
to be blowing each other up because of

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.920 

I<00:02:13.000> think<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.120> work<00:02:14.300> that<00:02:14.480> we're<00:02:14.630> doing<00:02:14.660> now

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
I think the work that we're doing now

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.420 
I think the work that we're doing now
could<00:02:15.290> have<00:02:15.380> been<00:02:15.530> done<00:02:15.710> a<00:02:15.740> hundred<00:02:15.980> years<00:02:16.370> ago

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
could have been done a hundred years ago

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.720 
could have been done a hundred years ago
if<00:02:17.240> someone<00:02:18.020> could<00:02:18.170> articulate<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:19.190> elements

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
if someone could articulate the elements

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.120 
if someone could articulate the elements
and<00:02:19.910> my<00:02:20.660> sole<00:02:21.050> purpose<00:02:21.080> is<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.830> try<00:02:22.070> to

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
and my sole purpose is to try to

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.940 
and my sole purpose is to try to
articulate<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:23.120> give<00:02:23.750> expression<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.410> the

articulate and give expression to the
elements<00:02:25.490> all<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.330> components<00:02:26.960> but<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:28.190> think

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
elements all the components but I think

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.190 
elements all the components but I think
that<00:02:29.120> today<00:02:29.540> there<00:02:30.020> are<00:02:30.200> more<00:02:30.500> people<00:02:30.770> who<00:02:31.640> are

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
that today there are more people who are

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.600 
that today there are more people who are
aware<00:02:33.200> that<00:02:33.260> knowing<00:02:33.950> are<00:02:34.040> we<00:02:34.160> not<00:02:34.310> alone

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
aware that knowing are we not alone

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.400 
aware that knowing are we not alone
remember<00:02:35.150> at<00:02:35.420> least<00:02:35.600> half<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.870> people<00:02:36.050> in

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
remember at least half the people in

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.920 
remember at least half the people in
America<00:02:36.950> think<00:02:37.490> that<00:02:37.700> these<00:02:37.850> UFOs<00:02:38.720> are<00:02:38.900> real

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
America think that these UFOs are real

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.380 
America think that these UFOs are real
and<00:02:39.410> something's<00:02:39.680> being<00:02:39.890> kept<00:02:40.010> secret<00:02:40.360> but<00:02:41.360> I

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
and something's being kept secret but I

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.030 
and something's being kept secret but I
think<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:41.900> more<00:02:42.110> importantly<00:02:42.590> more<00:02:42.920> and

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
think that more importantly more and

think that more importantly more and
more<00:02:43.270> humans<00:02:44.270> are<00:02:45.520> skeptical<00:02:46.520> of<00:02:46.730> the

more humans are skeptical of the

more humans are skeptical of the

demagoguery that goes with dividing

people and more and more people are

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.010 
people and more and more people are
saying<00:02:52.100> that<00:02:52.280> wait<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.460> minute<00:02:52.820> we're<00:02:53.540> all<00:02:53.720> one
