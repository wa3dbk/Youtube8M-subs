okay<00:00:01.680> here's<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:01.979> brand-new<00:00:02.929> electric<00:00:03.929> mini

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
okay here's a brand-new electric mini

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.349 
okay here's a brand-new electric mini
coopers<00:00:04.859> all<00:00:05.040> 500<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.580> these<00:00:05.670> in<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.910> US<00:00:06.240> right

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
coopers all 500 of these in the US right

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.410 
coopers all 500 of these in the US right
now<00:00:06.720> this<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.740> one<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.280> six<00:00:08.700> that<00:00:09.000> we<00:00:09.090> have<00:00:09.269> here

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
now this is one of six that we have here

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.299 
now this is one of six that we have here
locally<00:00:10.730> this<00:00:11.730> one's<00:00:11.910> got<00:00:12.799> 273<00:00:13.799> miles<00:00:14.009> on<00:00:14.280> it

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
locally this one's got 273 miles on it

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.180 
locally this one's got 273 miles on it
now<00:00:14.490> been<00:00:14.700> driving<00:00:15.000> it<00:00:15.059> for<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.269> couple<00:00:15.509> weeks

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
now been driving it for a couple weeks

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.189 
now been driving it for a couple weeks
it's<00:00:17.190> got<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.670> speedometer<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.900> middle

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
it's got the speedometer in the middle

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.019 
it's got the speedometer in the middle
there's<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.740> little<00:00:19.890> power<00:00:20.160> gauge<00:00:20.460> right<00:00:20.789> here

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
there's a little power gauge right here

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.250 
there's a little power gauge right here
sort<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.859> an<00:00:23.400> analog<00:00:23.820> for<00:00:24.119> a

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
sort of like a it's a an analog for a

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.390 
sort of like a it's a an analog for a
tachometer<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.500> guess<00:00:25.800> you'll<00:00:26.039> see<00:00:26.189> as<00:00:26.369> we

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
tachometer I guess you'll see as we

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.429 
tachometer I guess you'll see as we
accelerate<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.150> numbers<00:00:27.449> go<00:00:27.630> up<00:00:27.840> as<00:00:28.050> it

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
accelerate the numbers go up as it

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.050 
accelerate the numbers go up as it
decelerates<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.099> goes<00:00:29.220> into<00:00:29.369> charge<00:00:29.670> mode<00:00:29.939> it

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
decelerates it goes into charge mode it

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.650 
decelerates it goes into charge mode it
will<00:00:30.119> actually<00:00:30.300> go<00:00:30.570> down<00:00:32.270> over<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.390> steering

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
will actually go down over the steering

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.180 
will actually go down over the steering
wheel<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:34.170> guess<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> tachometer<00:00:34.829> would<00:00:35.100> usually

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
wheel I guess a tachometer would usually

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.030 
wheel I guess a tachometer would usually
be<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> normal<00:00:35.760> mini<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.040> charge

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
be on a normal mini this is a charge

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.590 
be on a normal mini this is a charge
mean<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.399> shows<00:00:38.520> how<00:00:38.610> much<00:00:38.730> battery<00:00:38.940> power<00:00:39.180> is

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
mean it shows how much battery power is

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.940 
mean it shows how much battery power is
left<00:00:39.809> obviously<00:00:39.989> 0<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:41.460> 100<00:00:42.170> you<00:00:43.170> plug<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.800> in

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
left obviously 0 to 100 you plug this in

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.459 
left obviously 0 to 100 you plug this in
every<00:00:44.070> night<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.550> charged<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.840> 15<00:00:46.320> amp

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
every night and charged it in a 15 amp

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.340 
every night and charged it in a 15 amp
110<00:00:47.190> circuit<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.760> takes<00:00:47.940> about<00:00:48.149> 20<00:00:48.809> hours<00:00:48.840> to

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
110 circuit it takes about 20 hours to

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.560 
110 circuit it takes about 20 hours to
get<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.500> full<00:00:49.739> charge<00:00:50.010> if<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> 50<00:00:51.390> amp

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
get a full charge if you have a 50 amp

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.220 
get a full charge if you have a 50 amp
220<00:00:53.030> you<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.149> get<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.570> about<00:00:54.629> three

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
220 you can get that in about three

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.799 
220 you can get that in about three
hours<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.770> much<00:00:55.920> faster<00:00:56.190> has<00:00:56.940> all<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> usual

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
hours it's much faster has all the usual

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.389 
hours it's much faster has all the usual
information<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.530> temperature<00:00:58.980> at<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.190> time

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399

how many miles are left on the batteries
on<00:01:01.680> here<00:01:01.980> there's<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.090> gear<00:01:04.019> shift<00:01:04.049> indicator

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
on here there's a gear shift indicator

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.980 
on here there's a gear shift indicator
of<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.890> gears<00:01:05.189> are<00:01:05.339> only<00:01:05.549> Park<00:01:06.000> over<00:01:06.360> Park

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
of the gears are only Park over Park

first<00:01:09.810> second<00:01:10.170> third<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.830> thing<00:01:11.010> has<00:01:11.130> no

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
first second third this thing has no

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.219 
first second third this thing has no
gearbox<00:01:11.640> as<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.240> accelerate<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.990> just

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
gearbox as you accelerate it just

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.810 
gearbox as you accelerate it just
seamlessly<00:01:13.950> accelerates<00:01:15.950> so<00:01:16.950> will<00:01:17.130> will<00:01:17.610> take

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
seamlessly accelerates so will will take

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.789 
seamlessly accelerates so will will take
off<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.150> turn<00:01:18.420> off<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> AC<00:01:18.780> because<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.680> AC

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
off and turn off the AC because the AC

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.390 
off and turn off the AC because the AC
actually<00:01:20.159> makes<00:01:21.060> more<00:01:21.330> noise<00:01:21.360> than<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.400> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
actually makes more noise than the the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.039 
actually makes more noise than the the
car<00:01:23.610> does<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> lot<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.060> times<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.479> drowns<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.900> out

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
car does a lot of times it drowns it out

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.960 
car does a lot of times it drowns it out
you'll<00:01:25.680> hear<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> slight<00:01:26.100> wine<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:26.850> it

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
you'll hear a slight wine as it

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.370 
you'll hear a slight wine as it
accelerates<00:01:27.210> hopefully<00:01:27.869> you'll<00:01:27.960> hear<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
accelerates hopefully you'll hear on the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.590 
accelerates hopefully you'll hear on the
video<00:01:28.650> well<00:01:29.490> then<00:01:29.610> now<00:01:29.759> you'll<00:01:30.030> hear<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.329> road
