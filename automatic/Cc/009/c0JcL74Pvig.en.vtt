00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.290
 good as having seen in the video two percent 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.740
 for the designer the way to create 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.649
 all edges of the cube 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:10.809
 and so it is in this case 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.989
 As I mentioned that there are two things that can happen to injured people 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:16.589
 what the minister to the edges once and for all 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:19.279
 what happens to us what happened to me right now 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.169
 we have all the edges done - 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:24.050
 these two 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.359
 we are left are the innocent 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.020
 tackles the flavor there is what 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.970
 the same thing they have explained broke 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.570
 a list oak and 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.880
 oak and depending on how they were placed up here 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.200
 so if we do now logarithm what we're going to get 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.080
 is breaking 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.450
 or this list costs sight so 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.010
 so slow in this case we would never end up doing all the edges 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.480
 you can look now 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.170
 one according to 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.910
 another new Labor for what 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.910
 is a pass and to premiere lists all well done 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.160
 first of all let's look at the bike 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.120
 in you are left no more check only states 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.350
 and look at the colors this space last side 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.290
 and this one is green and red 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.980
 the next face 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.980
 logically turn blue red and purple 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.570
 so that loeb do not work 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.940
 in my previous case we know that we have to have 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.650
 each of the boxes 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.610
 not in front of one another but in an environment still some here 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.469
 and until here 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.170
 but in this case contrary 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.870
 we have to have one in front of the other thing that we do not have why in fixed 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.869
 green green red 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.950
 red green are diagonally and it can not be like that 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.190
 So I took advantage of it, I explain to you how 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.370
 turn the edges for kids to see percent bet craving or jogo 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.300
 confronted one agent from the other 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.810
 or diagonally how are we now how do we do 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.440
 put one edge in front of the other 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.450
 each vaccine box in front of the other 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.860
 so very simple having the two in front 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.720
 in vertical better 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.720
 we do so we take on the right side and upload it 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.570
 i turn 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.440
 over 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.359
 only in room 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:14.289
 we see that the edge is here the broken list 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:15.819
 and the other one is here 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.819
 what we do now is your wellbeing 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.249
 we have a list in front of the other you see how they conceive 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:26.380
 purple blue 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.319
 Red Green 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.079
 purple blue red green and now we can do it figure that we were missing 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.329
 percent create edge states without breaking the others 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:38.729
 we will do the following 

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:41.469
 having one facing the other as we see 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:43.729
 we do it this way 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:46.729
 we break by room as 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:52.149
 down 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:55.149
 we turn 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:58.040
 It is not easy for you 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.129
 for the reals clearly 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:01.529
 we turn like this 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:03.139
 always in rooms 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.139
 we turn like this 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.849
 we turn like this 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:15.949
 we turn like this 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:17.279
 and now upside down 

00:03:17.279 --> 00:03:20.279
 tolosa we brought h 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.159
 let's keep going 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.319
 it's like this 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.739
 and we put everything as it was 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.299
 do you live 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.929
 we are already created lists 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:34.680
 and we have the entire quota to know these dates 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.839
 no problem none 

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:40.649
 the ultimate goal is a bit complicated but if you do it a little bit 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:41.950
 little watching for it 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.779
 he does not catch them not easily it's very simple 

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:46.649
 and it is already 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:50.649
 since it is up to you to create the cube as if it were a cube of three 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:53.649
 three because fixed 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:58.919
 A) Yes 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:02.249
 the pmi is a central point in this case are four 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:04.349
 when we see a hundred for example 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:05.839
 yd 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:07.539
 is 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.909
 is 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:13.229
 we move instead of one in this case we see two 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:15.489
 and here we have a point 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.279
 the edges 

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.659
 in this case I am one of two 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:22.169
 if we had the list 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.629
 we will promote 2 

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.189
 two boxes instead of one 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:29.319
 and then by the corners as well as always now it's your turn 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:30.849
 finish 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:31.949
 the cube 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.950
 it may sound in the next video 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.300
 two variants there 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.130
 specific in this quota of four because it is similar to that of three but it is not 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:40.499
 the same makes us equal 

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:43.090
 two things can happen to us at the end of everything 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.279
 let the bucket finish well 

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:48.499
 that we have a changed list 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:50.760
 or that we have two paddlers changed 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.830
 then review 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.030
 the two laredos for those two variants that can be that it does not write happens to us 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.479
 end of everything
