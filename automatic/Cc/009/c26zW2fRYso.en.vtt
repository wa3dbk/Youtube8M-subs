part right here and what's pretty neat
about<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:17.460> that<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.880> get<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.270> magnet<00:02:19.080> right

about it is that you get a magnet right
here<00:02:19.380> that's<00:02:19.560> going<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.740> help<00:02:19.830> keep

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
here that's going to help keep

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.060 
here that's going to help keep
everything<00:02:20.190> closed<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:22.200> as<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.680> can<00:02:22.770> fit<00:02:22.920> up

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070

the<00:02:29.850> magnet<00:02:30.720> helps<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.260> close<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:31.980> the

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
the magnet helps and close that so the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.860 
the magnet helps and close that so the
carbs<00:02:32.400> won't<00:02:32.580> fall<00:02:32.790> out<00:02:32.820> so<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.570> looks<00:02:33.720> really

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
carbs won't fall out so it looks really

carbs won't fall out so it looks really
good<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:35.510> what<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.540> discovered<00:02:36.780> about<00:02:37.140> this

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
front pocket is that it is best suited

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
for a business card size a credit card

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.310 
for a business card size a credit card
was<00:02:44.250> really<00:02:44.580> tight<00:02:44.820> so<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.210> might<00:02:45.420> take<00:02:45.660> some

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
was really tight so it might take some

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.830 
was really tight so it might take some
getting<00:02:46.950> loosened<00:02:47.910> up<00:02:48.060> in<00:02:48.240> there<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.690> just

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
getting loosened up in there and just

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.750 
getting loosened up in there and just
kind<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.110> working<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.590> into<00:02:49.710> over<00:02:50.340> some<00:02:50.520> time

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
kind of working it into over some time

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.970 
kind of working it into over some time
