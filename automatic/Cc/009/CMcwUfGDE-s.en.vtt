00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
here there you go

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.880 
here there you go
and<00:01:42.119> that's<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.320> we<00:01:43.409> also<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> little

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and that's it we also have a little

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.160 
and that's it we also have a little
label<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:44.310> for<00:01:44.490> IMEI<00:01:45.270> information<00:01:46.079> I'll

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
label here for IMEI information I'll

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.780 
label here for IMEI information I'll
peel<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.470> off<00:01:46.530> as<00:01:46.829> well<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.369> as<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.549> can<00:01:47.670> see

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
peel that off as well so as you can see

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.389 
peel that off as well so as you can see
the<00:01:47.909> even<00:01:48.119> color<00:01:48.329> match<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.170> red<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:50.310> they

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
the even color match that to red so they

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.120 
the even color match that to red so they
pull<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.610> thought<00:01:51.030> into<00:01:51.299> this<00:01:51.450> stuff<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.130> then

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
pull on thought into this stuff and then

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.010 
pull on thought into this stuff and then
we<00:01:53.250> have<00:01:53.369> another<00:01:53.460> camera<00:01:54.180> lens<00:01:54.450> protector

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
we have another camera lens protector

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.069 
we have another camera lens protector
right<00:01:55.350> here<00:01:55.649> we<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:55.920> peel<00:01:56.100> off<00:01:56.659> there<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.780> go

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
right here we can peel off there you go

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.410 
right here we can peel off there you go
now<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.040> terms<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.340> design<00:01:59.729> this<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.119> actually

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
now in terms of design this is actually

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.649 
now in terms of design this is actually
very<00:02:00.570> similar<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.350> black<00:02:01.649> nexus<00:02:02.369> 5<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:03.390> if

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
very similar to the black nexus 5 but if

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.620 
very similar to the black nexus 5 but if
they're<00:02:03.869> using<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.350> white<00:02:04.770> Nexus<00:02:05.670> materials

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
they're using the white Nexus materials

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.050 
they're using the white Nexus materials
so<00:02:07.140> what<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.590> mean<00:02:07.740> by<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:07.890> is<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.849> have

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
so what I mean by that is that we have

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.430 
so what I mean by that is that we have
the<00:02:09.179> color<00:02:09.360> wrapping<00:02:09.720> around<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.020> edges<00:02:10.319> so

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
the color wrapping around the edges so

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.000 
the color wrapping around the edges so
we<00:02:10.560> have<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.739> same<00:02:10.920> material<00:02:11.280> on<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.400> back

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
we have the same material on the back

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.649 
we have the same material on the back
around<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.310> edges<00:02:12.489> as<00:02:12.790> opposed<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.330> what<00:02:13.569> the

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
around the edges as opposed to what the

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.410 
around the edges as opposed to what the
light<00:02:13.810> does<00:02:14.049> which<00:02:14.830> is<00:02:14.860> have<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.489> panel<00:02:16.209> on<00:02:16.299> the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
light does which is have a panel on the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.539 
light does which is have a panel on the
back<00:02:16.540> along<00:02:16.959> with<00:02:17.019> these<00:02:17.290> glossy<00:02:17.890> side<00:02:18.099> pieces

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
back along with these glossy side pieces

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.390 
back along with these glossy side pieces
which<00:02:18.700> pick<00:02:18.939> up<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.750> design<00:02:20.409> of<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.890> front<00:02:21.159> so

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
which pick up the design of the front so

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.949 
which pick up the design of the front so
you<00:02:21.489> have<00:02:21.579> a<00:02:21.640> nice<00:02:21.819> wraparound<00:02:22.269> effect<00:02:22.659> along

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
you have a nice wraparound effect along

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.780 
you have a nice wraparound effect along
the<00:02:23.140> front<00:02:23.470> but<00:02:24.010> when<00:02:24.099> you're<00:02:24.250> handling<00:02:24.579> it

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
the front but when you're handling it

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.240 
the front but when you're handling it
you<00:02:24.939> just<00:02:25.150> feel<00:02:25.239> this<00:02:25.689> glossy<00:02:26.439> plastic<00:02:26.739> along

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
you just feel this glossy plastic along

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.949 
you just feel this glossy plastic along
the<00:02:27.370> side<00:02:27.579> which<00:02:27.730> doesn't<00:02:28.060> feel<00:02:28.269> really<00:02:28.720> nice

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
the side which doesn't feel really nice

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.380 
the side which doesn't feel really nice
in<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.260> hand<00:02:29.290> it<00:02:29.560> feels<00:02:29.739> a<00:02:29.829> little<00:02:29.920> cheap<00:02:30.390> but

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
in the hand it feels a little cheap but

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.270 
in the hand it feels a little cheap but
when<00:02:32.019> you<00:02:32.110> look<00:02:32.290> at<00:02:32.470> this<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:32.950> can<00:02:32.980> see<00:02:33.250> that

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
when you look at this you can see that

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.910 
when you look at this you can see that
the<00:02:33.849> red<00:02:34.090> bezel<00:02:34.690> wraps<00:02:35.140> around<00:02:35.290> these<00:02:35.590> side

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
the red bezel wraps around these side

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.830 
the red bezel wraps around these side
creates<00:02:36.579> a<00:02:36.610> really<00:02:36.819> nice<00:02:36.970> effect<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.540> design

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
creates a really nice effect the design

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.479 
creates a really nice effect the design
is<00:02:37.989> really<00:02:38.319> nice<00:02:38.500> here<00:02:38.769> the<00:02:39.010> bright<00:02:39.280> red

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
is really nice here the bright red

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.759 
is really nice here the bright red
against<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.140> contrasting<00:02:41.140> black<00:02:41.409> looks

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
against the contrasting black looks

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:42.809 
against the contrasting black looks
really<00:02:42.010> sharp<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.430> course<00:02:42.609> you<00:02:42.700> have<00:02:42.790> your

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
really sharp and of course you have your

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.910 
really sharp and of course you have your
red<00:02:43.209> earpiece<00:02:43.750> which<00:02:44.019> is<00:02:44.230> very<00:02:44.409> similar<00:02:44.650> to

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
red earpiece which is very similar to

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.089 
red earpiece which is very similar to
the<00:02:45.579> Nexus<00:02:46.000> 5<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.510> white<00:02:46.750> as<00:02:47.079> you<00:02:47.290> can<00:02:47.379> see<00:02:47.590> now

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
the Nexus 5 the white as you can see now

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.349 
the Nexus 5 the white as you can see now
I<00:02:48.129> think<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.519> looks<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.760> little<00:02:48.849> better<00:02:49.180> than

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
I think it looks a little better than

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:50.759 
I think it looks a little better than
the<00:02:49.450> red<00:02:49.659> version<00:02:49.870> just<00:02:50.049> because<00:02:50.379> the<00:02:50.560> red

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
the red version just because the red

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.149 
the red version just because the red
frames<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.959> glass<00:02:52.959> panel<00:02:53.440> while<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.920> red

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
frames the glass panel while the red

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.129 
frames the glass panel while the red
earpiece<00:02:54.609> come<00:02:54.879> is<00:02:55.030> an<00:02:55.150> accent<00:02:55.659> there<00:02:55.840> most

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
earpiece come is an accent there most

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:58.140 
earpiece come is an accent there most
does<00:02:56.319> a<00:02:56.349> nice<00:02:56.560> job<00:02:56.650> sort<00:02:57.099> of<00:02:57.220> giving<00:02:57.849> you<00:02:57.909> some

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
does a nice job sort of giving you some

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.300 
does a nice job sort of giving you some
orientation<00:02:58.359> point<00:02:59.079> so<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.530> know<00:02:59.709> which<00:03:00.010> side

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
orientation point so you know which side

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.979 
orientation point so you know which side
is<00:03:00.519> up<00:03:00.670> because<00:03:00.909> otherwise<00:03:01.060> is<00:03:01.480> completely

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
is up because otherwise is completely

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.629 
is up because otherwise is completely
symmetrical<00:03:02.530> and<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:02.709> can't<00:03:02.920> really<00:03:03.159> tell

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:03.639 
symmetrical and you can't really tell

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.699 
symmetrical and you can't really tell
along<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.629> back<00:03:04.780> again<00:03:05.079> you<00:03:05.170> have<00:03:05.260> your<00:03:05.409> Nexus

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
along the back again you have your Nexus

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.530 
along the back again you have your Nexus
branding<00:03:05.859> which<00:03:06.280> is<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:06.459> little<00:03:06.700> darker<00:03:07.150> with<00:03:07.510> a

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
branding which is a little darker with a

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.610 
branding which is a little darker with a
glossy<00:03:07.930> finish

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
glossy finish

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.009 
glossy finish
you<00:03:09.129> have<00:03:09.340> your<00:03:09.579> black<00:03:09.909> camera<00:03:10.540> module<00:03:10.900> which

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
you have your black camera module which

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.509 
you have your black camera module which
does<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.230> nice<00:03:11.440> job<00:03:11.470> contrasting<00:03:12.340> with<00:03:12.459> the

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
does a nice job contrasting with the

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.149 
does a nice job contrasting with the
black<00:03:12.790> along<00:03:13.120> with<00:03:13.269> an<00:03:13.389> LED<00:03:13.599> flash<00:03:14.010> along<00:03:15.010> the

black along with an LED flash along the

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.770

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
with your USB port now originally I

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.470 
with your USB port now originally I
thought<00:03:48.040> they<00:03:48.220> had<00:03:48.370> redesigned<00:03:48.970> these<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.359> be

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
thought they had redesigned these to be

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.839 
thought they had redesigned these to be
wider<00:03:49.959> or<00:03:50.169> larger<00:03:50.799> but<00:03:51.250> that<00:03:51.370> may<00:03:51.489> just<00:03:51.730> be<00:03:51.819> the

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 
wider or larger but that may just be the

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:53.580 
wider or larger but that may just be the
black<00:03:52.120> version<00:03:52.510> so<00:03:52.660> if<00:03:52.750> you<00:03:52.840> look<00:03:53.079> at<00:03:53.319> the

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
black version so if you look at the

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.649 
black version so if you look at the
white<00:03:53.919> version<00:03:54.160> and<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:55.329> red<00:03:55.480> version

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:55.659 
white version and the red version

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:57.030 
white version and the red version
side-by-side<00:03:56.379> you<00:03:56.409> can<00:03:56.530> see<00:03:56.739> that<00:03:56.919> these

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
side-by-side you can see that these

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.949 
side-by-side you can see that these
speaker<00:03:57.340> grilles<00:03:57.639> look<00:03:58.389> to<00:03:58.510> be<00:03:58.629> about<00:03:58.810> the

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
speaker grilles look to be about the

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.270 
speaker grilles look to be about the
same<00:03:59.139> size<00:03:59.379> let<00:03:59.650> me<00:03:59.709> see<00:03:59.829> if<00:03:59.889> I<00:03:59.949> can<00:04:00.069> get<00:04:00.190> an

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
same size let me see if I can get an

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.830 
same size let me see if I can get an
angle<00:04:00.489> here<00:04:00.669> that<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:00.879> can<00:04:00.970> see<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.299> they<00:04:01.659> look

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
angle here that you can see it they look

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.720 
angle here that you can see it they look
to<00:04:01.989> be<00:04:02.079> about<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.409> same<00:04:02.590> size<00:04:02.889> now<00:04:03.220> my

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
to be about the same size now my

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.610 
to be about the same size now my
impression<00:04:04.569> was<00:04:04.599> that<00:04:04.870> they<00:04:04.989> had<00:04:05.139> enlarged

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
impression was that they had enlarged

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.080 
impression was that they had enlarged
these<00:04:05.799> because<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.310> speaker<00:04:06.639> is<00:04:06.790> pretty

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
these because the speaker is pretty

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.449 
these because the speaker is pretty
quiet<00:04:07.419> but<00:04:08.199> looks<00:04:08.680> like<00:04:08.799> there<00:04:09.010> really<00:04:09.250> isn't

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
quiet but looks like there really isn't

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.159 
quiet but looks like there really isn't
a<00:04:09.639> difference<00:04:09.669> a<00:04:10.239> notable<00:04:10.540> difference<00:04:10.720> here

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
a difference a notable difference here

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:13.500 
a difference a notable difference here
now<00:04:11.979> of<00:04:12.069> course<00:04:12.220> we<00:04:12.430> still<00:04:12.609> have<00:04:12.669> NFC<00:04:13.269> and

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
now of course we still have NFC and

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.030 
now of course we still have NFC and
wireless<00:04:14.079> charging<00:04:14.109> so<00:04:14.650> all<00:04:14.829> of<00:04:14.949> those

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
wireless charging so all of those

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.979 
wireless charging so all of those
accessories<00:04:15.430> will<00:04:15.790> work<00:04:15.970> and<00:04:16.209> of<00:04:16.599> course<00:04:16.840> we

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
accessories will work and of course we

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.319 
accessories will work and of course we
have<00:04:17.199> the<00:04:17.470> Nexus<00:04:18.070> 5<00:04:18.220> bumper<00:04:18.639> case<00:04:18.849> if<00:04:19.060> you<00:04:19.150> pop

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
have the Nexus 5 bumper case if you pop

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.039 
have the Nexus 5 bumper case if you pop
that<00:04:19.359> on<00:04:19.690> here

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
that on here

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.920 
that on here
you<00:04:20.500> can<00:04:20.680> see<00:04:20.950> it<00:04:21.099> fits<00:04:21.219> just<00:04:21.479> perfectly<00:04:22.479> but

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
you can see it fits just perfectly but

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.320 
you can see it fits just perfectly but
it<00:04:23.020> does<00:04:23.169> cover<00:04:23.440> up<00:04:23.710> the

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
it does cover up the

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.480 
it does cover up the
bezel<00:04:24.690> except<00:04:24.960> for<00:04:25.139> the<00:04:25.199> earpiece<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:26.069> as<00:04:26.370> you

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
bezel except for the earpiece and as you

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.980 
bezel except for the earpiece and as you
can<00:04:26.580> see<00:04:26.639> it<00:04:26.789> also<00:04:26.909> hides<00:04:27.240> the<00:04:27.479> color<00:04:27.720> pretty

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
can see it also hides the color pretty

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.629 
can see it also hides the color pretty
much<00:04:28.110> behind<00:04:28.500> this<00:04:28.680> now<00:04:29.250> actually<00:04:29.520> my

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
much behind this now actually my

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.730 
much behind this now actually my
favorite<00:04:30.090> design<00:04:30.479> aspect<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.139> the<00:04:31.229> Nexus<00:04:31.530> 5<00:04:31.710> is

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
favorite design aspect of the Nexus 5 is

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.649 
favorite design aspect of the Nexus 5 is
looking<00:04:32.280> head-on<00:04:32.699> not<00:04:32.879> necessarily<00:04:33.419> looking

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 
looking head-on not necessarily looking

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.659 
looking head-on not necessarily looking
at<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.930> back<00:04:34.110> it<00:04:34.319> looks<00:04:34.770> nice<00:04:34.979> as<00:04:35.190> well<00:04:35.370> but<00:04:35.610> I

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
at the back it looks nice as well but I

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.219 
at the back it looks nice as well but I
think<00:04:35.879> looking<00:04:36.210> head-on<00:04:36.629> is<00:04:36.840> where<00:04:37.020> it<00:04:37.080> really

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
think looking head-on is where it really

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:38.689 
think looking head-on is where it really
shines<00:04:37.560> through<00:04:37.800> because<00:04:38.159> we<00:04:38.280> have<00:04:38.370> this<00:04:38.460> nice

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
shines through because we have this nice

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.719 
shines through because we have this nice
thin<00:04:39.150> bezel<00:04:40.080> around<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.470> black<00:04:40.919> display<00:04:41.520> it's

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
thin bezel around the black display it's

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.240 
thin bezel around the black display it's
nice<00:04:41.909> and<00:04:42.180> bright<00:04:42.569> red<00:04:43.020> so<00:04:43.409> even<00:04:43.949> that<00:04:44.009> thin

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
nice and bright red so even that thin

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.159 
nice and bright red so even that thin
bezel<00:04:44.639> really<00:04:44.849> jumps<00:04:45.240> out<00:04:45.360> and<00:04:45.509> frames<00:04:45.900> the

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
bezel really jumps out and frames the

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.930 
bezel really jumps out and frames the
black<00:04:46.379> display<00:04:46.740> really<00:04:47.099> nicely<00:04:47.310> of<00:04:47.669> course<00:04:47.699> we

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
black display really nicely of course we

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.369 
black display really nicely of course we
have<00:04:48.060> that<00:04:48.150> read<00:04:48.330> your<00:04:48.509> piece<00:04:48.720> to<00:04:48.900> set<00:04:49.110> it<00:04:49.199> off

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:49.379 
have that read your piece to set it off

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:51.110 
have that read your piece to set it off
so<00:04:49.919> I<00:04:49.949> think<00:04:50.069> it<00:04:50.250> looks<00:04:50.400> really<00:04:50.699> sharp<00:04:51.030> in

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
so I think it looks really sharp in

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.399 
so I think it looks really sharp in
particular<00:04:51.389> when<00:04:51.629> you<00:04:51.690> look<00:04:51.870> at<00:04:52.020> it<00:04:52.139> head-on

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:52.409 
particular when you look at it head-on

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:54.379 
particular when you look at it head-on
so<00:04:52.889> I<00:04:53.009> really<00:04:53.220> like<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.490> design<00:04:53.879> of<00:04:53.909> course

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
so I really like the design of course

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.330 
so I really like the design of course
with<00:04:55.020> a<00:04:55.050> display<00:04:55.530> on<00:04:55.740> if<00:04:55.919> you<00:04:55.979> got<00:04:56.099> a<00:04:56.129> matching

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
with a display on if you got a matching

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.369 
with a display on if you got a matching
wallpaper<00:04:57.240> I<00:04:57.449> think<00:04:57.659> it<00:04:57.750> looks<00:04:57.870> really<00:04:58.110> bright

00:04:58.369 --> 00:04:58.379 
wallpaper I think it looks really bright

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:59.959 
wallpaper I think it looks really bright
and<00:04:58.710> colorful<00:04:59.190> too<00:04:59.280> they<00:04:59.430> think<00:04:59.729> they've<00:04:59.849> done

00:04:59.959 --> 00:04:59.969 
and colorful too they think they've done

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:01.459 
and colorful too they think they've done
a<00:05:00.030> really<00:05:00.090> nice<00:05:00.479> job<00:05:00.690> here<00:05:00.750> matching<00:05:01.349> the

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:01.469 
a really nice job here matching the

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:03.350 
a really nice job here matching the
bright<00:05:01.740> colors<00:05:02.099> of<00:05:02.250> the<00:05:02.340> new<00:05:02.490> KitKat

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
bright colors of the new KitKat

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.540 
bright colors of the new KitKat
experience<00:05:03.930> on<00:05:04.050> Nexus<00:05:04.409> 5<00:05:04.680> along<00:05:05.129> with<00:05:05.400> the

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
experience on Nexus 5 along with the

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.909 
experience on Nexus 5 along with the
hardware<00:05:05.940> so<00:05:06.810> Valentine's<00:05:07.409> Day<00:05:07.590> are<00:05:07.710> not<00:05:07.889> a

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
hardware so Valentine's Day are not a

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.559 
hardware so Valentine's Day are not a
definitely<00:05:08.310> big<00:05:08.490> fan<00:05:08.759> of<00:05:08.789> the<00:05:09.120> red<00:05:09.300> and<00:05:09.449> black

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:09.569 
definitely big fan of the red and black

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:10.879 
definitely big fan of the red and black
color<00:05:09.900> scheme<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:10.229> think<00:05:10.409> it<00:05:10.500> looks<00:05:10.680> great

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
color scheme I think it looks great

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.529 
color scheme I think it looks great
especially<00:05:11.159> with<00:05:11.610> the<00:05:11.699> Nexus<00:05:12.030> 5<00:05:12.210> and<00:05:12.449> I'm

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
especially with the Nexus 5 and I'm

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.209 
especially with the Nexus 5 and I'm
really<00:05:12.750> glad<00:05:12.960> that<00:05:13.229> they<00:05:13.409> wrapped<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.949> color

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:14.219 
really glad that they wrapped the color

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.430 
really glad that they wrapped the color
around<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.639> edges<00:05:14.909> for<00:05:15.569> one<00:05:15.690> thing<00:05:15.900> it<00:05:16.169> feels

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
around the edges for one thing it feels

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.080 
around the edges for one thing it feels
a<00:05:16.590> lot<00:05:16.710> nicer<00:05:16.919> in<00:05:17.159> the<00:05:17.190> hand<00:05:17.460> than<00:05:17.580> the<00:05:17.729> glossy

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
a lot nicer in the hand than the glossy

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.209 
a lot nicer in the hand than the glossy
finish<00:05:18.360> on<00:05:18.509> the<00:05:18.659> white<00:05:18.840> and<00:05:19.110> the<00:05:19.650> color<00:05:19.680> kind

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:20.219 
finish on the white and the color kind

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:22.369 
finish on the white and the color kind
of<00:05:20.370> frames<00:05:20.879> the<00:05:21.150> black<00:05:21.479> screen<00:05:21.930> so<00:05:22.080> I<00:05:22.110> think<00:05:22.199> it

00:05:22.369 --> 00:05:22.379 
of frames the black screen so I think it

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:24.529 
of frames the black screen so I think it
looks<00:05:22.500> particularly<00:05:23.099> nice<00:05:23.250> so<00:05:23.460> that<00:05:23.940> is<00:05:24.210> the
