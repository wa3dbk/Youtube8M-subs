00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.990
 question or in any case wants to prove the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.269

 play up to 4 players or play in 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.590

 we were shown trailer kojima 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.860
 led by kojima necessarily very long 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.920
 very beautiful and sony will also play the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.000
 map of independent developers or 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.100
 small developers 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.619
 he notably signed with two beautiful 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.750
 fine to bring back to life grim fandango 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.070
 who has a great big classic so we 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.460
 see well that sony plays on all 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.009
 paintings 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.479
 the big hits the little ones as we are 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.070
 leader at sony we took the time 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.680
 to go frolic a little bit away from 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.159
 game we talked about the playstation to 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.630
 video content that will be created 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.409
 specifically for users of 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.619
 ps4 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.650
 they announced that the flagship title of 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.140
 rockstar gta 5 arrives on playstation 4 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.340
 in exclusivity it seems he saw that 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.750
 microsoft we did not blow word 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.610
 we'll tell you more about it anyway at 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.119
 course of the e3 and as a gift from 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.270
 review the first seconds of 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.880
 uncharted new charter id whistle end 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.920
 at the end of a thief is fourth 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.149
 episode that seems to sound the stable 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.070
 nathan drake a nice conference that 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.560
 takes a little long time maybe 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.549
 but who shows a little bit who is the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.950
 master on this new generation 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.229
 for the moment is undeniably that 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.250
 seems the ps4 and sony is aware of it 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.020
 and play the card of 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.510
 look at everything we have come to us 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.380
 we have a little everything a console 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.360
 notebook a living room console that 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.840
 tears a little bit and that crushes the 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.910
 competition 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.200
 we are better than xbox one in any case 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.000
 we will see in the coming months what 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.540
 will be the case but on paper it seems 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.540
 rather your
