00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
your camera I usually use spot metering

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
outside so I'm not using 3d matrix

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.770 
outside so I'm not using 3d matrix
metering<00:03:20.740> I'm<00:03:21.220> using<00:03:21.400> spot<00:03:21.760> metering<00:03:22.180> and<00:03:22.390> I'm

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
metering I'm using spot metering and I'm

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.200

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
black so if you're even doing the center

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.390 
black so if you're even doing the center
with<00:03:31.510> it<00:03:31.720> well<00:03:31.930> see<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.200> whole<00:03:32.500> black<00:03:33.010> inner

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
with it well see the whole black inner

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.850 
with it well see the whole black inner
like<00:03:33.610> a<00:03:33.640> person<00:03:34.060> suit<00:03:34.390> like<00:03:34.720> for<00:03:34.840> example<00:03:34.900> here

absolutely have to I always try and keep
it<00:04:03.490> around<00:04:03.610> about<00:04:04.590> 2200<00:04:05.590> as<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:05.800> maximum<00:04:06.220> or

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
it around about 2200 as you maximum or

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.220 
it around about 2200 as you maximum or
try<00:04:07.240> and<00:04:07.300> bring<00:04:07.450> a<00:04:07.510> little<00:04:07.660> bit<00:04:07.780> more<00:04:07.840> flash

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
try and bring a little bit more flash

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.500 
try and bring a little bit more flash
really<00:04:09.100> try<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.310> work<00:04:09.490> the<00:04:09.640> flash<00:04:09.970> and<00:04:10.210> the

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
really try and work the flash and the

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.210 
really try and work the flash and the
ambient<00:04:10.960> light<00:04:11.110> together<00:04:11.500> if<00:04:11.680> you<00:04:11.770> can<00:04:11.800> which

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
ambient light together if you can which

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.320 
ambient light together if you can which
means<00:04:12.250> you're<00:04:12.610> using<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:12.850> slower<00:04:13.210> shutter

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
means you're using a slower shutter

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.390 
means you're using a slower shutter
speed<00:04:13.840> but<00:04:14.050> still<00:04:14.650> using<00:04:14.770> flash<00:04:15.070> I'll<00:04:15.250> show

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
speed but still using flash I'll show

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.070 
speed but still using flash I'll show
you<00:04:15.460> some<00:04:15.580> examples<00:04:15.970> on<00:04:16.060> the<00:04:16.150> dance<00:04:16.420> floor<00:04:16.840> as

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
you some examples on the dance floor as

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.680 
you some examples on the dance floor as
well<00:04:17.920> so<00:04:18.340> right<00:04:18.700> on<00:04:18.730> the<00:04:18.910> dance<00:04:19.180> floor<00:04:19.390> you<00:04:19.480> can

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
well so right on the dance floor you can

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.270 
well so right on the dance floor you can
start<00:04:19.960> playing<00:04:20.170> around<00:04:20.320> adding<00:04:21.130> some

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
start playing around adding some

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.250 
start playing around adding some
movement<00:04:21.669> to<00:04:21.820> your<00:04:22.090> shots<00:04:22.390> adding<00:04:22.810> some<00:04:22.960> blur

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
movement to your shots adding some blur

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.920 
movement to your shots adding some blur
to<00:04:23.470> your<00:04:23.620> shots<00:04:23.890> gives<00:04:24.160> a<00:04:24.250> much<00:04:24.430> more<00:04:24.640> of<00:04:24.729> a

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
to your shots gives a much more of a

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.070 
to your shots gives a much more of a
action-packed<00:04:25.930> scene<00:04:26.290> on<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.590> dance

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
action-packed scene on the dance

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.260 
action-packed scene on the dance
so<00:04:27.500> for<00:04:27.650> example<00:04:27.740> here<00:04:28.220> it's<00:04:28.639> just<00:04:28.849> a<00:04:28.940> simple

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
so for example here it's just a simple

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.309 
so for example here it's just a simple
shot<00:04:29.389> of<00:04:29.539> them<00:04:29.690> on<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.840> dance<00:04:30.020> floor

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:30.319 
shot of them on the dance floor

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:31.719 
shot of them on the dance floor
nothing<00:04:30.650> really<00:04:30.800> moving<00:04:31.250> nothing<00:04:31.490> really

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
nothing really moving nothing really

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.649 
nothing really moving nothing really
happening<00:04:32.150> but<00:04:32.659> later<00:04:33.080> on<00:04:33.590> let's<00:04:34.430> see<00:04:34.819> if<00:04:35.300> I've

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:35.659 
happening but later on let's see if I've

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:39.790 
happening but later on let's see if I've
got<00:04:35.870> any<00:04:36.050> of<00:04:36.169> the<00:04:36.430> slightly<00:04:37.430> more<00:04:38.080> move<00:04:39.080> tastic

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
got any of the slightly more move tastic

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.469 
got any of the slightly more move tastic
shots<00:04:40.039> so<00:04:40.220> here<00:04:40.550> it<00:04:40.909> was<00:04:41.030> a<00:04:41.060> little<00:04:41.270> bit<00:04:41.389> of<00:04:41.449> a

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479

shots so here it was a little bit of a
zoom<00:04:41.750> and<00:04:42.020> a<00:04:42.289> flash<00:04:42.590> so<00:04:43.190> as<00:04:43.250> you<00:04:43.340> can<00:04:43.400> see<00:04:43.610> the

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
zoom and a flash so as you can see the

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:44.770

00:06:57.549 --> 00:06:57.559 
then you've got a great shallow depth of

00:06:57.559 --> 00:07:00.069 
then you've got a great shallow depth of
field<00:06:57.769> and<00:06:58.009> you<00:06:58.699> can<00:06:58.729> still<00:06:59.299> have<00:06:59.569> faster

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:00.079 
field and you can still have faster

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:03.219 
field and you can still have faster
shutter<00:07:00.559> speeds<00:07:00.889> with<00:07:01.519> good<00:07:02.449> focus<00:07:02.869> on<00:07:03.049> the

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:05.479

00:07:15.369 --> 00:07:15.379
