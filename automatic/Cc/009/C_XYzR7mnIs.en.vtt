look<00:02:07.289> at<00:02:08.289> this<00:02:08.560> water<00:02:09.460> erosion<00:02:09.789> happens<00:02:10.390> when

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
look at this water erosion happens when

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.870 
look at this water erosion happens when
the<00:02:10.600> flow<00:02:10.780> of<00:02:10.810> water<00:02:11.170> causes<00:02:11.860> sand<00:02:12.160> soil<00:02:12.550> or

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
the flow of water causes sand soil or

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.520 
the flow of water causes sand soil or
rock<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.420> chip<00:02:13.660> away<00:02:13.690> at<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.200> Earth's<00:02:14.470> surface

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
rock to chip away at the Earth's surface

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.130 
rock to chip away at the Earth's surface
water<00:02:15.400> erosion<00:02:15.790> usually<00:02:16.360> starts<00:02:16.720> out<00:02:16.900> when

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
water erosion usually starts out when

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.470 
water erosion usually starts out when
the<00:02:17.260> force<00:02:17.500> of<00:02:17.680> rain<00:02:17.950> drops<00:02:18.370> cause<00:02:18.730> soil<00:02:19.120> or

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
the force of rain drops cause soil or

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.990 
the force of rain drops cause soil or
rock<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:20.140> break<00:02:20.350> off<00:02:20.680> into<00:02:20.710> tiny<00:02:21.250> pieces<00:02:21.490> these

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
rock to break off into tiny pieces these

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.420 
rock to break off into tiny pieces these
tiny<00:02:22.300> pieces<00:02:22.900> are<00:02:23.140> carried<00:02:23.620> into<00:02:23.890> flowing

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
how some sea stacks are for so now you

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.110 
how some sea stacks are for so now you
know<00:03:30.030> more<00:03:30.420> about<00:03:30.600> erosion<00:03:31.290> no<00:03:31.830> no<00:03:32.010> see<00:03:32.820> your

know more about erosion no no see your

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.990 
know more about erosion no no see your
lotion<00:03:33.690> take<00:03:34.020> place<00:03:34.380> right<00:03:35.220> in<00:03:35.400> your<00:03:35.490> bathroom

is<00:03:36.420> why<00:03:36.690> science<00:03:37.410> is<00:03:39.530> so<00:03:40.530> cool
