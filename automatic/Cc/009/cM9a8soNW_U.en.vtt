and almond milk and I'll add a little
bit<00:02:02.830> of<00:02:02.860> water<00:02:03.100> so<00:02:03.400> pretty<00:02:04.330> much<00:02:04.540> I<00:02:05.050> don't<00:02:05.590> know

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
bit of water so pretty much I don't know

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.760 
bit of water so pretty much I don't know
if<00:02:05.860> I<00:02:05.920> can<00:02:06.100> film<00:02:09.780> with<00:02:10.780> this<00:02:11.110> handy<00:02:11.530> dandy

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
if I can film with this handy dandy

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.540 
if I can film with this handy dandy
little<00:02:12.570> container<00:02:13.570> from<00:02:14.020> Walmart<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.950> was<00:02:15.070> for

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
little container from Walmart it was for

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.580 
little container from Walmart it was for
like<00:02:15.910> $5<00:02:16.540> but<00:02:16.720> it's<00:02:16.840> really<00:02:17.140> good<00:02:17.320> for<00:02:17.500> making

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
like $5 but it's really good for making

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.920 
like $5 but it's really good for making
shakes<00:02:18.070> because<00:02:18.459> you<00:02:18.610> can<00:02:18.790> put<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.510> top<00:02:19.690> on<00:02:19.720> it

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
shakes because you can put the top on it
