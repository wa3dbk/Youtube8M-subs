00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.410
 no girlfriends I'm going to make a mix with 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.830
 sand that I have not done 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.629
 that I really have treated them with mixtures 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.990
 they have sent me but I the person 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:18.210
 has never done one like this is that we're going to 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.759
 winnow now I will be color 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.750
 purple ok and this is a little bag that 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:27.850
 kikis neils sent me and well that better not 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.340
 that sent me a whole range 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.560
 then I'm going to start here 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.240
 and the truth the truth I have no idea 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.380
 What I 'm doing like this is that 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:42.950
 are less good because I do not know how it's going to 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.660
 turn out I've seen I've seen the other 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.280
 day chatting with one of my friends 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.879
 here on youtube tells me she is 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.879
 like it gives pigment 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.280
 the sand not me not personal feel like 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.460
 if it's going to make me heavy but we're going to 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.460
 watch 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.330
 bataller to open the sachet 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.330
 okay 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.280
 I'm going to put a spark 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.280
 here 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:24.270
 of purple and this one already has as leader 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.550
 is that he gave me kick and I do not know what 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.240
 brand will be nothing but it already brings its 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:34.240
 own club 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:37.500
 and I will use know of this reconnection 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.470
 that are like dots 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.120
 or like mermaid tail ok to see I'm going 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.120
 bring the camera closer so you can see it 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.690
 notices 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.280
 and they are like graphics but nothing white 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.340
 to Ivan 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.750
 Well, a little bit, this is holographic 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:06.310
 are the ones that sued in 1807 that there are 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.310
 to the chancellors in mcal 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:15.280
 and this is a holographic rose 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:19.050
 and I will put stifler in its leader 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.830
 a little bit to not do it very Yankee 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.830
 just like the others 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.440
 Let's see what we have left 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.250
 I feel like I'm taking the light 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.250
 to know 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:47.060
 and I probably miss 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:51.459
 some other color and I 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.459
 one we are going to put silver 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.590
 no more I will not be throwing that the 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.290
 groping this is also like a tail 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.000
 of silver mermaid from recollections me 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.000
 I bought the complete package 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.150
 read me 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.040
 then everything is very Yankee 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.040
 to see what else 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.310
 face of angel or quality want the 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.819
 white forgiveness 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.819
 Y 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.019
 Y 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.740
 and this is like a lathe to solito 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:01.150
 now the moment of truth that is the 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:05.980
 acrylic shaft clear lewis and as well as 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:10.800
 injure a teaspoon of sand by 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.800
 one teaspoon of acrylic 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:18.120
 Look, if there is not going to be a union, 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.120
 I imagine 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:33.190
 and I'm going to take you out of fucking pink 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.190
 photographic 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.639
 to see how 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:52.639
 now we are going to treat it I hope it is 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:55.650
 enough acrylic yes no 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:59.030
 since putting them 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.030
 I'm going to take a tip 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:11.249
 and here 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:14.299
 here I have the tip and I have my 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:14.299
 at least 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:23.889
 and if I get up very well there was no problem 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.889
 nor has he fallen as you can see 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:32.600
 then I put a teaspoon of 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.600
 sand for a teaspoon of 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.419
 acrylic crystal plus confetti or 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.580
 be that actually 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:45.250
 also decoration and sand 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.970
 that the same acrylic but look what 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.970
 nice stay 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.139
 it was very beautiful and if it served as 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.940
 pigment 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:58.070
 I have been saying from this moment 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:00.740
 I remove my doubts about what was the 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:04.520
 sand and here's my answer because I 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:07.220
 if I was not afraid to recommend it because I 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.780
 the personal I have not used it but I have already seen 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.360
 so many mixtures that have sent me 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.330
 including kiki they are having to 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.060
 arenita and 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:19.139
 well 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:21.150
 I understand so I decided to try to 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:24.670
 if it does not have the desired consistency 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:27.380
 just add the most powder 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:30.980
 crystalline ok 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:33.260
 and it already encapsulates no or whatever they're going to 

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.700
 how beautiful and now I have all this 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.460
 mixture 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.400
 How are you 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:43.810
 with little day and a spoonful of 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:48.430
 acrylic now I have two tablespoons or 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:50.600
 more than mixing already hoping that if it says 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.790
 with 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:55.000
 It is completely dry now you can 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.000
 encapsulate 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:02.720
 but well this was the mixture that I made 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:06.410
 moradita was nice 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:08.670
 and well fast well I hope this video 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:12.540
 help them and so 

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:15.690
 and also because they save they save 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:19.040
 I do not think it's a good idea 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:22.130
 I know that he wants this video 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:25.850
 but I had to treat it so here 

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:28.580
 is and as I told you this sand are not 

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:32.810
 of the buy kikin will have to ask 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:35.180
 to her where he gets it I've seen in 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:38.120
 stores like frames but not precisely 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:41.150
 they are so packaged I do not even know where 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:44.210
 he pulled it out like this is that if someone knows then 

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:47.320
 here he puts me ok thank you very much and then 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.320
 see you bye
