what we've done is we've organized these

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.510 
what we've done is we've organized these
brush<00:00:59.380> presets<00:00:59.830> and<00:00:59.920> graduate<00:01:00.280> filter

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
brush presets and graduate filter

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.330 
brush presets and graduate filter
presets<00:01:00.880> based<00:01:01.180> on<00:01:01.450> frequency<00:01:02.380> of<00:01:02.740> use<00:01:02.980> so

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
presets based on frequency of use so

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.829 
presets based on frequency of use so
basically<00:01:03.580> we<00:01:03.730> find<00:01:03.940> that<00:01:04.119> we're<00:01:04.269> most<00:01:04.479> often

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
basically we find that we're most often

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.719 
basically we find that we're most often
using<00:01:05.199> our<00:01:05.350> graduate<00:01:05.799> brushes<00:01:06.220> and<00:01:06.369> filters

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
using our graduate brushes and filters

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.820 
using our graduate brushes and filters
and<00:01:07.090> our<00:01:07.479> graduate<00:01:07.990> filters<00:01:08.290> and<00:01:08.500> brushes

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
and dark and certain areas next we're

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.649

using<00:01:14.200> it<00:01:14.409> to<00:01:14.590> enhance<00:01:15.070> details<00:01:15.610> after<00:01:16.540> that

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
using it to enhance details after that

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.660 
using it to enhance details after that
we're<00:01:16.900> using<00:01:17.049> it<00:01:17.229> for<00:01:17.409> retouching<00:01:17.740> and<00:01:18.130> then

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.730 
we're using it for retouching and then
for<00:01:18.969> color<00:01:19.299> and<00:01:19.420> temperature<00:01:20.079> modifications

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
for color and temperature modifications

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.620 
for color and temperature modifications
and<00:01:20.950> then<00:01:21.070> finally<00:01:21.490> we're<00:01:21.969> using<00:01:22.179> it<00:01:22.390> for

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
and then finally we're using it for

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.690 
and then finally we're using it for
special<00:01:23.020> effects<00:01:23.560> so<00:01:24.280> it's<00:01:24.369> kind<00:01:24.520> of<00:01:24.549> weave

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
special effects so it's kind of weave

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.310 
special effects so it's kind of weave
order<00:01:24.939> we<00:01:25.090> put<00:01:25.299> everything<00:01:25.390> in<00:01:25.749> so<00:01:26.170> let's

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
order we put everything in so let's

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.660 
order we put everything in so let's
discuss<00:01:26.679> each<00:01:26.859> one<00:01:27.039> of<00:01:27.070> these<00:01:27.159> settings<00:01:27.490> and

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
discuss each one of these settings and

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.440 
discuss each one of these settings and
then<00:01:27.759> we're<00:01:27.850> going<00:01:27.939> to<00:01:27.999> go<00:01:28.149> through<00:01:28.359> and

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
then we're going to go through and

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.510 
then we're going to go through and
actually<00:01:28.570> retouch<00:01:29.170> this<00:01:29.469> image<00:01:29.799> all<00:01:30.310> right<00:01:30.429> so

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
actually retouch this image all right so

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.830 
actually retouch this image all right so
let's<00:01:30.640> start<00:01:30.850> from<00:01:30.969> the<00:01:31.060> top<00:01:31.240> with<00:01:31.420> dodging

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
let's start from the top with dodging

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.120 
let's start from the top with dodging
and<00:01:31.929> burning<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.530> first<00:01:32.710> thing<00:01:32.829> we<00:01:32.920> have

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
and burning and the first thing we have

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.980 
and burning and the first thing we have
is<00:01:33.369> burn<00:01:33.819> blacken<00:01:34.479> and<00:01:34.569> what<00:01:34.749> that<00:01:34.869> is

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
is burn blacken and what that is

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.539 
is burn blacken and what that is
basically<00:01:35.319> whenever<00:01:35.530> you<00:01:35.710> want<00:01:35.890> to<00:01:35.950> burn<00:01:36.189> down

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
basically whenever you want to burn down

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.130 
basically whenever you want to burn down
an<00:01:36.729> area<00:01:37.030> so<00:01:37.390> dark<00:01:37.659> that<00:01:37.719> it<00:01:37.899> becomes

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
an area so dark that it becomes

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.380 
an area so dark that it becomes
completely<00:01:38.560> black<00:01:39.009> you<00:01:39.700> use<00:01:39.909> this<00:01:40.060> setting

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
completely black you use this setting

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.989 
completely black you use this setting
it's<00:01:40.539> going<00:01:40.689> to<00:01:40.749> pull<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:40.990> all<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.259> way<00:01:41.619> down

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:41.999 
it's going to pull it all the way down

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:44.669 
it's going to pull it all the way down
next<00:01:42.999> we<00:01:43.090> have<00:01:43.240> burned<00:01:43.749> darken<00:01:44.289> which<00:01:44.439> is<00:01:44.530> just

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
next we have burned darken which is just

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:45.899 
next we have burned darken which is just
going<00:01:44.770> to<00:01:44.829> pull<00:01:45.039> something<00:01:45.219> down<00:01:45.399> one<00:01:45.609> stop

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
going to pull something down one stop

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.370 
going to pull something down one stop
and<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.179> reason<00:01:46.420> why<00:01:46.509> we<00:01:46.630> only<00:01:46.659> have<00:01:47.020> one<00:01:47.049> of

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
and the reason why we only have one of

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.959 
and the reason why we only have one of
these<00:01:47.469> settings<00:01:47.829> is<00:01:48.039> because<00:01:48.310> typically<00:01:48.700> with

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
these settings is because typically with

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:50.609 
these settings is because typically with
burning<00:01:49.389> what<00:01:50.079> we're<00:01:50.200> doing<00:01:50.409> is<00:01:50.469> we're

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
burning what we're doing is we're

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.230 
burning what we're doing is we're
applying<00:01:50.859> the<00:01:51.189> burn<00:01:51.340> effect<00:01:51.670> and<00:01:51.909> then<00:01:52.090> we're

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
applying the burn effect and then we're

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.059 
applying the burn effect and then we're
making<00:01:52.509> an<00:01:52.569> adjustment<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:53.109> it<00:01:53.319> afterwards<00:01:53.889> to

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
making an adjustment to it afterwards to

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.190 
making an adjustment to it afterwards to
get<00:01:54.189> it<00:01:54.280> to<00:01:54.369> where<00:01:54.460> we<00:01:54.549> want<00:01:54.819> so<00:01:55.479> we<00:01:55.659> just<00:01:55.840> set<00:01:56.020> a

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
get it to where we want so we just set a

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.459 
get it to where we want so we just set a
negative<00:01:56.950> 1<00:01:57.130> and<00:01:57.159> positive<00:01:57.609> one<00:01:58.030> for<00:01:58.060> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
negative 1 and positive one for the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.690 
negative 1 and positive one for the
standard<00:01:59.469> burn<00:01:59.679> and<00:01:59.859> dodge<00:01:59.950> settings<00:02:00.459> and

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
standard burn and dodge settings and

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.020 
standard burn and dodge settings and
then<00:02:00.729> negative<00:02:01.600> 4<00:02:02.020> +<00:02:02.229> +<00:02:02.530> 4<00:02:02.859> for<00:02:03.579> the<00:02:03.609> burn<00:02:03.880> to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
then negative 4 + + 4 for the burn to

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.300 
then negative 4 + + 4 for the burn to
complete<00:02:04.359> black<00:02:04.659> or<00:02:04.959> the<00:02:05.020> Dodge<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.979> complete

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
complete black or the Dodge to complete

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.130 
complete black or the Dodge to complete
white<00:02:06.579> which<00:02:06.850> does<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.149> exact<00:02:07.509> opposite<00:02:07.959> of

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
white which does the exact opposite of

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.630 
white which does the exact opposite of
the<00:02:08.319> burn<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:08.740> black<00:02:08.950> this<00:02:09.190> actually<00:02:09.550> will

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
the burn to black this actually will

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.780 
the burn to black this actually will
take<00:02:09.850> an<00:02:09.940> area<00:02:10.270> and<00:02:10.509> take<00:02:11.050> it<00:02:11.170> to<00:02:11.200> pure<00:02:11.470> white

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
take an area and take it to pure white

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.980 
take an area and take it to pure white
alright<00:02:12.790> next<00:02:13.000> we<00:02:13.209> have<00:02:13.390> our<00:02:13.540> detail

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
alright next we have our detail

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.449 
alright next we have our detail
enhancers<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.440> with<00:02:14.709> our<00:02:14.800> detail<00:02:15.100> enhancers

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
enhancers and with our detail enhancers

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.010 
enhancers and with our detail enhancers
we<00:02:15.550> basically<00:02:15.760> design<00:02:16.150> different<00:02:16.660> detail

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
we basically design different detail

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.400 
we basically design different detail
enhancers<00:02:17.500> for<00:02:18.190> every<00:02:18.490> possible<00:02:19.450> area<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:20.260> the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
enhancers for every possible area so the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.080 
enhancers for every possible area so the
general<00:02:20.560> all<00:02:20.860> purpose<00:02:20.890> detailed<00:02:21.580> answer<00:02:21.909> is

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
general all purpose detailed answer is

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.789 
general all purpose detailed answer is
one<00:02:22.330> that's<00:02:22.450> designed<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:22.989> be<00:02:23.110> not<00:02:23.470> too

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
one that's designed to be not too

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.339 
one that's designed to be not too
powerful<00:02:24.310> not<00:02:24.459> too<00:02:24.610> extreme<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.959> can<00:02:26.140> kind<00:02:26.319> of

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
powerful not too extreme you can kind of

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.360 
powerful not too extreme you can kind of
use<00:02:26.409> it<00:02:26.560> everywhere

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
use it everywhere

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.770 
use it everywhere
for<00:02:27.580> skin<00:02:27.819> tones<00:02:28.030> even<00:02:28.120> with<00:02:28.360> any<00:02:28.599> of<00:02:28.720> the

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.399 
retouching presets and most of these are
pretty<00:02:49.090> self-explanatory<00:02:49.299> we<00:02:50.049> can<00:02:50.170> soften

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
pretty self-explanatory we can soften

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.759 
pretty self-explanatory we can soften
skin<00:02:50.709> diminish<00:02:51.340> lines<00:02:51.610> Brighton<00:02:52.090> eyes<00:02:52.239> etc

skin diminish lines Brighton eyes etc
going<00:02:53.769> down<00:02:54.010> here<00:02:54.280> we<00:02:54.400> see<00:02:54.549> it<00:02:54.700> catch<00:02:54.970> light

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
going down here we see it catch light

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.339 
going down here we see it catch light
enhancers<00:02:55.690> which<00:02:55.870> we've<00:02:56.019> created<00:02:56.230> a

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
enhancers which we've created a

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.289 
enhancers which we've created a
basically<00:02:56.620> boost<00:02:56.980> catch<00:02:57.250> lights<00:02:57.549> and<00:02:57.760> then

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
basically boost catch lights and then

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.479 
basically boost catch lights and then
the<00:02:58.420> 28<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.079> 29<00:02:59.319> the<00:02:59.530> windows<00:02:59.829> softbox<00:03:00.250> catch

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
the 28 and 29 the windows softbox catch

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.130 
the 28 and 29 the windows softbox catch
light<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.000> reflector<00:03:01.450> catch<00:03:01.660> light<00:03:01.900> are

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
light and the reflector catch light are

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.110 
light and the reflector catch light are
actually<00:03:02.769> designed<00:03:02.890> so<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.250> guys<00:03:03.400> can<00:03:03.579> create

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
actually designed so you guys can create

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.880 
actually designed so you guys can create
catch<00:03:04.420> lights<00:03:04.690> where<00:03:05.019> you<00:03:05.170> don't<00:03:05.290> have<00:03:05.590> strong

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
catch lights where you don't have strong

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.770 
catch lights where you don't have strong
ones<00:03:06.160> visible<00:03:06.790> will<00:03:07.239> have<00:03:07.359> specific

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
ones visible will have specific

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.150 
ones visible will have specific
tutorials<00:03:08.170> on<00:03:08.260> all<00:03:08.440> of<00:03:08.560> these<00:03:08.680> so<00:03:08.890> don't<00:03:09.069> worry

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
tutorials on all of these so don't worry

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.009 
tutorials on all of these so don't worry
from<00:03:09.700> here<00:03:09.819> we<00:03:09.970> have<00:03:10.090> color<00:03:10.390> and<00:03:10.629> temperature

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
from here we have color and temperature

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.330 
from here we have color and temperature
modifications<00:03:11.680> where<00:03:11.920> we<00:03:12.010> can<00:03:12.190> basically

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
modifications where we can basically

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.009 
modifications where we can basically
desaturate<00:03:13.209> certain<00:03:13.569> areas<00:03:13.810> of<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:13.989> image

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
desaturate certain areas of the image

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.050 
desaturate certain areas of the image
this<00:03:14.799> is<00:03:14.950> going<00:03:15.069> to<00:03:15.129> be<00:03:15.190> a<00:03:15.250> full<00:03:15.519> desaturation

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
this is going to be a full desaturation

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.220 
this is going to be a full desaturation
words<00:03:16.269> can<00:03:16.420> take<00:03:16.540> it<00:03:16.659> to<00:03:16.720> black<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.049> white

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
words can take it to black and white

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.080 
words can take it to black and white
then<00:03:17.799> we<00:03:17.920> have<00:03:18.069> just<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.280> regular<00:03:18.459> desaturation

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
then we have just a regular desaturation

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.640 
then we have just a regular desaturation
we're<00:03:19.329> kinda<00:03:19.659> to<00:03:19.780> partially<00:03:20.260> takes<00:03:20.470> down<00:03:20.620> the
