just<00:00:40.980> make<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.250> depth<00:00:41.690> maybe<00:00:43.550> about<00:00:44.550> 85<00:00:44.940> yes

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
just make the depth maybe about 85 yes

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.610 
just make the depth maybe about 85 yes
good<00:00:46.760> we'll<00:00:47.760> just<00:00:47.910> copy<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.390> just<00:00:49.170> ctrl-c

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
good we'll just copy that just ctrl-c

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.670 
good we'll just copy that just ctrl-c
ctrl-v<00:00:49.649> link<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.550> duplicate<00:00:51.059> button

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
ctrl-v link is like a duplicate button

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.310 
ctrl-v link is like a duplicate button
not<00:00:52.680> one<00:00:52.800> hundred<00:00:52.860> percent<00:00:53.480> feel<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.600> cap<00:00:54.840> on

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
not one hundred percent feel it cap on

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.650 
not one hundred percent feel it cap on
the<00:00:55.440> start<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.460> end<00:00:56.609> and<00:00:57.149> cut<00:00:57.420> under

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660

captain<00:00:57.989> rounding<00:00:58.350> make<00:00:59.100> your<00:00:59.250> radius<00:00:59.550> about

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
captain rounding make your radius about

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.209 
captain rounding make your radius about
eight<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.780> both<00:01:01.019> of<00:01:01.050> them<00:01:01.260> make<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.949> little<00:01:02.129> bit

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
eight on both of them make a little bit

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.850 
eight on both of them make a little bit
more<00:01:02.280> round<00:01:02.930> when<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:03.960> was<00:01:04.080> ended<00:01:04.289> up<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.649> start

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
more round when I was ended up the start

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.770 
more round when I was ended up the start
so<00:01:05.640> go<00:01:05.820> highlight<00:01:06.420> both<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.690> text<00:01:07.280> font

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
so go highlight both the text font

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.100 
so go highlight both the text font
change<00:01:09.780> punch<00:01:10.050> whatever<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.410> want<00:01:10.619> we'll<00:01:11.399> go

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
change punch whatever you want we'll go

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.899 
change punch whatever you want we'll go
graffiti<00:01:13.110> fonts<00:01:13.380> look<00:01:13.500> good<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.920> suppose<00:01:14.640> that

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
graffiti fonts look good I suppose that

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.450 
graffiti fonts look good I suppose that
looks<00:01:15.330> weird<00:01:19.130> actually<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.220> one's<00:01:20.340> nice

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
looks weird actually that one's nice

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.800 
looks weird actually that one's nice
that's<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:20.880> bad<00:01:21.200> yeah<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:23.640> just<00:01:24.479> copy<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
pull the radius demo two steps or three

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.880 
pull the radius demo two steps or three
centimeters<00:01:38.250> that's<00:01:38.430> not<00:01:38.610> bad<00:01:39.320> um<00:01:40.320> yeah<00:01:40.860> so

can right-click and it moves forwards

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.800 
can right-click and it moves forwards
and<00:02:41.220> backwards<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.790> little<00:02:42.240> handier<00:02:42.750> than

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
using this little thing arrow let's play

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.060 
using this little thing arrow let's play
around<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.270> little<00:02:48.300> bit<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.570> suppose<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:50.990> there

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
around a little bit I suppose that there

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.540 
around a little bit I suppose that there
are<00:02:53.070> hot<00:02:53.580> keys<00:02:53.820> r<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:55.320> for<00:02:55.500> rotate<00:02:55.860> them<00:02:56.010> e<00:02:56.130> is

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
are hot keys r is for rotate them e is

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.910 
are hot keys r is for rotate them e is
for<00:02:56.610> moon<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.330> don't<00:02:57.960> know<00:02:58.020> why<00:02:58.200> e<00:02:58.380> is<00:02:58.410> moved<00:02:58.740> but

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
for moon I don't know why e is moved but

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:07.940 
for moon I don't know why e is moved but
it<00:02:59.010> just<00:02:59.130> is<00:03:01.220> slide<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:05.180> yes<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.330> bad<00:03:06.480> cool<00:03:07.140> so

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
it just is slide that yes I bad cool so

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.470 
it just is slide that yes I bad cool so
the<00:03:08.010> next<00:03:08.040> thing<00:03:08.190> is<00:03:08.310> is<00:03:08.790> render<00:03:09.180> settings

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
the next thing is is render settings

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.110 
the next thing is is render settings
it's<00:03:09.720> also<00:03:09.840> really<00:03:10.080> important<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:11.130> do<00:03:11.280> correct

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
it's also really important to do correct

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.490 
it's also really important to do correct
render<00:03:12.390> settings<00:03:12.660> not<00:03:12.810> correct<00:03:13.140> by<00:03:13.290> suppose

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
render settings not correct by suppose

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.760 
render settings not correct by suppose
ones<00:03:13.680> either<00:03:13.830> like<00:03:14.100> um<00:03:15.170> I'll<00:03:16.170> jump<00:03:16.470> in<00:03:16.560> here

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
ones either like um I'll jump in here

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.700 
ones either like um I'll jump in here
and<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:16.980> ones<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:17.310> like<00:03:18.350> will<00:03:19.350> output

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
and the ones that I like will output

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.980 
and the ones that I like will output
just<00:03:19.950> normally<00:03:20.250> change<00:03:20.490> it<00:03:20.580> to<00:03:20.700> like<00:03:20.880> 1280<00:03:21.870> by

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
just normally change it to like 1280 by

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.910 
just normally change it to like 1280 by
720<00:03:23.360> that's<00:03:24.360> just<00:03:24.600> it's<00:03:24.900> just<00:03:25.020> a<00:03:25.260> good<00:03:25.380> size<00:03:25.620> it

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
720 that's just it's just a good size it

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.090 
720 that's just it's just a good size it
really<00:03:26.100> is<00:03:26.250> i<00:03:26.430> love<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.910> ratio<00:03:27.830> save<00:03:28.830> it<00:03:28.980> as

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
really is i love the ratio save it as

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.460 
really is i love the ratio save it as
like<00:03:29.310> a<00:03:29.340> tiff<00:03:30.030> file<00:03:30.360> i<00:03:30.660> would<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:31.230> just<00:03:31.380> like

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
like a tiff file i would you just like

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.650 
like a tiff file i would you just like
PSD<00:03:31.950> layers<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.550> doesn't<00:03:32.760> really<00:03:32.910> do<00:03:33.120> lies<00:03:33.420> but

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
PSD layers it doesn't really do lies but

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.540 
PSD layers it doesn't really do lies but
i<00:03:33.720> just<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.140> just<00:03:34.290> turns<00:03:34.650> out<00:03:34.860> it<00:03:35.220> just<00:03:35.280> looks

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
i just it just turns out it just looks

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.800 
i just it just turns out it just looks
nice

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.559 

don't<00:03:38.650> worry<00:03:38.800> about<00:03:38.950> multipass

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
don't worry about multipass

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.680 
don't worry about multipass

anti-aliasing best still image unless
you<00:03:43.840> are<00:03:43.989> doing<00:03:44.170> animation<00:03:44.739> and<00:03:44.920> just<00:03:45.099> put<00:03:45.280> a

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
you are doing animation and just put a

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.570 
you are doing animation and just put a
check<00:03:45.520> out<00:03:45.610> on<00:03:45.700> animation<00:03:46.830> a<00:03:47.830> minimum<00:03:48.550> level

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
check out on animation a minimum level

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.330 
check out on animation a minimum level
is<00:03:49.000> kind<00:03:49.270> of<00:03:49.330> weird<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.930> would<00:03:50.709> say<00:03:50.950> just<00:03:50.980> to

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
is kind of weird I would say just to

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.979 
is kind of weird I would say just to
leave<00:03:51.489> it<00:03:51.550> on<00:03:51.790> one<00:03:52.060> by<00:03:52.180> one<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:52.480> four<00:03:52.660> by<00:03:52.780> four

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
leave it on one by one and four by four

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:53.910 
leave it on one by one and four by four
I<00:03:53.110> don't<00:03:53.260> know<00:03:53.319> if<00:03:53.440> that's<00:03:53.590> what<00:03:53.709> I<00:03:53.770> use<00:03:53.890> a

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
I don't know if that's what I use a

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.820 
I don't know if that's what I use a
standard<00:03:54.250> I'm<00:03:54.459> pretty<00:03:54.670> sure<00:03:55.560> that's<00:03:56.560> really

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
standard I'm pretty sure that's really

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.059 
standard I'm pretty sure that's really
it<00:03:57.750> options<00:03:58.750> leaving<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.349> standard<00:03:59.800> they're

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
it options leaving the standard they're

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.270 
it options leaving the standard they're
pretty<00:04:00.370> good<00:04:01.380> effects<00:04:02.380> ambient<00:04:03.130> occlusion

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
pretty good effects ambient occlusion

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.210 
pretty good effects ambient occlusion
global<00:04:04.060> illumination<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:05.530> depth<00:04:05.860> of<00:04:05.980> field

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
global illumination and depth of field

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.059 
global illumination and depth of field
are<00:04:06.910> all<00:04:07.090> really<00:04:07.450> good<00:04:07.569> that's<00:04:08.200> pretty<00:04:08.830> much

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
are all really good that's pretty much

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.479 
are all really good that's pretty much
what<00:04:09.430> makes<00:04:09.610> your<00:04:09.700> text<00:04:10.060> look<00:04:10.269> awesome<00:04:11.489> what

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
what makes your text look awesome what

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.750 
what makes your text look awesome what
is<00:04:12.610> nice<00:04:12.790> I<00:04:13.030> suppose<00:04:13.330> a<00:04:13.569> global<00:04:14.500> illumination

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
is nice I suppose a global illumination

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.909 
is nice I suppose a global illumination
under<00:04:15.760> gamma<00:04:16.030> change<00:04:16.389> it<00:04:16.510> to<00:04:16.600> 2.2<00:04:17.200> which<00:04:17.680> makes

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
under gamma change it to 2.2 which makes

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.280 
under gamma change it to 2.2 which makes
it<00:04:18.040> look<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.190> little<00:04:18.280> bit<00:04:18.489> nicer<00:04:18.700> um<00:04:19.290> that's

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
it look a little bit nicer um that's

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.530 
it look a little bit nicer um that's
become<00:04:20.620> a<00:04:20.650> tip<00:04:20.829> so<00:04:21.669> yeah<00:04:21.850> we'll<00:04:22.090> just<00:04:22.120> maybe

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
become a tip so yeah we'll just maybe

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.890 
become a tip so yeah we'll just maybe
seem<00:04:22.750> a<00:04:22.870> little<00:04:22.990> bit<00:04:23.080> more<00:04:24.660> forward<00:04:25.660> to<00:04:25.780> that

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
seem a little bit more forward to that

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.810
