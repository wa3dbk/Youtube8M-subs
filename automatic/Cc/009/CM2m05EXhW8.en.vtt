00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
pressing space and then even there see

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.930 
pressing space and then even there see
that's<00:00:57.600> how<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.930> do<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.520> that's<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.760> first

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
that's how you do it that's the first

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
one so I do a I have version one state

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:34.739 
one so I do a I have version one state
here's<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.150> color

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:34.749

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
see as you can see I did I had to move

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.310 
see as you can see I did I had to move
it<00:01:58.840> one<00:01:59.650> by<00:01:59.830> one<00:01:59.860> in<00:02:00.370> each<00:02:00.520> place<00:02:00.820> not<00:02:01.420> just

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
it one by one in each place not just

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.810 
it one by one in each place not just
here<00:02:02.800> and<00:02:03.100> then<00:02:03.390> no<00:02:04.390> that's<00:02:05.140> not<00:02:05.320> it<00:02:05.440> good<00:02:05.820> then

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
here and then no that's not it good then

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.330 
here and then no that's not it good then
over<00:02:07.510> here<00:02:07.709> you<00:02:08.709> I<00:02:08.740> don't<00:02:09.009> think<00:02:09.160> you<00:02:09.220> have

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
over here you I don't think you have

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.469 
over here you I don't think you have
this<00:02:09.490> inversion<00:02:09.850> when<00:02:10.119> it's<00:02:10.240> in<00:02:10.330> their

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
this inversion when it's in their

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.590 
this inversion when it's in their
version<00:02:10.780> 5010<00:02:11.140> that<00:02:11.650> means<00:02:11.800> forth<00:02:12.360> as<00:02:13.360> you<00:02:13.390> can

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
version 5010 that means forth as you can

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.590 
version 5010 that means forth as you can
see<00:02:13.720> it's<00:02:13.840> there<00:02:14.050> like<00:02:14.310> how<00:02:15.310> clear<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.150> from

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
see it's there like how clear and from

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:28.560 
see it's there like how clear and from
here<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.050> this<00:02:17.740> is<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.860> size<00:02:27.360> okay<00:02:28.360> that

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
here it is this is the size okay that

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.050 
here it is this is the size okay that
one<00:02:28.810> right<00:02:28.959> there<00:02:29.200> here<00:02:29.709> this<00:02:30.610> one<00:02:30.790> it's<00:02:30.970> the

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
one right there here this one it's the

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.260 
one right there here this one it's the
size<00:02:31.650> this<00:02:32.650> is<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.860> add<00:02:33.010> frame<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:34.090> frame

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
size this is the add frame and the frame

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.830 
size this is the add frame and the frame
naturally<00:02:35.370> these<00:02:36.370> here<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.760> color<00:02:37.090> this<00:02:37.690> one

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
naturally these here is color this one

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.430 
naturally these here is color this one
here<00:02:38.020> has<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.580> duplicate<00:02:39.580> add<00:02:40.540> figure

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
here has to duplicate add figure

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.210 
here has to duplicate add figure
background<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:43.239> this<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.870> speed<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.560> don't

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
background and this is the speed I don't

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.830 
background and this is the speed I don't
think<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.430> will<00:02:45.550> work<00:02:45.760> in<00:02:45.910> fire<00:02:46.209> fire<00:02:46.480> with<00:02:46.660> one

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
think it will work in fire fire with one

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.890 
think it will work in fire fire with one
speed<00:02:47.260> in<00:02:47.440> place<00:02:48.310> top<00:02:48.640> loop<00:02:49.290> renewable<00:02:50.290> file

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
speed in place top loop renewable file

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:59.089 
speed in place top loop renewable file
and<00:02:52.900> then<00:02:53.080> go<00:02:53.320> with<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.590> file

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.660 

okay<00:03:00.099> then<00:03:00.670> this<00:03:00.849> file<00:03:01.120> right<00:03:01.269> here<00:03:01.299> yeah<00:03:01.689> okay

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
okay then this file right here yeah okay

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.740 
okay then this file right here yeah okay
so<00:03:03.670> I<00:03:03.790> think<00:03:03.879> that's<00:03:04.180> all<00:03:04.299> you<00:03:04.329> need<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.629> know

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
so I think that's all you need to know

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.360 
so I think that's all you need to know
