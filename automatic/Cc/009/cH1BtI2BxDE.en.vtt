working<00:00:06.600> on<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.960> muscles<00:00:07.290> of<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.620> head<00:00:07.740> with

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
working on the muscles of the head with

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.860 
working on the muscles of the head with
the<00:00:08.010> head<00:00:08.130> down<00:00:08.160> because<00:00:08.630> sometimes<00:00:09.630> it<00:00:09.750> just

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
the head down because sometimes it just

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.270 
the head down because sometimes it just
takes<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:10.170> while<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.320> get<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.710> horse<00:00:10.889> trained

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
takes a while to get the horse trained

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.700 
takes a while to get the horse trained
to<00:00:11.429> do<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:11.700> but<00:00:12.660> I'll<00:00:12.780> show<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.019> how<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.259> do<00:00:13.440> it

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
to do it but I'll show you how I do it

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.919 
to do it but I'll show you how I do it
and<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:14.160> can<00:00:14.309> practice<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.880> but<00:00:15.360> if<00:00:15.660> you're

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
and you can practice it but if you're

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.840 
and you can practice it but if you're
not<00:00:15.960> if<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.529> horse<00:00:16.710> isn't<00:00:16.890> letting<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.340> do<00:00:17.490> it

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
not if the horse isn't letting you do it

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.060 
not if the horse isn't letting you do it
don't<00:00:18.420> spend<00:00:18.720> on<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.199> mean<00:00:19.470> spend<00:00:19.770> more<00:00:19.859> time

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
don't spend on I mean spend more time

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.769 
don't spend on I mean spend more time
later<00:00:20.310> practicing<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.300> one<00:00:21.449> because<00:00:21.630> I'd

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
later practicing on that one because I'd

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.359 
later practicing on that one because I'd
rather<00:00:21.960> move<00:00:22.230> on<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.650> head<00:00:22.830> up<00:00:22.980> which<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.340> a

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
rather move on to the head up which is a

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.759 
rather move on to the head up which is a
much<00:00:23.580> more<00:00:23.789> it's<00:00:24.300> it's<00:00:24.570> as<00:00:24.750> effective<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.439> in

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
much more it's it's as effective and in

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.730 
much more it's it's as effective and in
some<00:00:25.949> cases<00:00:26.160> more<00:00:26.519> effective<00:00:27.080> I<00:00:28.080> just

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
some cases more effective I just

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.589 
some cases more effective I just
loosened<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.250> here<00:00:29.429> because<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:30.029> like<00:00:30.449> to

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
loosened this here because I like to

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.359 
loosened this here because I like to
have<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> little<00:00:31.080> room<00:00:31.199> up<00:00:31.380> here<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:31.949> these

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
have a little room up here you can these

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.979 
have a little room up here you can these
halters<00:00:32.790> are<00:00:32.910> kind<00:00:33.059> of<00:00:33.090> cool<00:00:33.270> if<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.570> unhook

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
halters are kind of cool if you unhook

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.260 
halters are kind of cool if you unhook
them<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.489> you<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.640> move<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:35.940> around<00:00:36.090> a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
them and you can move this around a

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.119
