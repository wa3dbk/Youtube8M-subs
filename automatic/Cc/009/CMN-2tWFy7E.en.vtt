00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:09.120
 Although the British love to buy cheap goods, we can’t be soft on hunting. 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.510
 Today, the local tyrants from Browning are ready to go. 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:22.510
 Prepare for an extremely luxurious, bloody grouse hunting event 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.840
 Everyone is about to see a top-quality shotgun that is beautifully crafted and has excellent performance. 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.610
 Everyone can see the super luxury hunting car 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.760
 This film will also bring you professional guidance to drive hunting grouse. 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.370
 For this year's hunting season 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.210
 Today they specially brought three top B25 shotguns to everyone. 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.480
 Our group first came to the villa to take a break and let the car's 12-cylinder engine catch your breath. 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.810
 The V12 mark is impressively 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.170
 The best way to celebrate the start of the British hunting season 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.390
 It’s the beginning of the 12th hunting season, hunting with a beautifully crafted B25 shotgun. 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.310
 Of course, today we have amazing Aston Martin and Bentley\N 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.890
 We are driving a 12-cylinder luxury car on the 12th. 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.020
 Come to the beautiful Brockett Manor for hunting 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.670
 It’s just wonderful 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.520
 These luxury cars are provided by Owen HR of Cheltenham 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.770
 Originally we invited Dongm Hotham to give us a detailed introduction to this group of British beasts. 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.350
 Unfortunately, he was late to be explained by Bentley’s brand manager Paul Carver. 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.350
 This is the Bentley GT Speed ​​with W12 engine with a maximum output of 616 hp. 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.670
 GT Speed ​​is currently the fastest Bentley car with a top speed of 329 km / h 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.820
 This is the Aston Martin's Vantage Roadster under the hood with a 6,0 liter V12 engine. 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.820
 The maximum output power is 510 hp and the maximum speed is 305km. 4, 1 second can accelerate from 0 to 60km/h. 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.980
 GTC Speed ​​can also accelerate to 60km/h in 4,5 seconds 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:15.120
 But still maintain the luxury and comfort of the Bentley 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.200
 Aston Martin Vanquish's flagship full body made of carbon fiber 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.580
 Equipped with V12 engine with maximum output power of 565 hp 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.120
 If you are not interested in luxury cars, you can check out these expensive shotguns. But I have to tell a little story first. 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.840
 Our Brockett Manor has a shameful history of luxury cars. 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.890
 In the 1990s, Lord Brockett was arrested and imprisoned for burying a car for fraudulent insurance. 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.450
 But he buried the Italian goods, it is not difficult to understand. 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.290
 Today it has become a high-end golf club 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.860
 The entire manor was built in 1760 and belonged to the Brockett family. 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.200
 I believe that everyone must be familiar with this. Our company took over in the early 1990s. 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.950
 At present, the manor is equipped with two high-end restaurants and banquet halls in the golf competition course. 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.230
 Now it is a high-end sports club. 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.150
 If you have a rest, you can start doing business. 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.120
 But we still have to make sure that our shotguns can show their talents. 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.530
 So we drove to Atkin Grant and Lang Shooting School a few miles away. 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.100
 Here we are always working on the best shooting platform 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.070
 Tim’s dude, they will also give you advice on wearing. 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.450
 This is not a general clay shooting platform. 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.480
 Can you give me a detailed introduction? 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.370
 Ok, we brought the stone construction shooting platform from Yorkshire. 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.730
 It is also planted in the grouse hunting ground. 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.250
 When you look outwards, you can't see the front target and anything else. 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.650
 This is similar to when you were at a lower level when hunting grouse. 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.040
 Six target targets were installed in front of them. 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.930
 In addition we also installed a sports thrower so you can shoot from different angles 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.510
 All this is to create the closest real scene 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.400
 Formally so we spent a lot of time designing this target 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.640
 Our target is to slide down the mountain. 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.140
 Other clay targets fly like a mountain from bottom to top. 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.630
 Charlie, I also played bird guns. 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.630
 Although I am not a local tyrant, I know that this sport is not something that ordinary people can play. 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.660
 Can you give me some advice? 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.330
 Of course, when shooting grouse, you will find that they fly faster and flatter than pheasants and hawthorns. 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.600
 Pheasants generally fly higher 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.070
 So you have to set a long enough guiding distance when playing pheasants. 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.850
 The grouse flies flat so when it flies to you 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.000
 Many times you can still see the bird above the gun. 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.150
 Because you have to lock the direction in which they fly 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.640
 So the lead distance left for you is very short, but you have to respond positively. 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.000
 Indeed, it’s important to master the flight routes of the grouse. 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.170
 When they fly towards you 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.190
 You need to adjust the muzzle to aim at its wing tip according to the route it travels. 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.890
 Let’s come back to know the shotguns used today. 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.360
 Three local tyrants from Browning used different types of shotguns. 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.260
 But they are all from the hands of the masters at the Browning Custom Shop in Liege, Belgium. 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.640
 This is 20 ga, (15,63mm) B25 D5G provided by the Royal Berkshire Shooting School 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.150
 This gun is definitely the most expensive price on the market at 66,000 pounds (about 650,000 RMB). 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.960
 Such a expensive thing is not to say that you can buy it, but the local tyrant is not a minority. 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.850
 And they are willing to pay for the best 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:49.530
 Maybe we are the best shotgun manufacturer in the world. 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.310
 The number of people who come to the gun every week is endless, so you have to book 24 months in advance. 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.720
 Next this is 28 ga, (13,97mm) B25 provided by Ian Kree Shooting Range 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.170
 Andy is quite satisfied with this gun. 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.830
 Few guns are both beautiful and practical like this one. 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.520
 You go to any gun shop 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.940
 B25 can be seen in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.480
 Until today, B25 is still selling well. 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.580
 Few guns can do this 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.430
 The last one is the big man in the Browning family. Arist is your turn to play. 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:36.500
 The gun costs £22,000 (about 220,000 RMB) and includes some extra accessories. 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.430
 Such as this curved buttstock 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.090
 I like this gun most, the gun has a diameter of 12 ga, (about 18,5mm). 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.340
 This is the biggest of the three guns, so you can play the biggest bird. 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.740
 But this is a beautiful weapon price is only half of the D-class panel gun 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.750
 So absolutely worth the money 

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:00.190
 People say that money can't bring happiness but it gives you more choices 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.790
 This means you can choose Aston Martin or Bentley 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.300
 If they can't make your blood flow, the B25 series may make you feel good. 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.500
 Especially when the grouse is like a rocket, it is most needed. 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:16.860
 If you have not seen the addiction 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.930
 Can watch our Browning factory series movies
