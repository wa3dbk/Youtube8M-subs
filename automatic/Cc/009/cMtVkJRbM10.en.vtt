00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.409 
was important to talk about but then
when<00:04:20.160> I<00:04:20.190> was<00:04:20.340> actually<00:04:20.489> shooting<00:04:20.820> it<00:04:21.000> was<00:04:21.239> just

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
when I was actually shooting it was just

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.969 
when I was actually shooting it was just
me<00:04:21.660> in<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.780> room<00:04:22.019> with<00:04:22.199> them<00:04:22.380> so<00:04:22.740> they<00:04:22.919> were

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
me in the room with them so they were

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.070 
me in the room with them so they were
talking<00:04:23.370> directly<00:04:23.550> to<00:04:23.760> me<00:04:24.030> and<00:04:24.240> by<00:04:24.720> not<00:04:24.870> having

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
talking directly to me and by not having

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.409 
talking directly to me and by not having
any<00:04:25.410> crew<00:04:25.680> around<00:04:25.919> i<00:04:26.130> think<00:04:26.370> i<00:04:26.550> was<00:04:27.090> able<00:04:27.240> to

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
any crew around i think i was able to

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.270 
any crew around i think i was able to
keep<00:04:27.600> them<00:04:27.810> from<00:04:27.960> self-censoring<00:04:28.740> themselves

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
keep them from self-censoring themselves

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.830 
keep them from self-censoring themselves
I<00:04:29.460> think<00:04:29.850> if<00:04:29.910> there's<00:04:30.060> other<00:04:30.270> people<00:04:30.570> around

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
I think if there's other people around

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.820 
I think if there's other people around
they<00:04:31.199> would<00:04:31.289> have<00:04:31.380> been<00:04:31.470> worried<00:04:31.770> about

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
they would have been worried about

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.920 
they would have been worried about
saying<00:04:32.160> anything<00:04:32.460> that<00:04:32.580> was<00:04:32.729> to<00:04:32.970> might<00:04:33.810> be

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
saying anything that was to might be

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.560 
saying anything that was to might be
hurtful<00:04:34.169> or<00:04:34.699> loaded<00:04:35.699> in<00:04:35.820> an<00:04:35.940> emotional<00:04:36.389> manner

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
hurtful or loaded in an emotional manner

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.750 
hurtful or loaded in an emotional manner
so<00:04:37.229> that<00:04:37.260> I<00:04:37.919> think<00:04:38.310> they<00:04:38.400> felt<00:04:38.550> really

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
so that I think they felt really

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.969 
so that I think they felt really
confident<00:04:39.240> at<00:04:39.419> that<00:04:39.539> point<00:04:39.780> that<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.830> way<00:04:40.949> I

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
confident at that point that the way I

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.589 
confident at that point that the way I
was<00:04:41.130> going<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.340> take<00:04:41.460> this<00:04:41.580> film<00:04:41.849> wouldn't<00:04:42.479> be

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.219 
beneficial that I can as a transgendered
person<00:05:26.099> go<00:05:26.220> out<00:05:26.370> there<00:05:26.610> and<00:05:26.789> show<00:05:27.690> the<00:05:27.990> piece

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:28.229 
person go out there and show the piece

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:29.390

of work to people and answer their
questions<00:05:29.789> because<00:05:30.120> I<00:05:30.180> think<00:05:30.240> it<00:05:30.449> helps<00:05:30.599> break

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
questions because I think it helps break

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:32.870 
questions because I think it helps break
down<00:05:31.289> certain<00:05:31.830> stigma<00:05:32.130> or<00:05:32.310> stereotypes<00:05:32.820> that

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
down certain stigma or stereotypes that

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.300 
down certain stigma or stereotypes that
people<00:05:33.000> have<00:05:33.360> about<00:05:33.389> transgender<00:05:34.080> people<00:05:34.409> and

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310

just be about trans people and their
gender<00:06:05.369> but<00:06:05.519> all<00:06:05.789> people<00:06:06.179> because<00:06:06.449> we<00:06:06.569> all

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:06.719 
gender but all people because we all

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:08.689 
gender but all people because we all
have<00:06:06.899> our<00:06:06.929> own<00:06:07.079> unique<00:06:07.529> balance<00:06:07.739> of<00:06:08.039> masculine

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:08.699 
have our own unique balance of masculine

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:10.399 
have our own unique balance of masculine
feminine<00:06:08.999> traits<00:06:09.419> and<00:06:09.599> I<00:06:09.689> think<00:06:09.929> that<00:06:10.079> all<00:06:10.259> of

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:10.409 
feminine traits and I think that all of

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:12.799 
feminine traits and I think that all of
us<00:06:10.499> if<00:06:10.739> we're<00:06:10.979> feel<00:06:11.669> confined<00:06:11.999> by<00:06:12.209> the<00:06:12.269> gender

00:06:12.799 --> 00:06:12.809 
us if we're feel confined by the gender

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:15.589 
us if we're feel confined by the gender
binary<00:06:13.049> it<00:06:13.589> puts<00:06:14.519> straitjackets<00:06:15.239> on<00:06:15.359> us<00:06:15.449> all

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 
binary it puts straitjackets on us all

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:18.529 
binary it puts straitjackets on us all
and<00:06:15.749> I<00:06:15.779> think<00:06:16.019> that<00:06:16.199> this<00:06:16.889> is<00:06:16.949> just<00:06:17.339> one<00:06:18.149> film

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539 
and I think that this is just one film

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:19.989 
and I think that this is just one film
of<00:06:18.689> many<00:06:18.989> that<00:06:19.199> will<00:06:19.259> probably<00:06:19.469> hopefully

00:06:19.989 --> 00:06:19.999 
of many that will probably hopefully

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:22.999 
of many that will probably hopefully
look<00:06:20.999> at<00:06:21.119> gender<00:06:21.389> and<00:06:21.809> try<00:06:22.079> to<00:06:22.139> make<00:06:22.409> it<00:06:22.679> more

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009 
look at gender and try to make it more

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.289 
look at gender and try to make it more
open<00:06:23.819> for<00:06:23.999> all<00:06:24.119> of<00:06:24.269> us<00:06:24.889> so<00:06:25.889> when<00:06:26.549> I<00:06:26.789> thank<00:06:27.089> you
