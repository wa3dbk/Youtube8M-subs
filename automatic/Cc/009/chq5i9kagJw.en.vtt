pretty happy and a site like that very
little<00:02:05.860> irrigation<00:02:06.490> required<00:02:06.880> very<00:02:07.180> little

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
little irrigation required very little

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
pruning required you do have some needle

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.250

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
are going to drop some needles and some

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.090 
are going to drop some needles and some
