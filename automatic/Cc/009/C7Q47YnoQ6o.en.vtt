due to add a cell is to add the user

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.150 
due to add a cell is to add the user
interface<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:46.320> i<00:00:46.469> go<00:00:46.500> here<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:46.980> i

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
interface for that so if i go here and i

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.119 
interface for that so if i go here and i
also<00:00:47.370> choose<00:00:47.789> use<00:00:48.780> new<00:00:49.079> files<00:00:49.379> user<00:00:49.649> interface

on<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.520> selectman<00:00:51.059> view<00:00:52.370> then<00:00:53.370> i<00:00:53.550> can<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:53.760> next

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
on a selectman view then i can go next

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.119 
on a selectman view then i can go next
and<00:00:55.410> create<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:57.230> view<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.440> there<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:58.739> well<00:00:58.770> I

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
and create a view in there as well I

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.889 
and create a view in there as well I
think<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.820> made<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> mistake<00:01:00.149> one<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.570> called<00:01:00.809> out

menu view the many of you sell that's it

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.480 
menu view the many of you sell that's it
so<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.060> actually<00:01:06.590> would<00:01:07.590> be<00:01:07.650> our<00:01:07.920> pocket<00:01:08.280> for

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
so that actually would be our pocket for

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.850 
so that actually would be our pocket for
ourselves<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> user<00:01:10.380> interface

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
ourselves but this is a user interface

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.100 
ourselves but this is a user interface
for<00:01:11.040> an<00:01:11.130> iphone<00:01:11.250> application<00:01:12.210> iphone<00:01:12.720> full

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
for an iphone application iphone full

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.750 
for an iphone application iphone full
view<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.590> I'll<00:01:13.710> just<00:01:13.740> need<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.310> delete

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
view so I'll just need to do is delete

view so I'll just need to do is delete
that<00:01:15.060> view<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.930> then<00:01:16.470> add<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:18.200> tableview<00:01:19.200> cell

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
that view and then add a tableview cell

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.870 
that view and then add a tableview cell
to<00:01:20.610> our<00:01:20.790> application<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:22.200> that's<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.880> well

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
to our application and that's it well

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.060 
to our application and that's it well
that's<00:01:24.299> not<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:25.290> still<00:01:25.500> need<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.799> design

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
that's not it we still need to design

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.899 
that's not it we still need to design
that<00:01:26.310> okay<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.680> before<00:01:28.680> we<00:01:29.070> go<00:01:29.220> ahead<00:01:29.490> what<00:01:29.820> we

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
need to do is get design elements that

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.830 
need to do is get design elements that
we're<00:01:31.590> going<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.770> use<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.329> customize<00:01:33.329> this

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
we're going to use to customize this

well<00:01:52.070> alright<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.220> what<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.640> here<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.939> a

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
well alright so what we have here is a

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.639 
well alright so what we have here is a
list<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:56.540> elements<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:57.990> example<00:01:58.079> we<00:01:58.380> have

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
list of elements so for example we have

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.550 
list of elements so for example we have
here<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> calendar<00:02:00.030> view<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:01.140> what<00:02:01.290> we'll<00:02:01.409> have

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
here a calendar view so what we'll have

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.749 
here a calendar view so what we'll have
here<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> couple<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.820> buttons<00:02:04.369> so<00:02:05.369> that's<00:02:05.549> a

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
here is a couple of buttons so that's a

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.380 
here is a couple of buttons so that's a
design<00:02:06.360> for<00:02:06.659> buttons<00:02:07.350> we<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.710> designed<00:02:08.390> so

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
design for buttons we have designed so

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.220 
design for buttons we have designed so
basically<00:02:10.080> gradients<00:02:10.730> here<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.239> this<00:02:13.140> is

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
basically gradients here so this is

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.630 
basically gradients here so this is
going<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.410> be

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
going to be

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.540 
going to be
for<00:02:13.850> our<00:02:14.000> list<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:14.920> then<00:02:15.920> we<00:02:16.310> also<00:02:16.460> have

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
for our list and then we also have

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.610 
for our list and then we also have
different<00:02:17.330> gradients<00:02:17.750> in<00:02:17.930> different<00:02:18.290> colors

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
different gradients in different colors

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.100 
different gradients in different colors
so<00:02:19.459> what<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.670> can<00:02:19.790> see<00:02:19.850> here<00:02:20.030> is<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.360> these<00:02:20.930> are

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
so what you can see here is a these are

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.809 
so what you can see here is a these are
basically<00:02:21.470> design<00:02:22.100> elements<00:02:22.520> that<00:02:22.580> we<00:02:22.670> can

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
basically design elements that we can

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.870 
basically design elements that we can
use<00:02:22.850> to<00:02:23.030> customize<00:02:23.360> our<00:02:23.980> application<00:02:24.980> so<00:02:25.790> I'm

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
use to customize our application so I'm

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.880 
use to customize our application so I'm
going<00:02:26.060> to<00:02:26.090> copy<00:02:26.300> this<00:02:26.450> folder<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:27.080> add<00:02:27.709> it<00:02:27.860> to

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
that we need to add this folder to our

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.530 
that we need to add this folder to our
project<00:02:39.830> so<00:02:40.100> if<00:02:40.220> you<00:02:40.370> give<00:02:41.030> on<00:02:41.120> right<00:02:41.330> click

we'll select the resources folder click
on<00:02:47.270> ADD<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.660> then<00:02:48.410> we've<00:02:48.530> got<00:02:48.560> all<00:02:49.430> our<00:02:49.660> design

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
on ADD and then we've got all our design

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.940 
on ADD and then we've got all our design
elements<00:02:51.080> there<00:02:51.230> we<00:02:51.350> don't<00:02:51.470> need<00:02:51.650> everything

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
elements there we don't need everything

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.580 
elements there we don't need everything
for<00:02:52.610> this<00:02:52.730> application<00:02:53.080> we'll<00:02:54.080> just<00:02:54.290> use<00:02:54.440> the

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
for this application we'll just use the

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.490 
for this application we'll just use the
ones<00:02:54.769> that<00:02:54.950> we<00:02:55.070> think<00:02:55.610> are<00:02:55.880> needed<00:02:56.360> all<00:02:57.230> right

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
ones that we think are needed all right

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
so we're good to go so the next step is

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.800 
so we're good to go so the next step is
to<00:03:01.580> customize<00:03:02.080> their<00:03:03.080> many<00:03:03.860> of<00:03:04.010> you<00:03:04.160> sell<00:03:04.810> this

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
what we're going to do is a add an image

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.680 
what we're going to do is a add an image
view<00:03:08.269> to<00:03:08.480> this<00:03:08.720> cell<00:03:09.050> here<00:03:10.330> okay<00:03:11.330> so<00:03:11.390> that's<00:03:11.570> an

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
view to this cell here okay so that's an

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.199 
view to this cell here okay so that's an
image<00:03:11.959> view<00:03:12.170> this<00:03:12.709> is<00:03:12.860> going<00:03:13.040> to<00:03:13.100> be<00:03:13.190> our<00:03:13.489> is

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
image view this is going to be our is

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:15.820 
image view this is going to be our is
going<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:14.480> be<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.630> background<00:03:15.050> image<00:03:15.170> of<00:03:15.590> the

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
going to be the background image of the

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.420 
going to be the background image of the
outdoor<00:03:16.280> of<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:17.000> cell<00:03:17.530> so<00:03:18.530> let's<00:03:18.709> resize<00:03:19.190> that

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
outdoor of the cell so let's resize that

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.610 
outdoor of the cell so let's resize that
think<00:03:20.000> we<00:03:20.120> need<00:03:20.269> about<00:03:20.530> 220<00:03:21.579> 44<00:03:23.110> let's<00:03:24.110> resize

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
think we need about 220 44 let's resize

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.830 
think we need about 220 44 let's resize
also<00:03:25.100> how<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.430> same<00:03:25.790> dimensions<00:03:26.420> as<00:03:26.540> well

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.539 

okay<00:03:29.840> and<00:03:30.560> then<00:03:30.769> we<00:03:30.860> need<00:03:30.890> to<00:03:31.010> select<00:03:31.400> the

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
okay and then we need to select the

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.910 
okay and then we need to select the
image<00:03:31.790> for<00:03:31.970> that<00:03:32.090> so<00:03:32.810> in<00:03:33.110> this<00:03:33.590> case<00:03:33.769> we're

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
image for that so in this case we're

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.000 
image for that so in this case we're
going<00:03:33.950> to<00:03:34.070> use<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:36.220> menu<00:03:37.959> small.png<00:03:38.959> so<00:03:39.860> that

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
going to use the menu small.png so that

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.610 
going to use the menu small.png so that
gives<00:03:40.670> us<00:03:40.790> like<00:03:41.120> a<00:03:41.150> gradient<00:03:41.870> field<00:03:41.959> kind<00:03:42.560> of

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
gives us like a gradient field kind of

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.640 
gives us like a gradient field kind of
blue<00:03:42.920> gray<00:03:43.400> gradient<00:03:44.110> now<00:03:45.110> we<00:03:45.170> need<00:03:45.350> a<00:03:45.410> label

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650

that will be under that folder so can

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.080 
that will be under that folder so can
resize<00:04:15.079> a<00:04:15.109> little<00:04:15.560> bit<00:04:15.680> and<00:04:16.100> then<00:04:16.700> we<00:04:16.820> need<00:04:16.970> to

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
resize a little bit and then we need to

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.990 
resize a little bit and then we need to
add<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.840> number<00:04:18.169> of<00:04:18.320> images<00:04:19.010> that<00:04:19.430> are<00:04:19.640> in

add the number of images that are in
that<00:04:20.030> folder<00:04:21.070> to<00:04:22.070> do<00:04:22.250> that<00:04:22.460> we<00:04:22.669> also<00:04:22.940> need<00:04:23.330> to

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
that folder to do that we also need to

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.360 
that folder to do that we also need to
add<00:04:23.450> another<00:04:23.900> image<00:04:24.140> view

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:34.960 

track<00:04:28.370> that<00:04:28.580> to<00:04:28.759> the<00:04:28.940> stage<00:04:33.460> then<00:04:34.460> for<00:04:34.789> that

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
track that to the stage then for that

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.040 
track that to the stage then for that
we'll<00:04:35.210> need<00:04:35.240> a<00:04:35.590> count<00:04:37.479> yeah<00:04:38.479> so<00:04:38.690> it's<00:04:38.810> more

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
we'll need a count yeah so it's more

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.730 
we'll need a count yeah so it's more
like<00:04:39.199> a<00:04:39.229> rounded<00:04:39.860> view<00:04:40.310> box<00:04:40.990> and<00:04:41.990> I<00:04:42.110> think<00:04:42.530> this

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
like a rounded view box and I think this

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.300 
like a rounded view box and I think this
is<00:04:42.800> about<00:04:45.729> 30<00:04:46.729> x<00:04:46.970> 22<00:04:47.449> looks<00:04:47.720> like<00:04:47.870> a<00:04:47.900> better

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
is about 30 x 22 looks like a better

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.790 
is about 30 x 22 looks like a better
value<00:04:49.419> okay<00:04:51.550> then<00:04:52.550> we<00:04:52.759> need<00:04:52.789> a<00:04:52.910> label<00:04:53.150> in<00:04:53.419> that

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
value okay then we need a label in that

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.320 
value okay then we need a label in that
so<00:04:54.800> let's<00:04:54.979> drag<00:04:55.190> label<00:04:55.520> across<00:04:55.990> and<00:04:57.729> then<00:04:58.729> just

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
so let's drag label across and then just

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.969 
so let's drag label across and then just
go<00:04:59.509> out<00:04:59.599> a<00:04:59.659> quick<00:04:59.900> count<00:05:00.110> there's<00:05:00.409> just<00:05:00.590> a<00:05:00.710> 10

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
go out a quick count there's just a 10

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:02.860 
go out a quick count there's just a 10
so<00:05:01.310> let's<00:05:01.490> say<00:05:01.580> that<00:05:01.729> 10<00:05:01.909> images<00:05:02.210> in<00:05:02.449> that<00:05:02.659> in

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
so let's say that 10 images in that in

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.040 
so let's say that 10 images in that in
that<00:05:02.930> folder<00:05:04.479> so<00:05:05.479> we<00:05:05.599> need<00:05:05.720> to<00:05:05.780> make<00:05:05.870> sure<00:05:05.930> our

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
that folder so we need to make sure our

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.879 
that folder so we need to make sure our
label<00:05:06.590> fits<00:05:06.949> in<00:05:07.159> that<00:05:07.220> view<00:05:08.139> and<00:05:09.139> in<00:05:09.470> this<00:05:09.590> case

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
label fits in that view and in this case

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:16.170 
label fits in that view and in this case
the<00:05:10.250> color<00:05:10.490> of<00:05:10.729> our<00:05:10.880> text<00:05:11.440> should<00:05:12.440> be<00:05:12.979> white

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.110 

okay<00:05:17.180> so<00:05:17.949> that<00:05:18.949> is<00:05:18.979> actually<00:05:19.310> all<00:05:19.699> the<00:05:19.909> other

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
okay so that is actually all the other

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.700 
okay so that is actually all the other
we<00:05:20.300> need<00:05:20.330> to<00:05:20.479> do<00:05:20.599> for<00:05:20.810> our<00:05:20.840> so<00:05:21.229> let's<00:05:21.500> change

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
we need to do for our so let's change
