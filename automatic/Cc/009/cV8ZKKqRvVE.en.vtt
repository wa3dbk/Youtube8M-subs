00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:52.730
It is last continuation cam test 2.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:06.350
First, active mode test, this is HV30 comparison.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.840
Cam parts: Cam caddie &amp; fish-eye lens.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.070
Has the camera at a position that is lower than the waist while walking.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.480
Again.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.780
A walk is considerably different.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.970
About a cam caddie, it is a handle for cameras.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.830
The last test was also used.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.630
The next Active Mode test was carried out using a bicycle and this.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.630
This is side by side running by bicycle and Freeline.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.940
Since easy to handle HV30 by the cam caddie, this case is smoothness image by bicycle.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.440
The next is Smooth Slow image.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.350
Although this is a function convenient for sport,

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.210
Compared with other models, 3 seconds is short.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:30.420
Next is digital zoom test which was unexpectedly good quality.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.450
I thought digital zoom is bad quality until now,

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.580
Zoom setting x24 and No conversion lens

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.120
It is unexpectedly beautiful.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.540
Compare HV30 digital zoom x40.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.920
Furthermore, zoom x600 by video edit software.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:35.480
XR500V is few noise. its beautiful. It is thought the effect of Exmor R new CMOS sensor.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:45.790
The quality of the digital zoom of this camera seems to be good.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:55.150
The tree is also expressed finely.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:06.560
Finally STD /LOW LUX/NIGHT SHOT compare by night view.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:17.390
Its STD MODE take image by hand.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.600
It is not a slow shutter,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.660
It can be taking ordinarily.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:51.970
LOW LUX MODE.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:19.780
Although the slow shutter is used it is like a real eye.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:33.250
NIGHT SHOT MODE.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:49.500
Although this is a green image occasionally seen by TV SHOW, this is low noises than it.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:57.290
Next is compares by 3 screen &amp; slow.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:22.070
Center is blinking by slow shutter.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:33.280
Although the left doesn't see the shape of the background mountain, STD seems to be the best in all situations.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:08:14.690
I am happy if that was helpful. This was a camera test 2 of XR500V.
