00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.699 
might possibly be wanting to reconnect
with<00:02:43.680> her<00:02:44.010> Center<00:02:44.490> and<00:02:45.350> find<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.500> way<00:02:46.650> to

with her Center and find a way to

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.060 
with her Center and find a way to
comfort<00:02:47.310> her<00:02:47.430> self<00:02:47.810> so<00:02:48.810> when<00:02:49.560> we<00:02:49.680> talked<00:02:49.920> about

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070
