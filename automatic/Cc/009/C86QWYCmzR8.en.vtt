Dave<00:00:02.780> McCall<00:00:03.080> here<00:00:03.350> I'm<00:00:03.919> talking<00:00:04.279> about<00:00:04.340> basis

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:05.029 
Dave McCall here I'm talking about basis

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.080 
Dave McCall here I'm talking about basis
on<00:00:05.300> snowboards<00:00:06.019> a<00:00:06.859> lot<00:00:07.519> of<00:00:07.609> different<00:00:07.880> stuff

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
on snowboards a lot of different stuff

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.780 
on snowboards a lot of different stuff
out<00:00:08.300> there<00:00:08.740> basically<00:00:09.740> starting<00:00:10.370> off<00:00:10.490> there's

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
out there basically starting off there's

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.119 
out there basically starting off there's
two<00:00:11.030> main<00:00:11.179> differences<00:00:11.740> you're<00:00:12.740> looking<00:00:12.980> at

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:13.129 
two main differences you're looking at

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.549 
two main differences you're looking at
extruded<00:00:13.610> versus<00:00:13.969> centered<00:00:14.360> now<00:00:15.049> extruded

extruded<00:00:24.410> bases<00:00:24.740> are<00:00:24.890> you<00:00:25.070> know<00:00:25.189> still<00:00:25.429> very

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
extruded bases are you know still very

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.730 
extruded bases are you know still very
very<00:00:25.939> fast<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:27.050> major<00:00:27.259> difference<00:00:27.679> between

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
very fast the major difference between

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.200 
very fast the major difference between
them<00:00:28.099> and<00:00:28.220> centered<00:00:28.580> is<00:00:28.730> that<00:00:28.939> they're<00:00:29.089> not

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
them and centered is that they're not

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.560 
them and centered is that they're not
quite<00:00:29.509> as<00:00:29.539> porous<00:00:30.140> as<00:00:30.349> a<00:00:30.380> sooner<00:00:31.119> but<00:00:32.119> they<00:00:32.419> are

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
quite as porous as a sooner but they are

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.960 
quite as porous as a sooner but they are
easier<00:00:32.990> to<00:00:33.050> repair<00:00:33.680> sure<00:00:34.070> you<00:00:34.190> get<00:00:34.340> damage<00:00:34.730> in

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
easier to repair sure you get damage in

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.070 
easier to repair sure you get damage in
the<00:00:35.060> park<00:00:35.300> which<00:00:35.480> is<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:35.690> reason<00:00:35.900> why<00:00:35.990> you

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.080 
the park which is the reason why you

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.630 
the park which is the reason why you
included<00:00:36.530> on<00:00:36.590> a<00:00:36.620> lot<00:00:36.740> of<00:00:36.830> freestyle<00:00:37.220> boards

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
included on a lot of freestyle boards

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.510 
included on a lot of freestyle boards
also<00:00:38.210> they<00:00:38.930> don't<00:00:39.020> require<00:00:39.260> waxing<00:00:39.950> quite<00:00:40.370> as

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
also they don't require waxing quite as

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.910 
also they don't require waxing quite as
frequently<00:00:40.700> to<00:00:41.150> maintain<00:00:41.570> their<00:00:41.810> speed<00:00:42.020> not

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
frequently to maintain their speed not

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.560 
frequently to maintain their speed not
having<00:00:43.220> all<00:00:43.310> those<00:00:43.460> pores<00:00:43.820> you<00:00:44.090> know<00:00:44.210> rub<00:00:44.420> on

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
having all those pores you know rub on

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.360 
having all those pores you know rub on
waxes<00:00:45.050> will<00:00:45.170> work<00:00:45.320> really<00:00:45.590> really<00:00:45.740> good<00:00:46.130> on

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
waxes will work really really good on

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.050 
waxes will work really really good on
the<00:00:46.850> surface<00:00:47.450> of<00:00:47.630> the<00:00:48.470> base<00:00:48.700> moving<00:00:49.700> on<00:00:49.790> to<00:00:49.970> the

you're<00:01:10.609> gonna<00:01:10.700> be<00:01:10.909> waxing<00:01:11.270> them<00:01:11.420> definitely<00:01:11.929> a

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960

you're gonna be waxing them definitely a
little<00:01:12.229> bit<00:01:12.350> more<00:01:12.439> they're<00:01:12.950> very<00:01:13.159> porous<00:01:13.729> I

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
little bit more they're very porous I

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.919 
little bit more they're very porous I
usually<00:01:14.719> compare<00:01:15.109> it<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.500> somebody's<00:01:16.340> skin

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:16.929 
usually compare it to somebody's skin

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.779 
usually compare it to somebody's skin
when<00:01:17.929> the<00:01:18.020> bases<00:01:18.350> get<00:01:18.499> dry<00:01:18.770> you<00:01:19.310> put<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.609> wax

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
when the bases get dry you put the wax

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.130 
when the bases get dry you put the wax
I'm<00:01:19.999> just<00:01:20.179> like<00:01:20.270> you<00:01:20.359> put<00:01:20.539> lotion<00:01:20.719> on<00:01:20.960> your

I'm just like you put lotion on your
skin<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.799> you<00:01:22.130> know<00:01:22.460> with<00:01:22.579> the<00:01:22.700> high<00:01:22.850> end

skin and you know with the high end
sintered<00:01:23.270> base<00:01:23.329> you<00:01:23.630> are<00:01:23.749> looking<00:01:24.049> at<00:01:24.140> waxing

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:24.499 
sintered base you are looking at waxing

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:26.260 
sintered base you are looking at waxing
ideally<00:01:25.070> about<00:01:25.280> every<00:01:25.490> three<00:01:25.729> to<00:01:25.850> five<00:01:25.999> times

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
ideally about every three to five times

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.230 
ideally about every three to five times
out<00:01:26.710> you<00:01:27.710> know<00:01:27.799> it's<00:01:27.890> for<00:01:28.039> a<00:01:28.070> hot<00:01:28.249> wax<00:01:28.429> extruded

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
out you know it's for a hot wax extruded

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.789 
out you know it's for a hot wax extruded
basis<00:01:29.659> I<00:01:29.689> would<00:01:30.049> say<00:01:30.229> you're<00:01:30.439> looking<00:01:30.679> at

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
basis I would say you're looking at

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.709 
basis I would say you're looking at
probably<00:01:31.159> anywhere<00:01:31.429> from<00:01:31.939> five<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.569> eight

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
probably anywhere from five to eight

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.889 
probably anywhere from five to eight
times<00:01:32.749> out<00:01:33.729> but<00:01:34.729> like<00:01:34.880> I<00:01:34.939> said<00:01:34.999> Robin<00:01:35.390> rub-ons

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
times out but like I said Robin rub-ons

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:37.090 
times out but like I said Robin rub-ons
worked<00:01:36.140> really<00:01:36.350> good<00:01:36.530> with<00:01:36.710> them

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
worked really good with them

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.370 
worked really good with them
another<00:01:37.909> major<00:01:38.179> differences<00:01:38.659> in<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:38.899> base<00:01:39.079> is

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
another major differences in the base is

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.059 
another major differences in the base is
how<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:40.310> graphics<00:01:40.700> are<00:01:41.210> applied<00:01:41.659> to<00:01:41.990> it<00:01:42.140> the

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
how the graphics are applied to it the

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.859 
how the graphics are applied to it the
older<00:01:43.429> way<00:01:43.549> of<00:01:43.700> doing<00:01:44.030> it<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:44.359> this<00:01:44.450> is<00:01:44.630> still

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
older way of doing it and this is still

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.020 
older way of doing it and this is still
you<00:01:45.200> know<00:01:45.289> definitely<00:01:46.009> practiced<00:01:46.729> by<00:01:46.850> a<00:01:46.880> lot

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
you know definitely practiced by a lot

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.840 
you know definitely practiced by a lot
of<00:01:47.119> companies<00:01:47.479> is<00:01:48.460> subliminally<00:01:49.460> in<00:01:49.579> the<00:01:49.670> base

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
of companies is subliminally in the base

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.109 
of companies is subliminally in the base
this<00:01:50.420> takes<00:01:50.719> a<00:01:50.990> clear<00:01:51.439> ptex<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.219> inks<00:01:52.999> the

inner part of the board this is a little

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:59.649 
inner part of the board this is a little

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
bit cheaper way to produce the board you

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.109 
bit cheaper way to produce the board you
can<00:01:59.719> still<00:02:00.020> use<00:02:00.200> really<00:02:00.590> high-grade<00:02:00.770> peat<00:02:01.729> X's

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119

little<00:02:05.929> bit<00:02:06.020> cheaper<00:02:06.170> from<00:02:06.409> and<00:02:06.619> produce

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
little bit cheaper from and produce

allows<00:02:07.639> you<00:02:07.789> to<00:02:07.909> have<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.060> few<00:02:08.300> more<00:02:08.420> colors

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
allows you to have a few more colors

allows you to have a few more colors
typically<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.890> full<00:02:10.160> pallet<00:02:10.369> of<00:02:10.580> colors<00:02:10.640> on<00:02:11.480> the

typically a full pallet of colors on the

colors are cut out and inlaid next to
each<00:02:29.160> other<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:30.300> saves<00:02:30.630> some<00:02:30.959> weight<00:02:31.140> for

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
each other this saves some weight for

boards that have a mixture of both these
boards<00:03:00.420> obviously<00:03:00.750> have<00:03:00.840> really<00:03:01.080> good<00:03:01.170> pop<00:03:01.440> to

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
boards obviously have really good pop to

them from there the last thing I'd want

them from there the last thing I'd want
to<00:03:08.160> touch<00:03:08.400> on<00:03:09.530> is<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:12.000> quality<00:03:12.630> of<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.780> base

to touch on is the quality of the base
you'll<00:03:13.230> see<00:03:13.410> these<00:03:13.560> listed<00:03:14.010> anywhere<00:03:14.280> from

you'll see these listed anywhere from

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
series are gonna be on your really

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.800 
series are gonna be on your really
high-end<00:03:22.190> freeride<00:03:23.190> boards<00:03:23.780> you<00:03:24.780> know

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
high-end freeride boards you know

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.840 
high-end freeride boards you know
definitely<00:03:25.140> those<00:03:25.680> are<00:03:25.859> required<00:03:26.280> wasting

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
definitely those are required wasting

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
definitely those are required wasting
more<00:03:27.030> than<00:03:27.269> say<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.480> sintered<00:03:27.840> 4400<00:03:38.870> aboard

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870

more than say a sintered 4400 aboard
will<00:03:40.019> be<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.590> lower<00:03:40.799> you<00:03:40.950> go<00:03:41.069> the<00:03:41.100> less

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
will be the lower you go the less

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.090 
will be the lower you go the less
maintenance<00:03:41.880> it<00:03:42.209> will<00:03:42.239> have<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:43.470> really

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
maintenance it will have and really

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.039 
maintenance it will have and really
nowadays<00:03:44.639> even<00:03:45.000> with<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.239> extruded<00:03:45.569> bases

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
nowadays even with the extruded bases

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.229 
nowadays even with the extruded bases
are<00:03:46.200> really<00:03:46.650> really<00:03:46.920> really<00:03:47.400> fast<00:03:47.639> bases<00:03:48.120> out

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
are really really really fast bases out

are really really really fast bases out
there<00:03:48.480> everything<00:03:49.079> you<00:03:49.500> know<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.769> definitely

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
there everything you know is definitely

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.160 
there everything you know is definitely
gonna<00:03:50.280> be<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:50.700> lot<00:03:51.090> faster<00:03:51.600> than<00:03:51.750> that<00:03:51.959> board

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
gonna be a lot faster than that board

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.830 
gonna be a lot faster than that board
you<00:03:52.230> might<00:03:52.410> buy<00:03:52.590> from<00:03:52.829> Target<00:03:53.250> but<00:03:54.150> as<00:03:54.569> far<00:03:54.810> as

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
you might buy from Target but as far as

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.360 
you might buy from Target but as far as
bases<00:03:55.230> go<00:03:55.350> that's<00:03:55.530> pretty<00:03:55.650> much<00:03:55.920> everything<00:03:56.280> I

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370
