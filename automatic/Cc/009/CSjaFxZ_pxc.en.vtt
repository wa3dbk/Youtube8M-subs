00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.390 

right<00:00:02.580> basically<00:00:03.580> I've<00:00:04.509> done<00:00:04.930> here<00:00:05.250> and<00:00:06.250> I've

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:06.400 
right basically I've done here and I've

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.690 
right basically I've done here and I've
got<00:00:06.430> two<00:00:06.790> monitors<00:00:07.259> side<00:00:08.259> by<00:00:08.469> side<00:00:08.740> I've

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
got two monitors side by side I've

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.549 
got two monitors side by side I've
actually<00:00:09.910> stripped<00:00:10.509> one<00:00:10.839> of<00:00:10.990> my<00:00:11.110> monitors

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:11.559 
actually stripped one of my monitors

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.689 
actually stripped one of my monitors
down<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:13.509> one<00:00:13.690> on<00:00:13.719> the<00:00:13.839> right<00:00:13.929> hands<00:00:14.650> used<00:00:15.549> to

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:15.699 
down the one on the right hands used to

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:17.790 
down the one on the right hands used to
have<00:00:15.849> all<00:00:16.030> big<00:00:16.240> plastic<00:00:16.480> surround<00:00:17.020> on<00:00:17.410> it<00:00:17.590> and

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:17.800 
have all big plastic surround on it and

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.970 
have all big plastic surround on it and
you<00:00:18.310> just<00:00:18.509> get<00:00:19.509> so<00:00:19.929> much<00:00:20.080> faith<00:00:20.380> taken<00:00:20.890> out

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:20.980 
you just get so much faith taken out

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.200 
you just get so much faith taken out
when<00:00:21.099> you<00:00:21.160> put<00:00:21.339> them<00:00:21.429> together<00:00:21.490> it<00:00:21.849> didn't

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
when you put them together it didn't

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.290 
when you put them together it didn't
quite<00:00:22.420> work<00:00:22.660> as<00:00:23.109> well<00:00:23.410> so<00:00:24.009> I've<00:00:24.669> taken<00:00:25.000> all<00:00:25.210> the

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
quite work as well so I've taken all the

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.609 
quite work as well so I've taken all the
plastic<00:00:25.720> surround<00:00:25.960> or<00:00:26.169> five<00:00:26.289> basically

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
plastic surround or five basically

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.710 
plastic surround or five basically
modified<00:00:27.189> it<00:00:27.429> to<00:00:27.460> get<00:00:27.730> as<00:00:27.849> close<00:00:28.060> together<00:00:28.419> as

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
modified it to get as close together as

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.360 
modified it to get as close together as
possible<00:00:30.480> I'm<00:00:31.480> going<00:00:31.689> to<00:00:31.950> attempt<00:00:32.950> to<00:00:33.040> see<00:00:33.310> how

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
possible I'm going to attempt to see how

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.150 
possible I'm going to attempt to see how
many<00:00:33.430> games<00:00:33.790> off<00:00:34.150> and<00:00:34.390> get<00:00:34.660> to<00:00:35.470> run<00:00:35.800> in<00:00:36.100> a

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
many games off and get to run in a

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.220 
many games off and get to run in a
multiple<00:00:36.640> monitor<00:00:37.120> and<00:00:37.240> configuration<00:00:38.110> or

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
multiple monitor and configuration or

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.550 
multiple monitor and configuration or
dual<00:00:38.890> monitor<00:00:39.310> if<00:00:39.430> you<00:00:39.550> want<00:00:39.730> to<00:00:39.820> call<00:00:40.000> it<00:00:40.030> that

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
dual monitor if you want to call it that

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.640 
dual monitor if you want to call it that
I<00:00:41.560> thought<00:00:42.250> I<00:00:42.280> start<00:00:42.700> with<00:00:43.030> halo<00:00:43.570> it's<00:00:44.380> an

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
I thought I start with halo it's an

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.960 
I thought I start with halo it's an
older<00:00:44.980> game<00:00:45.220> obviously<00:00:45.700> an<00:00:46.300> absolute<00:00:46.720> classic

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
older game obviously an absolute classic

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.320 
older game obviously an absolute classic
the<00:00:48.970> demands<00:00:49.390> on<00:00:50.080> performance<00:00:50.860> as<00:00:51.820> far<00:00:52.150> as<00:00:52.270> the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
the demands on performance as far as the

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.960 
the demands on performance as far as the
pc<00:00:52.780> goes<00:00:53.020> is<00:00:53.230> not<00:00:53.500> that<00:00:53.680> great<00:00:53.920> so<00:00:54.280> we<00:00:54.940> can

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
pc goes is not that great so we can

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.610 
pc goes is not that great so we can
stretch<00:00:55.480> it<00:00:55.510> out<00:00:55.780> cross<00:00:56.200> two<00:00:56.470> monitors<00:00:56.770> and

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.880 

it<00:01:00.160> should<00:01:00.489> run<00:01:00.850> pretty<00:01:01.629> good<00:01:01.930> I've<00:01:02.140> got<00:01:02.620> two

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
it should run pretty good I've got two

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.050 
it should run pretty good I've got two
radeon<00:01:03.720> x1950<00:01:04.720> s<00:01:05.049> cross<00:01:05.320> slide<00:01:05.650> in<00:01:05.920> there<00:01:06.159> so

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
radeon x1950 s cross slide in there so

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.740 
radeon x1950 s cross slide in there so
well<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:09.040> should<00:01:09.430> pretty<00:01:10.030> much<00:01:10.150> handle<00:01:10.690> it

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
well it should pretty much handle it

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.200 
well it should pretty much handle it
quite<00:01:10.990> well<00:01:11.200> so<00:01:11.470> what<00:01:12.070> I've<00:01:12.159> done<00:01:12.369> I've<00:01:12.610> taken

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
quite well so what I've done I've taken

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.160 
quite well so what I've done I've taken
halo<00:01:13.750> I'll<00:01:14.619> put<00:01:14.830> it<00:01:14.920> into<00:01:15.100> windows<00:01:15.520> mode

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
halo I'll put it into windows mode

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.139 
halo I'll put it into windows mode
running<00:01:17.170> it<00:01:17.259> in<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.409> window<00:01:17.740> I've<00:01:18.610> stretched

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
running it in a window I've stretched

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.600 
running it in a window I've stretched
the<00:01:19.390> window<00:01:19.750> right<00:01:20.140> out<00:01:20.380> across<00:01:20.710> two<00:01:21.070> monitors

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
the window right out across two monitors

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.530 
the window right out across two monitors
and<00:01:22.229> up<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.380> resolution<00:01:24.070> of<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.310> game<00:01:24.550> sort

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
and up the resolution of the game sort

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.149 
and up the resolution of the game sort
of<00:01:25.659> get<00:01:26.140> that<00:01:26.290> aspect<00:01:26.860> ratio<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:28.979> yeah<00:01:29.979> the

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
of get that aspect ratio and yeah the

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.490 
of get that aspect ratio and yeah the
two<00:01:30.369> monitors<00:01:30.700> quiet<00:01:31.600> as<00:01:31.899> close<00:01:32.170> to<00:01:32.320> get

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
two monitors quiet as close to get

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.889 
two monitors quiet as close to get
result<00:01:32.770> get<00:01:33.009> them<00:01:33.190> any<00:01:33.310> way<00:01:33.490> physically<00:01:33.940> so

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
result get them any way physically so

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:36.870 
result get them any way physically so
I'm<00:01:35.320> going<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.470> see<00:01:35.649> how<00:01:35.679> it<00:01:35.890> goes<00:01:35.920> I've<00:01:36.670> got<00:01:36.850> a

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
I'm going to see how it goes I've got a

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.139 
I'm going to see how it goes I've got a
feeling<00:01:37.119> Chris<00:01:37.539> the<00:01:37.690> crosshair<00:01:38.350> is<00:01:38.970> where<00:01:39.970> the

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
feeling Chris the crosshair is where the

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:42.120 
feeling Chris the crosshair is where the
center<00:01:40.479> of<00:01:40.509> the<00:01:40.630> monitors<00:01:41.020> is<00:01:41.259> it's<00:01:41.800> going<00:01:42.039> to

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
center of the monitors is it's going to

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.359 
center of the monitors is it's going to
be<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.280> bit<00:01:42.520> awkward<00:01:42.640> bar<00:01:43.330> you<00:01:44.170> know<00:01:44.369> it's

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
be a bit awkward bar you know it's

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.840 
be a bit awkward bar you know it's
clearly<00:01:46.060> like<00:01:46.710> experimental<00:01:47.710> so<00:01:47.920> I'll<00:01:48.729> give

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
clearly like experimental so I'll give

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.130 
clearly like experimental so I'll give
it<00:01:48.880> a<00:01:49.000> try<00:01:49.030> anyway<00:01:49.679> all<00:01:50.679> right

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.880 

so<00:01:55.140> here<00:01:55.290> we<00:01:55.320> go<00:01:55.410> as<00:01:55.950> halo<00:01:56.750> running<00:01:57.750> across<00:01:57.990> two

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
so here we go as halo running across two

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.030 
so here we go as halo running across two
monitors<00:02:00.860> no<00:02:01.860> real<00:02:02.130> speed<00:02:02.580> drop<00:02:03.770> seems<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.950> be

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
monitors no real speed drop seems to be

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.240 
monitors no real speed drop seems to be
running<00:02:05.160> a<00:02:05.370> quite<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> good<00:02:05.880> frame<00:02:06.180> rate<00:02:06.420> still

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
running a quite a good frame rate still

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.570 
running a quite a good frame rate still
I'm<00:02:08.250> going<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.430> go<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.760> a<00:02:08.850> multiplayer<00:02:09.240> and<00:02:10.580> get

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
I'm going to go in a multiplayer and get

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.630 
I'm going to go in a multiplayer and get
my<00:02:11.730> ass<00:02:11.880> kicked<00:02:12.230> but<00:02:13.230> I'm<00:02:14.010> just<00:02:14.340> basically

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
my ass kicked but I'm just basically

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.100 
my ass kicked but I'm just basically
demonstrating<00:02:15.770> what<00:02:16.770> we<00:02:16.950> can<00:02:17.160> do

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
demonstrating what we can do

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.810 
demonstrating what we can do
you<00:02:19.650> get<00:02:19.800> two<00:02:20.010> monitors<00:02:20.310> together<00:02:22.640> find<00:02:23.640> a

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
you get two monitors together find a

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.040 
you get two monitors together find a
server<00:02:25.670> find<00:02:26.670> something<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.540> want<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.470> do

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
server find something I want to do

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.360 
server find something I want to do
server<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.290> full<00:02:31.910> typical<00:02:33.920> let's<00:02:34.920> just<00:02:35.010> create

server is full typical let's just create

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.450 
server is full typical let's just create
an<00:02:35.550> internet<00:02:35.940> game<00:02:36.830> just<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:38.010> give<00:02:38.190> you<00:02:38.310> the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
an internet game just to give you the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.930 
an internet game just to give you the
idea

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.750 

you<00:02:43.940> go<00:02:44.440> right<00:02:45.440> yeah<00:02:45.710> as<00:02:45.950> I<00:02:46.160> was<00:02:46.310> saying<00:02:46.340> the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
you go right yeah as I was saying the

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.290 
you go right yeah as I was saying the
crosshair<00:02:47.300> is<00:02:48.200> in<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:48.860> middle<00:02:49.100> here<00:02:49.400> but<00:02:50.120> it's

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
crosshair is in the middle here but it's

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.610 
crosshair is in the middle here but it's
slightly<00:02:50.630> to<00:02:50.990> the<00:02:51.050> left<00:02:51.170> where<00:02:51.860> your<00:02:53.620> when

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
slightly to the left where your when

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.210 
slightly to the left where your when
your<00:02:54.770> shots<00:02:55.130> actually<00:02:55.400> go<00:02:56.080> so<00:02:57.080> can<00:02:58.010> get<00:02:58.190> a

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
your shots actually go so can get a

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.660 
your shots actually go so can get a
basic<00:02:58.520> idea<00:02:58.760> of<00:02:59.240> where<00:02:59.720> I'll<00:02:59.840> go<00:03:00.020> get<00:03:00.670> the

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
basic idea of where I'll go get the

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.120 
basic idea of where I'll go get the
crosshair<00:03:02.180> together<00:03:02.870> headshot<00:03:03.590> business<00:03:03.980> or

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
crosshair together headshot business or

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.580 
crosshair together headshot business or
something<00:03:04.340> like<00:03:04.580> that<00:03:04.640> as<00:03:05.330> you<00:03:06.290> can<00:03:06.380> see<00:03:06.500> the

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
something like that as you can see the

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.950 
something like that as you can see the
frame<00:03:06.860> rates<00:03:07.130> really<00:03:07.550> good<00:03:07.820> haven't<00:03:08.780> really

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
frame rates really good haven't really

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.860 
frame rates really good haven't really
got<00:03:09.110> a<00:03:09.140> drop<00:03:09.410> their<00:03:10.420> hope<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:11.540> frightened<00:03:11.810> my

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
got a drop their hope you frightened my

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.580 
got a drop their hope you frightened my
legs<00:03:12.050> now

running not too bad there's no problem

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.559 
running not too bad there's no problem
with<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.550> vsync<00:03:23.120> or<00:03:23.390> anything<00:03:24.069> so<00:03:25.090> yeah<00:03:26.090> this

with the vsync or anything so yeah this
is<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.870> first<00:03:27.110> game<00:03:27.349> anyway<00:03:27.800> I<00:03:27.830> wanted<00:03:28.010> to<00:03:28.250> try

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
is the first game anyway I wanted to try

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.330 
is the first game anyway I wanted to try
with<00:03:28.849> two<00:03:29.120> monitors<00:03:29.739> I'm<00:03:30.739> going<00:03:30.920> to<00:03:31.010> be<00:03:31.099> trying

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
with two monitors I'm going to be trying

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.130 
with two monitors I'm going to be trying
to<00:03:31.519> some<00:03:31.760> others<00:03:31.910> more<00:03:32.269> up-to-date<00:03:32.660> games

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
to some others more up-to-date games

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.380 
to some others more up-to-date games
unreal<00:03:33.620> tournament<00:03:33.890> I'm<00:03:34.700> going<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:34.970> see<00:03:35.150> if<00:03:35.180> I

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
unreal tournament I'm going to see if I

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.850 
unreal tournament I'm going to see if I
can<00:03:35.450> get<00:03:35.720> that<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:36.170> go<00:03:36.200> across<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:38.739> again<00:03:39.739> I'll

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
can get that to go across to again I'll

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.100 
can get that to go across to again I'll
have<00:03:39.980> to<00:03:40.099> force<00:03:40.340> a<00:03:40.549> in<00:03:40.610> the<00:03:40.730> windows<00:03:41.120> mode<00:03:41.390> you

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
have to force a in the windows mode you

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.190 
have to force a in the windows mode you
have<00:03:42.319> to<00:03:42.470> do<00:03:42.650> that<00:03:42.860> because<00:03:43.010> natively<00:03:44.200> most

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
have to do that because natively most

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.080 
have to do that because natively most
games<00:03:46.900> will<00:03:47.900> go<00:03:48.410> into<00:03:48.590> one<00:03:48.920> monitor<00:03:49.340> that

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
games will go into one monitor that

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.949 
games will go into one monitor that
should<00:03:50.329> name<00:03:50.950> primary<00:03:51.950> monitor<00:03:52.130> and<00:03:52.959> so

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
should name primary monitor and so

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.750 
should name primary monitor and so
you've<00:03:54.260> got<00:03:54.290> a<00:03:54.500> sort<00:03:55.040> of<00:03:55.099> force<00:03:55.370> it<00:03:55.549> into<00:03:55.640> a

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
you've got a sort of force it into a

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.680 
you've got a sort of force it into a
windows<00:03:56.180> mode<00:03:56.480> to<00:03:56.720> get<00:03:56.870> it<00:03:56.959> to<00:03:57.049> do<00:03:57.230> that<00:03:58.690> most

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
windows mode to get it to do that most

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.270 
windows mode to get it to do that most
games<00:03:59.930> are<00:04:00.140> being<00:04:00.349> played<00:04:00.470> on<00:04:00.709> multiple

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
games are being played on multiple

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.430 
games are being played on multiple
monitors<00:04:01.610> a<00:04:01.640> flight<00:04:02.030> simulator<00:04:02.390> stuff<00:04:03.170> like

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
monitors a flight simulator stuff like

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.750 
monitors a flight simulator stuff like
that<00:04:04.209> so<00:04:05.209> I<00:04:05.299> sort<00:04:05.660> wanted<00:04:06.019> to<00:04:06.400> see<00:04:07.400> what<00:04:07.579> other

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
that so I sort wanted to see what other

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.840 
that so I sort wanted to see what other
games<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.599> can<00:04:08.840> play<00:04:09.519> using<00:04:10.519> two<00:04:10.910> monitors

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.870 

I<00:04:13.940> think<00:04:15.340> first-person<00:04:16.340> shooter<00:04:16.580> games

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
I think first-person shooter games

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.310 
I think first-person shooter games
you're<00:04:17.090> always<00:04:17.420> going<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.720> end<00:04:17.870> up<00:04:18.050> with<00:04:18.110> your

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
you're always going to end up with your

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.680 
you're always going to end up with your
crosshair<00:04:18.830> in<00:04:18.950> the<00:04:19.040> middle<00:04:19.370> but<00:04:20.180> again<00:04:20.300> i'm

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
crosshair in the middle but again i'm

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.850 
crosshair in the middle but again i'm
going<00:04:20.900> to<00:04:20.959> try<00:04:21.140> and<00:04:22.480> using<00:04:23.480> some<00:04:23.690> mods<00:04:23.960> stuff

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
going to try and using some mods stuff

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.380 
going to try and using some mods stuff
like<00:04:25.070> that<00:04:25.100> see<00:04:25.550> if<00:04:25.610> i<00:04:25.730> can<00:04:25.880> shift<00:04:26.120> it<00:04:26.300> over

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
like that see if i can shift it over

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.440 
like that see if i can shift it over
slightly<00:04:27.040> so<00:04:28.040> we're<00:04:28.250> predominantly<00:04:29.030> on<00:04:29.270> the

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
slightly so we're predominantly on the

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.510 
slightly so we're predominantly on the
left<00:04:29.690> or<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:29.960> right<00:04:30.080> with<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.800> crosshair<00:04:31.310> and

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
left or the right with the crosshair and

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.860 
left or the right with the crosshair and
then<00:04:32.480> you<00:04:32.630> get<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.610> base<00:04:34.610> panoramic<00:04:35.330> view<00:04:35.540> for

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
then you get the base panoramic view for

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.580 
then you get the base panoramic view for
everything<00:04:36.290> else<00:04:37.690> i'm<00:04:38.690> also<00:04:38.900> going<00:04:39.260> to<00:04:39.320> try

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
everything else i'm also going to try

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.620 
everything else i'm also going to try
and<00:04:39.620> see<00:04:39.920> if<00:04:39.950> i<00:04:40.160> can<00:04:40.370> get<00:04:40.520> a<00:04:40.580> rear<00:04:40.910> view<00:04:40.940> running

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
and see if i can get a rear view running

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.700 
and see if i can get a rear view running
on<00:04:41.780> one<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:42.460> you<00:04:43.460> forward<00:04:43.970> you<00:04:44.180> on<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.510> other

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
on one and you forward you on the other

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.040 
on one and you forward you on the other
so<00:04:45.710> you<00:04:46.550> can<00:04:46.760> basically<00:04:46.940> always<00:04:47.300> see<00:04:47.750> what's

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
so you can basically always see what's

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.550 
so you can basically always see what's
behind<00:04:48.290> you<00:04:48.940> there's<00:04:49.940> another<00:04:50.060> option<00:04:50.560> and

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
behind you there's another option and

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.840 
behind you there's another option and
this<00:04:51.860> is<00:04:51.980> the<00:04:52.130> first<00:04:52.160> of<00:04:52.730> my<00:04:52.880> texts<00:04:54.370> using<00:04:55.370> two

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
this is the first of my texts using two

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.740 
this is the first of my texts using two
monitors<00:04:57.490> if<00:04:58.490> I<00:04:58.610> can<00:04:58.760> get<00:04:58.850> another<00:04:59.150> one<00:04:59.450> and

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
monitors if I can get another one and

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.750 
monitors if I can get another one and
it's<00:05:00.470> got<00:05:00.740> quite<00:05:01.580> a<00:05:01.990> slim

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
it's got quite a slim

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.870
