00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.929
 I'm back here I discovered the breaks and 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.670
 to finish assume that you are here in 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.050
 car retreading wheels running through the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:22.490
 streets have not cleaned right is a 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:28.279
 respected here for you is a way 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:32.219
 which will be very good and safer 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:35.370
 system of adaptation of a 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.040
 century was for you but you followed 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.829
 the same ones here to do it right not 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.950
 just to remember, they took advantage of both 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.219
 two right holes of the six screws 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.480
 I was in a club that has the right group. 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:55.860
 and stuck the two some right choice and 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.449
 after being stuck mark correctly 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.899
 the other two are to escape 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:05.010
 through here will be among the other 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:08.729
 four screws that hold the right goal 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.340
 system that we talked about because the vote is 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.560
 improve in the case will be as follows 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:19.500
 rip off this combo as a 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:23.250
 Inside video is to get another cube same 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.350
 acts in good condition to take care of the 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.140
 next would take around asking for a 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.140
 friend cut that part that has 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.820
 convicted three had been yet another 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.869
 aesthetic and this will not change much 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.270
 certain thing is that in these 10 that well in the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.930
 Caution, I'm careful here. Not here. 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.880
 strip out the less is this 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.689
 and here is where the holding bolts 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.399
 the cube 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:56.280
 instead of using block 3 4 as I was going to 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:58.730
 do three can be framed like me 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:04.760
 I did in the case of 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:08.750
 just do is do and do not do 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.910
 different giving best is is rather than 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.010
 drill and call 7 8th is ensured 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.380
 grotesque of a public doing a service 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:20.440
 more neat and go and stick with a 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.450
 straight - edge drill to avoid 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.890
 fatality straight in a cavity 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.650
 rounded like ordinary plates make 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.930
 I'm going to put a screw in here 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:34.040
 right stayed in the fair inside the hole 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.860
 and sunk right it looks more beautiful 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:42.800
 let yourself be in the right cube 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.850
 full is closed and with the corner only 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:48.440
 same day 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:50.060
 now we hope that you here is a 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.610
 Way better way I was 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:59.510
 serious talking bored 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:01.310
 the four holes here with a drill that 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.520
 give to the measure of the screw that you are 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:09.590
 use here one step further and it will enter 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.660
 these holes just do not stay in that 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.989
 hole as I did here is a 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.250
 provisional way when when I did 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.300
 had not observed the efficient way 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.670
 that finishes better and certain 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.050
 This is how a turner knew 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.050
 the taper cut the excess 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.400
 ed 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:36.390
 What do I do with a wheel hub 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.549
 here to fit right here the measure 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.989
 not paid on a good sports car is a 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:44.969
 only that it is fitted under pressure 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.209
 it will make a case a make a 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:49.200
 cavity around the door one 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:55.530
 little bigger 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:57.180
 sure and will make a citizen a centralizer 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.470
 to enter pressure and be well 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.269
 centralized 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:05.159
 Why not just have more. 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.349
 own security and avoid 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:09.150
 of blows and move to live will start to 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.579
 tighten the bolts the more 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.959
 pressure to the magnificent under tension 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.209
 which can lead to an overflow of 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.919
 screws and quantified the 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.660
 centralized and prevents this 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.789
 card the council kick goes 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.460
 continue in place without affecting 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:28.009
 screws right this way I go 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:33.449
 do one in my car 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:35.159
 the next step is cool and show 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.930
 For now, this is what I have. 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:42.440
 that show up giving the tip to 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:45.210
 you to do this procedure that 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.729
 no problem if I did not here 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.070
 and has not had not caught rocking track 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:53.520
 does not take for a while in the city but how 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.610
 get the track and I'm going to leave more 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:05:02.479
 own city is better to do this 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:06.020
 system and you will not have 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.020
 legal problem 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:13.619
 repeating in the neighborhoods, are not you? 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:15.749
 took two holes out of the six 

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:20.219
 hex bolts that ensure that 

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:23.369
 attach the hub to the tray system 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:27.079
 of the vehicle in the cool car you 

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:30.269
 take advantage of 12 measures 

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:32.279
 recovered for cgu rice and then 

00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:35.759
 between the other four will 

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:39.149
 mark up to have the four 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:42.389
 correct way to cross holes 

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:47.909
 Balancing gave perfect for the can 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:49.679
 give 160 150 that which has no problem 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:52.379
 balance had no direction 

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:55.229
 much better serve the adapters and 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:56.939
 use the adapter on all four wheels but is 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:59.309
 horrible would not recommend to anyone else's 

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:03.269
 with more be well done never 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:06.179
 gives the correct centralization of the 

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:08.399
 right and outside screws that grips the 

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:11.279
 this way I did not 

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:14.459
 You have this problem right ensures people 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:15.919
 You will enjoy good time beauty close 

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:18.269
 month as I said show in detail 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:23.189
 such as the event disc brake system 

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:24.929
 in the back of the car is cool that you 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:29.969
 because it was like to enjoy and share 

00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:32.639
 27 staff have more comments and take into 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:34.800
 keep more videos beaten from watching the 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:38.899
 staff that tinkering also liked staff 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.899
 beauty a hug
