00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
be focusing on here in a second we want

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.220 
be focusing on here in a second we want
to<00:02:53.739> make<00:02:53.890> sure<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.910> best<00:02:55.150> piece<00:02:55.420> this<00:02:56.019> piece

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
to make sure the best piece this piece

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.630 
to make sure the best piece this piece
right<00:02:56.380> here<00:02:56.500> hits<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.370> metal<00:02:57.840> teste<00:02:58.840> that

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
right here hits the metal teste that

right here hits the metal teste that
hits<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.880> metal<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:01.269> that's<00:03:01.420> as<00:03:01.569> far<00:03:01.840> as<00:03:01.900> it's

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
hits the metal so that's as far as it's

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.250 
hits the metal so that's as far as it's
going<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.620> go<00:03:02.739> ok<00:03:03.340> so<00:03:04.209> that's<00:03:04.390> good<00:03:04.720> actually
