00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
see the difference this is the natural

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.750 
see the difference this is the natural
this<00:03:46.200> is<00:03:46.380> more<00:03:46.590> less<00:03:46.769> more<00:03:46.799> than<00:03:47.069> a<00:03:47.100> realistic

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
this is more less more than a realistic

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.330

and<00:03:47.940> then<00:03:48.390> this<00:03:48.540> looks<00:03:48.870> like<00:03:49.049> okay<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:49.920> all<00:03:50.310> I

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
and then this looks like okay and all I

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.220 
and then this looks like okay and all I
did<00:03:50.700> was<00:03:50.730> just<00:03:51.090> repeat<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.450> same<00:03:51.810> stuff<00:03:52.049> what

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230

did was just repeat the same stuff what
I<00:03:52.260> get<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:52.500> decide<00:03:52.860> on<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.220> this<00:03:53.400> side<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:54.239> as

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
I get to decide on to this side and as

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.900 
I get to decide on to this side and as
you<00:03:54.569> can<00:03:54.750> see<00:03:54.780> it<00:03:55.410> makes<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.130> hairline<00:03:56.700> look

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910
