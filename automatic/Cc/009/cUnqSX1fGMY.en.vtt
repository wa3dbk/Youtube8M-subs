and<00:01:34.009> well<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.159> felt<00:01:35.490> there<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.720> after<00:01:37.049> some

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
and well I felt there so after some

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.670 
and well I felt there so after some
testing<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.340> found<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.350> umbrella<00:01:40.350> and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
testing I found that the umbrella and

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.060 
testing I found that the umbrella and
the<00:01:40.890> orange<00:01:41.340> umbrella<00:01:42.470> didn't<00:01:43.470> work<00:01:43.680> at<00:01:43.860> all

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
the orange umbrella didn't work at all

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.870 
the orange umbrella didn't work at all
they<00:01:44.729> won't<00:01:45.439> kind<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.619> reduce<00:01:47.369> your<00:01:47.579> for

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
they won't kind of reduce your for

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.710 
they won't kind of reduce your for
damage<00:01:48.240> at<00:01:49.049> all<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:50.040> only<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.549> yellow<00:01:51.060> one<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
damage at all so only the yellow one the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.760 
damage at all so only the yellow one the
pink<00:01:52.200> one<00:01:52.290> line<00:01:53.250> 1<00:01:53.700> blue<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.869> red<00:01:55.020> works

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
pink one line 1 blue and the red works

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.420 
pink one line 1 blue and the red works
so<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.460> hold<00:01:56.969> umbrella<00:01:57.649> you<00:01:58.649> press<00:01:58.979> shift

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
so you hold umbrella you press shift

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
so you hold umbrella you press shift
well

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
well

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.990 
well
descending<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.700> you<00:02:02.700> slowly<00:02:03.390> going<00:02:04.259> down

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
descending and you slowly going down

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.790 
descending and you slowly going down
through<00:02:06.320> ground<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.970> well<00:02:09.289> it<00:02:10.289> seems<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.649> I

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
through ground and well it seems that I

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.500 
through ground and well it seems that I
fell<00:02:11.690> strangely<00:02:12.690> enough<00:02:13.580> well<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:15.030> seems<00:02:15.390> that

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
fell strangely enough well it seems that

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.009 
fell strangely enough well it seems that
it<00:02:16.130> still<00:02:17.130> isn't<00:02:17.819> working<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.349> huge<00:02:20.040> bug

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
it still isn't working it is a huge bug

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.320 
it still isn't working it is a huge bug
me<00:02:22.019> because<00:02:22.410> this<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.950> main<00:02:23.160> feature<00:02:23.489> of<00:02:23.940> mod

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
me because this the main feature of mod

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.660 
me because this the main feature of mod
so<00:02:25.110> i<00:02:25.530> think<00:02:25.709> i<00:02:25.950> repotted<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:27.180> very<00:02:28.670> enormous

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
so i think i repotted is a very enormous

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.110 
so i think i repotted is a very enormous
pot<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:30.860> by<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.920> way<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.129> second<00:02:32.519> picture<00:02:32.700> of

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
pot and by the way the second picture of

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.920 
pot and by the way the second picture of
this<00:02:33.420> end<00:02:33.660> better<00:02:33.900> is<00:02:34.290> if<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.310> right-click

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
this end better is if you right-click

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.550 
this end better is if you right-click
you<00:02:36.930> get<00:02:37.620> super<00:02:37.890> jump<00:02:38.180> however<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.569> deduce<00:02:40.290> by

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
you get super jump however you deduce by

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.210 
you get super jump however you deduce by
one<00:02:40.799> heart<00:02:41.569> or<00:02:42.569> haven't<00:02:43.170> hard<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.040> can

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
one heart or haven't hard so you can

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.610 
one heart or haven't hard so you can
jump<00:02:44.489> really<00:02:44.700> really<00:02:44.849> high<00:02:45.390> have<00:02:46.110> in<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.380> sky

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
jump really really high have in the sky

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.880 
jump really really high have in the sky
so<00:02:47.310> anyways<00:02:47.760> despite<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:49.140> model<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.680> very

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
so anyways despite the model is very

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.280 
so anyways despite the model is very
