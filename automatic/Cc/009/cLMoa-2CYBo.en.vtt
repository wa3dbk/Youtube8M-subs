00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659 

so<00:00:00.480> basically<00:00:00.989> it's<00:00:01.319> higher<00:00:01.680> efficiency<00:00:01.979> and

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
so basically it's higher efficiency and

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.450 
so basically it's higher efficiency and
also<00:00:03.240> simply<00:00:03.570> do<00:00:03.780> papi<00:00:04.500> rail<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:04.920> so<00:00:05.250> may<00:00:05.400> be

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
also simply do papi rail and so may be

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.179 
also simply do papi rail and so may be
much<00:00:06.210> more<00:00:06.390> stable<00:00:06.600> or<00:00:07.020> coffee<00:00:07.799> realm

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
much more stable or coffee realm

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.930 
much more stable or coffee realm
