00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 the fool's puy caught up with the legend 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.930
 the elders speak edimburg disappeared at 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.710
 16th century 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.910
 he was found delightfully surprised 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.330
 for the theme park 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:19.230
 because this legend they have a little believed in 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.930
 start and then then not at all 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.779
 a 6 year old village hiding 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.480
 under the soil puyfolais this legend 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.779
 she says that there was also a 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.369
 love the village bÃ©rard but this village of 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.380
 14th century and is all the more 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.239
 extraordinary here on this site that 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.309
 usually the medieval villages are 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.930
 located under the current boroughs in the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.000
 communes of France and so it is 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.579
 extremely rare he found love of this 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.930
 14th 15th century time that is all to 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.230
 sure blow right in the middle of a 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.570
 field 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.530
 not only is it a discovery 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.110
 important 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.190
 and then in addition she brings credit 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.190
 at the puy du fou 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.469
 this borough consisting mainly of a 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.960
 big house is a snap of 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.989
 the story for the historic park that 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.409
 could imagine a tall building in l 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:10.799
 with two annexes added in this area 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:16.710
 a bakehouse with possibly an oven 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:21.060
 bread by here you have the entrance with a 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.650
 level of going as well as drains and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.560
 where my colleagues are 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.909
 it would be a big room and would have 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.100
 served as cooking the archaeological team 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.799
 and here you say the stacking that took place 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.780
 succeeded in time we know that the 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.780
 house had a floor 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.720
 every room will be emptied and we will 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.189
 record each layer note the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.750
 relationship to costs which 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.909
 are above and below for 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.549
 get to understand the logic 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.310
 Stacking the different layouts 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.860
 which were carried out 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.610
 and take the furniture that will us 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.460
 to date 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.950
 each layer a little further we measure 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.590
 the ditches around the agricultural part 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.899
 from the village 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.900
 how will the crazy puy go to value 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.150
 this extraordinary discovery 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.250
 of course we have some ideas but as 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.900
 always at puy du fou it is necessary that the 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.160
 way of presenting things be 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.239
 alive and of course with 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.980
 the use of two big of 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.640
 state-of-the-art technology that allows 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:33.019
 is good to give the presentation of 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.930
 history a modern figure for 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:40.900
 discover with your own eyes the village 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.900
 of bejar rendez-vous in 2016
