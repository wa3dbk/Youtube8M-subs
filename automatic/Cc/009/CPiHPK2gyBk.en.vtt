00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
I've played good Ryu in the past and I

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.860 
I've played good Ryu in the past and I
do<00:01:37.460> think<00:01:38.740> evil<00:01:39.740> as<00:01:39.980> opposed<00:01:40.880> to<00:01:41.030> good<00:01:41.210> Ryu<00:01:41.450> has

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
do think evil as opposed to good Ryu has

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.870 
do think evil as opposed to good Ryu has
kind<00:01:42.230> of<00:01:42.350> evened<00:01:42.770> out<00:01:42.890> this<00:01:43.220> matchup<00:01:43.850> because

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
kind of evened out this matchup because

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.410 
kind of evened out this matchup because
before<00:01:44.420> it<00:01:44.570> was<00:01:44.660> like<00:01:44.840> 64<00:01:45.470> good<00:01:45.770> Ryu<00:01:45.980> right<00:01:46.420> but

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
before it was like 64 good Ryu right but

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.140 
before it was like 64 good Ryu right but
i<00:01:47.450> think<00:01:47.690> is<00:01:47.750> like<00:01:47.900> 55<00:01:48.200> evil<00:01:48.890> you<00:01:49.820> know<00:01:49.910> it's

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
i think is like 55 evil you know it's

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.180 
i think is like 55 evil you know it's
like<00:01:50.210> a<00:01:50.330> nice<00:01:50.600> even<00:01:50.930> playing<00:01:51.320> field<00:01:51.410> for<00:01:51.800> the
