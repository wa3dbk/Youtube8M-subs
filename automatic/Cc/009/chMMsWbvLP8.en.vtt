okay<00:00:01.350> so<00:00:01.410> be<00:00:01.709> inspired<00:00:02.040> by<00:00:02.340> Laurie's<00:00:03.650> creation

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
okay so be inspired by Laurie's creation

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.950 
okay so be inspired by Laurie's creation
on<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.190> cutting<00:00:05.819> create<00:00:05.970> page<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.690> I<00:00:06.750> thought

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
on the cutting create page and I thought

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.589 
on the cutting create page and I thought
I<00:00:06.990> would<00:00:07.170> try<00:00:07.290> my<00:00:07.470> own<00:00:07.680> we<00:00:08.429> are<00:00:08.460> going<00:00:08.790> to<00:00:09.059> start

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
I would try my own we are going to start

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.759 
I would try my own we are going to start
with<00:00:10.820> one<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:11.849> my<00:00:11.940> logs<00:00:12.150> umber<00:00:12.450> tops<00:00:12.750> on<00:00:13.590> the

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
with one of my logs umber tops on the

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.700 
with one of my logs umber tops on the
back<00:00:14.570> it's<00:00:15.570> fairly<00:00:15.870> playing<00:00:16.260> all<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.619> way

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
back it's fairly playing all the way

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.380 
back it's fairly playing all the way
through<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.490> thought<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:17.910> would<00:00:17.940> cut<00:00:18.240> this

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
through so I thought we would cut this

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.900 
through so I thought we would cut this
one<00:00:18.570> up<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.960> yeah<00:00:19.439> we'll<00:00:19.590> see<00:00:19.680> how<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:19.859> go<00:00:20.039> okay

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
one up and yeah we'll see how we go okay

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.609 
one up and yeah we'll see how we go okay
so<00:00:20.939> my<00:00:21.330> people<00:00:21.539> we<00:00:21.689> can<00:00:21.869> see<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.320> basically

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
so my people we can see that basically

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.310 
so my people we can see that basically
what<00:00:23.039> we're<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.340> do<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:24.240> run<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.630> couple

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
what we're going to do is run a couple

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.890 
what we're going to do is run a couple
of<00:00:25.410> slits<00:00:25.650> down<00:00:25.890> this<00:00:26.070> way<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.670> then<00:00:27.510> create

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
of slits down this way and then create

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.179 
of slits down this way and then create
the<00:00:28.080> center<00:00:28.560> panel<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:30.949> start<00:00:31.949> with<00:00:32.070> this

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
the center panel so I start with this

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.560 
the center panel so I start with this
one<00:00:34.579> make<00:00:35.579> sure<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.940> we're<00:00:36.090> still<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.300> view

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
one make sure that we're still in view

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.920 
one make sure that we're still in view
on<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.780> camera<00:00:37.079> these<00:00:37.500> are<00:00:38.090> I<00:00:39.500> know<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.530> am

on the camera these are I know I am

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:53.470 
on the camera these are I know I am
going<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.110> start<00:00:43.969> small<00:00:44.969> up<00:00:45.480> here

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.750 

keep<00:00:54.079> it<00:00:54.230> in<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.440> same<00:00:54.680> sort<00:00:54.980> of<00:00:55.130> length<00:00:55.399> all

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
keep it in the same sort of length all

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:19.210 
keep it in the same sort of length all
the<00:00:55.820> way<00:00:56.090> along<00:00:56.570> here

we still see them yeah so I'm just
cutting<00:01:35.190> them<00:01:35.370> gradually<00:01:36.110> deeper<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:40.530> deeper

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
cutting them gradually deeper and deeper

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.580

right the way down to that bottom see
okay<00:01:47.010> so<00:01:47.070> I've<00:01:47.190> done<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.430> cuts<00:01:47.640> down<00:01:47.850> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
okay so I've done the cuts down the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.690 
okay so I've done the cuts down the
other<00:01:48.150> side<00:01:48.360> as<00:01:48.600> well<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.410> you<00:01:50.310> can<00:01:50.430> see<00:01:50.580> the

length but I've just found the the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.210 
length but I've just found the the
center<00:01:53.570> I'm<00:01:54.570> gonna<00:01:54.810> start<00:01:55.250> that<00:01:56.250> same<00:01:56.640> place

cutting<00:03:48.660> my<00:03:48.990> orange<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.680> Pink's<00:03:49.950> on<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.220> top

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
cutting my orange and Pink's on the top

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.250 
cutting my orange and Pink's on the top
finished<00:03:50.880> weaving<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.390> this<00:03:52.200> is<00:03:52.380> what<00:03:52.530> we<00:03:52.560> have

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
finished weaving it this is what we have

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.820 
finished weaving it this is what we have
so<00:03:55.260> I've<00:03:55.500> just<00:03:55.530> done<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:57.150> normal<00:03:57.510> wave

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
so I've just done the normal wave

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.160 
so I've just done the normal wave
straight<00:03:58.830> down<00:03:59.100> both<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.610> outside<00:04:00.060> limbs<00:04:00.360> and

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
straight down both the outside limbs and

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.630 
straight down both the outside limbs and
in<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.410> center<00:04:01.740> when<00:04:01.890> I<00:04:01.920> actually<00:04:02.220> did<00:04:02.490> the

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
in the center when I actually did the

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.880 
in the center when I actually did the
outside<00:04:03.090> wave<00:04:03.240> to<00:04:03.450> about<00:04:03.690> here<00:04:04.020> and<00:04:04.380> then<00:04:04.800> I

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
outside wave to about here and then I

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.950 
outside wave to about here and then I
did<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.970> wave<00:04:06.150> where<00:04:06.390> you<00:04:06.480> twist<00:04:06.660> it

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
did that the wave where you twist it

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.110 
did that the wave where you twist it
before<00:04:07.290> you<00:04:07.410> loop<00:04:07.620> it<00:04:07.770> through<00:04:07.830> and<00:04:08.820> I've<00:04:08.940> done

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
before you loop it through and I've done

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.090 
before you loop it through and I've done
that<00:04:09.270> almost<00:04:09.840> all<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.380> way<00:04:10.470> down<00:04:10.710> until<00:04:10.890> we

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
that almost all the way down until we

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.380 
that almost all the way down until we
got<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.370> last<00:04:11.520> bottom<00:04:11.910> bit<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.240> then<00:04:12.360> I

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
got to the last bottom bit and then I

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.770 
got to the last bottom bit and then I
just<00:04:12.630> went<00:04:13.260> back<00:04:13.470> into<00:04:13.800> a<00:04:13.830> normal<00:04:14.040> way

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
just went back into a normal way

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.390 
just went back into a normal way
okay<00:04:15.780> I'll<00:04:16.260> go<00:04:16.380> and<00:04:16.530> try<00:04:16.590> it<00:04:16.680> on<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.950> see<00:04:17.130> how<00:04:17.280> it

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
okay I'll go and try it on to see how it

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.280 
okay I'll go and try it on to see how it
goes<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:17.580> had<00:04:18.060> to<00:04:18.150> duck<00:04:18.299> away<00:04:18.420> into<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.720> class<00:04:18.989> but

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
goes I had to duck away into a class but

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.900 
goes I had to duck away into a class but
I'm<00:04:19.380> back<00:04:19.560> just<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:19.890> show<00:04:20.100> you<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.430> end<00:04:20.760> result

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
I'm back just to show you the end result

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.790 
I'm back just to show you the end result
of<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.420> pink<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:21.750> orange<00:04:21.900> tank<00:04:22.320> that<00:04:22.500> I<00:04:22.530> cut

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
of the pink and orange tank that I cut

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.310 
of the pink and orange tank that I cut
up<00:04:22.830> this<00:04:23.010> afternoon<00:04:23.540> sorry<00:04:25.250> here<00:04:26.250> we<00:04:26.520> have

standard tea at the front um something I

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.100 
standard tea at the front um something I

didn't mention when I was doing it this
afternoon

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
afternoon

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.080 
afternoon
was<00:04:32.070> that<00:04:32.310> I've<00:04:32.400> actually<00:04:32.610> cut<00:04:33.240> off<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.800> band

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
was that I've actually cut off the band

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.400 
was that I've actually cut off the band
all<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.150> way<00:04:36.270> along<00:04:36.600> it<00:04:36.840> just<00:04:37.020> made<00:04:37.170> for<00:04:37.350> a

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
all the way along it just made for a

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.230 
all the way along it just made for a
nicer<00:04:37.590> finish<00:04:37.920> at<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.280> back<00:04:38.460> where<00:04:38.730> I<00:04:38.760> had<00:04:39.060> the

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
nicer finish at the back where I had the

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.390 
nicer finish at the back where I had the
the<00:04:39.720> we've<00:04:39.900> done<00:04:40.280> now<00:04:41.280> on<00:04:41.720> the<00:04:42.720> back<00:04:43.250> get<00:04:44.250> in<00:04:44.340> a

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
the we've done now on the back get in a

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.180 
the we've done now on the back get in a
bit<00:04:44.520> closer<00:04:44.730> so<00:04:45.030> you<00:04:45.060> can<00:04:45.180> see<00:04:45.620> we've<00:04:46.620> got<00:04:46.860> that

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
bit closer so you can see we've got that

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.140 
bit closer so you can see we've got that
wave<00:04:47.460> all<00:04:47.880> the<00:04:47.940> way<00:04:48.150> down<00:04:49.760> just<00:04:50.760> when<00:04:50.880> you<00:04:50.970> put

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
wave all the way down just when you put

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.490 
wave all the way down just when you put
it<00:04:51.240> on<00:04:51.330> you<00:04:51.540> just<00:04:51.660> have<00:04:51.750> a<00:04:51.870> fiddle<00:04:52.169> with<00:04:52.290> it<00:04:52.320> to

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
it on you just have a fiddle with it to

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.120 
it on you just have a fiddle with it to
make<00:04:52.680> sure<00:04:52.830> it's<00:04:52.980> all<00:04:53.130> evenly<00:04:53.490> spaced<00:04:53.910> and

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
make sure it's all evenly spaced and

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.260 
make sure it's all evenly spaced and
then<00:04:56.130> the<00:04:56.250> center<00:04:56.550> what<00:04:56.669> I<00:04:56.700> put<00:04:56.880> backwards

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
then the center what I put backwards

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.760 
then the center what I put backwards
actually<00:04:57.540> double<00:04:58.050> waved<00:04:58.230> and<00:04:58.530> coming

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
actually double waved and coming

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.460 
actually double waved and coming
straight<00:04:59.010> down<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.370> middle<00:05:00.080> so<00:05:01.080> yeah<00:05:01.230> I<00:05:01.410> think

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
straight down the middle so yeah I think

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.800 
straight down the middle so yeah I think
it<00:05:01.710> actually<00:05:02.010> makes<00:05:02.190> for<00:05:02.460> a<00:05:02.490> really<00:05:02.810> really

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
it actually makes for a really really

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.890 
it actually makes for a really really
nice<00:05:03.990> finish<00:05:04.970> on<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.090> t-shirt<00:05:06.480> for<00:05:06.630> something

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
nice finish on the t-shirt for something

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.400 
nice finish on the t-shirt for something
a<00:05:06.960> little<00:05:07.080> bit<00:05:07.260> different<00:05:07.680> and<00:05:07.890> unique<00:05:09.410> okay

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
a little bit different and unique okay

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:11.780 
a little bit different and unique okay
and<00:05:10.680> thank<00:05:11.040> you<00:05:11.130> to<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.340> group<00:05:11.520> because<00:05:11.610> I

and thank you to the group because I
wouldn't<00:05:11.970> have<00:05:12.030> found<00:05:12.270> this<00:05:12.360> design<00:05:12.660> if<00:05:12.810> I

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
wouldn't have found this design if I

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.950 
wouldn't have found this design if I
were<00:05:12.990> you<00:05:13.260> guys<00:05:13.290> thanks
