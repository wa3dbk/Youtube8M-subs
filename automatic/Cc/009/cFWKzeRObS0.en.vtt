speed<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.750> car<00:02:29.650> control<00:02:30.100> is<00:02:30.310> really<00:02:30.520> really

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
speed and car control is really really

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.260 
speed and car control is really really

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
fighter jet squadron that was shut down

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.960 
fighter jet squadron that was shut down
because<00:02:53.290> Sweden<00:02:53.890> is<00:02:54.010> cutting<00:02:54.640> down<00:02:54.670> on

because Sweden is cutting down on

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.440 
because Sweden is cutting down on
military<00:02:55.450> force<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.760> pilots<00:02:58.240> of<00:02:58.360> the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
their symbol on our car so we say that

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.580 
their symbol on our car so we say that
all<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.910> cars<00:03:07.150> we<00:03:07.330> produce<00:03:07.510> in<00:03:08.260> that<00:03:08.410> facility

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
all the cars we produce in that facility

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.010 
all the cars we produce in that facility
we<00:03:09.310> will<00:03:09.340> use<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.850> ghosts<00:03:10.060> we<00:03:10.420> named<00:03:10.660> it<00:03:10.810> the

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
we will use the ghosts we named it the

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.250 
we will use the ghosts we named it the
spirit<00:03:12.010> of<00:03:12.160> performance<00:03:12.760> which<00:03:13.240> suits<00:03:13.660> kind

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
spirit of performance which suits kind

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.690 
spirit of performance which suits kind
of<00:03:14.350> our<00:03:14.470> philosophy<00:03:15.070> whether<00:03:15.310> what<00:03:15.550> we're

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
of our philosophy whether what we're

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.590 
of our philosophy whether what we're
doing<00:03:15.970> is<00:03:16.090> wrong

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
doing is wrong

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.140 
doing is wrong
so<00:03:17.350> even<00:03:17.560> though<00:03:17.830> it's<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.370> very<00:03:18.580> compact

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
so even though it's a very compact

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.060 
so even though it's a very compact
efficient<00:03:19.810> car<00:03:20.050> we<00:03:20.350> have<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.530> really<00:03:20.830> good

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
efficient car we have a really good

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.830 
efficient car we have a really good
interior<00:03:21.580> space<00:03:21.850> you<00:03:22.060> can<00:03:22.180> almost<00:03:22.330> be<00:03:22.600> 2

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
interior space you can almost be 2

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.340 
interior space you can almost be 2
meters<00:03:22.990> tall<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:23.500> still<00:03:23.950> fit<00:03:24.160> inside<00:03:25.170> we<00:03:26.170> have

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
meters tall and still fit inside we have

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.630 
meters tall and still fit inside we have
very<00:03:26.950> unique<00:03:27.660> layout<00:03:28.660> of<00:03:29.110> buttons<00:03:29.620> which<00:03:29.830> are

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
very unique layout of buttons which are

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.250 
very unique layout of buttons which are
backlit<00:03:31.300> through<00:03:32.230> the<00:03:32.500> metal<00:03:32.890> with<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.370> nano

backlit through the metal with the nano
laser-cut<00:03:35.260> holes<00:03:35.560> so<00:03:36.460> we<00:03:36.730> don't<00:03:36.910> we<00:03:37.120> avoid

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
laser-cut holes so we don't we avoid

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.860 
laser-cut holes so we don't we avoid
plastic<00:03:37.780> by<00:03:38.260> by<00:03:38.830> just<00:03:39.520> shooting<00:03:39.760> LED<00:03:40.630> light

straight<00:03:41.350> through<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.860> metal<00:03:42.190> which<00:03:42.730> is<00:03:42.850> kind

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
straight through the metal which is kind

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.810 
straight through the metal which is kind
of<00:03:43.180> interesting<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.950> whole<00:03:45.100> layout<00:03:45.310> of<00:03:45.610> the

of interesting the whole layout of the

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.780 
of interesting the whole layout of the
computer<00:03:46.780> is<00:03:46.990> symmetrical<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:48.520> the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
computer is symmetrical and the

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.670 
computer is symmetrical and the
dashboard<00:03:49.300> goes<00:03:49.780> together<00:03:50.020> with<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:50.350> steering

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
dashboard goes together with a steering

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.890 
dashboard goes together with a steering
wheel<00:03:50.710> I<00:03:51.010> can<00:03:51.190> be<00:03:51.250> moved<00:03:51.460> around<00:03:51.580> to<00:03:52.180> adjust<00:03:52.690> to

wheel I can be moved around to adjust to

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.920 
wheel I can be moved around to adjust to
each<00:03:52.930> driver<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:54.060> it's<00:03:55.060> very<00:03:55.300> easy<00:03:55.510> for<00:03:55.720> us<00:03:55.780> to

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
each driver and it's very easy for us to

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.240 
each driver and it's very easy for us to
do<00:03:56.050> left<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.410> right<00:03:56.590> hand<00:03:56.830> drive<00:03:57.040> as

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
do left and right hand drive as

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.970 
do left and right hand drive as
everything<00:03:57.670> is<00:03:57.760> symmetrical

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
everything is symmetrical

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.530 
everything is symmetrical
so<00:03:59.340> we<00:03:59.430> planned<00:03:59.730> that<00:03:59.880> from<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.180> beginning

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
so we planned that from the beginning

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.660 
so we planned that from the beginning
even<00:04:00.600> though<00:04:00.810> we<00:04:00.990> have<00:04:01.110> very<00:04:01.290> low<00:04:01.500> volume<00:04:01.740> and

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
even though we have very low volume and

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.800 
even though we have very low volume and
we<00:04:02.760> spend<00:04:03.000> a<00:04:03.060> lot<00:04:03.090> of<00:04:03.270> time<00:04:03.480> getting<00:04:03.630> the

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
we spend a lot of time getting the

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.600 
we spend a lot of time getting the
ergonomics<00:04:04.470> of<00:04:04.590> conference<00:04:05.040> right<00:04:05.220> so<00:04:05.460> it's

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
ergonomics of conference right so it's

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.630 
ergonomics of conference right so it's
really<00:04:05.790> a<00:04:05.910> nice<00:04:06.150> place<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:06.960> stay<00:04:07.170> in<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.640> focus

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
really a nice place to stay in and focus

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.970 
really a nice place to stay in and focus
really<00:04:08.940> on<00:04:09.150> details<00:04:09.870> on<00:04:10.230> how<00:04:10.470> everything

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
really on details on how everything

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.010 
really on details on how everything
tected<00:04:11.550> tactility<00:04:12.060> and<00:04:12.630> how<00:04:12.750> everything

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
tected tactility and how everything

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.240 
tected tactility and how everything
feels<00:04:13.410> like<00:04:13.580> to<00:04:14.580> really<00:04:14.940> enhance<00:04:15.210> the

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
feels like to really enhance the

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.250 
feels like to really enhance the
experience
