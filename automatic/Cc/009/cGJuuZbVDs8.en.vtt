00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.559
 hello here piano saint john voila 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.269
 today I wanted to make you a 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.690
 little tiny video to bring my 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.220
 support in any case moral since since 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.730
 my swiss i can not really do 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.289
 something else that can be used the 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.150
 little bit of notoriety that I could have 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.240
 thanks to the release of my book but in 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.550
 any case to bring support to the 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.690
 fight against the implantation of a new 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.399
 airport to nantes report under the name of 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.329
 our lady of the moors and the whole project 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.930
 which follows 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:47.300
 I put here a site that gives a lot 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.289
 information I put it back here zad 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.620
 nadir point org 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.690
 so 2 add za points to say like the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.780
 very common name in france point org 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.850
 and to really it's a it's totally 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.250
 the example of the nonsense that do 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.530
 today governments and 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.790
 local authorities 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.360
 we are in a world that is going towards a 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.740
 collapse 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.720
 we are in a world that in all 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.939
 case at least goes towards the end of oil 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.830
 cheap and we are in a world 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.080
 who, despite everything, seeks at all costs 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.700
 growth and it is typical to see 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.580
 local government 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.320
 try at all costs to create the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.290
 growth by manufacturing 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.650
 constructions by making work the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.329
 btp is here this is a new 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.090
 airport in nantes nantes already has a 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.670
 report that works well I imagine for 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.710
 while I was once or twice and 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.729
 we want to build a huge airport 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.770
 to bring in so-called 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.470
 tourism commercial activities on 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.540
 this city of nantes and on the region 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.189
 nearby Saint Nazaire and is c 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.750
 this is the pretext to launch very 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.170
 great works it is typically 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.939
 Keynesian projects but in a world where 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.049
 soon oil will be so expensive 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.369
 and where the resources will be so 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.159
 rare and I think even the whole economy 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.320
 go meat and what's the point of it 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.820
 serves since soon will no longer be able 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.489
 take the plane to walk will not be able to 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.200
 more traveling as we did 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.400
 as we still do 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.110
 and in addition we are going to need to 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.239
 all these farmland that we 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.069
 wishes with this concrete project and 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.810
 destroy this farmland this is it 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.340
 that will allow you to eat a 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.330
 airport it's not going to allow you to 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.209
 to eat in a few years 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.680
 and if you live nantes if you think 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.540
 only to earn a little money 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.190
 for the next five years this 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.709
 would be nice to have this thoughtful project 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.750
 it's a little bit of what makes you 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.390
 to live every day is water 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.590
 the food is not concrete and 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.489
 when the collapse will be 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.540
 unfortunately on us and that 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.269
 is getting closer and faster like 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.349
 you can notice it by the economy 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.510
 even around your home in France 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.610
 Well, you'll be glad to have 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.799
 agricultural land rather than having 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.349
 concretes from abandoned concrete and zones 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.700
 industrial completely useless so 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.239
 be careful so he is 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.560
 important to support farmers 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.900
 and finally all these objectors of 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.750
 growth that are right to oppose 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.940
 this airport our lady of the moors and at 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.440
 beyond this support 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.410
 I think it's interesting that 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.660
 each of you can see in the 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.190
 where he lives 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.000
 what are the political plans for 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:26.250
 industrial development 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.440
 infrastructure etc and other goods 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.940
 look well at those who make sense those 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.549
 who are perennial what they can 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.350
 brought a real added value or those 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.660
 who are just there to destroy from 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.630
 agricultural space destroy nature is 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.510
 finally brought a pseudo growth 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.180
 admitted on credit in addition that it will not happen 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.959
 never be very attentive 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.100
 so I encourage you to do what 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.120
 is in your power I know that 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.590
 unfortunately we are no longer 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.380
 so in democracies so no 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.099
 have much capacity to vote or 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.349
 of petitions finally done that is possible 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:03.450
 harass the local authorities the 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.489
 communities to explain to them that 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.680
 the end the population does not want and 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.760
 support these people once again go 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.130
 on this site 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.610
 http of two barbarian points zz has some 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.320
 points to say point org for already you 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.360
 inform about the ins and outs 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.810
 outsiders of this project is from those 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.070
 fighting against and eventually to 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.820
 make the decision your soul and 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.050
 awareness of what is 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.270
 really good for you and for your 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.640
 region in the future and I believe that 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.020
 like me will support you because 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.700
 the future is not that of a 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.020
 industrial development but 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.200
 contrary is that of a return to 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:42.110
 local is that of a return to what 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.700
 is near and what is natural and what 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.440
 will not be a new airport notice 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.300
 as in england too there are some 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.620
 plans to build a third big 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.420
 airport around london like around 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.620
 from Paris there is also a project 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.860
 absurd that we make a new big 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.420
 airport between paris and lille all these 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.520
 projects they have to be stopped because 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.080
 that we need capital for 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.030
 others other projects a lot more 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.220
 simple and much more useful and then 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.630
 we do not have to stop ourselves from 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.140
 just destroy everything to make 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.780
 the growth 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:11.120
 so here it was a little message very 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.740
 modest support for those struggling 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.560
 against projects that lies to him stupid 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.280
 so courage and see you soon 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.280
 ciao
