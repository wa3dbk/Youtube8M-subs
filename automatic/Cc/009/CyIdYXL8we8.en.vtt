benefits from kiting to test your
understanding<00:01:04.460> first<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:05.909> have<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
understanding first up we have the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.810 
understanding first up we have the
stalker<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.930> zergling<00:01:07.380> no<00:01:07.799> upgrades<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
stalker and the zergling no upgrades the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.880 
stalker and the zergling no upgrades the
stalker<00:01:09.119> has<00:01:09.240> longer<00:01:09.600> range<00:01:09.750> it's<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.619> tie<00:01:10.830> for

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
stalker has longer range it's a tie for

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.070 
stalker has longer range it's a tie for
speed<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.000> stock<00:01:12.210> has<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.510> slower<00:01:12.780> rate<00:01:13.049> of

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
speed and the stock has a slower rate of

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.920 
speed and the stock has a slower rate of
fire<00:01:13.400> so<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.729> stalker<00:01:15.000> benefits<00:01:15.479> from<00:01:15.600> kiting

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
fire so the stalker benefits from kiting

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.960 
fire so the stalker benefits from kiting
but<00:01:16.619> what<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:16.950> give<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> zergling<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.670> speed

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
but what if we give the zergling a speed

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.940 
but what if we give the zergling a speed
upgrade<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.810> stalker<00:01:19.080> still<00:01:19.409> has<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> longer

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
upgrade the stalker still has a longer

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.130 
upgrade the stalker still has a longer
range<00:01:20.130> but<00:01:20.610> now<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.820> zergling<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.450> faster<00:01:21.960> and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
range but now the zergling is faster and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.960 
range but now the zergling is faster and
the<00:01:22.439> stalker<00:01:22.680> still<00:01:23.040> has<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.460> slower<00:01:23.729> rate<00:01:23.939> of

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the stalker still has a slower rate of

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.969 
the stalker still has a slower rate of
fire<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.900> situation<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.500> stalker<00:01:25.770> is

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
fire in this situation the stalker is

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.039 
fire in this situation the stalker is
still<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.640> benefit<00:01:27.030> from<00:01:27.150> cutting<00:01:27.509> in

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
still going to benefit from cutting in

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.390 
still going to benefit from cutting in
this<00:01:28.170> kind<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.470> matchup<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:29.070> advantageous

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
this kind of matchup it's advantageous

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.280 
this kind of matchup it's advantageous
for<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> faster<00:01:30.390> unit<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.780> try<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.140> surround

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
for the faster unit to try and surround

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.109 
for the faster unit to try and surround
the<00:01:31.590> slower<00:01:31.890> rate<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.189> fire<00:01:32.280> unit<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.030> it

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the slower rate of fire unit so it

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.179 
the slower rate of fire unit so it
cannot<00:01:33.329> benefit<00:01:33.720> from<00:01:33.780> cutting<00:01:34.200> let's<00:01:34.890> try<00:01:35.100> an

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
cannot benefit from cutting let's try an

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.890 
cannot benefit from cutting let's try an
example<00:01:35.640> where<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.880> longer<00:01:36.240> range<00:01:36.390> unit<00:01:36.720> has

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
example where the longer range unit has

up<00:02:08.550> let's<00:02:08.640> try<00:02:08.879> two<00:02:08.940> ranged<00:02:09.450> units<00:02:09.750> which<00:02:10.170> are

up let's try two ranged units which are

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.110 
up let's try two ranged units which are
kite<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.860> marine<00:02:11.190> or<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.670> stalker

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
kite the marine or the stalker

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.550 
kite the marine or the stalker
no<00:02:12.480> upgrades

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
no upgrades

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.350 
no upgrades
the<00:02:13.620> stalker<00:02:13.890> has<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.310> longer-range<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
the stalker has the longer-range the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.510 
the stalker has the longer-range the
stalker<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.870> faster<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.680> stalker<00:02:16.980> has<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.190> slow

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
stalker is faster the stalker has a slow

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.229 
stalker is faster the stalker has a slow
rate<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.760> fire

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
rate of fire

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.820

therefore<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.810> stalker<00:02:19.050> benefits<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.680> most

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
therefore the stalker benefits the most

therefore the stalker benefits the most
