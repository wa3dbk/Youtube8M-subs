00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.320
 most important beauty products 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.460
 and I'm actually talking about store 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.379
 every girl has of course wax 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.879
 favorite beauty products 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.250
 so I thought I'd leave it with you 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.649
 share so that maybe you too 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.270
 some of being able to learn and I thought 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.270
 just nice to share this with you 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.080
 at number one I have the eyebrows on 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.670
 number 2 I have the cheeks and number 3 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.770
 I have the lips 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.270
 so let's start first 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.400
 my eyebrows and yes you can 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.720
 easy to do or mobile fun well like me 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.060
 it can easily do what use 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.159
 pencil and this is from catrice 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.930
 it is a very nice pencil you can 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.369
 only show deeper from which brand 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.110
 it is because the label you are off 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.939
 yes it also has such a brush on 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.180
 so i thought it was easy for you 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.860
 brush your hairs well so that you 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.930
 easier to apply and 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.119
 even though not seeing truth apply and 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.150
 i just use this when i have a story 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:45.720
 do not write themselves with this pattern as 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.460
 pencil I go fast works well 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.270
 so that 's the easy way if 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.909
 second I have and what now 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.560
 and this more expensive than the same as the products 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.770
 from anastasia mountains 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.969
 first i upload but to this one 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.240
 once in four 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:03.729
 care pro often you need with these products 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.689
 take a lighter color than you 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.600
 thinks 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:10.360
 because it always gets dark 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.010
 I told him so I thought 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.870
 it very nice it seems very 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.819
 get little product but really 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.890
 giant with it so somewhere seemed super long there 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.080
 a link now for more than half a year and 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.579
 he is still an offer 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.829
 well i'm using in combination with 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.799
 the brush also very easy 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:28.000
 posts has special hearts for this 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.670
 Products 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.400
 cut diagonally on it's easy to 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.090
 such a brush also finds that out 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.180
 easy it effects and sometimes 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:45.310
 He is very miss out on one and I have 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:48.310
 also in old crazy creatures 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.200
 this is in the taupe color 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.940
 and I also like this very much I use 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.920
 had him in combination then I do say 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.989
 but the powder at the beginning of my 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.910
 eyebrows so that hangs there 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.560
 most hair than ever because i like it 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.620
 end of my eyebrows 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.540
 I use even less hair than I do 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.160
 get hot and that gives it just 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.230
 more light people more color 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.170
 which is easy, I myself make it more beautiful 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.609
 of those is even tighter than in this 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.340
 And I think that Tom recognizes 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:18.340
 so then I have this for the women as 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.010
 second I have the beans and use them there 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.480
 I actually called 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.710
 i just love being there with you 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.500
 face on reiner 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:30.400
 don't ripping you see and i'm using 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.310
 not all of our machines must also be here 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.860
 say something special i just had this 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.200
 bought in spain last week which i 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.170
 was in spain so i bought this one 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.870
 at the forums it is in the color light 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.370
 but essentially he seems when I thought 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.540
 first a bit of education 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.390
 to 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:56.230
 he is still darker but this way so 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.120
 long do that in combination with this 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.740
 brush 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.590
 it is cut diagonally so you can still 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.690
 make it easier to show this movement 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.010
 and yes it is super soft so very bad 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.400
 fine to be used in 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.770
 so that's only two wine last 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.510
 I do not pack 3 and it is not 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.790
 always that i do something on my lips 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.870
 but if i do n't just like one 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.690
 white line and that a bit easier and that 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:27.010
 fine on his lips for wild white 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:29.740
 bringing laughter is completely in the hole 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.400
 the captain to why I always just 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.210
 jesus lines of the mbx and and 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.820
 economic 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.480
 they tell him 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.410
 and this is the color the lip comes off 28 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.930
 through 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.520
 WPC in color but so far can 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.710
 I see here because he is quite small 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.590
 because I have been quite often used 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.640
 that is just a very nice color i 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.260
 like it very much 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.260
 make your lips fuller I think 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.880
 also very nice so yes therefore always right 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.170
 a lip to you you come here what 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.610
 and I hope you have 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.200
 like it even like it 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.910
 you already have a reaction here so 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.500
 let what you wonder what I was 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.720
 certainly improve it 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.430
 so always leave a comment 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.690
