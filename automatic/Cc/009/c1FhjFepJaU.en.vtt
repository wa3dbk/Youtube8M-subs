00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.650
 friends rye and pavon shepherd digital 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.139
 We are in February 2008 arrived 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.550
 an analysis of the new compact digital photography camera from kodak 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.909
 and there yes sir 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:20.320
 zeta minute 65 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.650
 tapia was not based on the package 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.829
 it's a camera 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.399
 - an apex which is going to give us quite a lot of everyone to take photos 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:29.210
 They are very large size 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.410
 in telecinco is a reason 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.430
 that his football 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.040
 right is not much your hair 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.100
 and I think those ideas wanted this is the sensitivity and the camera with the 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.870
 Albufera 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.050
 that's why what he allows is to take pictures and paintings 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.810
 in places where there is much less light than necessary to form a photo 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.660
 I think we can still see through the postcard box to camoranesi 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.850
 by ledesma mundo already started the show 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.420
 the alcalaínos will return to the markets indicate that soon 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.910
 battery then the camera eos alkaline batteries that is always good because 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.170
 anytime 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.170
 we can buy new batteries we stay 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.450
 bald serer and think about the naval sector 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.450
 fígar de cork let's see how it is 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.829
 good - just the camera the box 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:17.690
 vii 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.670
 as you know they have been used years before in so few large 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.550
 that is correct has 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.040
 a baby and a half thick 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.130
 we can observe what we said before that it has 12 megapixels 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.250
 what does he have 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.360
 a great slowness in his own life 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.140
 of the lens is a 35 7 235 millimeters equivalent to whatever 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.860
 in reeds and analog 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.730
 and the opening the delivery of f2 8 f 5 1 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.210
 in the eleventh century there were no peaks of 5 as we said before 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.030
 is fine and is that a visitor amen of five 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.670
 who are four megabytes of internal memory 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.640
 and has a foreign work that we can insert as it is in this case of memory 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.710
 sd in this case we have put 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.560
 1 kingson card 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.500
 efe 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.799
 following with the characteristics of the camera 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.669
 we talk about iso sensitivity 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:17.399
 the sensitivity on this camera low between 64 to 1600 iso 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:23.899
 we can get adopt assassinate 3200 but only if we use in sizes of 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:26.759
 3 megapixel image 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:30.029
 with the results in prison 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:33.660
 understand me includes a digital image stabilizer that is very well 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.640
 because what it does is to avoid that the photograph had moved quite 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.649
 small go to add put to throw 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:43.759
 photographs of the exhibition with low light environments 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.629
 that is to say the screen of two commas 5 inches in the image which is 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.229
 enough and go to see the pictures 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:52.229
 very well 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:55.989
 As you can see, menus can be seen very well on the screen 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.149
 guiding tells us what's left to do 

00:02:58.149 --> 00:03:00.770
 the opening this time will go at the speed 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.189
 He specified that this suture autofocus 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:06.109
 back we can see also 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:11.239
 the buttons are not many buttons which he does his are quite simple 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.730
 tinaquillo his man 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.150
 to erase images to get information on glass screen is 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.909
 knows at least they are made to screens 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.099
 santana place the photo 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.779
 we will support a couple of little them masculine the Serbian stopped another one that allows us 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:29.819
 move from the different models the expansion of the game stopped of eyes 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:30.989
 red and so on 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.319
 and it also allows us to take continuous photographs or have a 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.529
 delay trigger to discua put the government photo 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.019
 and has a bronze wheelchair press saying the various modes of 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.330
 scene and 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.109
 my daughter valentina 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.449
 you can also comment that this camera captures high ambition 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:52.759
 definition and format 16 9 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:53.750
 percent 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.979
 and the taxpayers 4 

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:59.439
 in what it does to unpack a little size of sevilla without problems 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.579
 more mobility 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.879
 she and with additional support that sells kodak we can connect this 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.339
 camera to a high definition television another high device 

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:13.339
 definition of various videos 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.819
 we can shoot the tomato mode skateboard as the classic automatic mode 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:21.900
 behind the cameras is with different scenes with manual mode 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.259
 in automatic mode in the camera the time to spare to pre-select the 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:28.710
 most appropriate settings 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.759
 for for the photo of zamora in sanlúcar the loser in a touch we press 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.610
 the trigger 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.189
 take data read from serna and select one of the nine scenes that has already 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:42.439
 received more of landscape portrait the lucentum 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:44.919
 inside it close 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.380
 in the middle the manual mode we can choose everything we can choose 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.110
 from the speed with which we are going to make the photo the opening of the plot 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.790
 that if it continues like this its going to win 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.500
 we can even talk and his wife a picture or his staff 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.190
 has many scene modes like the fact before the landscape portrait centers on 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:04.389
 an interesting 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.440
 that you start charging us we have already verified 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.290
 that panoramic mode that we can launch to take a picture of 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.240
 landscape 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.480
 and we were up to three photos in a row 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.610
 we were linking a comma but with a special show 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.039
 they eat the work pressures 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.999
 the general assessment of the camera is good me is a camera with trees 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:28.610
 anyone does not have very complicated hands nor many lessons that 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.540
 do not too much 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.969
 information on screen 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:33.999
 the typical father of camera with sensor because to our parents 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.889
 percent and without having to explain too much you can get to use in 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:42.630
 manual mode as explained legion doctor sara all parameters 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.129
 possible if it is a person 

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:45.779
 with experience in photography 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:48.309
 and if not leave it channels everything with 

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:50.430
 at the moment we press the button 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.080
 reads with what or to use let totally awaken people think that take out a 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.039
 little bit more than match photography 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:00.860
 the goose on the screen is fine they have good size maybe the menus are little 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.860
 today we could look for more improvements 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.590
 between it is successful that I have instilled two standard alkaline batteries as you can 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.119
 watch 

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:13.789
 efe that this what allows us you do not have so that we do not follow the battery 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:17.479
 charged to do it because at any time we can buy them own 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:19.289
 pirates in any store 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:23.340
 the time cáceres buttons as what they do the function gives you enough 

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:26.319
 simple and has a very important help for people with little 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:28.569
 Experience 3D stabilizer or image 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:32.059
 now that the photos always speak clearly and with little movement 

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:35.559
 it's nothing 

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:39.300
 camera recommended for medium use and however given 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.099
 It gives a great image quality because 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:44.259
 12 megapixels oil the photos in 

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:47.289
 and without forgetting that high definition video recording 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:50.050
 you get scared is a big advantage nearby 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.050
 I hope you liked it below you can see more signings 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:56.529
 and it is that men but it is difficult 

00:06:56.529 --> 00:06:59.529
 a greeting first of all for 3d 

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:06.019
 no no
