00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.620
 that day we took a 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.990
 nuclear bomb in the head 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.880
 a gigantic explosion we were 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.890
 annihilated one wonders by giving him to 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.779
 eat an addition will have to do it alone 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.460
 how are we going to be able to arrange 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.460
 to make him happy 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.160
 one day in the corridors of a comrade 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.380
 of class told me disabled people are only 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.910
 not as smart as people 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.070
 valid and then the guys are good them 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.620
 as soon as they are nice because often 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.090
 they are more ready to actually help more 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.770
 helpful of the coup on 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.480
 says we stick them the label as what 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.090
 they want to go out with the disabled 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.739
 to not take from others to 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.970
 grindstones to integrate it as a person 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.130
 normal but it was not 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.780
 explanations that lasted 4 hours I 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.850
 asked Montreuil Down syndrome in 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.890
 the pressure these people with disabilities 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.100
 finally yielded taddart hours and 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.670
 pasdaran to arrive at the museum 1 are 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.989
 first with what they started but has 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.760
 just as much love etc 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.979
 and it's really people who have 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.570
 pleasure to come back and then it is done 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.860
 it's a rope more than his bow it's 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.690
 not like with your friends you're kidding 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.950
 it's a different experience and 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.960
 the impression of bringing something to 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.570
 someone who had imagined a girl 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.140
 who enters with one of the angles at one 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.390
 can end up they remain after 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.460
 on a donation they often have a 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.850
 character of beating a big will 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.670
 and 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.369
 gets to go as far as possible the 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.049
 public scrutiny enhances our friend 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.000
 of the band and me even that do not value 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.320
 near people come to us bravo 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.320
 had brought joy 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.040
 we come really very atypical sense 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.690
 how are the people of what are 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.480
 the differences or directly to 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.130
 MÃ©diapost this nice confit space 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.130
 way and we cross the habit 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.540
 when I see her smile when I 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.640
 see you laugh all that really 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.060
 hot like that of any similarly 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.060
 cried
