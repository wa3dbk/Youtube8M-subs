Oh<00:00:00.060> Oh<00:00:00.599> welcome<00:00:01.140> back<00:00:01.800> last<00:00:02.129> time<00:00:02.399> we<00:00:02.610> were

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
Oh Oh welcome back last time we were

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.519 
Oh Oh welcome back last time we were
creating<00:00:03.030> this<00:00:03.120> plane<00:00:03.449> but<00:00:03.899> it<00:00:04.110> was<00:00:04.259> full

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
creating this plane but it was full

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.200 
creating this plane but it was full
offices<00:00:05.130> that<00:00:05.310> we<00:00:05.400> didn't<00:00:05.700> want<00:00:05.910> it<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.000> be

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
offices that we didn't want it to be

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.490 
offices that we didn't want it to be
full<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:07.610> inside<00:00:08.610> there<00:00:09.059> are<00:00:09.090> faces<00:00:09.920> bad<00:00:10.920> faces

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:12.500 
full of inside there are faces bad faces

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.539 
full of inside there are faces bad faces
so<00:00:13.500> in<00:00:13.679> this<00:00:13.769> episode<00:00:13.889> we're<00:00:14.130> gonna<00:00:14.250> make<00:00:14.460> it

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
so in this episode we're gonna make it

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.460 
so in this episode we're gonna make it
so<00:00:14.639> that's<00:00:14.820> hollow<00:00:17.720> the<00:00:18.720> way<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.930> do<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.260> is

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
so that's hollow the way to do that is

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.560 
so that's hollow the way to do that is
to<00:00:19.710> use<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.220> function<00:00:20.609> called<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.910> transparent

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
to use a function called is transparent

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.099 
to use a function called is transparent
now<00:00:21.720> if<00:00:21.840> you<00:00:21.930> followed<00:00:22.230> along<00:00:22.289> with<00:00:22.619> my<00:00:22.710> first

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
now if you followed along with my first

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.179 
now if you followed along with my first
version<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.680> may<00:00:25.890> actually

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
version of this you may actually

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.519 
version of this you may actually
remember<00:00:26.849> most<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.210> these<00:00:27.300> functions<00:00:27.779> these

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
remember most of these functions these

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.169 
remember most of these functions these
are<00:00:28.650> slightly<00:00:28.949> more<00:00:29.130> polished<00:00:29.580> than<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.970> ones

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
are slightly more polished than the ones

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.500 
are slightly more polished than the ones
I<00:00:30.330> was<00:00:30.449> using<00:00:30.630> back<00:00:30.929> then<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:32.120> I<00:00:33.120> said<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.450> I

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
I was using back then and I said that I

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.639 
I was using back then and I said that I
was<00:00:33.600> gonna<00:00:33.719> get<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.960> noise<00:00:34.079> fields<00:00:34.590> in

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
was gonna get the noise fields in

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.049 
was gonna get the noise fields in
episode<00:00:34.950> 3<00:00:35.250> but<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.550> looks<00:00:35.700> like<00:00:35.790> that's<00:00:35.940> more

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
episode 3 but it looks like that's more

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.119 
episode 3 but it looks like that's more
like<00:00:36.180> episode<00:00:36.719> 5<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:36.989> was<00:00:37.290> I'm<00:00:37.590> taking<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.010> at

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
like episode 5 I was I'm taking this at

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.260 
like episode 5 I was I'm taking this at
a<00:00:38.190> much<00:00:38.340> slower<00:00:38.489> pace<00:00:38.730> with<00:00:39.120> smaller

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
a much slower pace with smaller

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.340 
a much slower pace with smaller
individual<00:00:42.270> lessons<00:00:42.719> are<00:00:42.809> much<00:00:42.960> shorter

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
individual lessons are much shorter

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.840 
individual lessons are much shorter
which<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.590> good<00:00:43.770> that's<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.430> better<00:00:44.700> way<00:00:44.760> to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
which is good that's the better way to

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.170 
which is good that's the better way to
do<00:00:45.030> it

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
do it

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.119 
do it
so<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:45.809> we're<00:00:45.930> actually<00:00:46.050> gonna<00:00:46.260> do<00:00:46.440> here<00:00:46.980> is

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
so what we're actually gonna do here is

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.350 
so what we're actually gonna do here is
we're<00:00:47.219> gonna<00:00:47.309> build<00:00:47.579> another<00:00:47.789> instead<00:00:48.270> of

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
we're gonna build another instead of

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.180 
we're gonna build another instead of
just<00:00:48.750> build<00:00:48.989> face<00:00:49.260> we're<00:00:49.500> also<00:00:49.590> gonna<00:00:49.739> have<00:00:49.829> a

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
just build face we're also gonna have a

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.840 
just build face we're also gonna have a
public<00:00:50.989> virtual<00:00:51.989> bool<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:53.570> transparent<00:00:55.850> into

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
public virtual bool is transparent into

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.470 
public virtual bool is transparent into
X<00:00:57.059> into<00:00:57.329> y<00:00:57.680> its<00:00:58.680> Z<00:00:58.980> we<00:00:59.399> also<00:00:59.640> are<00:01:00.059> going<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.359> need

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
X into y its Z we also are going to need

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.260 
X into y its Z we also are going to need
a<00:01:01.079> lot<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.559> other<00:01:01.829> things<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.430> support<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:03.000> in

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
a lot of other things to support this in

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.549 
a lot of other things to support this in
the<00:01:03.420> near<00:01:03.539> future<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.140> might<00:01:04.229> as<00:01:04.320> well<00:01:04.379> do

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
the near future so it might as well do

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.679 
the near future so it might as well do
them<00:01:04.710> now<00:01:05.240> from<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> virtual<00:01:06.630> bite<00:01:07.110> get<00:01:07.710> bite

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
them now from the virtual bite get bite

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:16.940 
them now from the virtual bite get bite
into<00:01:09.689> X<00:01:09.810> into<00:01:10.140> Y<00:01:10.939> Z<00:01:13.340> if<00:01:14.340> X<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.909> less<00:01:14.970> than<00:01:15.119> 0<00:01:15.540> or<00:01:15.960> Y

not equal to world current world would
there<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:44.189> go

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
there we go

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.569 
there we go
so<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:45.990> any<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.290> those<00:01:46.439> things<00:01:46.770> are<00:01:47.040> true<00:01:47.310> then

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
so if any of those things are true then

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.719 
so if any of those things are true then
our<00:01:47.970> bite<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.509> going<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.290> be<00:01:49.439> 0<00:01:50.130> it's<00:01:50.549> going<00:01:50.670> to

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
our bite is going to be 0 it's going to

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.560 
our bite is going to be 0 it's going to
be<00:01:50.820> an<00:01:51.000> error<00:01:51.360> that's<00:01:52.170> actually<00:01:52.619> not<00:01:52.829> true<00:01:53.570> but

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
be an error that's actually not true but

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.910 
be an error that's actually not true but
it's<00:01:54.720> true<00:01:54.840> for<00:01:54.869> now<00:01:55.110> later<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.680> we're<00:01:55.829> gonna

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
it's true for now later on we're gonna

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.350 
it's true for now later on we're gonna
have<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.219> actually<00:01:56.490> go<00:01:56.640> over<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.240> next

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
have it actually go over to the next

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.679 
have it actually go over to the next
chunk<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.930> look<00:01:58.680> there

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.620 

like<00:02:04.689> so<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.979> herein<00:02:06.159> is<00:02:06.340> transparent<00:02:07.090> we're

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
like so so herein is transparent we're

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.350 
like so so herein is transparent we're
going<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.960> need<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.289> have<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.890> set<00:02:09.670> of<00:02:09.910> arguments

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
going to need to have a set of arguments

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.600 
going to need to have a set of arguments
I<00:02:11.230> mean<00:02:11.770> I<00:02:11.860> said<00:02:12.010> about<00:02:12.160> you<00:02:12.250> in<00:02:12.340> some<00:02:12.430> talk

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
I mean I said about you in some talk

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.680 
I mean I said about you in some talk
about<00:02:12.760> white<00:02:13.300> brick<00:02:13.630> equals<00:02:14.110> get<00:02:14.349> white<00:02:15.690> XYZ

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
about white brick equals get white XYZ

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.970 
about white brick equals get white XYZ
we're<00:02:17.170> gonna<00:02:17.319> get<00:02:17.410> a<00:02:17.440> bite<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.739> we<00:02:17.800> need<00:02:17.920> to

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
we're gonna get a bite and we need to

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.020 
we're gonna get a bite and we need to
have<00:02:18.069> a<00:02:18.099> switch<00:02:18.310> statement<00:02:18.459> for<00:02:18.880> our

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
have a switch statement for our

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.920 
have a switch statement for our
beautiful<00:02:19.360> brick<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:22.420> what<00:02:22.569> are<00:02:22.660> we<00:02:22.720> going<00:02:22.840> to

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
beautiful brick so what are we going to

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.780 
beautiful brick so what are we going to
do<00:02:22.989> exactly<00:02:23.260> with<00:02:23.590> this<00:02:23.709> switch<00:02:23.920> statement<00:02:23.950> we

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
do exactly with this switch statement we

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.820 
do exactly with this switch statement we
have<00:02:24.940> actually<00:02:25.239> a<00:02:25.300> lot<00:02:25.330> of<00:02:25.480> options<00:02:25.750> here<00:02:26.290> but

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
have actually a lot of options here but

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.740 
have actually a lot of options here but
since<00:02:27.069> we<00:02:27.250> only<00:02:27.370> have<00:02:27.459> two<00:02:27.610> wrecks<00:02:28.360> right<00:02:28.600> now

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
since we only have two wrecks right now

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.080 
since we only have two wrecks right now
zero<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.410> one<00:02:29.680> we're<00:02:30.190> only<00:02:30.400> going<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.790> default

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
zero and one we're only going to default

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:40.320 
zero and one we're only going to default
to<00:02:31.180> those<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:38.260> we're<00:02:38.890> culling<00:02:39.340> interior<00:02:40.000> faces

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
to those so we're culling interior faces

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.770 
to those so we're culling interior faces
so<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.200> idea<00:02:41.530> here<00:02:41.590> is<00:02:41.799> that<00:02:42.040> if<00:02:42.280> this<00:02:43.120> face<00:02:43.480> is

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
so the idea here is that if this face is

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.410 
so the idea here is that if this face is
pointing<00:02:44.290> at<00:02:44.500> another<00:02:44.950> opaque<00:02:45.489> brick<00:02:45.880> we

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
pointing at another opaque brick we

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.479 
pointing at another opaque brick we
don't<00:02:46.630> need<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.930> draw<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.260> face<00:02:47.590> on<00:02:47.860> either

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
don't need to draw the face on either

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.460 
don't need to draw the face on either
brick<00:02:48.790> we<00:02:49.000> don't<00:02:49.150> that<00:02:49.630> face<00:02:49.930> will<00:02:50.140> never<00:02:50.230> be

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
brick we don't that face will never be

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.830 
brick we don't that face will never be
seen<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:51.519> will<00:02:51.700> definitely<00:02:52.000> cut<00:02:52.540> down

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
seen and that will definitely cut down

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.710 
seen and that will definitely cut down
on<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.200> number<00:02:53.319> of<00:02:54.180> faces<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.209> we<00:02:55.480> draw

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
on the number of faces that we draw

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.720 
on the number of faces that we draw
which<00:02:56.080> will<00:02:56.260> radically<00:02:56.650> reduce<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.459> number

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
which will radically reduce the number

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.270 
which will radically reduce the number
of<00:02:57.760> vertex<00:02:58.239> as<00:02:58.390> we<00:02:58.540> use<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:59.590> triangles<00:03:00.069> we<00:03:00.160> use

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
of vertex as we use and triangles we use

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.580 
of vertex as we use and triangles we use
by<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.030> more<00:03:01.360> than<00:03:01.390> half<00:03:01.540> we'll<00:03:02.019> end<00:03:02.500> up

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
by the more than half we'll end up

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.520 
by the more than half we'll end up
cutting<00:03:02.830> all<00:03:03.100> of<00:03:03.130> them<00:03:03.340> down<00:03:03.930> so<00:03:04.930> here<00:03:05.319> this<00:03:05.470> is

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
cutting all of them down so here this is

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.180 
cutting all of them down so here this is
our<00:03:05.890> left<00:03:06.850> wall<00:03:07.239> so<00:03:07.540> we're<00:03:07.690> gonna<00:03:07.780> say<00:03:08.190> let's

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
our left wall so we're gonna say let's

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:18.810 
our left wall so we're gonna say let's
go<00:03:09.280> ahead<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.489> just<00:03:09.609> mark<00:03:09.820> them<00:03:09.880> all<00:03:17.820> actually

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:18.820 
go ahead and just mark them all actually

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.340 
go ahead and just mark them all actually
I<00:03:19.000> don't<00:03:19.299> believe<00:03:19.540> this<00:03:19.660> is<00:03:19.720> true<00:03:20.049> I<00:03:20.079> think

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
I don't believe this is true I think

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.539 
I don't believe this is true I think
I've<00:03:20.440> got<00:03:20.560> those<00:03:20.680> reversed<00:03:24.239> yeah<00:03:25.269> why<00:03:25.720> is<00:03:25.780> up

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
I've got those reversed yeah why is up

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.910 
I've got those reversed yeah why is up
not<00:03:27.549> down

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.830 

and<00:03:31.190> I<00:03:31.580> believe<00:03:32.000> that<00:03:32.030> this<00:03:32.330> is<00:03:32.450> front<00:03:32.750> and

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
and I believe that this is front and

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.040 
and I believe that this is front and
back<00:03:33.110> but<00:03:33.980> I<00:03:34.010> might<00:03:34.280> have<00:03:34.400> these<00:03:34.580> backwards

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
back but I might have these backwards

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:43.030 
back but I might have these backwards
whatever<00:03:36.050> I<00:03:37.840> do<00:03:38.840> have<00:03:39.050> them<00:03:39.170> backwards<00:03:42.040> there

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
whatever I do have them backwards there

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.680 
whatever I do have them backwards there
we<00:03:43.130> go

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
we go

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.510 
we go
that<00:03:45.319> was<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.590> error<00:03:45.740> I<00:03:45.830> was<00:03:46.040> making<00:03:46.340> in<00:03:46.430> the

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
that was the error I was making in the

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.330 
that was the error I was making in the
original<00:03:46.970> series<00:03:47.240> by<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.570> way<00:03:47.750> so<00:03:48.650> if<00:03:49.070> it's

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
original series by the way so if it's

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.330 
original series by the way so if it's
the<00:03:49.459> left<00:03:49.670> wall<00:03:49.850> we<00:03:50.000> don't<00:03:50.030> we<00:03:50.680> if<00:03:51.680> it<00:03:52.010> is<00:03:52.190> the

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
the left wall we don't we if it is the

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.040 
the left wall we don't we if it is the
left<00:03:52.520> wall<00:03:52.820> and<00:03:53.150> then<00:03:53.240> we<00:03:53.360> have<00:03:53.510> to<00:03:53.630> check<00:03:53.870> to

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
left wall and then we have to check to

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.010 
left wall and then we have to check to
the<00:03:54.200> left<00:03:54.380> so<00:03:54.800> if<00:03:55.580> not<00:03:56.420> is<00:03:56.950> transparent<00:03:57.950> X<00:03:58.880> -1<00:03:59.420> Y

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
the left so if not is transparent X -1 Y

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.790 
the left so if not is transparent X -1 Y
Z<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:01.220> then<00:04:01.520> draw<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.790> face<00:04:02.060> if<00:04:03.050> not<00:04:03.500> is

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
Z and then draw the face if not is

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:10.240 
Z and then draw the face if not is
transparent<00:04:05.410> X<00:04:06.410> plus<00:04:07.010> 1<00:04:07.900> Y<00:04:08.900> Z<00:04:09.470> then<00:04:09.920> draw<00:04:10.190> the

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
transparent X plus 1 Y Z then draw the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.370 
transparent X plus 1 Y Z then draw the
face<00:04:10.840> simple<00:04:11.840> enough<00:04:12.019> right

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
face simple enough right

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.280 
face simple enough right
and<00:04:12.800> we<00:04:13.040> just<00:04:13.220> keep<00:04:13.310> doing<00:04:13.430> that<00:04:17.169> except<00:04:18.169> of

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
and we just keep doing that except of

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.930 
and we just keep doing that except of
course<00:04:18.320> we<00:04:18.859> have<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.130> point<00:04:19.310> it<00:04:19.790> in<00:04:19.850> the

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
course we have to point it in the

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.180 
course we have to point it in the
correct<00:04:20.090> direction<00:04:20.180> each<00:04:20.660> time<00:04:20.930> so<00:04:21.859> here<00:04:22.070> we

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
correct direction each time so here we

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:34.060 
correct direction each time so here we
have<00:04:23.710> y<00:04:24.710> -1<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:26.950> y<00:04:27.950> plus<00:04:28.430> 1<00:04:28.640> here<00:04:29.540> we<00:04:29.720> have<00:04:33.070> Z

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
have y -1 and y plus 1 here we have Z

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.590 
have y -1 and y plus 1 here we have Z
minus<00:04:34.640> 1<00:04:34.820> and<00:04:35.120> Z<00:04:35.510> plus<00:04:35.750> 1<00:04:37.300> so<00:04:38.300> let's<00:04:38.450> go<00:04:38.540> ahead

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
minus 1 and Z plus 1 so let's go ahead

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.010 
minus 1 and Z plus 1 so let's go ahead
and<00:04:38.720> contrast<00:04:39.440> and<00:04:40.510> not<00:04:41.510> all<00:04:41.600> code<00:04:41.810> paths

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
and contrast and not all code paths

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:52.659 
and contrast and not all code paths
return<00:04:42.260> value

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:58.379 

oh<00:04:52.960> no<00:04:53.960> we<00:04:54.319> fell<00:04:54.530> through<00:04:54.999> what<00:04:55.999> happened

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
oh no we fell through what happened

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.939 
oh no we fell through what happened
it<00:04:59.389> looks<00:04:59.569> like<00:04:59.659> our<00:04:59.930> y-axis<00:05:00.740> is<00:05:01.580> screwed<00:05:02.180> up

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:02.949 
it looks like our y-axis is screwed up

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.309 
it looks like our y-axis is screwed up
and<00:05:04.569> none<00:05:05.569> of<00:05:05.599> the<00:05:05.719> other<00:05:05.840> ones<00:05:05.990> worked<00:05:06.199> either

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:06.319 
and none of the other ones worked either

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:08.739 
and none of the other ones worked either
everything<00:05:07.009> didn't<00:05:07.279> work<00:05:07.460> the<00:05:08.300> things<00:05:08.539> that

00:05:08.739 --> 00:05:08.749 
everything didn't work the things that

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:09.939 
everything didn't work the things that
are<00:05:08.840> supposed<00:05:09.050> to<00:05:09.080> be<00:05:09.199> transparent<00:05:09.800> are

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
are supposed to be transparent are

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:11.170 
are supposed to be transparent are
opaque<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:10.490> the<00:05:10.580> things<00:05:10.729> that<00:05:10.849> are<00:05:10.939> opaque

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
opaque and the things that are opaque

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.550 
opaque and the things that are opaque
are<00:05:11.449> supposed<00:05:11.659> to<00:05:11.689> be<00:05:11.779> transparent<00:05:12.259> you<00:05:12.439> know

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
are supposed to be transparent you know

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.980 
are supposed to be transparent you know
why<00:05:12.680> that<00:05:12.800> is<00:05:12.919> because<00:05:13.580> I<00:05:13.999> have<00:05:14.569> is

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
why that is because I have is

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.200 
why that is because I have is
transparent<00:05:15.650> backwards<00:05:16.039> I<00:05:16.249> must<00:05:18.580> know<00:05:19.580> that's

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
transparent backwards I must know that's

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.469 
transparent backwards I must know that's
correct<00:05:21.580> if<00:05:22.580> it's<00:05:22.759> empty<00:05:22.939> then<00:05:23.300> it's

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
correct if it's empty then it's

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:34.640 
correct if it's empty then it's
transparent<00:05:23.930> Oh

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.830 

let's<00:05:35.250> make<00:05:35.490> basic<00:05:35.970> logic<00:05:36.360> errors<00:05:38.750> there<00:05:39.750> we

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
let's make basic logic errors there we

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.439 
let's make basic logic errors there we
go<00:05:39.960> much<00:05:40.260> better<00:05:40.699> so<00:05:41.699> now<00:05:41.850> you<00:05:41.910> can<00:05:42.150> see<00:05:42.330> that

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
go much better so now you can see that

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.600 
go much better so now you can see that
this<00:05:42.660> oh<00:05:42.990> well<00:05:43.500> my<00:05:43.710> camera<00:05:44.190> is<00:05:44.250> upside<00:05:44.580> down

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
this oh well my camera is upside down

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.469 
this oh well my camera is upside down
for<00:05:44.970> some<00:05:45.120> reason

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
for some reason

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.450 
for some reason
but<00:05:46.410> you<00:05:46.500> can<00:05:46.620> see<00:05:46.710> that<00:05:46.830> now<00:05:46.919> it's<00:05:47.070> Hollow

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
but you can see that now it's Hollow

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.070 
but you can see that now it's Hollow
there's<00:05:47.790> no<00:05:47.910> longer<00:05:48.180> anything<00:05:48.389> inside<00:05:48.810> of<00:05:48.870> it

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
there's no longer anything inside of it

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:50.930 
there's no longer anything inside of it
but<00:05:49.680> our<00:05:49.800> collision<00:05:50.190> mesh<00:05:50.370> wall<00:05:50.580> still<00:05:50.790> works

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
but our collision mesh wall still works

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.620 
but our collision mesh wall still works
fine<00:05:51.150> come<00:05:51.900> on

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
fine come on

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.939 
fine come on
but<00:05:54.630> our<00:05:54.720> collision<00:05:55.110> mesh<00:05:55.260> still<00:05:55.500> works<00:05:55.680> fine

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
but our collision mesh still works fine

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:58.280 
but our collision mesh still works fine
because<00:05:56.220> it<00:05:57.180> only<00:05:57.300> relies<00:05:57.720> on<00:05:57.750> the<00:05:57.960> exterior

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
because it only relies on the exterior

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.530 
because it only relies on the exterior
faces<00:05:58.830> in<00:05:59.100> fact<00:05:59.669> the<00:05:59.820> collision<00:06:00.180> mesh<00:06:00.330> is

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:00.540 
faces in fact the collision mesh is

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:02.330 
faces in fact the collision mesh is
going<00:06:00.750> to<00:06:00.810> be<00:06:00.900> in<00:06:00.990> the<00:06:01.080> slowest<00:06:01.440> part<00:06:01.680> of<00:06:01.800> this

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
going to be in the slowest part of this

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.550 
going to be in the slowest part of this
entire<00:06:03.199> chunk<00:06:04.199> calculation<00:06:04.919> thing<00:06:05.340> so<00:06:06.560> it's

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
entire chunk calculation thing so it's

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.170 
entire chunk calculation thing so it's
good<00:06:07.830> to<00:06:07.979> keep<00:06:08.130> the<00:06:08.280> collision<00:06:08.669> the<00:06:08.910> mesh<00:06:09.030> is

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
good to keep the collision the mesh is

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.370 
good to keep the collision the mesh is
small<00:06:09.389> for<00:06:09.570> the<00:06:09.630> collision<00:06:09.930> mesh<00:06:10.080> and<00:06:10.229> later

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
small for the collision mesh and later

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.320 
small for the collision mesh and later
on<00:06:10.530> we're<00:06:10.680> actually<00:06:10.770> gonna<00:06:11.010> make<00:06:11.160> a<00:06:11.400> reduced

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
on we're actually gonna make a reduced

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.120 
on we're actually gonna make a reduced
mesh<00:06:12.600> specifically<00:06:13.350> for<00:06:13.590> the<00:06:13.710> collision

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
mesh specifically for the collision

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.070 
mesh specifically for the collision
system<00:06:14.479> because<00:06:15.479> otherwise<00:06:15.750> we'll<00:06:15.960> be<00:06:15.990> here

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
system because otherwise we'll be here

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.640 
system because otherwise we'll be here
all<00:06:16.350> day

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
all day

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.560 
all day
count<00:06:17.280> recalculate<00:06:17.910> in<00:06:17.970> that<00:06:18.060> collision<00:06:18.270> mesh

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
count recalculate in that collision mesh

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.240 
count recalculate in that collision mesh
and<00:06:18.690> it'll<00:06:18.840> freeze<00:06:19.199> for<00:06:19.560> a<00:06:19.590> second<00:06:19.919> every<00:06:20.100> time

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
and it'll freeze for a second every time

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.670 
and it'll freeze for a second every time
we<00:06:20.370> do<00:06:20.520> so<00:06:20.729> but<00:06:21.690> there's<00:06:22.050> an<00:06:22.139> eyeing<00:06:22.320> an

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
we do so but there's an eyeing an

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.610 
we do so but there's an eyeing an
annoying<00:06:22.979> problem<00:06:23.190> here<00:06:23.490> I'm<00:06:23.610> pretty<00:06:24.030> sure

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
annoying problem here I'm pretty sure

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.379 
annoying problem here I'm pretty sure
that<00:06:25.620> this<00:06:25.889> should<00:06:26.280> be<00:06:26.430> returning<00:06:26.880> a<00:06:27.060> value<00:06:27.180> I

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:27.389 
that this should be returning a value I

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:28.909 
that this should be returning a value I
think<00:06:27.960> that<00:06:28.080> what<00:06:28.169> the<00:06:28.260> problem<00:06:28.440> is<00:06:28.680> is<00:06:28.889> that

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
think that what the problem is is that

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:32.150 
think that what the problem is is that
range<00:06:29.370> is<00:06:29.699> exclusive<00:06:30.360> not<00:06:30.539> inclusive<00:06:31.160> yeah

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 
range is exclusive not inclusive yeah

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.480 
range is exclusive not inclusive yeah
there<00:06:32.340> we<00:06:32.400> go<00:06:32.430> much<00:06:32.760> better<00:06:34.130> so<00:06:35.130> now<00:06:35.160> you<00:06:35.280> can

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
there we go much better so now you can

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.279 
there we go much better so now you can
see<00:06:35.639> that<00:06:35.820> we<00:06:35.970> have<00:06:36.210> a<00:06:36.240> fully<00:06:36.720> functional

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:37.289 
see that we have a fully functional

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:40.490 
see that we have a fully functional
screen<00:06:38.130> here<00:06:38.570> you<00:06:39.570> can't<00:06:39.810> really<00:06:39.900> see<00:06:40.289> any<00:06:40.410> of

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
screen here you can't really see any of

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.960 
screen here you can't really see any of
the<00:06:40.680> bricks<00:06:40.919> as<00:06:41.099> bricks<00:06:41.460> yet<00:06:41.789> they're<00:06:41.940> just

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
the bricks as bricks yet they're just

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.890 
the bricks as bricks yet they're just
kind<00:06:42.389> of<00:06:42.590> faceless<00:06:43.590> white<00:06:43.860> blobs<00:06:44.750> but<00:06:45.750> we've

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
kind of faceless white blobs but we've

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.029 
kind of faceless white blobs but we've
already<00:06:46.050> got<00:06:46.200> shadows<00:06:46.650> and<00:06:46.800> we've<00:06:46.919> already

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 
already got shadows and we've already

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:50.390 
already got shadows and we've already
got<00:06:47.250> all<00:06:47.310> that<00:06:47.460> stuff<00:06:47.669> so<00:06:47.960> next<00:06:48.960> episode<00:06:49.410> what

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
got all that stuff so next episode what

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.070 
got all that stuff so next episode what
we're<00:06:50.490> gonna<00:06:50.580> do<00:06:50.880> is<00:06:51.210> we're<00:06:51.510> going<00:06:51.660> to<00:06:51.780> start

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
we're gonna do is we're going to start

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.379 
we're gonna do is we're going to start
to<00:06:52.289> delve<00:06:52.560> into<00:06:52.800> the<00:06:53.039> wild<00:06:53.430> wild<00:06:53.639> world<00:06:54.030> of

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:54.389 
to delve into the wild wild world of

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:57.020 
to delve into the wild wild world of
noise<00:06:54.690> fields<00:06:55.289> that's<00:06:56.220> going<00:06:56.430> to<00:06:56.520> be<00:06:56.639> quite<00:06:56.880> an

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
noise fields that's going to be quite an

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:03.140 
noise fields that's going to be quite an
