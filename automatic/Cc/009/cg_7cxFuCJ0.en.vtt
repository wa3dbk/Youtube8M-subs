00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.950
 All New Year's greetings New Year's Eve 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.550
 tomorrow 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:11.910
 I was going to take off mad 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.599
 video about books but I have such a list 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.940
 turned out 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.390
 what after this list say these 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.550
 happy new year versions all the best 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.699
 I had some dissonance and I 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.410
 I realized that it would sound weird 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.689
 so I decided to replay everything a little 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:33.480
 and about these books I will shoot a little video 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.570
 later today i will show a book which 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.780
 could have been 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.370
 book what book of desire can be 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.410
 read before new year she is not 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.190
 Christmas not new year to new 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:53.960
 year has no relationship but 90 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:56.760
 90 percent well 85 percent probably 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.710
 people feel from her just charge 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.320
 energy and look to the future I will say with 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.510
 certainty 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.320
 with courage shrug shoulders 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.420
 my eyes light up in general this book to me 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.560
 advised my friend who was 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.140
 pretty serious trouble him 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.360
 such a black stripe was and then gave me 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.380
 this book with words this book saved 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:31.350
 my life is an adventure of major zvyagin 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:34.290

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.210
 you understand what the text will be 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:44.130
 first and secondly each of us 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:48.030
 probably want someone to 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.060
 a certain moment did not just understand ours 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.070
 problems not just helped, but just 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.210
 here now took by the collar and made 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.340
 do something right said right here 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.960
 need to do here and here do this 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.110
 so here and everything will be fine 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.710
 if you do that 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.220
 and there is such a hero here major 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.960
 zvyagin he is just such he is like this 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.140
 perfect hero led ru 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.790
 he is like a guardian angel like a wizard 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.750
 such a simple simple ordinary wizard 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.470
 intervenes in the fate of people changes them 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.460
 makes sort of like perfect 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.840
 incredible 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:34.400
 everyday things and it is perceived as 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:38.630
 a miracle and after this book feeling that 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.030
 a man can all all his problems all 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:46.070
 his difficulties are all solvable 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:50.980
 whatever terrible they were so or 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:55.100
 otherwise you can exit any black strip. 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:59.930
 Here is a book and everything else this 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:01.880
 hero he is not perfect i in my time when 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.540
 I read this book for the first time. 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.470
 read the prologue the story is really here 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.140
 several stories 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.090
 here she jerked me she was for 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.260
 me so tough and she was in 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.400
 the very beginning and then I thought why 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.530
 why is she at first like this 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.080
 for myself I answered this question as well 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.060
 Here I should not have to be fascinated 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.030
 be fascinated to fall into some kind 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:33.830
 admiring state in some kind of euphoria 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.650
 from the main character because not 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.560
 every decision every decision can be 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:45.380
 controversial about this book can be a lot 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:47.630
 argue and need probably need 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.750
 think about everything that happens there 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.630
 try on yourself and look like you 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.830
 react to what's happening to me but 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.320
 the main 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:02.930
 some promise and they are absolutely beautiful 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:07.910
 Major Zvyagin believes that his main 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:12.340
 principle cannot be helped by all but it is quite 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.340
 no reason not to help someone alone 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:19.260
 Here is a book I congratulate you on 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.550
 Happy New Year I wish to open 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:26.310
 myself find this major zvyagin because 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.590
 that of course this way of the hero and at 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.870
 everyone inside is 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:38.130
 I'd also like to wish you warmth 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:41.100
 inside it not just this 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.610
 some light which is one of us 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.190
 there is so that he warmed not only you 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.290
 so that it expands in any situation 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.470
 even the worst 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:55.140
 he remained strong could support you 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:59.040
 and support to warm those who are 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.830
 near you and want to wish you 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.100
 tenderness 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:07.590
 be gentle I really liked how 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.340
 told steven king his book what 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.010
 tenderness 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.979
 does not allow to creep up to the heart 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.500
 blackness 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:19.020
 I agree completely therefore 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:23.070
 more tenderness let it be yours 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.680
 life and now I want to congratulate you on 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.440
 a small bonus because it's funny 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.539
 the gizmo it made my day and I didn't 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.539
 I can not share with you again about this
