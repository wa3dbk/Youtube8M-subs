I'm<00:00:16.590> wondering<00:00:17.130> if<00:00:17.250> it's<00:00:17.430> going<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.609> be<00:00:17.699> just

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
I'm wondering if it's going to be just

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.179 
I'm wondering if it's going to be just
full<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.330> wood<00:00:18.600> when<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.320> read<00:00:19.590> online<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:20.039> looks

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
full of wood when I read online it looks

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.050 
full of wood when I read online it looks
like<00:00:20.310> some<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.580> them<00:00:20.699> are<00:00:20.789> filled<00:00:20.910> with

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
like some of them are filled with

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.820 
like some of them are filled with
possibly<00:00:21.810> rocks<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.350> bricks

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
possibly rocks and bricks

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.400 
possibly rocks and bricks
but<00:00:23.310> we<00:00:23.550> cut<00:00:23.760> open<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.090> bowling<00:00:24.359> ball<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.990> few

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
but we cut open this bowling ball a few

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.200 
but we cut open this bowling ball a few
months<00:00:25.680> back<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:26.609> just<00:00:26.699> natural

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
months back and so it's just natural

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.419 
months back and so it's just natural
that<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.689> cut<00:00:27.840> open<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.109> bowling<00:00:28.410> pin<00:00:28.560> now<00:00:28.769> but

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
that we cut open a bowling pin now but

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.220 
that we cut open a bowling pin now but
before<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:29.789> do<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:29.970> we're<00:00:30.900> going<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.109> have<00:00:31.199> a

before we do that we're going to have a

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.900 
before we do that we're going to have a
little<00:00:31.410> fun<00:00:31.500> with<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:31.980> see<00:00:32.040> if<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:32.759> can

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910
