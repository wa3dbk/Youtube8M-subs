doing a trick points down so that's

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.330

these water balloons onto that target
but<00:03:15.079> I<00:03:15.200> think<00:03:15.440> that<00:03:15.560> target<00:03:15.980> should<00:03:16.160> be<00:03:16.280> a

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
but I think that target should be a

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.789 
but I think that target should be a
little<00:03:16.760> bit<00:03:16.940> bigger<00:03:17.239> well<00:03:17.870> I<00:03:18.139> was<00:03:18.349> in<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.620> game

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
little bit bigger well I was in the game

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.770

but<00:03:19.190> I<00:03:19.250> chickened<00:03:19.579> out<00:03:19.700> so<00:03:19.940> now<00:03:20.120> I'm<00:03:20.419> part<00:03:20.690> of

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
but I chickened out so now I'm part of

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.220 
but I chickened out so now I'm part of
the<00:03:20.870> game

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
the game

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.759 
the game
serves<00:03:21.560> me<00:03:21.620> right<00:03:24.609> this<00:03:25.609> platform<00:03:26.120> game
