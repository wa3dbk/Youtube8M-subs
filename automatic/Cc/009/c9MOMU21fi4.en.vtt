it so first of all let's just start with
the<00:00:14.849> basics<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:16.199> get<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.410> protection<00:00:16.920> around

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
the basics to get a protection around

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.580 
the basics to get a protection around
this<00:00:17.400> gold<00:00:17.699> right<00:00:17.850> here<00:00:18.020> you<00:00:19.020> don't<00:00:19.199> hit<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
this gold right here you don't hit the

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.689 
this gold right here you don't hit the
gold<00:00:19.830> actually<00:00:21.980> you<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.220> actually<00:00:23.369> hit<00:00:23.640> a

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
gold actually you have to actually hit a

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.250 
gold actually you have to actually hit a
block<00:00:23.939> below<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:26.269> so<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.359> basically<00:00:27.779> have<00:00:28.109> to

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
block below it so you basically have to

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.020 
block below it so you basically have to
hit<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.560> block<00:00:28.859> right<00:00:28.890> there<00:00:31.820> I'm<00:00:32.820> not<00:00:32.969> sure

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
hit this block right there I'm not sure

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.290 
hit this block right there I'm not sure
why<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.870> but<00:00:34.230> it's<00:00:34.770> just<00:00:34.950> like<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.399> so

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
that right there alright let's set our
first<00:00:42.030> point<00:00:42.180> right<00:00:42.390> there<00:00:44.390> you<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.539> right

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
first point right there you just right

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.090 
first point right there you just right
click<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> wooden<00:00:46.410> shovel<00:00:46.739> that's<00:00:46.829> by

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
click with the wooden shovel that's by

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.910 
click with the wooden shovel that's by
default<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.730> then<00:00:48.600> let's<00:00:49.020> make<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> block<00:00:49.500> one

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
default and then let's make a block one

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.760 
default and then let's make a block one
high<00:00:50.239> just<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> get<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> good<00:00:51.780> region<00:00:52.680> around

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
high just to get a good region around

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.029 
high just to get a good region around
here<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.989> let's<00:00:54.989> right<00:00:55.170> click<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.739> basically

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
here and let's right click so basically

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.799 
here and let's right click so basically
what<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.610> doing<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.090> its<00:00:57.270> setting<00:00:57.600> two

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
what this is doing is its setting two

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.000 
what this is doing is its setting two
points<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.440> from<00:00:59.449> the<00:01:00.449> point<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.770> point

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
points and from the point on the point

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.680 
points and from the point on the point
beneath<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> point<00:01:03.210> up<00:01:03.359> there<00:01:03.510> it's

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
beneath it to the point up there it's

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.329 
beneath it to the point up there it's
