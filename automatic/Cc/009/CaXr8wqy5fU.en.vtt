00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 Welcome to the smart keynes 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.980
 My name is Benni &amp; Burkhardt today 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.080
 talk about the local fat burning 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.179
 you will certainly know that you have 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.260
 always at the top of a body part you have 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.450
 to find a problem 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.280
 the typical problem is with the format 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.379
 the lower abdomen we all know 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.119
 can then rather build lower is always 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.460
 very persistent we want one 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.500
 have hot sixpack and mostly in the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.269
 four upper four packs are visible 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.189
 and at the bottom is still one 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.140
 small swimming ring still the the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.910
 the last two orden muscles 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.070
 hidden and that is ultra persistent 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.770
 and you do that everybody he just goes 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.680
 not so away with the woman so that looks 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.379
 is so typical one typical men 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.570
 problem areas in the woman is it is a 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.410
 a little different the situation often falls on 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.840
 Rhine and on the thigh on it all 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.640
 usually relatively fast free of fat 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.469
 but has however thigh in 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.160
 and asch relatively much fat 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.199
 It does not matter where you are, by the way 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.199
 The fat distribution is always genetic 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.910
 therefore, when sowing, it requires 12 percent 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.979
 very different from any other 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.720
 twelve percent of the unit at 12 percent 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.740
 sixpack the other not so strong for it 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.090
 maybe even more fat 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.280
 shoulders with me is like this for example 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.890
 my shoulder is very fast very 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.630
 Quickly free from fat my breast as well 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.549
 my back comes afterwards 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.350
 after a bit of chest and 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.700
 Shoulder and belly is one with me 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.530
 real problem areas but for example 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.420
 my legs go in proportion to 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.630
 belly will be relatively free again 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.619
 relatively good field free that is depending on 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.270
 Corina kinetics where your body is 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.860
 Easier to give off the bed fell ten 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.200
 Body fat percentage also different 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.860
 you can not do that either 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.090
 determine that is that is given 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.340
 Of course, there are the classic ones 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.740
 problem areas and why does this exist? 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.479
 problems at all you've got to the Sun. 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.840
 imagine if you are tall 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.400
 body fat percentage 15 plus then always has 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.640
 one fatty many fat cells f 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.170
 in the blood and now you take off of course 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.430
 and the lower the 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.960
 Body fat content all the more defends itself 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.760
 the body, of course, continues 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.020
 thinks such a colleague man you have 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.390
 now here already ten kilos decreased 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.310
 and I still say keep losing 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.910
 or body always eager to 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.890
 to survive 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.870
 maybe not the pictures anymore 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.740
 So calories are needed because who 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.540
 even a warehouse because a warehouse is 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.220
 for the survival of at the 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.640
 prepare you when bad times 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.709
 come 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.750
 problem i am so prepared after that 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.670
 That's why he tries to think 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.530
 and now you are in deficit for a long time 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.209
 Do you take it and then you give it to him ? 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.830
 continue to be low in calories and then 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.410
 Take the fight is what are you supposed to do 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.310
 shit i resist that is 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.110
 each one ever 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.840
 body fat percentage was reached by 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.150
 under 10% or even ten percent of 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.010
 markets are progressing relatively well at the beginning 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.620
 goes and then towards the end it will be 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.970
 extremely persistent and that's easy 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.620
 hand that we are low 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.140
 Body fat percentage is even more difficult 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.620
 The fat cell mobilization 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.660
 Lipolysis and the resulting 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.769
 practically these stubborn ones too 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.080
 problem areas local fat burning 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.180
 local speak you can specifically on the 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.940
 Tummy slimming specifically on the arm 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.040
 back shoulders no matter where to lose weight 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.200
 is not there is not and theirs 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.209
 through the update lover bullshit 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.769
 because that you can not determine 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.620
 Flat on the body decreases that 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.640
 the body decides that is genetics 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.590
 and you can practically if the 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.690
 problemzone construction is you can always 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.760
 further down the sometime he gives the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.800
 problem zone free but you can now 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.420
 Do not say if my belly is falling 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.790
 Now I'm doing park rangers and 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.220
 then it goes away fat on the belly that gives 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.380
 It is not local fat burning 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.440
 not possible 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.000
 and that the problem areas are tough 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.030
 British example among that too 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.769
 is just because of the lipolysis yes that gives 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.140
 to say it on this subject i hope 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.450
 I think the topic video or video 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.400
 informative if yes, that's why 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.349
 can subscribe 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.349
 the next time it makes good euro
