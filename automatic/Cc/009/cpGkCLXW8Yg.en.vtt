00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
the classes just three main classes now

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.060 
the classes just three main classes now
can<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.020> give<00:00:16.230> us<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.379> quick<00:00:16.529> overview<00:00:16.710> of

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
those three classes and why you took the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.109 
those three classes and why you took the
decision<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.650> condense<00:00:20.220> them<00:00:20.369> down<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.000> just

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
decision to condense them down to just

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.439 
decision to condense them down to just
three<00:00:21.330> sure<00:00:22.279> but<00:00:23.279> we<00:00:23.430> have<00:00:23.640> three<00:00:24.119> very

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
three sure but we have three very

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.060 
three sure but we have three very
distinct<00:00:25.019> classes<00:00:25.260> because<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:25.740> look<00:00:25.890> at<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
distinct classes because we look at the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.150 
distinct classes because we look at the
different<00:00:26.340> playstyles<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:27.060> people<00:00:27.300> use<00:00:27.510> and

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
different playstyles that people use and

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.070 
different playstyles that people use and
we<00:00:29.160> found<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:29.910> connected<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.359> three<00:00:30.750> big

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
we found that connected the three big

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.229 
we found that connected the three big
ones<00:00:31.109> are<00:00:32.009> really<00:00:32.219> kind<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.090> more

easy<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.119> jump<00:01:30.329> into<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.320> lot<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.590> fun<00:01:31.770> so

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
easy to jump into and a lot of fun so

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.179 
easy to jump into and a lot of fun so
rather<00:01:32.640> than<00:01:33.560> whenever<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.680> start<00:01:34.890> playing

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
rather than whenever you start playing

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.240 
rather than whenever you start playing
it<00:01:35.400> needs<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:36.000> needs<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.299> fun<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:37.250> we

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
it needs it needs to be fun so we

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.789 
it needs it needs to be fun so we
realized<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.869> wing<00:01:39.869> or<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.049> launch<00:01:40.259> title<00:01:40.380> a

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
realized that wing or a launch title a

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.780 
realized that wing or a launch title a
lot<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:40.979> people<00:01:41.100> are<00:01:41.220> going<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.400> pick<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.579> up<00:01:41.670> at

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
lot of people are going to pick it up at

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.340 
lot of people are going to pick it up at
launch<00:01:42.000> but<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> lot<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.810> people<00:01:42.899> are<00:01:43.110> going<00:01:43.229> to

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
launch but a lot of people are going to

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.230 
launch but a lot of people are going to
join<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.710> after<00:01:43.920> launch<00:01:44.369> as<00:01:44.549> well<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:44.939> we<00:01:45.060> don't

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
join in after launch as well so we don't

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.080 
join in after launch as well so we don't
want<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.420> get<00:01:46.049> an<00:01:46.140> unfair<00:01:46.470> advantage<00:01:46.970> to<00:01:47.970> those

walking away all the good stuff and then

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.389 
walking away all the good stuff and then

and<00:03:01.430> we're<00:03:01.550> saying<00:03:01.670> okay<00:03:01.940> we<00:03:02.660> made<00:03:02.810> one<00:03:02.990> change

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
and we're saying okay we made one change

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.170 
and we're saying okay we made one change
for<00:03:03.260> example<00:03:03.410> of<00:03:03.830> any<00:03:04.010> player<00:03:04.250> can<00:03:04.490> now<00:03:04.580> have<00:03:04.850> a

for example of any player can now have a
drone<00:03:05.900> with<00:03:06.200> them<00:03:06.350> and<00:03:06.950> that<00:03:07.040> means<00:03:07.070> that<00:03:07.520> it's

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
drone with them and that means that it's

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.610 
drone with them and that means that it's
not<00:03:07.760> just<00:03:07.820> 24<00:03:08.360> now<00:03:08.510> it's<00:03:08.630> 48<00:03:08.930> entity<00:03:09.440> such

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
not just 24 now it's 48 entity such

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.650 
not just 24 now it's 48 entity such
after<00:03:09.980> kind<00:03:10.250> of<00:03:10.400> juggle<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.360> was<00:03:11.540> not

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
after kind of juggle and that was not

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.390 
after kind of juggle and that was not
possible<00:03:11.810> on<00:03:12.080> previous<00:03:12.470> games<00:03:12.680> at<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.130> same

possible on previous games at the same

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.190 
possible on previous games at the same
time<00:03:13.550> there<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.790> solution<00:03:14.000> that's<00:03:14.450> now<00:03:14.570> 1080p

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
time there a solution that's now 1080p

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.140 
time there a solution that's now 1080p
it's<00:03:15.440> running<00:03:15.680> at<00:03:15.739> 60<00:03:16.130> frames<00:03:16.160> it's<00:03:16.610> all<00:03:16.790> doing

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
it's running at 60 frames it's all doing

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.610 
it's running at 60 frames it's all doing
all<00:03:17.330> of<00:03:17.360> these<00:03:17.600> things<00:03:17.660> it's<00:03:18.320> kind<00:03:18.470> of<00:03:18.500> ok

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
all of these things it's kind of ok

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.170 
all of these things it's kind of ok
that's<00:03:19.070> a<00:03:19.190> big<00:03:19.370> step<00:03:19.580> up<00:03:19.730> from<00:03:19.880> what<00:03:19.970> we've

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
that's a big step up from what we've

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.120 
that's a big step up from what we've
done<00:03:20.270> in<00:03:20.390> previous<00:03:20.510> game<00:03:20.840> so<00:03:21.080> it's<00:03:22.040> a

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
done in previous game so it's a

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
done in previous game so it's a
combination<00:03:22.280> of<00:03:22.640> things<00:03:22.790> that<00:03:22.940> you<00:03:23.000> have<00:03:23.060> to
