00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.670
 let's make the homemade marzipan how it 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.139
 about Christmas because I decided to do 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.420
 this recipe that I hope you like to 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.820
 all so that everyone presented the 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.299
 ingredients we're going to need 200 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:19.720
 grams of ground almonds 150 grams of 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.670
 icing sugar and egg white 4 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.570
 tablespoons of water and I have put a 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.270
 little bit of honey too 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.980
 to start we mix the icing sugar 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.980
 with the ground almonds 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.530
 we add the 4 tablespoons of water and 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.530
 we are stirring 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.829
 let's mix it all we will be like 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.870
 a mass a little difficult to knead 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.480
 but in a little while and the problem 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.280
 we add also can be qualified 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.270
 also with cinnamon or with a little 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.270
 lemon what you want 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.510
 and after working the mask we will do 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.970
 a little ball like this one that I already tell you 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.150
 no problem a little while is done 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.950
 problem 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.930
 when we have the ball then we go 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.430
 making figures that this can 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.560
 help the children at home who will be 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.180
 vacation then we can do 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.550
 any kind of animal figure that 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.600
 come to mind then snails 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.460
 ducklings as turtles or fruits for 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.290
 fruits for example you can put a 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.800
 little bit of nail doing as if it were 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.650
 the corner of the fruit 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.280
 now we are going to ride the merengue 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.890
 let's say it's the beaten egg on top of 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.340
 the figures and well we will have the oven 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.020
 preheated to 180 degrees and we put the 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.360
 figurines up to about 2 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.610
 minutes or until they are golden brown and 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.490
 we'll have lists that easy between 1 and 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.410
 You can see the result, it is a 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.110
 good idea for three Christmases on 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.970
 everything with the children and that will be done 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.350
 the delights of everyone at home so 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.860
 I hope you liked it happy 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.860
 parties to all
