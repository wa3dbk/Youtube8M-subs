00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
lack of label you'll see that is from a

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.640 
lack of label you'll see that is from a
negotiation<00:02:31.760> which<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:32.510> not<00:02:32.660> really<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.989> winery

negotiation which is not really a winery

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.270 
negotiation which is not really a winery
it's<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:34.510> person<00:02:35.510> or<00:02:35.900> an<00:02:36.349> institution<00:02:37.250> that

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
it's a person or an institution that

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.180 
it's a person or an institution that
sources<00:02:38.239> grapes<00:02:38.630> from<00:02:38.870> different<00:02:39.470> regions<00:02:39.709> or

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
sources grapes from different regions or

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.190

a<00:02:40.220> different<00:02:40.519> appellation<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.630> make<00:02:41.959> their

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
a different appellation to make their

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.490 
a different appellation to make their
own<00:02:42.230> brand<00:02:42.890> but<00:02:43.310> their<00:02:43.489> own<00:02:43.700> label<00:02:44.150> on<00:02:44.329> it<00:02:44.500> it

own brand but their own label on it it

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.680 
own brand but their own label on it it
certainly<00:02:45.739> had<00:02:46.099> a<00:02:46.130> strong<00:02:46.489> black<00:02:46.819> cherry<00:02:47.510> and

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
certainly had a strong black cherry and

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.319 
certainly had a strong black cherry and
floral<00:02:48.049> scents<00:02:48.319> again<00:02:48.620> but<00:02:49.160> again<00:02:49.250> we<00:02:50.000> would

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
floral scents again but again we would

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.380 
floral scents again but again we would
not<00:02:50.510> recommend<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:51.730> maybe<00:02:52.730> it<00:02:52.910> just<00:02:52.940> needs<00:02:53.150> a

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
not recommend it maybe it just needs a

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.660 
not recommend it maybe it just needs a
little<00:02:53.420> more<00:02:53.720> time<00:02:53.989> I<00:02:54.350> don't<00:02:54.799> know<00:02:54.890> but<00:02:55.340> you

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670
