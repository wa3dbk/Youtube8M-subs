you've taken a painting class before
this<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:09.960> gonna<00:00:10.139> be<00:00:10.349> something<00:00:10.769> you've

already learned but for those of you
that<00:00:13.259> have<00:00:13.349> never<00:00:13.500> been<00:00:13.710> instructed<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.370> how

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
that have never been instructed on how

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.790 
that have never been instructed on how
to<00:00:14.610> paint<00:00:14.880> something<00:00:15.599> as<00:00:15.870> simple<00:00:16.289> as<00:00:16.410> this<00:00:16.560> is

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
to paint something as simple as this is

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.830 
to paint something as simple as this is
gonna<00:00:16.920> make<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.160> big<00:00:17.430> difference<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.090> the

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
gonna make a big difference and the

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.300 
gonna make a big difference and the
general<00:00:19.140> idea<00:00:19.410> is<00:00:19.500> when<00:00:19.830> you're<00:00:19.949> painting

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
general idea is when you're painting

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.400 
general idea is when you're painting
something<00:00:20.550> that<00:00:20.850> has<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.300> lot<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.840> layered

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
something that has a lot of layered

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.939 
something that has a lot of layered
content<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.880> start<00:00:24.269> at<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.869> back<00:00:25.050> but<00:00:25.800> as<00:00:25.920> a

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
content to start at the back but as a

paint<00:00:33.660> store<00:00:34.820> so<00:00:35.820> if<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:35.940> were<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.059> make<00:00:36.149> this

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
paint store so if I were to make this

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.080 
paint store so if I were to make this
painting<00:00:36.840> here<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.140> would<00:00:37.380> begin<00:00:38.040> with<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.760> sky

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
painting here I would begin with the sky

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.569 
painting here I would begin with the sky
I<00:00:39.450> paint<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.899> sky<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:40.410> if<00:00:40.590> there<00:00:40.829> was<00:00:40.980> nothing

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
I paint the sky as if there was nothing

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.639 
I paint the sky as if there was nothing
there<00:00:42.000> at<00:00:42.180> all<00:00:42.270> look<00:00:42.570> at<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.050> clear<00:00:43.350> day

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
there at all look at just a clear day

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.160 
there at all look at just a clear day
and<00:00:43.920> then<00:00:44.700> maybe<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.000> paint<00:00:45.360> clouds<00:00:45.719> over<00:00:46.020> that

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
and then maybe I paint clouds over that

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.350 
and then maybe I paint clouds over that
because<00:00:46.620> those<00:00:46.890> are<00:00:47.070> overlapping<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.180> blue

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
because those are overlapping the blue

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.930 
because those are overlapping the blue
of<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.510> sky<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.050> from<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.160> point<00:00:50.399> forward<00:00:50.760> I

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
of the sky and from that point forward I

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.700 
of the sky and from that point forward I
would<00:00:51.000> just<00:00:51.180> work<00:00:51.480> my<00:00:51.510> way<00:00:52.020> towards<00:00:52.410> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
would just work my way towards the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.400 
would just work my way towards the
foreground<00:00:53.090> so<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.120> would<00:00:54.390> do<00:00:54.539> background

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
foreground so I would do background

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.229 
foreground so I would do background
objects<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.160> might<00:00:56.370> get<00:00:56.520> covered<00:00:56.910> up<00:00:57.000> later

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
objects that might get covered up later

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.470 
objects that might get covered up later
I<00:00:57.559> then<00:00:58.559> begin<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.129> put<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.550> my<00:00:59.730> middle<00:01:00.210> ground

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
I then begin to put in my middle ground

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.410 
I then begin to put in my middle ground
objects<00:01:01.079> detail<00:01:02.010> them<00:01:02.250> out<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.149> then

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
objects detail them out and then

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.359 
objects detail them out and then
eventually<00:01:03.629> put<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> foreground<00:01:04.619> objects

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.660 

and<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.270> way<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.540> don't<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:10.320> messy<00:01:11.189> edges

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
and in this way I don't have messy edges

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.670 
and in this way I don't have messy edges
because<00:01:12.390> what<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.659> naturally<00:01:12.900> might<00:01:13.439> want<00:01:13.619> to

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
because what you naturally might want to

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.440 
because what you naturally might want to
do<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.130> look<00:01:14.520> at<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.729> objects<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
do is look at the objects in the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.330 
do is look at the objects in the
foreground<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.140> assign<00:01:16.830> them<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> lot<00:01:17.310> of

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
foreground and assign them a lot of

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.429 
foreground and assign them a lot of
importance<00:01:18.000> because<00:01:18.780> they're<00:01:19.049> important

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
importance because they're important

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.460 
importance because they're important
well<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:20.009> may<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.729> well<00:01:20.759> paint<00:01:21.119> them<00:01:21.270> first<00:01:21.540> so

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
well I may as well paint them first so

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.679 
well I may as well paint them first so
you'd<00:01:22.619> begin<00:01:22.920> painting<00:01:23.280> your<00:01:23.400> power<00:01:23.610> line<00:01:23.850> got

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
you'd begin painting your power line got

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.140 
you'd begin painting your power line got
it<00:01:24.780> looking<00:01:25.049> nice<00:01:25.229> there<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:26.729> now<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.970> gotta

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
it looking nice there and now you gotta

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.929 
it looking nice there and now you gotta
fill<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.990> rest<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> canvas<00:01:28.790> well<00:01:29.790> now

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
fill in the rest of the canvas well now

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.609 
fill in the rest of the canvas well now
you've<00:01:30.090> got<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.240> bit<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.509> problem<00:01:30.780> because

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you've got a bit of a problem because

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.289 
you've got a bit of a problem because
it's<00:01:31.860> really<00:01:32.130> really<00:01:32.280> hard<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.909> paint

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
it's really really hard to paint

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.920 
it's really really hard to paint
carefully<00:01:34.049> around<00:01:34.439> those<00:01:34.890> little

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
carefully around those little

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.510 
carefully around those little
intersections<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.229> lines<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:38.340> try<00:01:38.460> to

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
intersections of the lines and try to

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.210 
intersections of the lines and try to
make<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.790> blue<00:01:39.060> sky<00:01:39.240> not<00:01:39.689> look<00:01:39.900> messy

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
make that blue sky not look messy

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.109 
make that blue sky not look messy
because<00:01:41.220> you'll<00:01:41.460> remember<00:01:41.579> from<00:01:41.939> other

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
because you'll remember from other

because you'll remember from other
videos<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.869> best<00:01:43.049> way<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.200> get<00:01:43.439> clean<00:01:43.829> brush

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
videos the best way to get clean brush

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.780 
videos the best way to get clean brush
marks<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.329> have<00:01:45.509> large<00:01:46.259> brush<00:01:46.860> strokes<00:01:47.189> to

use<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.090> biggest<00:01:48.540> brush<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.170> well<00:01:49.890> when

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
use the biggest brush you can well when

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.800 
use the biggest brush you can well when
you're<00:01:50.189> painting<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> sky<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:51.509> don't<00:01:51.540> want

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
you're painting the sky you don't want

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.960 
you're painting the sky you don't want
to<00:01:51.869> see<00:01:51.960> any<00:01:52.259> brush<00:01:52.649> strokes<00:01:52.950> at<00:01:53.100> all<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.460> clear

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
to see any brush strokes at all a clear

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.240 
to see any brush strokes at all a clear
blue<00:01:54.240> sky<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.600> almost<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.200> perfect<00:01:55.530> gradation

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
blue sky is almost a perfect gradation

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.620 
blue sky is almost a perfect gradation
so<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.939> means<00:01:57.090> you're<00:01:57.180> gonna<00:01:57.270> want<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.479> use<00:01:57.540> a

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
so that means you're gonna want to use a

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.200 
so that means you're gonna want to use a
really<00:01:58.049> big<00:01:58.290> brush<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.829> as<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.939> see<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.149> this

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
really big brush and as you see in this

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.270 
really big brush and as you see in this
example<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.899> hard<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.530> use<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> really<00:02:02.100> big

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
example is hard to use a really big

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.249 
example is hard to use a really big
brush<00:02:02.579> if<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.570> fit<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:03.960> all<00:02:04.079> those

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
brush if you have to fit it in all those

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.950 
brush if you have to fit it in all those
tiny<00:02:04.619> little<00:02:04.829> spots<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:06.210> if<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.360> paint<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.719> big

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
tiny little spots so if you paint it big

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.199 
tiny little spots so if you paint it big
and<00:02:07.140> smooth<00:02:07.439> first<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.039> then<00:02:08.610> overlay<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
and smooth first and then overlay the

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.969 
and smooth first and then overlay the
foreground<00:02:09.509> on<00:02:09.720> top<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.229> you'll<00:02:10.560> have<00:02:10.679> much

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
foreground on top of it you'll have much

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.780 
foreground on top of it you'll have much
better<00:02:11.009> results

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
better results

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.210 
better results
so<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.150> traditional<00:02:13.390> painter<00:02:14.110> would<00:02:14.590> plan<00:02:14.980> out

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
so a traditional painter would plan out

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.920 
so a traditional painter would plan out
their<00:02:15.459> image<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:15.909> then<00:02:16.510> be<00:02:16.689> able<00:02:16.780> to

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
their image and then be able to

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.539 
their image and then be able to
reverse-engineer<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:18.010> for<00:02:18.159> the<00:02:18.220> actual

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
reverse-engineer it for the actual

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.250 
reverse-engineer it for the actual
painting<00:02:18.939> now<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.480> course<00:02:19.629> because<00:02:19.810> we<00:02:20.230> are

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
painting now of course because we are

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.860 
painting now of course because we are
using<00:02:20.680> Photoshop<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.489> you<00:02:21.849> have<00:02:22.030> layers<00:02:22.480> at

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
using Photoshop and you have layers at

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.869 
using Photoshop and you have layers at
your<00:02:22.989> disposal<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.950> could<00:02:24.129> change<00:02:24.519> this<00:02:24.819> a

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
your disposal you could change this a

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.970 
your disposal you could change this a
little<00:02:25.090> bit<00:02:25.329> for<00:02:26.140> instance<00:02:26.470> if<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.680> wanted<00:02:26.920> to

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
little bit for instance if I wanted to

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.309 
little bit for instance if I wanted to
keep<00:02:27.159> the<00:02:27.760> middle<00:02:28.090> ground<00:02:28.299> objects<00:02:28.930> on<00:02:29.079> their

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
keep the middle ground objects on their

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:30.059 
keep the middle ground objects on their
own<00:02:29.500> layer

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
own layer

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.649

their<00:02:34.000> own<00:02:34.120> layer<00:02:34.360> I'd<00:02:35.019> be<00:02:35.260> able<00:02:35.379> to<00:02:35.440> jump

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
their own layer I'd be able to jump

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.860 
their own layer I'd be able to jump
around<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:36.220> bit<00:02:36.400> but<00:02:37.299> if<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.480> just<00:02:37.629> want<00:02:37.840> to

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
around a bit but if you just want to

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.050 
around a bit but if you just want to
make<00:02:38.019> a<00:02:38.049> quick<00:02:38.349> painting<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.370> maybe<00:02:39.730> doesn't

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
make a quick painting that maybe doesn't

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.030 
make a quick painting that maybe doesn't
even<00:02:40.150> have<00:02:40.359> layers<00:02:40.690> at<00:02:40.900> all<00:02:41.049> and<00:02:41.709> you<00:02:41.829> want<00:02:41.980> to

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
even have layers at all and you want to

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.819 
even have layers at all and you want to
be<00:02:42.099> as<00:02:42.189> clean<00:02:42.549> as<00:02:42.760> possible<00:02:43.530> paint<00:02:44.530> from<00:02:44.769> the

be as clean as possible paint from the
background<00:02:45.489> towards<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.629> foreground<00:02:47.049> it<00:02:47.980> is

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
background towards the foreground it is

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.069 
background towards the foreground it is
a<00:02:48.159> surefire<00:02:48.519> way<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.239> get<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.599> as<00:02:49.690> clean<00:02:50.049> as

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
a surefire way to get it as clean as

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.349 
a surefire way to get it as clean as
possible<00:02:50.799> but<00:02:51.400> it<00:02:51.519> is<00:02:51.549> gonna<00:02:51.790> require<00:02:52.120> a

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
possible but it is gonna require a

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.360 
possible but it is gonna require a
little<00:02:52.690> bit<00:02:52.780> of<00:02:52.840> planning<00:02:53.099> so<00:02:54.099> make<00:02:54.340> a

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
little bit of planning so make a

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.119 
little bit of planning so make a
thumbnail<00:02:54.720> plan<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:55.900> out<00:02:56.019> and<00:02:56.290> then<00:02:56.859> paint

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
thumbnail plan it out and then paint

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:57.990 
thumbnail plan it out and then paint
from<00:02:57.250> back<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.609> forward

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
from back to forward

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.550 
from back to forward
good<00:02:58.569> luck<00:02:58.690> painting<00:02:59.049> and<00:02:59.170> thanks<00:02:59.409> for<00:02:59.500> coming
