that<00:06:28.150> says<00:06:28.390> offline<00:06:28.930> sync<00:06:29.260> so<00:06:29.470> this<00:06:29.620> is

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
that says offline sync so this is

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.469 
that says offline sync so this is

automatically now for offline sync and
this<00:06:31.570> is<00:06:31.720> so<00:06:31.870> important<00:06:32.320> because<00:06:32.440> if<00:06:32.650> you

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770
