long<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.930> build<00:01:16.229> which<00:01:16.619> i<00:01:16.860> figured<00:01:17.490> out<00:01:17.580> what<00:01:17.729> i

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
long to build which i figured out what i

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.539 
long to build which i figured out what i
was<00:01:17.909> doing<00:01:18.409> and<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:20.009> everything<00:01:20.430> works

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
was doing and not everything works

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.340 
was doing and not everything works
currently<00:01:21.090> obviously<00:01:23.689> obviously<00:01:24.689> i'm<00:01:25.229> an

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
currently obviously obviously i'm an

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.649 
currently obviously obviously i'm an
airplane<00:01:25.710> mode<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.790> reason<00:01:27.090> being<00:01:27.270> is

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
airplane mode and the reason being is

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.249 
airplane mode and the reason being is
because<00:01:28.579> it<00:01:29.579> currently<00:01:30.119> does<00:01:30.390> not<00:01:30.570> support

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
because it currently does not support

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.020 
because it currently does not support
the<00:01:32.780> wireless<00:01:33.780> chip<00:01:34.369> at<00:01:35.369> least<00:01:35.549> that's<00:01:35.820> what<00:01:36.000> i

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
the wireless chip at least that's what i

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.020 
the wireless chip at least that's what i
gathered<00:01:36.450> i<00:01:36.740> should<00:01:37.740> say<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.250> cell<00:01:38.850> phone

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030
