 to talk a little bit with them first 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.710
 wants everyone to come forward and what 

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:11.120
 does what is the work in which all 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.549
 they use predicted valence of this day

 alexander aguirre battery the girls with 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.179
 have a little bit of how long ago 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.519
 the project and what musical influences 

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:31.410
 It has good is good, more or less 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:34.310
 about seven years ago or eight 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.530
 in a long learning process 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.300
 explore various genres experimenting 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.190
 with several musical genres and contributing 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.750
 the ideas that everyone had was 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.210
 growing the band we enter the rest 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.820
 a year ago we have a vocalist from 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.220
 botero in influences of the band no 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.379
 so much we have many things bands 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.150
 as black label society rise against 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.699
 the machine but that this combined 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.280
 with the personal that we all hear 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.449
 listen from 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.280
 Cuban trova does not wear metal 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.799
 here is all electronics can be 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.690
 say and I see most of all all that is 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:13.100
 take and work in this good let's talk 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:15.680
 a little bit of management who takes care of 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.369
 get the all that is to spread 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.290
 the music tools uses good well in 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.960
 general the one who takes care of this is me 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.630
 and because I'm like that because facebook 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.240
 is more than everything on facebook because I want 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.780
 you get in touch with a lot of people I do the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.300
 contacts as for radio stations and projects 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.649
 of events and therefore many people who 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.030
 interested in the band and then 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.220
 we started to show our album 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.380
 bust and many people liked it and 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.330
 more than everything because our video you do not know 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.520
 you do not understand that the video is like 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.200
 now what is it like that is moving 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.220
 the audiovisual then why we launch 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.350
 the video and what is moving 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.030
 many of those and let's talk a little bit like 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.830
 from the local scene here in Manizales 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.960
 you believe that there is enough support 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.360
 by entities 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.590
 governmental for 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.600
 for these independent bands 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.190
 emergent that are emerging here in 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.650
 first place say that the support if 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.420
 there is or is not the support they would like 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.910
 the bands true but if there is a 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.530
 support let's say in opening the spaces in 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.240
 the opportunities for bands without 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.250
 But let's say that with the palencia 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.010
 volpe mobile of these two opportunities 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.750
 the money then the bands of some 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.760
 way does self-manage 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.550
 a lot of what they do have to 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.870
 take money out of your pocket sometimes 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.459
 including money that does not exist but 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.959
 then bands always with their endurance and 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.120
 with their desire to get ahead they do it 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.800
 and I think the opportunities are 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.230
 simply that the bands then yes 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.450
 they have to know how to take advantage of them and 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.610
 redundant to take advantage of any 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.989
 opportunity that is presented what is the 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.209
 position of this area in front of the 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.989
 piracy let's say we do not support the 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.330
 piracy but yes but let's say it was 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.100
 how to beat that we 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.250
 We give our music because 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.440
 But that sell and knowing that 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.120
 end they will hack it or yes or for 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.400
 make an emerging band people do not go 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.680
 to buy then then the same is more than 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.450
 we gave ourselves away and said good we gave away 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.069
 we were talking all many 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.739
 they had agreed from the band another 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.830
 yes and the idea was to give the for what 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.510
 what for but not good that sounds so ugly 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.430
 how to give it away but how to give it to 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.440
 people to people learn 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.760
 our issues that it becomes like a 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.349
 virus that everyone starts to water 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.300
 the music so that they can pay 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.340
 a ticket a concert so that 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.230
 understand that the concept is fine 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.660
 would be at this moment is to have a show 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.480
 live and that sounds live much better 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.220
 to someone if then it is to give the 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.599
 people that so that people do not stay 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.730
 there are only many bands for example 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.760
 personally helps to see bands that 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.400
 they sound better back then I see 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.940
 bands that sound very good but they look 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.410
 very ugly because they look very ugly 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.870
 you serve like on stage it looks like very very 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.180
 badly badly organized and all that is 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.290
 let's say that disappoints me a little 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.610
 then the invitation of this trip is 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.650
 what people listen to in songs 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.930
 download all learn and it's worth 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.299
 if there is a concert is free for you 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.000
 attend with greater reason and see the 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.890
 band that sounds different and has a 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.290
 staging that people to impact 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.590
 what I have always told you and we have 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.720
 said is 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.640
 one to listen to a band has a cd 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.889
 but one goes to a concert is to see the 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.350
 band and what it generates as I remember and 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.120
 all that is what you see then that's the 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.620
 concept as of us to listen 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.000
 the music as they are if they are 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.760
 recordings that enjoy more 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.690
 appear live or rehearse and 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.610
 shut up to produce good I think 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.560
 what is a is a joint work and 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.520
 true that it has a lot of both 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.770
 shutting yourself up to work is very good already 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.810
 produce because you give from there you 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.880
 it improves a lot band level so much 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.260
 musically you can leave him a lot 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.780
 time to the lyrics because that day 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.760
 let's say that in that it comes out to know that they are 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:54.180
 the makers of making the letters of 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.590
 the songs is very very close with that 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.600
 technique are very good lyrics we would have 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.350
 that to close itself to rehearse and compose good 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.410
 lyrics is very good and play send then 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.990
 good is the result of what is achieved 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.420
 from so much trial of so much passion of 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.790
 so much practice 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:14.420
 we definitely prefer to go live 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:17.570
 it is ours that reach us and 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.730
 what makes us dream and what are we going to 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.250
 do great and that this will come out 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.780
 forward then live we become 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.780
 crazy and we love 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.380
