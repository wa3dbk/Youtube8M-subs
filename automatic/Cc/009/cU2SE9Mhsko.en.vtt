two of our tour a pepper plantation here

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.110 
two of our tour a pepper plantation here
are<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.870> trees<00:03:02.580> where<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.730> little<00:03:03.910> pepper

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
are the trees where the little pepper

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.420 
are the trees where the little pepper
kernels<00:03:04.600> grow<00:03:04.960> and<00:03:05.740> it<00:03:05.890> doesn't<00:03:06.160> actually

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
kernels grow and it doesn't actually

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.160 
kernels grow and it doesn't actually
smell<00:03:06.670> like<00:03:06.790> pepper<00:03:07.060> instead<00:03:07.480> it<00:03:07.750> smells<00:03:07.990> like

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
smell like pepper instead it smells like

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.680 
smell like pepper instead it smells like
fish<00:03:08.500> sauce<00:03:08.800> and<00:03:09.250> that's<00:03:09.820> because<00:03:10.240> that<00:03:10.480> once

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
fish sauce and that's because that once

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.650 
fish sauce and that's because that once
the<00:03:10.870> fish<00:03:11.550> has<00:03:12.550> been<00:03:12.700> discarded<00:03:13.090> from<00:03:13.540> the

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
the fish has been discarded from the

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.940 
the fish has been discarded from the
fish<00:03:13.960> sauce<00:03:14.280> processing<00:03:16.410> process<00:03:17.410> I<00:03:17.709> guess

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
fish sauce processing process I guess

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.610 
fish sauce processing process I guess
then<00:03:18.820> it's<00:03:19.180> used<00:03:19.450> as<00:03:19.600> fertilizer<00:03:20.050> for<00:03:20.380> these

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
then it's used as fertilizer for these

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.860 
then it's used as fertilizer for these
pepper<00:03:21.130> trees<00:03:21.459> and<00:03:21.820> so<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.810> circle<00:03:23.170> continues

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
pepper trees and so the circle continues

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.750 
pepper trees and so the circle continues
this<00:03:25.870> is<00:03:26.080> what<00:03:26.260> pepper<00:03:26.530> looks<00:03:26.890> like<00:03:27.130> before<00:03:27.430> it

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
this is what pepper looks like before it

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.760 
this is what pepper looks like before it
