00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.309
 in my youth I do not recommend

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.620

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.440
 dangerous and especially its high prices 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.210

 next test brought directly into 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.270
 the homes people have the impression that 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.770
