00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.390
 tee 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.390
 b 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.670
 pr 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.640
 The 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.050
 What 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.010
 eh 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.010
 debian 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.450
 tee 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.590
 We are 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.580
 Had 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.610
 Bach 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.610
 Oh 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.920
 Oh 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.600
 The 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.560
 Hmm 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.799
 Yup 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.909
 I wondered how good I was imagining a sound that was relatively dark with acrylic 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.350
 Though 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:35.800
 That really 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.220
 I thought it would be interesting if there were many things, especially at the low pitch I'm on that kid's acrylic 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.880
 Ne 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.330
 I think this little person is heavy Weight and so on 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.790
 Balance of was I thought that cool a Sugokuro pitch 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:51.560
 But this in-mic live take want to feel the 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:56.120
 I say Imp retardation Innovation whether it was was I Teku Hahn Dah Let to burn in sound 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:59.299
 The tuning was also very easy to adjust that and that 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:04.189
 I thought also it makes easy to sound to say so 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:06.780
 This in softening the image as that to be more and more go with Middohai 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:09.390
 Kana type to go according to the image of the head 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:14.970
 Mashitee For example there is a feeling that it is going 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:17.700
 In Well increased to be doing with that tension high and a big sound PC milk replacer 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.360
 It feels good than come back and Scone 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.850
 Yeah 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:31.720
 It's acrylic, so it's cool, but it's all about it. 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:33.670
 It was a feeling that I could not do it, and the price was about twice to see that cheap , twice to see with the child 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.080
 I think it's a bit scary because this price 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.350
 Because it was a feeling that it would be great if you try to catch a little rope and see 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.540
 a little bit 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:51.060
 Because this is a cylinder service feel great good of that child until the switch 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.560
 You may have one of these variations of your own snare. 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:59.430
 I thought it was not 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:01.109
 That's why I introduced the crash acrylic s name drum 14 inches deep 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.670
 Was a 6-inch model 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.670
 It was a Shirai teacher store of Sirai Music
