 hello friends today 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.809
 I want to talk about whether it is easy and in general 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.430
 Is it possible to upgrade windows 8 to 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.370
 windows 8.1 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.760
 a friend of mine sent me a link to 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:22.100
 very interesting article 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.710
 it concerns billa gates and so i 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.380
 read the headline joking bill gates 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.170
 installed windows installed windows 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.149
 all work day bill gates spent 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.129
 whole working day to install on 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.160
 your computer update windows 81 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.020
 writes the magazine new yorker humorous 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.059
 columns he received several times 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.760
 error message saying that 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.999
 him so far ran into the windfall 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.730
 problem and needs a reboot 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:52.879
 According to informed sources as 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.940
 lunchtime gates called himself new 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.289
 Microsoft CEO Satya 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.510
 allotted 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.670
 they locked the office and tried 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.280
 put the update together witness 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.010
 going to stay 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.200

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.930
 actually beat a pretty cool guy 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.710
 so some words come from 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.979
 from behind the door 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.799
 caused a strong bewilderment 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.450
 present he noted so here 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:24.350

 I have already installed the update installation 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:32.360
 tried several times to deliver more accurately 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:34.460
 updates mean to me already one 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.130

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.659
 the operation was interrupted 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.630
 and the computer then wrote that he 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:51.530
 restored to windows 8 so it was 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.859

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.439

00:01:54.859 --> 00:02:00.409

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.560
