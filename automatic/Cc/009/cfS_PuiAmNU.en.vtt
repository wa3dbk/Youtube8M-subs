00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.060 
of tsunamis nanoscale o.o lucuma is the
hostile<00:01:52.840> takeover<00:01:53.140> this<00:01:53.230> know<00:01:53.380> that<00:01:53.530> ah<00:01:53.680> so<00:01:53.950> we

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
hostile takeover this know that ah so we

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:08.109 
hostile takeover this know that ah so we
did<00:01:54.220> any<00:01:54.370> time

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.660 

ok<00:02:09.080> so<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.289> Japanese<00:02:09.739> have<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.039> working<00:02:10.220> so

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
ok so the Japanese have it working so

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.390 
ok so the Japanese have it working so
this<00:02:10.940> is<00:02:10.970> this<00:02:11.299> is<00:02:11.420> good<00:02:11.599> but<00:02:12.440> doesn't<00:02:13.340> this

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
this is this is good but doesn't this

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.190 
this is this is good but doesn't this
show<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.700> that<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.299> technology<00:02:14.629> is<00:02:14.989> there

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
show you that this technology is there

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.420 
show you that this technology is there
why<00:02:15.440> can't<00:02:15.680> we<00:02:15.769> use<00:02:15.799> it<00:02:16.040> because<00:02:16.159> they're

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
why can't we use it because they're

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.250 
why can't we use it because they're
telling<00:02:16.670> us<00:02:16.730> not<00:02:16.909> to<00:02:16.970> we<00:02:17.780> have<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.019> do

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
telling us not to we have to do

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.080 
telling us not to we have to do
something<00:02:18.500> about<00:02:18.769> this<00:02:19.040> people<00:02:19.430> check<00:02:19.970> out

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
something about this people check out
