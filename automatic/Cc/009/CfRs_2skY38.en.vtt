00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.400
 hello dear garden friends nice that 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.070
 every now and again gärtner looks inside 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.870
 pötschke green tip on today 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.780
 I am particularly happy about this 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.850
 even if it gets a little wet because 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.710
 Today I want to show you how to get in 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.000
 a few simple steps one 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.000
 small mini pond invests 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.270
 Water fascinates big and small 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.180
 for many it even has a calming effect 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.980
 effect but what if you are in the garden 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.760
 has no place for a normal 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.400
 simply pond the solution is one 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.590
 small mini pond with lots of water 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.500
 can reproduce without problems in 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.989
 plant cramped containers that's how you need them 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.850
 not even in smaller proportions 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.600
 on a beautiful flower water garden too 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.450
 renounce 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.020
 and the best part is he even watches 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.020
 balcony and terrace 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.330
 I have an old one today 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.200
 zinc tub decided 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.060
 but theoretically every one could 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.040
 other vessels take as long as it only 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.869
 is waterproof 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.170
 if not, you could just as well 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:25.990
 lining with pond film is important 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.330
 just that you have your mini pond right on 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.280
 final location planted namely 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.100
 Once filled, it can be filled 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.540
 only very difficult to move again 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.729
 initially only a few larger stones 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.409
 in the tub at different 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.830
 plants for the aquatic plants 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.830
 create 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.659
 I then cover the rest of the floor with 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.030
 then new with pebbles 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.530
 You should best buy bought thies 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.280
 Do not wash directly around the water 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.649
 pollute 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.360
 that's easy, for example 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.670
 take care of a bucket in the next step 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.709
 I plant myself around the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.709
 these are now in such special 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.940
 plants baskets of plastic set 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.610
 because the dam is an unwanted 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.329
 spread around the baskets too 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.489
 complain 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:21.190
 I also feel it first with one 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.930
 thin layer of gravel wasserpflanzen 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.820
 should always be in low-nutrient pond 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.390
 Earth can be set so that no 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.310
 algae form these baskets here very much 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.519
 Fine-meshed, I can directly 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.079
 plant lattice baskets with coarse ones 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.299
 you should mesh with fleece 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.340
 lay out so that the earth is not rinsed out 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.019
 becomes 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.190
 for the same reason, I think that 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.930
 now join us again 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.700
 pebbles off when inserting the 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.140
 you just have to plant now 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.030
 despise the right plant and then 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.519
 if the tenant already with water 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.650
 be filled 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.070
 ideal would be cold water for example 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.760
 Rainwater from a rain barrel 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.700
 otherwise, but also does the 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.920
 garden hose now it does not take longer 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.030
 long and your minite is developing 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.810
 to a splendid flowering 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.819
 waterscape 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.280
 optimal is a location in the 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.170
 lunchtime little shadow has then 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.270
 the water has not so much on 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.550
 and it prevents too many 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.380
 form algae 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.270
 In addition, you should pay attention that the 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.950
 water when it evaporates in the summer 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.950
 is refilled regularly 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.390
 I hope this topic has you as well 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.640
 a lot of fun like me started from 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.190
 the choice of the planters to the 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.260
 Selection of plants is infinite 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.410
 possibilities its own taste 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.600
 in this mini pond to realize 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.000
 just tried it out of you have 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.310
 It's just a lot of fun 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:20.180
 and wish you much success 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:20.180
