00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:07.539
 What are the advantages and disadvantages of choosing a ground floor or a duplex? 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:12.070
 Hi, I'm Martin Bonari 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.259
 and today I wanted to share 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.799
 some of the experiences we have had 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.640
 in so many years of work 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.689
 and to share with so many people and so many comments about why 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.769
 chose a person downstairs and why 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.460
 others choose the upper floor. 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.239
 In general, 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.860
 which the person who chooses the ground floor 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.659
 think a little more about what you have 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:38.020
 what will come and is very clear 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.150
 that in the future does not want to climb stairs. 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.160
 For example, the big difference between the ground floor and the top floor are 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.800
 the stairs 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.090
 It is the biggest decision factor 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:51.050
 at the time 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.180
 to choose one of the two options. 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.670
 Another decision factor is 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.809
 the size of the land. If you have 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.520
 a very large land 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.440
 It will not cost you much to decide much about ground floor. 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.180
 But sometimes, 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.560
 we have a very small land 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.590
 5 meters wide 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.590
 or six meters wide 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.040
 Y 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.630
 and we have a plan 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.810
 very demanding, a very demanding needs plan, where we want the best 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.070
 three bedrooms and garage and others and in six meters 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.229
 everything does not come ... 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.490
 to ventilate correctly. Then you have to decide forcefully 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.040
 or forcefully, 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.260
 a high floor. 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.010
 This, basically, are the decision factors: 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.900
 the size of the land and 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.940
 the theme of the stairs. To choose a high floor, you have to be fine 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.630
 physically 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.930
 and not think so much about the future. But people already a little 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.170
 bigger ones already 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.190
 they think more about the future 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.670
 and decide 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.400
 Do not use stairs. 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.729
 All right. The advantages of the ground floor 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.780
 It's the economy. 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.900
 Building a ground floor is, 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.880
 approximately, 10% between 9 and 10% more than economic than a plant 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.309
 than a house plant. 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:10.649
 The other advantage 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:11.719
 is the 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:15.039
 possibility of building in stages. Is much more 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:18.939
 the easy to build and expand when you have 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.159
 that expand only one bedroom that 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:22.959
 when you have to do 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.219
 a high floor, climb, you will have to climb 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:29.229
 the whole house until roofing to be able 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:31.679
 build comfortably in stages. 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:35.819
 The effort to build in stages is much greater at the beginning because you are going to 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.239
 have to close the whole house 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.709
 because the concrete structure that is left in the middle is not going to serve you as 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:42.539
 the ceiling 

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:45.069
 and, if you are going to need to solve 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.419
 all the cover so that the insulation is properly sealed. 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.620
 However, the upper floor, 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.729
 It has a very big advantage over the ground floor. 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:03:01.409
 The spatial form that one can achieve in a two-story house does not 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:02.279
 you can achieve 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:03.949
 with a one-story house. 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:05.179
 we can achieve 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:11.389
 balconies and relationship from the top to the bottom, 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:15.019
 from the top floor to the ground floor to achieve a spatiality and 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.389
 a spatial continuity 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.149
 that you do not have it in a plant 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:20.099
 in a house on the ground floor. 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.189
 And also, 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:25.239
 the last advantage is the design 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.859
 of the facade. On the facade you can design ... 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.329
 you have many design possibilities when you have more height 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.689
 that on a ground floor. 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.479
 It's much better, for us 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.189
 the architects, when we have 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:42.599
 two plants to be able to design. We can achieve better spatiality and also 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.289
 we like more 

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:47.500
 percent the upper floor although to live I recognize 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.249
 the ground floor is better. 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:51.379
 Then you have to choose 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.089
 what is the best option for you and your family, OK? 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:57.350
 Your opinion matters to us! I shared 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.619
 with us your opinion and with everyone else to see 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:02.349
 if among all we can define 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.359
 a position to choose. 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.239
 See you at the next opportunity.
