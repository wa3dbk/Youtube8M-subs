00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
to last now all we're gonna do is take

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.950 
to last now all we're gonna do is take
this<00:02:14.050> hair<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.820> pin<00:02:15.820> it<00:02:15.970> up<00:02:16.150> just<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:16.630> a<00:02:16.750> nice

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
this hair and pin it up just in a nice

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.810 
this hair and pin it up just in a nice
messy<00:02:17.860> bun<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.860> don't<00:02:21.040> think<00:02:21.160> about<00:02:21.280> this<00:02:21.580> part

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
messy bun so don't think about this part

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.390 
messy bun so don't think about this part
too<00:02:21.970> much<00:02:22.180> it's<00:02:22.990> easier<00:02:23.860> if<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.190> hair<00:02:24.370> is

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
too much it's easier if the hair is

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.750 
too much it's easier if the hair is
actually<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.910> little<00:02:25.120> bit<00:02:25.330> curled<00:02:26.130> then<00:02:27.130> rather

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
actually a little bit curled then rather

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.280 
actually a little bit curled then rather
than<00:02:28.000> being<00:02:28.150> poker<00:02:28.600> straight<00:02:28.870> it's<00:02:29.140> just

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
than being poker straight it's just

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.380 
than being poker straight it's just
easier<00:02:29.620> to<00:02:29.680> work<00:02:29.920> with<00:02:29.980> gives<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:30.910> a<00:02:31.000> softer

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
easier to work with gives it a softer

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.070 
easier to work with gives it a softer
look<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:33.880> just<00:02:34.180> take<00:02:34.390> some<00:02:34.840> pieces<00:02:37.080> depending

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
look so just take some pieces depending

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.900 
look so just take some pieces depending
on<00:02:38.380> how<00:02:38.530> long<00:02:38.740> your<00:02:38.950> hair<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.730> might<00:02:39.880> have

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
on how long your hair is you might have

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.850 
on how long your hair is you might have
to<00:02:40.530> wind<00:02:41.530> some<00:02:41.890> up<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.460> pin<00:02:42.700> them<00:02:43.650> but<00:02:44.650> this<00:02:44.800> is

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
to wind some up and pin them but this is

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.910 
to wind some up and pin them but this is
the<00:02:45.070> part<00:02:45.280> thing<00:02:46.020> you<00:02:47.020> don't<00:02:47.350> really<00:02:47.620> have<00:02:47.770> to

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
the part thing you don't really have to

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.110 
the part thing you don't really have to
think<00:02:47.950> about<00:02:48.130> that<00:02:48.490> much<00:02:48.640> because<00:02:48.850> we're

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
think about that much because we're

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.770 
think about that much because we're
looking<00:02:49.270> for<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.690> kind<00:02:50.080> of<00:02:50.170> a<00:02:50.260> messy<00:02:50.740> softer

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
