00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
and everything I actually kind of

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.320 
and everything I actually kind of
thought<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.859> was<00:00:29.039> fake<00:00:29.250> because<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.939> does<00:00:30.060> seem

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
thought it was fake because it does seem

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.550 
thought it was fake because it does seem
like<00:00:30.480> something<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.750> could<00:00:30.900> be<00:00:31.019> photoshop

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
like something that could be photoshop

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.840 
like something that could be photoshop
and<00:00:31.769> there<00:00:31.949> wasn't<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.309> whole<00:00:32.340> lot<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.700> evidence

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
and there wasn't a whole lot of evidence

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.459 
and there wasn't a whole lot of evidence
showing<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.660> was<00:00:33.809> like<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> hundred

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
showing that it was like a hundred

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.750 
showing that it was like a hundred
percent<00:00:34.620> real<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.219> was<00:00:35.370> just<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.610> lot<00:00:35.730> of

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
percent real it was just a lot of

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.810

actually believe and also I'm not really

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.190 
actually believe and also I'm not really
sure<00:01:59.549> if<00:01:59.790> they<00:02:00.060> would<00:02:00.180> announce<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.600> city<00:02:00.840> 3<00:02:01.170> I

are<00:02:03.840> i<00:02:03.899> don't<00:02:04.259> think<00:02:04.560> they<00:02:04.710> will<00:02:04.799> actually

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979
