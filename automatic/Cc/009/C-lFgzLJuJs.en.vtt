00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.319
 there are video games that our 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.880
 days is trying to get you to participate a 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.980
 particular trip rather than to bring 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.780
 a stone in the videogame building in 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.789
 whole and jazz punk is part of this 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.560
 category if he tried to be funny 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.910
 when I say he tried to be funny 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.170
 it is of course that I consider 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.550
 that it did not really happen because 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.990
 we need more to me 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.370
 laugh that references to 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.600
 reference references that maybe I 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.070
 can understand because I have some 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.640
 culture and so that I understand the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.350
 references 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.550
 however it's one of those games that has 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.290
 decided not to have news 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.480
 gameplay ideas if it was the idea of 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.100
 maybe try to have fun and that's 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.710
 fun to see they're trying to 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.150
 create a videogame comedy in this 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.500
 episode 6 of a show called 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.910
 I remind you the real critic 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.030
 we will see if there is something 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.310
 a bit of a game under this varnish of 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.760
 reference which are references to 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.760
 references 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.310
 you know in time when people 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.929
 thought funny and video games he had 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.579
 the ability to play video games 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:31.140
 Funny not seen this collections of 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.490
 foolish gags that make references to 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.469
 the con on subjects no longer nobody 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.060
 has nothing to do with it is jazz funk and 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.890
 fun games are things 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.110
 like maniac mansion day of the tentacle 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.130
 the grimm fandago brief those games that 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.750
 was created by people 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.280
 certainly smarter than those 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.750
 who created this game if that in more 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.909
 had the particularity to know 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.950
 write because knowing how to write is a 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.810
 talent that can not be learned or is the 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.920
 either we do not have it here we work on it 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.599
 may perhaps acquire it but 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.610
 certainly if we do not know how to write this 

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:58.500
 is not doing an adventurous game to 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.840
 the first person in unity that one 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.929
 will have incredible abilities to do 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.970
 a role play this is a parody of a 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.770
 video game it's supposed to be funny c 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.119
 protects from the rain in version I 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.679
 never played pool value of my life 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.000
 but you know what matters is the 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.730
 reference which is a reference and a 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.110
 reference so it's supposed to be funny 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.849
 what can I tell you about this 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.260
 game i can definitely tell you that 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.360
 it's a universe in which you are 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.280
 proposes to discover visual gags 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.470
 who are funny or not at places 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.269
 various that are distributed in different 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.190
 levels and the succession of this level 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.769
 participate in the idea of ​​making you pay 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.410
 15 euros an hour and a half of play 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.450
 relatively mediocre which certainly 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.920
 absolutely no team of interest by the 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.730
 gameplay capabilities that are you 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.079
 thus proposed 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.790
 so what are we proposing 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.560
 proposes a style of the word that is self 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.760
 saying inspired David's movies at 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.440
 heart you know david's movies 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.239
 zucker it was I know not less 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.010
 liquids win he was a pilot of 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.090
 the plane is crap at the base but 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.459
 It's not that serious 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.630
 people might hope maybe in 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.310
 inspiring you something 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.660
 especially stupid and low of 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.090
 ceiling was doing something 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.440
 and here the real problem of this game this 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.180
 is not necessarily that it's a 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.620
 bad game is that there is no game 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.120
 these rooms real problem 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.160
 so when you have a game that is 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.079
 entirely based on references 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.519
 not funny has stuff that they were 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.349
 real games that were they games 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.910
 successful we can ask a single 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.799
 question and this question we can get 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.959
 ask what's the point of paying jazz punk 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.669
 and the answer to this one may have been 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.799
 loved you stupid humor in this setting 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:25.530
 there you could discover with this game 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:27.450
 if one of these so-called fake 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.330
 today's independent classic that 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.860
 go to 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.080
 and in over six months because they are only 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.070
 really only a form of anecdotes in 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.200
 videogame history 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.970
 there is no sugar there is no 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.220
 background there is no real humor 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.260
 of stake if not this Pavlovian humor 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.420
 at the family games is used from a 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.000
 particularly incompetent way 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.800
 pretty amazing way this game does 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.960
 to pass family gaye for probably 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.340
 one of the biggest incredible form 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.350
 of Shakespearian comedy had these 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.800
 last time because see you if that you 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.970
 make laugh 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.920
 you are not very smart and 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.990
 it's not very serious and you go without 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.730
 doubt defending this game until the phase 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.500
 that death ensues all and all that 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.270
 it just does not have any form of 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.130
 interesting it has no shape 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.720
 of interest I could do you 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.010
 notice that it's expensive by the hour 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.060
 could point this out i 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.740
 could have that mark I'm going 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.680
 just tell you this play jazz 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.390
 punk is losing an hour or two 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.459
 hours maybe even three if you are 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.100
 especially stone that you do not 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.590
 never see again in your life who have 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.780
 so been totally ruined at things 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.630
 particularly futile that did not 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.970
 ultimately not really the ability to 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.350
 makes anyone laugh I have in 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.140
 the idea that maybe this can do 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.850
 to fuck another person but if that 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.590
 go six aces and humor for you brief 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.060
 you do not really have any sense of 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.770
 humor I mean it's a problem 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.150
 that arises this is a problem that I 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.530
 notice with a lot of my 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.600
 fellow citizens today what do they think 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.220
 that they understand humor would be 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.060
 unable to write to a gag if he ever 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.190
 had to save their lives 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.500
 I have if you just need to 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.060
 references of the failed stuff as I know 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.350
 not me the virgin boy pascal lalle the 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.419
 virtual boy it's funny the virtual boy 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.010
 and here you go to buy 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.390
 I do not say that I have you 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.160
 not warned because I have website you 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.110
 prevent that decidedly this game does not 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.970
 was not one who was not funny enough 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.500
 to really be considered 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.790
 something that could be sold on 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.919
 his humor I simply tell you this 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.060
 when the people who made this game and 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.800
 called louis sam mendes and 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.570
 gespral microphone games when they have 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.550
 decided to do this game they have very 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.740
 clearly tried to make a game the 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.090
 easier to do for 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.530
 to hide the fact that they were void in 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.030
 gameplay that was zero in game design 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.229
 it was bad in graphics that became tenuous 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.620
 their music is that they were naked their 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:28.330
 dialogue 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.550
 now is it serious no and 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.560
 I leave a good desire surely 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.570
 that of actually laughing unfortunately he 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.250
 is a little too stupid to get there then 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.720
 it's not a particular remark to 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.870
 do it's just the state of the 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.670
 question is a little 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.740
 game that is made for that time of 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.020
 easy hipster you know what counts 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.280
 it's not the quality you see it's the 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.020
 does it make it postmodern a little 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.220
 wacky a little offbeat and blah and 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.560
 blablabla you're one of those people 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.120
 absolutely hateful you 'll love this 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.920
 game if you give him 10 out of 10 on 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.480
 all services that will want 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.480
 store one of your notes
