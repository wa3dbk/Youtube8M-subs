 george thomaz was a very knowledgeable english preacher 

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:13.109
 he seems one day in his preaching carrying greater 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:14.889
 according to the public 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:15.990

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.619
 started talking I was walking down the street yesterday 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.220
 and I saw the boy carrying this cage 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.789
 three small ones inside 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.149
 with the cold 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:27.880
 and scared 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.249
 And I asked, boy. 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:35.250
 What are you going to do with these three passengers so he answered me 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.980
 is to take your legs off the adverse weather I'm going to have fun with them 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.360

 How much do you want for space in the agenda? 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.960
 the boy answered 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.550

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.010
 will not want us 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.630
 they are of no use then the preacher bought them for 10 bucks 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.450
 exhorted in a tree 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.570
 a goal 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.740
 jesus 18 years were talking 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.020
 jesus asked satan 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.330
 what he was doing people here on earth he replied I'm me 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.010

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.430

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.960
 jesus asked 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.460
 and then 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.550
 What are you going to do with them I will kill them and end them then Jesus 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.600
 How much do you want for them ironically? 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.490
 satan replied you will not want these people they are treacherous 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.829
 stylish 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.840
 are foreseen and the 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.690
 I will not really love you 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.619
 he spit at your post 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.779
 come back said need me I will take into consideration 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:13.709
 what did you do 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.459
 so jesus 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.129
 How much do you want for them? 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.259
 I want all your tears 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:23.769
 and jesus paid 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.269
 the price of our freedom how can we forget jesus 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:33.479
 believing everything that teaches us but we always question the things that 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:34.809
 come from god 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:40.229
 everyone wants one day was with him but do not want to meet him and loved 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:41.979
 many say 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:45.109
 I believe in god 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.099
 They do not do anything for him. 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.339
 people 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:50.459
 Send jokes by email 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.479
 in a situation for others at a speed of light 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.769
 when the message about God people think twice before sharing 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.320
 with the other 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.109
 said that every moment 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:07.329
 with a team you cheer with a car you like the most 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:13.919
 What is your favorite band? Your favorite music? Max, think twice before. 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.289
 to say 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:16.819
 I am of Christ 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.569
 and I love God 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.779
 try to be invisible will be that when you have just heard this message you 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:28.349
 creates the courage to tell a friend is not sure what people will think 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.199
 about you if you send talk about jesus christ is not a subject that the 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.409
 people want to hear only want to act games 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.639
 when they are in big trouble 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.639
 so think we have no other way 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:44.509
 unless 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:46.899
 God's way 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:49.400
 if you are a person who believes in God 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.970
 and love then send your message to as many people as you can 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.039
 I can because if it was a song 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:01.339
 I would make sure that you at the same time 

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:05.199
 I would be sharing with your friends that God bless you 

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:08.899
 abundantly immediately hiss 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.769
 It's fair
