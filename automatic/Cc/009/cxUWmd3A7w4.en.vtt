the Zerg right now surfaces are is

Roach bushes simply because the mule is

Roach bushes simply because the mule is
are<00:00:42.640> a<00:00:42.670> lot<00:00:43.030> less<00:00:43.240> viable<00:00:43.600> because<00:00:44.260> they<00:00:44.650> get

are a lot less viable because they get

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.220 
are a lot less viable because they get
three<00:00:45.130> shot<00:00:45.400> by<00:00:45.610> a<00:00:45.640> sport<00:00:46.060> roller<00:00:46.329> now<00:00:46.930> once

three shot by a sport roller now once

three shot by a sport roller now once
you<00:00:47.350> are<00:00:47.500> up<00:00:47.680> first<00:00:47.920> someone<00:00:48.400> who's<00:00:48.579> also

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
you are up first someone who's also

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.580 
you are up first someone who's also
going<00:00:48.910> roaches<00:00:49.480> and<00:00:49.660> you<00:00:49.810> are<00:00:49.960> going<00:00:50.140> roaches

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
going roaches and you are going roaches

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.710 
going roaches and you are going roaches
as<00:00:50.710> well<00:00:50.950> it<00:00:51.220> is<00:00:51.400> kind<00:00:51.970> of<00:00:52.060> a<00:00:52.180> little<00:00:52.450> bit<00:00:52.540> of<00:00:52.630> an

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
as well it is kind of a little bit of an

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.300 
as well it is kind of a little bit of an
awkward<00:00:52.899> game<00:00:53.200> because<00:00:53.470> both<00:00:53.680> players<00:00:53.980> don't

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.310 
awkward game because both players don't

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.280 
awkward game because both players don't
want<00:00:54.489> to<00:00:54.579> get<00:00:54.760> bad<00:00:54.970> engagements<00:00:55.630> because<00:00:56.140> that

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
want to get bad engagements because that

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.690 
want to get bad engagements because that
is<00:00:56.410> pretty<00:00:56.649> much<00:00:56.770> the<00:00:56.829> only<00:00:57.010> thing<00:00:57.550> that

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
is pretty much the only thing that

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.700 
is pretty much the only thing that
really<00:00:57.850> happens<00:00:58.239> now<00:00:58.660> obviously<00:00:59.110> it<00:00:59.290> opens<00:00:59.620> up

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
really happens now obviously it opens up

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.229 
really happens now obviously it opens up
with<00:00:59.829> a<00:00:59.890> bunch<00:01:00.130> of<00:01:00.220> certainty<00:01:00.760> name<00:01:00.910> goes

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
with a bunch of certainty name goes

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.330 
with a bunch of certainty name goes
through<00:01:01.450> roaches<00:01:01.899> and<00:01:02.110> usually<00:01:02.890> after<00:01:03.220> that

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
through roaches and usually after that

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.069 
through roaches and usually after that
day<00:01:03.550> and<00:01:03.730> some<00:01:03.910> hydralisk<00:01:04.420> or<00:01:04.659> some<00:01:04.750> swarm

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.079 
day and some hydralisk or some swarm

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:06.929 
day and some hydralisk or some swarm
host<00:01:05.350> or<00:01:05.680> somebody<00:01:05.920> Festus<00:01:06.310> but<00:01:06.490> that<00:01:06.700> is

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
host or somebody Festus but that is

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:09.420 
host or somebody Festus but that is
pretty<00:01:07.299> much<00:01:07.540> it<00:01:07.600> now<00:01:08.140> rogue<00:01:08.560> vs<00:01:08.979> Roach<00:01:09.219> is

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
pretty much it now rogue vs Roach is

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.039 
pretty much it now rogue vs Roach is
kind<00:01:09.729> of<00:01:09.909> awkward<00:01:10.149> when<00:01:10.540> you<00:01:10.600> think<00:01:10.810> about<00:01:10.899> it

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
kind of awkward when you think about it

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:12.990 
kind of awkward when you think about it
because<00:01:11.380> when<00:01:11.650> both<00:01:12.130> players<00:01:12.520> are<00:01:12.700> pretty

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
because when both players are pretty

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.789 
because when both players are pretty
even<00:01:13.420> a<00:01:13.510> skill<00:01:13.780> which<00:01:13.960> you<00:01:14.140> are<00:01:14.200> most<00:01:14.500> likely

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
even a skill which you are most likely

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.640 
even a skill which you are most likely
going<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:15.190> be<00:01:15.280> facing<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:16.630> actually<00:01:17.140> becomes<00:01:17.409> a

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
going to be facing it actually becomes a

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.710 
going to be facing it actually becomes a
really<00:01:18.010> weird<00:01:18.280> game<00:01:18.610> because<00:01:19.270> both<00:01:19.450> players

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
really weird game because both players

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.000 
really weird game because both players
don't<00:01:19.930> really<00:01:20.110> want<00:01:20.290> to<00:01:20.350> engage<00:01:20.470> because

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
don't really want to engage because

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.370 
don't really want to engage because
obviously<00:01:21.220> if<00:01:21.820> you're<00:01:22.000> closer<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.780> home<00:01:23.020> close

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
obviously if you're closer to home close

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.530 
obviously if you're closer to home close
the<00:01:23.590> hatcheries<00:01:24.159> your<00:01:24.610> reinforcements<00:01:25.390> will

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
the hatcheries your reinforcements will

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.690 
the hatcheries your reinforcements will
arrive<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.900> lot<00:01:26.170> faster<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:27.070> battles<00:01:27.490> can

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
arrive a lot faster the battles can

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.000 
arrive a lot faster the battles can
pretty<00:01:27.909> much<00:01:28.000> get<00:01:28.780> determined<00:01:29.320> by<00:01:29.409> a<00:01:29.440> slight

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
pretty much get determined by a slight

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.370 
pretty much get determined by a slight
position<00:01:30.250> difference<00:01:30.940> or<00:01:31.090> by<00:01:31.570> one<00:01:31.780> upgrade<00:01:31.990> or

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
position difference or by one upgrade or

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.800 
position difference or by one upgrade or
so<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.770> one<00:01:33.369> tiny<00:01:33.729> misstep<00:01:34.270> can<00:01:34.630> basically

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
so and one tiny misstep can basically

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.780 
so and one tiny misstep can basically
khushu<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.409> entire<00:01:35.680> game<00:01:35.920> so<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:36.340> few<00:01:36.610> days

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
khushu the entire game so a few days

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.670 
khushu the entire game so a few days
back<00:01:37.000> this<00:01:37.210> game<00:01:37.479> happened<00:01:37.900> and<00:01:38.080> I'm<00:01:38.380> going<00:01:38.619> to

game and this is actually one of the
best<00:02:02.110> engagement<00:02:02.500> if<00:02:02.830> not<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.130> best

zirkle desert this is actually giving

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:15.880 
zirkle desert this is actually giving
you<00:02:07.780> quite<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.200> gigantic<00:02:09.129> advantage

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.440 

so<00:02:16.890> let's<00:02:17.100> have<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.280> look<00:02:17.340> at<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.700> once<00:02:18.030> again<00:02:18.209> as

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
so let's have a look at it once again as

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.640 
so let's have a look at it once again as
you<00:02:18.540> can<00:02:18.660> see<00:02:18.750> I'm<00:02:18.840> splitting<00:02:19.290> up<00:02:19.380> my<00:02:19.470> roaches

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
you can see I'm splitting up my roaches

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.650 
you can see I'm splitting up my roaches
as<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.069> notice<00:02:20.459> his<00:02:20.580> army<00:02:20.910> is<00:02:21.030> coming<00:02:21.270> in<00:02:21.510> and

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
as I notice his army is coming in and

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.600 
as I notice his army is coming in and
I'm<00:02:21.720> attacking<00:02:22.020> right<00:02:22.800> in<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.220> middle<00:02:23.430> right

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
I'm attacking right in the middle right

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.059 
I'm attacking right in the middle right
there<00:02:24.120> now<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:24.930> absolutely<00:02:25.590> crucial<00:02:25.860> that

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
there now it is absolutely crucial that

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.740 
there now it is absolutely crucial that
you<00:02:26.160> spread<00:02:26.520> over<00:02:26.760> words<00:02:27.090> all<00:02:27.240> over<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.630> map

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
you spread over words all over the map

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.660 
you spread over words all over the map
to<00:02:27.930> know<00:02:28.080> exactly<00:02:28.230> when<00:02:28.890> he's<00:02:29.040> gonna<00:02:29.250> engage

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
to know exactly when he's gonna engage

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.120 
to know exactly when he's gonna engage
it<00:02:29.910> is<00:02:30.360> also<00:02:30.750> absolutely<00:02:30.959> crucial<00:02:31.709> if<00:02:32.010> you

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
it is also absolutely crucial if you

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.710 
it is also absolutely crucial if you
split<00:02:32.430> up<00:02:32.580> your<00:02:32.730> roaches<00:02:32.970> in<00:02:33.209> tiny<00:02:33.510> little

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
split up your roaches in tiny little

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.960 
split up your roaches in tiny little
chunks<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.320> as<00:02:34.680> you<00:02:34.800> can<00:02:34.980> see<00:02:35.010> here<00:02:35.430> we<00:02:35.550> go<00:02:35.580> for

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
chunks and as you can see here we go for

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.850 
chunks and as you can see here we go for
the<00:02:36.030> army<00:02:36.450> supply<00:02:36.780> as<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:37.470> can<00:02:37.590> see<00:02:37.709> at<00:02:37.830> the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
the army supply as you can see at the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.080 
the army supply as you can see at the
start<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.400> game<00:02:38.610> he<00:02:38.670> was<00:02:38.910> actually

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
start of the game he was actually

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.479 
start of the game he was actually
slightly<00:02:39.570> ahead<00:02:39.870> he<00:02:40.170> was<00:02:40.320> about<00:02:40.530> 20<00:02:41.040> army

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
slightly ahead he was about 20 army

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.820 
slightly ahead he was about 20 army
supply<00:02:41.790> or<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.150> ahead<00:02:42.270> of<00:02:42.450> mine<00:02:42.750> however<00:02:43.380> and

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
supply or so ahead of mine however and

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.220 
supply or so ahead of mine however and
the<00:02:43.920> laundry<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.459> fight<00:02:44.700> goes<00:02:44.940> on<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.840> bigger

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
the laundry to fight goes on the bigger

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.860 
the laundry to fight goes on the bigger
disadvantage<00:02:47.130> goes<00:02:47.370> in<00:02:47.610> my<00:02:47.730> favor<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.420> as<00:02:48.750> you

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
disadvantage goes in my favor and as you

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.490 
disadvantage goes in my favor and as you
can<00:02:49.050> see<00:02:49.080> the<00:02:49.739> engagements<00:02:50.400> in<00:02:50.550> surfaces<00:02:51.209> are

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
can see the engagements in surfaces are

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.050 
can see the engagements in surfaces are
absolutely<00:02:52.500> absolutely<00:02:53.160> crucial<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:53.760> do<00:02:56.060> so

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
absolutely absolutely crucial to do so

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.550 
absolutely absolutely crucial to do so
how<00:02:57.209> do<00:02:57.269> you<00:02:57.510> do<00:02:57.630> this<00:02:57.810> sort<00:02:58.019> of<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.200> thing<00:02:58.230> while

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
how do you do this sort of a thing while

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.199 
how do you do this sort of a thing while
you<00:02:58.680> basically<00:02:59.040> spread<00:02:59.340> over<00:02:59.489> oils<00:02:59.790> all<00:02:59.940> over

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
you basically spread over oils all over

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.820 
you basically spread over oils all over
the<00:03:00.300> map<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.870> actually<00:03:01.170> know<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.739> acknowledge

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
the map to actually know and acknowledge

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.130 
the map to actually know and acknowledge
when<00:03:02.400> your<00:03:02.550> opponent<00:03:03.300> is<00:03:03.360> moving<00:03:03.810> out<00:03:03.900> with

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.039 

idea<00:04:08.680> it<00:04:09.340> is<00:04:09.579> all<00:04:09.730> backed<00:04:10.090> up<00:04:10.299> with<00:04:10.689> a<00:04:10.750> locked

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
room so let's say you're trading armies

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.569 
room so let's say you're trading armies
with<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.629> profiles<00:04:14.109> when<00:04:14.769> it<00:04:14.950> is<00:04:15.159> going<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.549> be

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
with the profiles when it is going to be

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.699 
with the profiles when it is going to be
good<00:04:15.909> when<00:04:16.299> it's<00:04:16.509> going<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:17.019> be<00:04:17.139> efficient

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
good when it's going to be efficient

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.070 
good when it's going to be efficient
