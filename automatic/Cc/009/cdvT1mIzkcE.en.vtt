massive<00:03:01.820> grille<00:03:02.150> which<00:03:03.019> I<00:03:03.170> must<00:03:03.320> say<00:03:03.440> is

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
massive grille which I must say is

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.590 
massive grille which I must say is
actually<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:04.430> least<00:03:04.670> successful<00:03:05.120> part<00:03:05.300> of

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
actually the least successful part of

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.229 
actually the least successful part of
the<00:03:05.690> design<00:03:06.019> it's<00:03:06.950> actually<00:03:07.280> chromed<00:03:07.610> plastic

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
the design it's actually chromed plastic

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.180 
the design it's actually chromed plastic
which<00:03:08.420> I<00:03:08.570> imagine<00:03:09.050> is<00:03:09.200> for<00:03:09.410> safety<00:03:09.769> reasons

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
which I imagine is for safety reasons

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.250 
which I imagine is for safety reasons
but<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.850> just<00:03:11.060> looks<00:03:11.239> a<00:03:11.360> bit<00:03:11.390> gaudy<00:03:11.810> in<00:03:12.019> a<00:03:12.110> bit

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
but it just looks a bit gaudy in a bit

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.259 
but it just looks a bit gaudy in a bit
cheap<00:03:12.560> against<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:13.070> rest<00:03:13.280> of<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.459> design<00:03:13.670> and

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
cheap against the rest of the design and

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.330 
cheap against the rest of the design and
just<00:03:15.019> think<00:03:15.230> that<00:03:15.320> that's<00:03:15.470> possibly<00:03:15.950> out<00:03:16.130> for

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
just think that that's possibly out for

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.580 
just think that that's possibly out for
a<00:03:16.370> mid<00:03:16.550> style<00:03:16.850> makeover<00:03:17.480> as<00:03:18.080> we<00:03:18.260> move<00:03:18.440> around
