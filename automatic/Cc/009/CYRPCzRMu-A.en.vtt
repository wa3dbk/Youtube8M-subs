opponent<00:05:31.480> and<00:05:31.660> this<00:05:32.560> game<00:05:32.740> really<00:05:33.100> annoyed<00:05:33.430> me

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
opponent and this game really annoyed me

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.280 
opponent and this game really annoyed me
I'll<00:05:33.760> tell<00:05:33.970> you<00:05:34.120> why<00:05:34.480> in<00:05:34.780> a<00:05:34.870> minute<00:05:34.990> because

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
I'll tell you why in a minute because

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.140 
I'll tell you why in a minute because
obviously<00:05:35.590> you<00:05:35.860> see<00:05:36.040> his<00:05:36.190> stats<00:05:36.460> not<00:05:36.850> the<00:05:36.970> best

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
obviously you see his stats not the best

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.770 
obviously you see his stats not the best
of<00:05:37.270> stats<00:05:37.540> 57<00:05:38.470> 67<00:05:39.130> and<00:05:39.340> I<00:05:39.430> think<00:05:39.640> that<00:05:40.060> was<00:05:40.180> 63

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
of stats 57 67 and I think that was 63

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.410 
of stats 57 67 and I think that was 63
so<00:05:41.290> if<00:05:41.380> you<00:05:41.500> look<00:05:41.650> okay<00:05:42.550> nothing<00:05:42.970> they've<00:05:43.240> got

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:43.420 
so if you look okay nothing they've got

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.060 
so if you look okay nothing they've got
nany<00:05:43.690> been<00:05:44.140> our<00:05:44.290> first<00:05:44.530> I<00:05:44.680> thought<00:05:44.800> okay

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
nany been our first I thought okay

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.400 
nany been our first I thought okay
hopefully<00:05:45.550> a<00:05:45.940> benefit<00:05:46.450> don't<00:05:46.690> really<00:05:47.290> need

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
hopefully a benefit don't really need

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.380 
hopefully a benefit don't really need
him<00:05:47.650> and<00:05:48.130> look<00:05:48.310> at<00:05:48.400> his<00:05:48.520> bun<00:05:48.670> she's<00:05:48.850> got<00:05:49.000> Aguero

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
him and look at his bun she's got Aguero

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.290 
him and look at his bun she's got Aguero
so<00:05:49.780> it's<00:05:49.900> like<00:05:50.020> okay<00:05:50.290> he<00:05:50.590> pauses<00:05:50.950> it<00:05:51.340> and<00:05:51.520> quit

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
so it's like okay he pauses it and quit

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.360 
so it's like okay he pauses it and quit
