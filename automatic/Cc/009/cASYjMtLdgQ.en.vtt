hello everyone

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.280 
hello everyone
all<00:00:12.090> portraits<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.630> these<00:00:12.780> today<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.139> today

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
all portraits of these today and today

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.169 
all portraits of these today and today
we're<00:00:13.410> going<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.589> cover<00:00:13.769> body<00:00:14.190> fat<00:00:14.549> percentage

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
we're going to cover body fat percentage

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.850 
we're going to cover body fat percentage
and<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.450> problem<00:00:15.809> with<00:00:15.929> body<00:00:16.139> fat<00:00:16.379> percentage

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
and the problem with body fat percentage

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.089 
and the problem with body fat percentage
is<00:00:17.040> that<00:00:17.189> it's<00:00:17.340> very<00:00:17.400> deceptive<00:00:18.349> as<00:00:19.349> you<00:00:19.950> can

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
is that it's very deceptive as you can

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.060 
is that it's very deceptive as you can
see<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.490> very<00:00:21.150> low<00:00:21.390> body<00:00:21.630> fat<00:00:21.900> percentage<00:00:22.410> but

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
see a very low body fat percentage but

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.250 
see a very low body fat percentage but
if<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.310> was<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.640> relax<00:00:23.939> bend<00:00:24.599> over<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.900> little<00:00:24.930> bit

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
if I was to relax bend over a little bit

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.950 
if I was to relax bend over a little bit
I<00:00:25.439> can<00:00:25.890> grab<00:00:26.130> what<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.910> would<00:00:27.029> say<00:00:27.210> fat<00:00:27.689> or

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
I can grab what you would say fat or

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.890 
I can grab what you would say fat or
skin<00:00:28.439> around<00:00:29.099> my<00:00:29.250> waist<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:30.179> two<00:00:30.390> thumbnails

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
skin around my waist the two thumbnails

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.680 
skin around my waist the two thumbnails
that<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.230> see<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.619> my<00:00:31.830> video<00:00:32.390> both<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.570> them

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
that you see on my video both of them

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.110 
that you see on my video both of them
are<00:00:33.809> taken<00:00:34.230> right<00:00:34.379> before<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.400> made<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:35.910> video

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
are taken right before I made this video

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.540 
are taken right before I made this video
on<00:00:36.420> both<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.809> them<00:00:36.960> are<00:00:37.170> me<00:00:38.070> right<00:00:38.309> now

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
on both of them are me right now

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.630 
on both of them are me right now
basically<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:40.170> everything<00:00:40.980> depends<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.489> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
basically so everything depends on the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.279 
basically so everything depends on the
angle<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> way<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.480> look<00:00:42.690> at<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.930> person

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289 
angle on the way you look at the person

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:45.139 
angle on the way you look at the person
another<00:00:43.530> problem<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.039> arises<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.820> you

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
another problem that arises is that you

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.170 
another problem that arises is that you
don't<00:00:45.420> only<00:00:45.899> store<00:00:46.289> fat<00:00:46.770> under<00:00:47.640> your<00:00:47.850> skin

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
don't only store fat under your skin

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.049 
don't only store fat under your skin
your<00:00:49.020> organs<00:00:49.500> store<00:00:49.800> fat<00:00:50.070> your<00:00:50.309> liver<00:00:50.610> stores

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
your organs store fat your liver stores

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.720 
your organs store fat your liver stores
fat<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.780> it's<00:00:51.870> all<00:00:52.170> inside<00:00:52.890> your<00:00:53.070> organs<00:00:53.520> I

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
fat and it's all inside your organs I

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.119 
fat and it's all inside your organs I
mean<00:00:53.969> around<00:00:54.420> your<00:00:54.660> organs<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.010> were

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
mean around your organs and if you were

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.220 
mean around your organs and if you were
to<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.430> no<00:00:56.460> fat<00:00:56.879> there<00:00:57.149> your<00:00:57.690> organs<00:00:58.140> will

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
to have no fat there your organs will

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.010 
to have no fat there your organs will
begin<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.680> shut<00:00:58.829> down<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.609> by<00:00:59.760> one<00:01:00.030> until<00:01:00.719> they

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
begin to shut down one by one until they

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.619 
begin to shut down one by one until they
all<00:01:01.370> you're<00:01:02.370> basically<00:01:02.760> going<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.059> die<00:01:03.210> so

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
all you're basically going to die so

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.200 
all you're basically going to die so
it's<00:01:03.809> impossible<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.440> have<00:01:04.589> no<00:01:04.949> fat<00:01:05.399> in<00:01:05.700> your

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
it's impossible to have no fat in your

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.930 
it's impossible to have no fat in your
body<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:07.200> always<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.979> basically<00:01:08.729> what

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
body you always have that basically what

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.600 
body you always have that basically what
people<00:01:08.970> try<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.479> do<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.050> decrease<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.490> amount

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
people try to do is decrease the amount

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.180 
people try to do is decrease the amount
of<00:01:12.050> subcutaneous<00:01:13.050> fat<00:01:13.229> which<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.500> fat<00:01:13.890> under

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
of subcutaneous fat which is fat under

of subcutaneous fat which is fat under
the<00:01:14.220> skin<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.849> in<00:01:15.539> the<00:01:15.630> last<00:01:15.780> video<00:01:16.020> I'll<00:01:16.289> put

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the skin and in the last video I'll put

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.559 
the skin and in the last video I'll put
right<00:01:16.649> here<00:01:16.679> on<00:01:16.979> six-pack<00:01:17.280> abs<00:01:17.580> abs<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.360> told

00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:18.569 
right here on six-pack abs abs I told

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:20.270 
right here on six-pack abs abs I told
you<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.050> only<00:01:19.229> way<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> make<00:01:19.950> your<00:01:20.130> abs

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
fat percentage and this is what today's

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.070 
fat percentage and this is what today's
video<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.429> about<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.970> first<00:01:27.509> way<00:01:27.690> to<00:01:27.720> measure

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
video is about the first way to measure

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.749 
video is about the first way to measure
body<00:01:28.319> fat<00:01:28.410> percentage<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.160> by<00:01:29.429> the<00:01:29.490> use<00:01:29.729> of

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
body fat percentage is by the use of

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.969 
body fat percentage is by the use of
calipers<00:01:30.360> calipers<00:01:31.349> is<00:01:31.500> like<00:01:31.649> a<00:01:31.679> little

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
calipers calipers is like a little

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.370 
calipers calipers is like a little
measuring<00:01:32.429> tool<00:01:32.670> that<00:01:32.940> allows<00:01:33.209> us<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:34.020> see<00:01:34.349> how

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
measuring tool that allows us to see how

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.979 
measuring tool that allows us to see how
much<00:01:34.679> subcutaneous<00:01:35.429> fat<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:35.910> have<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.720> if<00:01:36.869> I

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:36.989 
much subcutaneous fat we have so if I

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:39.919 
much subcutaneous fat we have so if I
was<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.259> grab<00:01:37.440> around<00:01:37.739> like<00:01:37.890> my<00:01:38.660> fat<00:01:39.660> right

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
was to grab around like my fat right

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:41.660 
was to grab around like my fat right
here<00:01:40.080> and<00:01:40.200> measure<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:41.009> tells<00:01:41.340> me<00:01:41.520> how<00:01:41.640> many

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
here and measure it it tells me how many

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.419 
here and measure it it tells me how many
millimeters<00:01:42.539> of<00:01:43.140> separation<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.039> have<00:01:44.220> and

00:01:44.419 --> 00:01:44.429 
millimeters of separation I have and

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.400 
millimeters of separation I have and
that's<00:01:44.580> tells<00:01:45.149> me<00:01:45.390> how<00:01:45.630> much<00:01:45.780> fat<00:01:46.080> I<00:01:46.259> have

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
that's tells me how much fat I have

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.529 
that's tells me how much fat I have
under<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.830> skin<00:01:47.039> then<00:01:47.220> we<00:01:47.369> use<00:01:47.489> a<00:01:47.520> chart<00:01:48.300> and

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
under the skin then we use a chart and

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.109 
under the skin then we use a chart and
we<00:01:49.140> find<00:01:49.440> our<00:01:49.590> age<00:01:49.800> and<00:01:49.830> we<00:01:50.220> find<00:01:50.520> how<00:01:50.789> much<00:01:50.940> we

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
we find our age and we find how much we

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.669 
we find our age and we find how much we
measured<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.569> millimeters<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.289> tells<00:01:52.500> us

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
measured in millimeters and it tells us

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.559 
measured in millimeters and it tells us
our<00:01:52.830> body<00:01:53.039> fat<00:01:53.250> percentage<00:01:53.789> approximately

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
our body fat percentage approximately

measurement of your body fat percentage
make<00:04:02.280> sure<00:04:02.519> as<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:03.359> do<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.959> two-inch<00:04:04.319> clip

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
make sure as you do the two-inch clip

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.589 
make sure as you do the two-inch clip
with<00:04:04.829> your<00:04:05.010> hands<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.819> take<00:04:06.000> it<00:04:06.150> within<00:04:06.389> 5

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
with your hands you take it within 5

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:08.870 
with your hands you take it within 5
seconds<00:04:07.049> because<00:04:07.410> you<00:04:07.769> aren't<00:04:08.010> pushing<00:04:08.370> and

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
seconds because you aren't pushing and

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.809 
seconds because you aren't pushing and
the<00:04:09.030> fat<00:04:09.329> cells<00:04:09.630> are<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:10.230> know<00:04:10.549> being<00:04:11.549> pushed

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
the fat cells are you know being pushed

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.479 
the fat cells are you know being pushed
away<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.739> you<00:04:13.739> won't<00:04:13.919> get<00:04:14.099> an<00:04:14.190> accurate

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
away and you won't get an accurate

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:15.800 
away and you won't get an accurate
reading<00:04:14.700> if<00:04:14.880> you've<00:04:15.060> been<00:04:15.239> holding<00:04:15.540> it<00:04:15.630> there

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
reading if you've been holding it there

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.020 
reading if you've been holding it there
for<00:04:16.019> a<00:04:16.079> while<00:04:16.260> and<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:17.280> distance<00:04:17.700> will<00:04:17.849> keep

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
for a while and the distance will keep

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.379 
for a while and the distance will keep
decreasing<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:18.840> decrease

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
decreasing and decrease

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.830 
decreasing and decrease
because<00:04:19.719> as<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.439> fat<00:04:20.650> dissipates<00:04:21.219> sides<00:04:21.840> so

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
because as the fat dissipates sides so

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
make sure you clip it you measure you go

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.899 
make sure you clip it you measure you go
through<00:04:26.110> it<00:04:26.199> do<00:04:26.439> that<00:04:26.620> three<00:04:26.919> times<00:04:26.949> through

all the places that you were going to
measure<00:04:29.349> and<00:04:29.740> then<00:04:30.729> take<00:04:30.939> an<00:04:31.090> average<00:04:31.330> of<00:04:31.810> the

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
measure and then take an average of the

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.869 
measure and then take an average of the
three<00:04:32.560> measurements<00:04:32.889> that<00:04:33.219> you<00:04:33.310> got<00:04:33.490> that<00:04:33.699> way

three measurements that you got that way

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:35.820 
three measurements that you got that way
you<00:04:33.939> get<00:04:34.270> a<00:04:34.300> more<00:04:34.389> accurate<00:04:34.780> reading<00:04:35.289> in<00:04:35.590> case

you get a more accurate reading in case

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.490 
you get a more accurate reading in case
you<00:04:36.039> did<00:04:36.189> something<00:04:36.400> wrong<00:04:37.169> all<00:04:38.169> right<00:04:38.259> now
