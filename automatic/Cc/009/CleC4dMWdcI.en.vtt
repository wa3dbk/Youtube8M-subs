origins because that game looks amazing

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.280

I<00:02:55.670> played<00:02:56.120> Arkham<00:02:56.570> City<00:02:56.810> and<00:02:56.990> Arkham<00:02:57.230> Asylum

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
I played Arkham City and Arkham Asylum

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.949 
I played Arkham City and Arkham Asylum
and<00:02:57.890> they<00:02:58.550> were<00:02:58.610> both<00:02:58.970> really<00:02:59.330> challenging

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
and they were both really challenging

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.480 
and they were both really challenging
games<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.500> that's<00:03:00.620> what<00:03:00.770> I<00:03:00.800> liked<00:03:01.100> about<00:03:01.220> them

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
games and that's what I liked about them

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.160 
games and that's what I liked about them
the<00:03:01.610> most<00:03:01.820> is<00:03:02.090> that<00:03:02.180> they<00:03:02.570> weren't<00:03:02.870> just<00:03:03.020> a

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
the most is that they weren't just a

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.440 
the most is that they weren't just a
walkthrough<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:03.860> had<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.130> actually<00:03:04.790> play<00:03:05.270> the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
walkthrough you had to actually play the

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.300 
walkthrough you had to actually play the
game<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:05.870> realize<00:03:06.230> what<00:03:06.470> was<00:03:06.590> going<00:03:06.650> on<00:03:07.040> and

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
game to realize what was going on and

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.509 
game to realize what was going on and
the<00:03:07.940> story<00:03:08.209> behind<00:03:08.420> it<00:03:08.720> was<00:03:08.900> amazing<00:03:09.500> I<00:03:09.739> was

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
the story behind it was amazing I was

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.640 
the story behind it was amazing I was
thinking<00:03:10.910> about<00:03:11.000> doing<00:03:11.180> a<00:03:11.390> began<00:03:11.720> to<00:03:12.050> souls

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
thinking about doing a began to souls

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.400 
thinking about doing a began to souls
um<00:03:13.239> walkthrough<00:03:14.239> but<00:03:14.450> it<00:03:14.989> seems<00:03:15.260> like

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
um walkthrough but it seems like

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.050 
um walkthrough but it seems like
everybody's<00:03:15.920> doing<00:03:16.250> it<00:03:16.400> and<00:03:16.580> it's<00:03:16.760> kind<00:03:16.910> of

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
everybody's doing it and it's kind of

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.280 
everybody's doing it and it's kind of

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
too late for me to kind of just jump

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.930 
too late for me to kind of just jump
into<00:03:18.769> it<00:03:18.920> and<00:03:19.190> start<00:03:20.180> doing<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:20.510> right<00:03:20.660> now<00:03:20.810> but
