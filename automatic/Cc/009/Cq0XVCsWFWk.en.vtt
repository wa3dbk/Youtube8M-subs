00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:51.440
 Now back to the box 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:58.069
 Shake it all up and get it 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:01:00.909

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.370
 is the tutorial for this 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.780
 cards trick for the cards have war 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:22.610
 me a normal blue bicycle bactech 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:27.530
 taken and three cards of a rose 30 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:30.700
 played and a card comes on top 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.860
 and the other two dogs are stacked 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.890
 both together and over these two 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.900
 cards stop him pinky break like that 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.720
 if that lifts off here , so to speak 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.090
 those two red cards for what they do 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.310
 next load is onlookers 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.650
 Dust say you make a ruffle 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.350
 Fund riffle through the cards and raises 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.080
 From every case I mean in any case 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.780
 from the tiebreak off so on here 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.970
 every case here these two cards there 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:06.050
 have lie if you have then lifted 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.869
 then you get the top card in 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.610
 In case the cross here gives that 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.220
 spectators in the hand of the should 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.830
 inspect whole times and become this 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.740
 card while watching 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.720
 and i want a break under the 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:25.930
 top card in the left hand and 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.480
 gives it to the top, so to speak 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.910
 position in the right stack so yours 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.100
 right hand and pushes the rest of the 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.620
 blue pile is supposed to have roared so 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.860
 again break under the top card 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:42.610
 and then you push the whole thing like that 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.710
 together then you have the two above 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.210
 red cards and the rest of the decks is 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.980
 blue 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.380
 okay what she's doing next 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.020
 just let the viewer see the map 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.540
 stuck somewhere and then is 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.000
 logically the viewer's card is the 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.560
 only red card the other two 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.550
 live on top of it and then it's gone 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.709
 Back in the can shakes the whole 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.820
 once makes a magical move or 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:15.190
 so get out and get it out then 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.520
 but possible so that the lower one 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.760
 keep stay in the box two cards 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:25.120
 your middle finger on the bottom 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.160
 two cards so that in the box 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.850
 Remember her pushing so a little bit 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:35.140
 down and cover the whole here then 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:37.180
 Face with this these have then 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.959
 so to speak, only blue cards in the 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:44.739
 hand up on this red and that the 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.340
