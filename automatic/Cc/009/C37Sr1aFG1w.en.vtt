00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.980
 very well in this special edition of 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.930
 tennis first we saw part of the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.200
 world's best players part of the 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.520
 best tournaments that were played during 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.830
 1978 that now good we're going to go to 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.170
 tennis event of the year so 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.880
 less for Argentina clear the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.770
 Argentina Davis Cup Davis Cup for 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.809
 sing in almost for the world but in 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.450
 Argentina in the Davis Cup always has 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.030
 that very special breath of expectation 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.100
 of problems of unknowns and I think that 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.960
 this year I had as main 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.150
 ingredient the presence nothing less than 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.980
 of the USA after the glorious 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.659
 days that you have drunk here comes in 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.480
 people in the USA with lives and conclude 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:00.300
 how many times we said before that 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.909
 event how much it is worth today to put in 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.450
 Argentina to agassi and matter of life 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:09.060
 It was used 300 record 400,000 US dollars 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.430
 morente to jaite characters and I want that 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.890
 it was a production of 500 thousand dollars 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.540
 about putting him here playing 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.110
 free for argentina a great double 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.420
 also because they make it up like this 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.430
 accurate very good team of argentina two 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.560
 of the best teams in the world so 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.010
 except in slow courts , the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.220
 American final for the promotion to 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:34.200
 play next year in 1989 in the area 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.000
 of the championship it was the US because it was 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.260
 more equipment no doubt was more often followed by 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.940
 best players and none of the 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.190
 which players better 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.470
 Americans but anyway 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.780
 Argentina presented a young team with 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.970
 future and this is already valid for the next 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.170
 year from argentina will try the road 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.500
 of the return and I was practically 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.140
 defined when today they played martín jaite 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.250
 and john mcenroe 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.280
 was 30 the American team had 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.690
 lost on saturday the doubles because 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.710
 I had started very well mcenroe 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.000
 winning him 6-2 5-7 6-4 3-6 and 6-3 a 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.780
 we would like to be able to shoot in the first 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.450
 I do not know with what spirit he played 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.830
 marking if at full speed or not the actor 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.290
 that the performance was correct but what 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.150
 true is that hai played you very well there 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.500
 you played very well to tennis one of the 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.390
 best matches he played with good 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.640
 airs in recent times what I think 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.780
 which is confirming that evidently to 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.510
 Sometimes nerves can betray him 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.760
 the anxiety that of a martín jaite that 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.970
 wants to meet the public can not 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.260
 betray a little because that day already with 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.959
 the party defined without great 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.930
 responsibility kite played very well the 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.840
 that did not play well was agassi in front of 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.760
 good people was a barbarous party I think 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.500
 who deleted it from the court and even 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.800
 martín jaite confessed me after the 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.630
 party I wanted to go 620 61 andre 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.310
 Agassi was beginning to show him 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.330
 less to the Argentine public because up 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.920
 that moment was practically 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.620
 unknown 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.040
 he was an exceptional player a player 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.560
 immense that could hit very hard to 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.390
 the ball from all parts of the court 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.850
 he proved it stopped him from the 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.560
 fund returned pulled out good favor barbarian 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.120
 I am referring to Andre's party 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.160
 agassi and martín jaite 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.890
 and the victory of the double flag will come 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:26.370
 he got in front of me news code by 6-2 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:30.299
 6-3 6-4 was all solved when 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.430
 this game andre agassi and the goal of 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.099
 excellent match very good match very 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.409
 hard fought despite the definition was a 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.150
 excellent match 4 match point to see 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.980
 to nolan he exactly missed the 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.920
 victory but the very well very well 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.530
 much more loose than the first game 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.450
 in front of dialing but roldán and with more 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.960
 breath of the public wants what he 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:56.730
 he asked and what he needed 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:01.710
 and pérez roldán lost 26 62 86 in favor 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:04.890
 by andre agassi got 54 match point 2 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:08.090
 wright point could not win do it if 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.090
 he played very, very well
