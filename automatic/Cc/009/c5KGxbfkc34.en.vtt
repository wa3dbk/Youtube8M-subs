00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.529
 scissors silicon iron and fomy color 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.890
 they want me to do the poinsettia 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.710
 in color this box brings four molds 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.650
 bring to do 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.230
 the poinsettia flower and bring to make 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.349
 poinsettia leaves and try to make 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.800
 rose roses and tea to make the sepal of 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.800
 the Rose 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.670
 this is to make the sepal 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.120
 this is to make the flower for big 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.670
 Christmas Eve is also going to 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.300
 occupy to make the green leaf of the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.300
 pink 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.760
 this is the mold of the rose 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:05.810
 and in this mold brings the two leaves of 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.410
 small size 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.750
 this is the girl and this is the median 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:15.170
 we started making the big sheet of the 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.400
 poinsettia is the next one we are going to 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.400
 warm our foami 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.220
 this foami is from mexico i like more 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.000
 work with this fomi because it's more 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.650
 thin and the truth works better 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.470
 also with the foam and from here of the USA 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.800
 but well I like foam better and 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.840
 from Mexico 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.840
 that our foamy is already hot 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.580
 well, we couple 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.880
 we crush 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.640
 and here we have our sheet marked and 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:02.710
 now let's do the sheet that brings 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.710
 the small leaf and the medium leaf 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.720
 We also heat our foamy 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.730
 it does not take long to warm up because as 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:19.180
 I tell you here our two leaves come out 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.890
 this is the median 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.890
 and this is the little one 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.299
 with the big poinsettia leaf 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.799
 let's make the green bag that is going 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.300
 to serve to put it also to 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.350
 our 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.350
 to our flower 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.830
 we crush it 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.020
 remember that it is with the big leaf of 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.010
 the poinsettias lamas that we are now 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.010
 doing in green 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.720
 here we are marked this green 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.629
 let's do three of the yellow 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.450
 let's do five so we can stay 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.190
 five medium five girls since 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.629
 we have all our sheets marked 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.629
 we started to cut 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.160
 now we cut the median and the girl 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.540
 here is the smallest we are going to 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.540
 trim 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.940
 yes 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.930
 the girl stays like this here we have the 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.290
 big leaf 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.110
 the median 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.230
 and the smallest one and also we cut 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.730
 the greens now to all our leaves 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.730
 we are going to put silicone 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.300
 from the back 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.439
 and we hit the wire 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.370
 same for the back we press 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.370
 here 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.470
 so that the wire comes this is 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.269
 the back like that is the part of 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.580
 in front of us, this will keep us 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.680
 we do with all our sheets we are going to 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.350
 take care of you here are all our 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.130
 leaves on the female give barbed wire like 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.729
 they want to tell us here we have now 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.729
 let's put together 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:42.069
 for the poinsettia on the poinsettia 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:45.129
 I grabbed these little balls of this I the 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:47.110
 I bought a bonche and I cut and 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.939
 I'm grabbing three or four of those 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.360
 you want to put it and put it for 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.360
 a tape 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.620
 let's grab the pistil we made and 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:02.090
 we grabbed 5 leaves of the small ones 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.090
 we put here around 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.760
 until we stay like this 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.490
 anyway, finishing as 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.690
 We have wire and we will shape it 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.690
 we put the strong 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.050
 in the first round 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.730
 now we go with the 5 medium 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.630
 and the medians we are going to put them in 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.630
 these little holes that remain 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.010
 and one 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.479
 a little more 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.540
 we love again now we go with the sheet 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.969
 larger 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.780
 same in between 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:05.650
 if you want to put a little more down 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.650
 it's okay 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:20.939
 4 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.620
 5 

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.220
 they accommodated our little leaves 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.080
 this way we are staying 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.100
 since we are just now we are going to put the 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.640
 truffle 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:59.129
 you can put one on each side can 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:02.330
 put two or three I'll put 3 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:02.330
 how to give them 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:09.350
 and so we do the same procedure you 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:12.610
 we expose this way we have our flower of 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.610
 poinsettia in yellow 

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:16.819
 here I made a red 

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:25.250
