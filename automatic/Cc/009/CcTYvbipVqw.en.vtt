 several decades exist

 and they register cars immediately 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.030
 get into base 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:01.219
 if the car was repaired even 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:06.439
 often or did something that was replaced by something 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:09.960

 car history 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.869
 it is important to us that the carfax is celebrated 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.330
 whether the car was hit maybe this 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.680
 car and the client was unable to pay 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.950
 and the bank took that is the system is very 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.530
 very cool and it allows us 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.290
 see the whole story about what can talk 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.500
 for jelly not 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.939
 if the car was a bank the bank took 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.920
 the car at the client he could not 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.659
 to pay 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.880
 maybe this car is bad 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.110
 served but because 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.210
 the client was taken away for debt 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.460
 just in America is not taken tomorrow 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.880
 yes client means several contributions not 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.950
 did a car get we can 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.049
 use and customers had little money 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.090
 possible at the wrong time to change the oil 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.750
 maybe there are still some problems 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:16.170
 cars the next moment is very important 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.170
 if there was any accident then of course 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.569
 we know that the car cafe and the will 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.640
 repaired it means that this 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.620
 car he can in good condition 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.780
 be up to maybe he was very weak 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:32.190
 bumper hit there replaced none wing 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.580
 but it means that in america this 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.200
 the car will be sold much lower 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.760
 market price 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.760
 accordingly if you are talking to dealers 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.670
 who should buy you a car 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.269
 in the us and you see that on carfax there is 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.209
