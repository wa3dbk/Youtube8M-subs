00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.690
 to the classmates and suddenly we 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.120
 we complain about the low temperatures that 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.860
 we live here in miles in the city of 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:15.849
 suddenly we see we are at 23 degrees and 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:18.190
 we are in a colder scandal 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:21.510
 exactly the coldest on this planet 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:25.470
 that is at least 93 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.870
 exactly Antarctica is in the part 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.330
 high 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.570
 it is considered as the sixth continent 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.370
 because if there is this by the extension 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.370
 territorial 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.370
 exactly 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.690
 in the south on vacation but in the north 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.760
 lives in chile where it ends up in chile no 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.590
 let's go down there is a station there 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.940
 which is the one that took place all this 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.350
 type of research to measure the 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.480
 temperatures to have the extension 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.350
 territorial the part of which they have of 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.710
 water and everything that is the station 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.030
 mcmurdo that is the research base 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.650
 as I repeat it and overtake having 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.170
 well they realized these 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:07.610
 temperatures really realities broke 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.410
 reggae broke the record is 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.520
 place the south pole where really 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:15.190
 there are penguins is in the south pole 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.990
 penguins 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.260
 that's why they visit a lot of Australia because 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.260
 is it so 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.509
 impression I imagine there 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.990
 There definitely can not be life 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.990
 human 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:33.259
 in the week of last week ago 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.659
 ten days the metallica group has just 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.780
 visit the south pole for the Antarctic 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.520
 to do a concert they did the 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.659
 concert very at least 40 degrees under 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:48.439
 zero 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:50.869
 just imagine the people gathered in 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:58.069
 so much alcohol in his veins that 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:02:00.520
 keeps the temperature high where I 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.409
 I think there are about 10 degrees below zero 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.380
 I was frozen from the hands that 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:10.099
 They gave me a hot coffee and I was spilled 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.280
 I do not burn absolutely anything to my 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:17.360
 hands were 1 but 4 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.980
 the producer that when I already my hands 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.390
 they were warm, I had not 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.800
 happened nothing the truth is that you're 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.600
 temperatures like those 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.760
 it does not feel as cold as me 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.510
 also when you are speaking when you go to 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.510
 diverse 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.379
 twenty 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.379
 38 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.319
 it is the place that has less humidity 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:50.780
 registered also has 80 by 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.879
 a hundred also of the water comes out of the water 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.200
 sweet from all over the planet 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.349
 this part of the south pole of which has 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.459
 compiled most is the 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:03.409
 metal in Antarctica there are the 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:07.250
 images where the few people who were 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:10.450
 met look at this exit that we're not 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.450
 prepared for those temperatures 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.190
 and physically we are also not 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:28.069
 used to endure that kind of 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:28.069
 people that 93 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.140
 and sra
