 good game modes its story mode 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.120
 it's a bit arcade not very entertaining 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.180
 but yes its interesting scenarios are 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.549

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.550

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.410

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.870
 the best wrestling games 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.120

 the best graphics or the best audio 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.740
 but what I love about this great game 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.050
 is that you could not just fight in the ring 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.480
 but in the parking lot and even in the 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.850
 park or outside the stadium wow 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.040

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.470

 and finally the gold medal is for 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.940
