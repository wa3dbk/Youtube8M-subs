God of War he's pretty easy to play yeah
actually<00:01:47.869> he's<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.500> easiest<00:01:48.860> to<00:01:49.100> play<00:01:49.340> if<00:01:49.579> you

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
actually he's the easiest to play if you

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.399 
actually he's the easiest to play if you

the<00:01:56.360> amount<00:01:56.630> of<00:01:56.719> strategy<00:01:57.259> that<00:01:57.289> goes<00:01:57.590> into

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
the amount of strategy that goes into

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.319 
the amount of strategy that goes into
this<00:01:57.950> game<00:01:58.189> is<00:01:58.460> that<00:01:58.579> it<00:01:58.700> might<00:01:58.850> take<00:01:59.000> a<00:01:59.030> player

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
this game is that it might take a player

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:01.630 
this game is that it might take a player
a<00:01:59.360> while<00:01:59.750> before<00:02:00.380> another<00:02:00.860> player<00:02:01.219> can<00:02:01.520> play

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
a while before another player can play

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.630 
a while before another player can play
however<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:03.140> game<00:02:03.320> is<00:02:03.500> still<00:02:03.740> pretty<00:02:04.219> short

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
however the game is still pretty short

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.310 
however the game is still pretty short

your<00:02:16.800> region<00:02:17.130> it's<00:02:17.370> pretty<00:02:17.640> simple<00:02:18.090> really

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
your region it's pretty simple really

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.030 
your region it's pretty simple really
we<00:02:18.840> need<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.080> summon<00:02:19.500> what<00:02:19.650> are<00:02:19.770> called

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.040 
we need to summon what are called
cultists<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.000> at<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.330> end<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.600> your<00:02:21.720> turn<00:02:22.020> you

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
placed the corruption tokens on that

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.940 
placed the corruption tokens on that
region<00:02:33.000> gets<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.870> move<00:02:34.050> up<00:02:34.260> on<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.620> victory

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
region gets to move up on the victory

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.520 
region gets to move up on the victory
points<00:02:35.310> ladder<00:02:35.520> once<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.630> region<00:02:37.050> is<00:02:37.200> ruined

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
points ladder once a region is ruined

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.110 
points ladder once a region is ruined
not<00:02:37.680> much<00:02:37.890> can<00:02:38.040> happen<00:02:38.190> there<00:02:38.550> so<00:02:38.790> more<00:02:38.970> the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
not much can happen there so more the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.300 
not much can happen there so more the
gods<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.660> chaos<00:02:39.840> will<00:02:40.230> try<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.500> move<00:02:40.770> to

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
gods of chaos will try to move to

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.130 
gods of chaos will try to move to
another<00:02:41.370> region<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.090> corrupt<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:42.690> one

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
another region and corrupt that one

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.680 
another region and corrupt that one
so<00:02:43.830> that's<00:02:44.100> corruption<00:02:44.850> let's<00:02:45.330> talk<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.569> little

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
so that's corruption let's talk a little

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.390 
so that's corruption let's talk a little
bit<00:02:45.870> about<00:02:46.110> fighting<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.800> won't<00:02:47.160> go<00:02:47.250> into

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
bit about fighting I won't go into

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.949 
bit about fighting I won't go into
detail<00:02:47.850> on<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.090> one<00:02:48.300> because<00:02:48.510> it's<00:02:48.660> really

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
detail on this one because it's really

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.290 
detail on this one because it's really
simple<00:02:49.230> basically<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.310> works<00:02:50.459> on<00:02:50.730> dice<00:02:50.940> rules

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
simple basically it works on dice rules

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.930 
simple basically it works on dice rules
and<00:02:51.570> on<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.750> four<00:02:52.230> five<00:02:52.590> or<00:02:52.860> six<00:02:52.890> it's<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.519> hit<00:02:53.730> on

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
and on a four five or six it's a hit on

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.509 
and on a four five or six it's a hit on
top<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:55.080> six<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:55.709> an<00:02:55.830> explosion<00:02:56.190> that

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
top of that a six is an explosion that

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.790 
top of that a six is an explosion that
allows<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.090> roll<00:02:57.269> another<00:02:57.570> dice<00:02:57.900> you

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
allows you to roll another dice you

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.009 
allows you to roll another dice you
count<00:02:59.130> how<00:02:59.459> many<00:02:59.519> hits<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.120> do<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:00.540> fish<00:03:00.750> them

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
count how many hits you do and fish them

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.570 
count how many hits you do and fish them
out<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.470> opposing<00:03:01.920> armies<00:03:02.220> in<00:03:02.430> that

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
out to the opposing armies in that

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.670 
out to the opposing armies in that
region<00:03:02.870> yeah<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.019> battles<00:03:04.140> are<00:03:04.440> pretty

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
region yeah the battles are pretty

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.320 
region yeah the battles are pretty
simple<00:03:04.950> but<00:03:05.220> when<00:03:05.340> you<00:03:05.430> get<00:03:05.550> four<00:03:05.850> armies<00:03:06.180> in

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
simple but when you get four armies in

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.120 
simple but when you get four armies in
one<00:03:06.510> region<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.110> some<00:03:07.410> cards<00:03:07.769> in<00:03:07.860> there<00:03:08.010> as

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
one region and some cards in there as

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.540 
one region and some cards in there as
well

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
well

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.580 
well
the<00:03:08.850> battles<00:03:09.239> can<00:03:09.420> get<00:03:09.570> very<00:03:09.870> confusing<00:03:10.050> and

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
the battles can get very confusing and

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.130 
the battles can get very confusing and
you<00:03:10.650> can't<00:03:11.370> gang<00:03:11.610> up<00:03:11.790> on<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:11.970> bigger<00:03:12.180> guy<00:03:12.420> but

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
you can't gang up on a bigger guy but

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.530 
you can't gang up on a bigger guy but
all<00:03:13.260> in<00:03:13.380> all<00:03:13.530> it's<00:03:14.040> basic<00:03:14.400> fighting<00:03:14.640> the

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
all in all it's basic fighting the

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.630 
all in all it's basic fighting the
character<00:03:16.019> cards<00:03:16.320> are<00:03:16.470> really<00:03:16.769> nice<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.459> big

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
character cards are really nice and big

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
like the game but I just feel that too

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.970 
like the game but I just feel that too
much<00:03:42.239> strategy<00:03:42.510> can<00:03:42.959> ruin<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.290> fun<00:03:43.500> sometimes
