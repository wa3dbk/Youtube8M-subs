we're<00:00:51.629> doing<00:00:51.839> the<00:00:51.929> scene<00:00:52.170> one<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.980> called

we're doing the scene one is called

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.459 
we're doing the scene one is called
caustics<00:00:54.030> these<00:00:54.600> are<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> patterns<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.350> you

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
caustics these are the patterns that you

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.989 
caustics these are the patterns that you
see<00:00:55.499> on<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> bottom<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.249> swimming<00:00:56.399> pool<00:00:56.760> or

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:56.999 
see on the bottom of a swimming pool or

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:59.299 
see on the bottom of a swimming pool or
in<00:00:57.210> our<00:00:57.329> case<00:00:57.359> the<00:00:57.719> sea<00:00:57.899> floor<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.440> sunlight<00:00:59.100> is

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
in our case the sea floor as sunlight is

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.489 
in our case the sea floor as sunlight is
refracted<00:00:59.969> through<00:00:59.999> the<00:01:00.510> wavy<00:01:00.719> surfaces<00:01:01.350> of

refracted through the wavy surfaces of
the<00:01:01.620> water<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:03.300> other<00:01:03.510> technique<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.589> use

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
the water the other technique is the use

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.670 
the water the other technique is the use
of<00:01:04.739> fog<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.370> simulate<00:01:05.640> murkiness<00:01:06.320> you'll<00:01:07.320> note

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
of fog to simulate murkiness you'll note

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.920 
of fog to simulate murkiness you'll note
that<00:01:08.070> objects<00:01:08.520> distant<00:01:09.090> from<00:01:09.300> our<00:01:09.390> eyes<00:01:09.570> seem

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
that objects distant from our eyes seem

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.110 
that objects distant from our eyes seem
to<00:01:10.020> disappear<00:01:10.500> into<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.860> dark<00:01:11.190> blue<00:01:11.640> murkiness

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
to disappear into a dark blue murkiness

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.330 
to disappear into a dark blue murkiness
this<00:01:12.690> is<00:01:12.840> simulated<00:01:13.320> by<00:01:13.350> adding<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.860> blue<00:01:14.070> fog

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
this is simulated by adding a blue fog

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.340 
this is simulated by adding a blue fog
to<00:01:14.700> all<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> objects<00:01:15.570> as<00:01:15.750> they're<00:01:16.110> drawn

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
to all of the objects as they're drawn

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.410 
to all of the objects as they're drawn
the<00:01:17.130> further<00:01:17.400> they<00:01:17.580> are<00:01:17.610> from<00:01:17.730> the<00:01:17.940> eye<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the further they are from the eye the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.770 
the further they are from the eye the
more<00:01:18.720> they're<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.260> fog<00:01:19.470> now<00:01:20.480> let<00:01:21.480> me<00:01:21.570> show

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
more they're in the fog now let me show

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.810 
more they're in the fog now let me show
you<00:01:21.810> what<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.290> would<00:01:22.440> look<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:23.070> earlier

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
you what this would look like on earlier

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.250 
you what this would look like on earlier
mobile<00:01:24.150> devices<00:01:24.570> we<00:01:24.870> have<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.020> cool

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
mobile devices we have a cool

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.880 
mobile devices we have a cool
split-screen<00:01:25.890> mode<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:27.350> this<00:01:28.350> mode<00:01:28.410> you<00:01:28.740> can

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
split-screen mode in this mode you can

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.710 
split-screen mode in this mode you can
see<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.220> just<00:01:29.490> not<00:01:29.730> as<00:01:29.940> immersive<00:01:30.300> or

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
see it's just not as immersive or

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.490 
see it's just not as immersive or
realistic<00:01:31.290> as<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.740> Tegra<00:01:32.160> 3<00:01:32.190> version<00:01:33.470> you<00:01:34.470> don't

have lighting particles you don't have

the glow all these dynamic lighting

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.780 
the glow all these dynamic lighting
techniques<00:01:39.960> bring<00:01:40.290> more<00:01:40.470> life<00:01:40.710> realism<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.730> a

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
techniques bring more life realism and a

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.160
