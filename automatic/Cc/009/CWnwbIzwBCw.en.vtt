00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.759
 in this lesson we continue to get acquainted with 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.510
 module develop adobe programs 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:13.320
 photoshop lightroom and we will meet 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.109
 settings clarity Vibrans and Saturn and 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.920
 they are below the tone settings 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:23.550
 corrections let's see how to influence 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.939
 these settings on the image to start 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.400
 repeat the previous material and a little bit 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.040
 we will correct that new collection for this 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.450
 Images 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.730
 the first thing you need to do is raise 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.219
 exposure as we see the histogram here 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.860
 does not reach the right edge and image 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.190
 looks a bit darkened as 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.200
 shot against the sun besides need 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.960
 use the fill light parameters 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.899
 to fill in these colors 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.850
 dark areas and if required 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.510
 if there are overexposure 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.100
 let's use recovery parameters 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:04.880
 let's start by setting the exposure 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:12.040
 hold and hold the alt key and 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:13.120
 set the exposure 3 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.510
 tically we look 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:23.200
 we get it ok 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:26.620
 add a little pure light here 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.470
 the image is already animated in order 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.900
 to return us juiciness 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.550
 colors in dark areas we 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.400
 use the parameters bags 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:45.300
 add a little black and 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:48.690
 a little bit of contrast like that now 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.400
 let's do saturation settings and 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.800
 vibrations as it is translated into Russian 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.790
 tongue 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.610
 Russified versions translate 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.330
 vibration let's compare how work 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.770
 these two sliders these two settings 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.430
 try to raise saturation to 100 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.820
 percent as we see the image has become 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.460
 supersaturated so perry fried and 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.590
 she looks no longer very beautiful 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.540
 let's go back 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.080
 double click on the slider this 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:24.370
 resets the setting now do that 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.900
 the same with the vibrance parameter also 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.450
 add one hundred percent 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.870
 it can be seen that it acts much softer 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.270
 and on the skin has much less 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.450
 influences that is, you can put more 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.959
 high numbers sometimes to 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.980
 to reach 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.920
 even color on the image 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.080
 as this parameter works softer 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.430
 slightly remove saturation and vice versa 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.550
 add parameter 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.239
 vibrance and shade becomes more 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.110
 even 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:58.540
 now about the clerics parameter this setting 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.540
 for portrait photos in which 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.489
 there should be softened facial features 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.310
 use undesirable look like it 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.250
 acts so well do a little 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:14.170
 smaller and start raising the parameter 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:17.290
 receive clarity 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.900
 emphasis on middle tones that is 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.640
 the contrast of midtones increases and we 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.860
 we get this more voluminous 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.020
 image but can 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:30.069
 get out such nasty artifacts 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:33.630
 medium sized for example on the skin and face 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.410
 facial features turn out such pointy 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.930
 so for portrait photos 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.930
 use it with caution 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.540
 it is more suitable for landscape however 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.150
 if you intend to create an effect for example 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.690
 style to him Hilo is just here that 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.459
 parameters you can achieve something now 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.980
 let's try to reduce the value 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:58.590
 clerics see what 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:03.769
 happens we have a mitigation 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:08.069
 image let me zoom 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:11.519
 so that it is even to see on the skin here 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:13.769
 so with us by default and if we 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.650
 reduce it a little bit 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:19.500
 mitigation of small skin defects with 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.340
 This main facial features eye brow 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.669
 lips stay sharp here one more 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.440
 interesting property of this parameter 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.910
 let's now look at how the parameter 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.889
 clerics acting on landscape photos 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.550
 let's open the top panel 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:42.060
 lower left side to release 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:46.440
 A place for a better photo review for 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:49.260
 press the f5 and f7 keys 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.710
 or you can press shift 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.080
 tab and then f8 open only 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:59.190
 right panel on which are all 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:03.860
 settings now i add value 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:16.750
 clerics let's 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:16.750
 increase to see the middle tones click 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.860
 that's how 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.770
 this parameter now let's try 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.780
 decrease its decrease leads to 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.540
 such misting mitigation 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.180
 image disappears contrast in medium 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:36.940
 tones 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:41.200
 now again increase first to zero and 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:43.940
 now we increase almost to the maximum 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.140
 in landscape photos this effect 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.960
 gives clarity 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:51.070
 Medium size and picture 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.760
 it becomes more voluminous so we are with you 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:57.260
 got acquainted with all the settings 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:59.630
 basic panels and in the future we are waiting 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:03.550
 familiarity with the rest of the settings then 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:07.690
 new curve color correction settings 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:11.570
 split toning detail lens correction 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:14.650
 effect and camera calibration calibration 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.990
 the cameras here are the basic settings 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:20.270
 develop module parameters 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:23.060
 by means of them all correction is made 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:26.330
 images and are also used 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:30.640
 local correction tools this 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:34.100
 crop tool crop overlay 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:38.750
 Remove any dust or stains downturn tool 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:42.110
 removal red oh correction this correction 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:45.410
 red eye beard this filter it 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:48.080
 custom filter and corrective 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.000
 brush allows you to produce a local 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.520
 correction is very valuable and necessary 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.950
 tool to work all this we 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.950
 consider gradually the next lessons
