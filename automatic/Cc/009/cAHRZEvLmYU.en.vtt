00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.520 
instead of in the past you know you come
up<00:02:19.370> with<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.519> melody<00:02:19.790> or<00:02:20.300> whatever<00:02:21.050> and<00:02:21.379> it

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
up with a melody or whatever and it

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.570 
up with a melody or whatever and it
might<00:02:21.800> lean<00:02:22.099> into<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:23.030> certain<00:02:23.510> person<00:02:24.080> that

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
might lean into a certain person that

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.850 
might lean into a certain person that
that<00:02:25.580> you<00:02:25.700> look<00:02:25.970> up<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.360> in<00:02:26.720> music<00:02:27.470> order<00:02:27.680> but

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
that you look up to in music order but

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.890 
that you look up to in music order but
on<00:02:27.950> this<00:02:28.099> record<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.910> wasn't<00:02:29.090> so<00:02:29.390> much<00:02:29.450> what

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
on this record it wasn't so much what

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.559 
on this record it wasn't so much what
I'd<00:02:30.410> heard<00:02:30.650> but<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.760> was<00:02:31.880> more<00:02:32.120> about<00:02:32.209> like

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
I'd heard but it was more about like

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.540 
I'd heard but it was more about like
just<00:02:32.989> creating<00:02:33.470> characters<00:02:33.890> within<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.250> song

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
just creating characters within the song

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.790 
just creating characters within the song
so<00:02:35.360> I<00:02:35.390> mean<00:02:35.660> like<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:35.900> might<00:02:36.050> hear<00:02:36.230> a<00:02:36.290> song<00:02:36.530> and

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
so I mean like I might hear a song and

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.880 
so I mean like I might hear a song and
like<00:02:37.209> imagine<00:02:38.209> some<00:02:38.420> gaunt<00:02:38.720> wizard<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.739> know

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
or whatever and I'd try to embody that

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:44.020
