00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:17.489
 To myself. here we are grandfather focus on aifon 3 gix but today we will talk specifically 

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:20.200
 Safari integrated browsers 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.320
 i'm by phone 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.640
 we will make comparative tests between 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.110
 tar h hsdpa cover with 3 italy d in coverage 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.910
 you want to get the browser's interface is similar to the other pages 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.780
 to take pictures we have different possibilities 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.950
 we see more accounts 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.829
 how can we add the favorites how a link on the page gets directly 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.639
 obama 

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:52.460
 ok let's say dd add sea to call it golfo see it appears in the scaffolding 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.909
 the button you pressed brings you directly to the page 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.720
 entered as a favorite 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.930
 if not we can absolutely add the favorite main in our list or 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.980
 send an ebay link to this page so very convenient the interaction with 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.390
 this kind of functionality 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.290
 the second button let us go favorite but we'll see later why the 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.280
 third pole that interests us a lot 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.010
 allows you to open a new page 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.700
 edit go hahaha 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.540
 open a new web page and blog while in the other one maybe already 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.620
 loaded so we can 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.070
 read more things at once the plague loading of the various pages 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.020
 we put the page where he was opening telefonino.net we see that the voice 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.070
 very good mind recharge we activated it a few seconds ago 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.840
 from this point of view the pious thesis compared to the old 3g really makes the 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.850
 difference 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.820
 % with a double 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.740
 tarsu the screen we can fast 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.740
 the page here is not always very accurate 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.149
 the are the fantasy apathy creep as you see 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.929
 ditta screen d alpone of the mind one of the strong points of this phone 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.219
 absolutely 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:10.620
 that fantastic surf with this prosap 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.040
 we can also zoom in if we want to zoom in less than double 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.849
 tap o 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.139
 absolutely more 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:22.779
 two fingers open and a little more if on the display here is also that the short-sighted 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:26.819
 we could easily read what is written on the display 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.839
 double touch you go back with the zoom unfortunately but I can see 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.239
 the rosette is not supported the flash in fact the flash animations present on the 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:38.770
 place 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.940
 are displayed with a 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.940
 quadratino I said before the favorites 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:45.630
 here is here 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.400
 tubs that we joke about in the book to go and see 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.180
 what we can do we can go to see the favorites bar the menu 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.180
 of the favorites as well as the history of all the sites we have 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.180
 visited 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.189
 in the day 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:06.169
 I also tried app entering a site that allows you to do a test of 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:10.679
 speed up from on the broswer of alfonso connectivity 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:13.820
 and we enter it we do it live so as to 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.840
 check the difference in connection between flat hsd two pardoned friends that sq 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.799
 hi-fi 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.799
 I start text 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.159
 here it is 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:33.939
 an envelope of 307, 1 kilobyte according to what we are impact hsdpa 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.749
 let's try pa 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.659
 take the test to have 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.659
 a confirmation 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:48.280
 we are at 417 obviously the network 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.689
 hsd plane an alhambra speed 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:54.739
 the constant but sometimes based on this is the network can 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.980
 increase every minute and performance 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.339
 however we are around 400 a great result for this 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:03.579
 aifon 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.599
 then while brusa can also be used horizontally as we can 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.850
 see if when we put horizontal 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:10.629
 the 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.790
 is the keyboard appears there 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.449
 it was this too. in Horizon 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.659
 to write in this way much more 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.750
 simple and immediate 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.910
 in fact as you see 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.940
 page 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.560
 it is also sought after among putty macs 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.290
 for visiting we can't understand why it is this type of keyboard 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.970
 horizontal is not also used in messages 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.250
 it would be really very convenient to go and search the messages on the 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.040
 alna to write messages with the keyboard of naples zontale 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.289
 if we are up for another page wars not on that again the chip appears 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.919
 in the area the ipad upper part of the screen 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:57.159
 vertically called an option for searching for impure deeds directly so if there is 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.949
 we put 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.289
 a string 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.020
 i'm 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.910
 this 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.969
 window 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:11.029
 appetizer sketch or directly for our country. will look for all the 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:16.129
 pages 2 brought the relative to that string if impressum on engine of 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:17.199
 search 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.060
 year we are going to activate but now killer 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.060
 uefa and let's go into the settings 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:25.389
 you want to do 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:26.839
 we activate it 

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:29.349
 the phone automatically 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.680
 hindi sad we have already configured previously connects to the wi-fi network 

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:35.069
 of our office 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:38.159
 the swich will allow us 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:39.040
 you can do 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.710
 we do not have the possibility to choose acehood connectivity 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.580
 turning on and off to do why 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.300
 the 3 phone tell me it always turns 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.520
 this second type of connection assuming that 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:53.889
 &amp; lt be a free connection 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:56.530
 back to our favorites 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.559
 now we remember we are in wi-fi 

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:05.599
 let's load it paint.net and see how to take two csv files a little bit 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:06.330
 faster 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.319
 obviously it also depends on our adsl but it is not 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.610
 so marked difference 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.740
 respect to the speed we had 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.150
 i'm one piece and therefore very good modem 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.300
 qnt s integrated into this to do with the nation with the mind 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.210
 it doesn't change compared to before we try to go on a page per pill 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.430
 % lot so let's see if mobile safaris 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:38.820
 manage download I have seen that many of you have asked us for the devil page 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:39.650
 we are on 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:41.869
 pagien download of the poor 

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:43.150
 sky we do 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.990
 click on a 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.040
 the inter case ecole de unfortunately safari cannot download this comment 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:50.180
 why 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:55.080
 downloads are blocked so we can't download them at all 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.080
 no file type from the network 

00:06:58.869 --> 00:07:02.559
 this is a bit of a limitation but unfortunately apple 

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:05.550
 prefers - 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.240
 applications that will come mom have marketed their own site or herb 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.999
 and therefore 

00:07:10.999 --> 00:07:14.409
 blocks free application downloads directly from 

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:18.319
 by safari 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.899
 however, the browser speed even with multiple pages open remains 

00:07:25.059 --> 00:07:26.699
 lacote marco see 

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:29.369
 browsing through the various pages that 

00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:30.380
 really 

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.190
 fast we are always on the qnetwork website 

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.360
 how can i see 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.759
 unfortunately is not before flashing is not 3 

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:41.349

00:07:41.349 --> 00:07:44.259
 alhambra this prose 

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:46.150
 hopefully the thousand 

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:47.309
