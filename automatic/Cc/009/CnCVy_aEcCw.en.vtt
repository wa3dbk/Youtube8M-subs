00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
you could take it to a private match but

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.129 
you could take it to a private match but
I<00:05:09.340> just<00:05:09.669> I<00:05:09.819> went<00:05:10.180> to<00:05:10.270> a<00:05:10.300> public<00:05:10.539> matches<00:05:10.779> and<00:05:11.080> I
