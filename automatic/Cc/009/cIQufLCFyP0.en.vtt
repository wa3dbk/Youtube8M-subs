00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
flash drive so I used a small

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.700 
flash drive so I used a small
screwdriver<00:00:41.000> and<00:00:41.269> carefully<00:00:41.449> pried<00:00:42.229> it<00:00:42.379> apart

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
screwdriver and carefully pried it apart

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.219 
screwdriver and carefully pried it apart
to<00:00:43.220> reveal<00:00:43.250> just<00:00:43.970> the<00:00:44.210> guts<00:00:44.510> of<00:00:44.720> the<00:00:45.050> flash

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:45.229 
to reveal just the guts of the flash

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:47.649 
to reveal just the guts of the flash
drive<00:00:45.530> now<00:00:45.860> check<00:00:46.430> this<00:00:46.640> out<00:00:46.970> it<00:00:47.210> fits

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
drive now check this out it fits

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:50.469 
drive now check this out it fits
perfectly<00:00:48.199> inside<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:49.010> USB<00:00:49.640> phone<00:00:49.940> housing

perfectly inside the USB phone housing

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.270 
perfectly inside the USB phone housing
so<00:00:50.900> a<00:00:50.930> little<00:00:51.229> drop<00:00:51.470> of<00:00:51.650> hot<00:00:51.800> glue<00:00:52.040> will<00:00:52.250> hold

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
so a little drop of hot glue will hold

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.250 
so a little drop of hot glue will hold
the<00:00:52.610> flash<00:00:52.909> drive<00:00:53.269> in<00:00:53.420> place<00:00:53.449> you<00:00:53.989> could<00:00:54.140> use

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
the flash drive in place you could use

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.320 
the flash drive in place you could use
any<00:00:54.440> glue<00:00:54.710> to<00:00:54.860> do<00:00:55.010> this<00:00:55.190> then<00:00:55.790> we'll<00:00:56.000> take<00:00:56.180> our

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
any glue to do this then we'll take our

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.600
