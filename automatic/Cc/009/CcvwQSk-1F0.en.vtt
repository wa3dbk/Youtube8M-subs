 hello everyone welcome to my channel 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.490
 today we are going to make a makeup for 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.490
 any event you have on the day 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.049
 we start by applying corrector in the 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.560
 eyelid and seal with color shade 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.560
 of the skin 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.030
 we use this coffee shade as the color of 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.030
 transition 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.890
 no no 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.329
 we apply this tone in the eye socket 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.329
 and we blur it very well 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.490
 we put this lilac tone on all the 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.490
 eyelid mobile 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.720
 i 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.479
 as it is a day look we take this 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:16.409
 dark coffee shade and we make a 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.409
 thin delineated 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.620
 Y 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.350
 and 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.790
 a more precise broach we apply a 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.790
 little more than the lilac tone 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.160
 we follow the cat line halfway 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.160
 of the lower lashes 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.940
 in the other half we apply lilac 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.790
 we apply a champagne tone as 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.000
 illuminator in the lacrimal and below the 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.000
 eyebrow 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.879
 we check the tabs and we put a lot 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.879
 eyelash 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.110
 we put corrector in a triangular way and 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.579
 we blur it with a synthetic brush 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.180
 We seal with translucent powder over 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.180
 all face 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.109

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.109
 bronzer to define the face 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.260
 in the high areas of the face we put 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.260
 illuminator 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.150
 to finish the face we apply only 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.150
 a little flush 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.690
 i 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.709

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.709
 cappuccino color tone 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.840
