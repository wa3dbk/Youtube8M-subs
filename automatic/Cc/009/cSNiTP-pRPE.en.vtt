interestingly it doesn't seem to be a

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.229 
interestingly it doesn't seem to be a
lot<00:02:25.269> of<00:02:25.330> difference<00:02:25.720> in<00:02:25.870> terms<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.170> weight<00:02:26.440> the

touch HD or see that behavior but not
great<00:02:30.849> deal<00:02:31.060> heavier<00:02:32.010> okay<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.129> finding<00:02:33.459> off

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550

the<00:02:33.730> customization<00:02:34.660> is<00:02:34.780> finished<00:02:35.080> installing

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
the customization is finished installing

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.280 
the customization is finished installing
we<00:02:36.160> get<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.519> touchflo<00:02:36.760> 3d<00:02:36.989> display<00:02:37.989> which

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
we get to the touchflo 3d display which

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.259 
we get to the touchflo 3d display which
is<00:02:38.500> similar<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:39.160> that<00:02:39.190> but<00:02:39.519> we<00:02:39.610> find<00:02:39.849> on<00:02:40.030> the

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
is similar to that but we find on the

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.869 
is similar to that but we find on the
touch<00:02:40.569> diamond<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.709> touch<00:02:41.890> pro<00:02:42.129> but

touch diamond and the touch pro but

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.809 
touch diamond and the touch pro but
obviously<00:02:43.120> this<00:02:43.299> is<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.510> HD<00:02:44.049> version

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819

we can customize our tabs and we can

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.029 
we can customize our tabs and we can
rewrite<00:04:35.350> a<00:04:35.410> position<00:04:35.979> to<00:04:36.820> sound<00:04:37.360> settings
