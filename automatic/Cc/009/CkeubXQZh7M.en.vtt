00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.880
 passing game cabal online pass 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.469
 I will be swung from the first level 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.269
 their Persians no help 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.340
 I will swing from the first fret 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.840
 maximum 190 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.600
 there is a level here 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:24.090
 war nation is almost like northern 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.619
 the server is very colorful 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.900
 battles in general let's start us on 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.290
 the choice is provided by two servers mars and 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.329
 Jupiter and how to choose 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.160
 let's choose jupiter that he has 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.870
 the prefix cold is obviously some kind of bonus 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:49.079
 but it goes into this nation from 52 to 79 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:53.670
 level from 80 to 190 and then 49 and up to 170 of you 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.250
 up to 190 on pokamis early 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.600
 let's build let's go to the war of nations 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.899
 although there is no let's go to drink when you even 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.120
 175 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:08.189
 a bunch of us just gonna be a music video 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.229
 old us will throw 60 plus 79 us 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.900
 just will not give prodyu we are not 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.790
 we can not do anything let's 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.040
 drink them on channel 2 newbies 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.490
 here is violence 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.070
 So 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.240
 we enter 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.240
 create a character 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.080
 so 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:32.700
 warrior is a class that will be strong 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.560
 damage and he will have tremendous protection 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.870
 I really want and he has a lot of humble words here 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.970
 In principle, every class has almost everything about 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.990
 spring skills 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.850
 assassin is colorful jumping 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.420
 great agility too big damage well 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.510
 little protection magician is the absence 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.240
 I think itâ€™s great dexterity 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.780
 Damage little protection Damage will be 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.640
 justify your defense shooter this then 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.660
 same as the mac in principle only 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.690
 bow defender is a very big defense 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:11.550
 and minor damage well it's like a tank 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.410
 take on and witcher because the magician is 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.400
 sword wielding character magic but so 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.410
 as an assassin imac here if we attack 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.110
 he knocks you down and and you just don't 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.239
 You can do anything I used to play for 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.550
 warrior went out spoil my witch 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.430

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.500
 to do him some damage 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.500
