that the phone is them not locked as you

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.519 
that the phone is them not locked as you
can<00:00:25.230> see<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.529> says<00:00:25.680> invalid<00:00:26.640> SIM<00:00:27.029> card<00:00:27.380> we<00:00:28.380> have

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
can see it says invalid SIM card we have

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.859 
can see it says invalid SIM card we have
no<00:00:28.680> way<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:28.859> entering<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:30.150> code<00:00:30.420> normally

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
no way of entering the code normally

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.740 
no way of entering the code normally
farms<00:00:31.199> are<00:00:31.320> different<00:00:31.910> in<00:00:32.910> some<00:00:33.180> way<00:00:33.329> twins<00:00:33.600> in

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
farms are different in some way twins in

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.780 
farms are different in some way twins in
a<00:00:33.809> code<00:00:34.020> or<00:00:34.290> there's<00:00:34.770> an<00:00:34.920> option<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.250> do<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.640> but

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
a code or there's an option to do it but

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.500 
a code or there's an option to do it but
honestly<00:00:36.239> though<00:00:38.059> obviously<00:00:39.059> what<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.420> need

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
honestly though obviously what you need

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.959 
honestly though obviously what you need
to<00:00:39.600> do<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.780> get<00:00:39.989> your<00:00:40.370> unlocking<00:00:41.370> code<00:00:41.579> so

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
to do is get your unlocking code so

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.380 
to do is get your unlocking code so
Michael<00:00:42.270> -<00:00:42.420> -<00:00:42.899> probe<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.850> you<00:00:44.850> can<00:00:45.059> get<00:00:45.239> one

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
Michael - - probe and you can get one

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.560 
Michael - - probe and you can get one
line<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:48.570> what<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.469> also<00:00:49.530> need<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.360> these<00:00:51.360> two

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
line so what we also need is these two

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.160 
line so what we also need is these two
codes<00:00:51.870> here<00:00:52.610> and<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:54.329> as<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.510> can<00:00:54.629> see<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
codes here and so as you can see on the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.610 
codes here and so as you can see on the
top<00:00:55.350> one<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:56.190> would<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.579> enter<00:00:56.699> hash<00:00:57.149> 0<00:00:57.870> 1

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
top one we would have to enter hash 0 1

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.240 
top one we would have to enter hash 0 1
1<00:00:58.800> 1<00:00:58.859> star<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.180> code<00:01:00.390> then<00:01:00.660> hash<00:01:00.960> or<00:01:01.859> we

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
1 1 star in the code then hash or we

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.660 
1 1 star in the code then hash or we
have<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> other<00:01:02.609> option<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.239> hash<00:01:04.140> 0<00:01:04.949> 1<00:01:05.189> 3<00:01:05.580> 3

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
have the other option of hash 0 1 3 3

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.289 
have the other option of hash 0 1 3 3
star<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:07.260> code<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.770> hash<00:01:08.100> now<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:08.970> top

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
star and you code in hash now the top

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.590 
star and you code in hash now the top
one<00:01:09.470> should<00:01:10.470> only<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.830> used<00:01:11.180> with<00:01:12.180> your<00:01:12.210> neck

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
one should only be used with your neck

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.560 
one should only be used with your neck
lock<00:01:12.869> code<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> bottom<00:01:15.119> one's<00:01:15.270> going<00:01:15.509> to

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
lock code and the bottom one's going to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.670 
lock code and the bottom one's going to
be<00:01:15.689> used<00:01:15.960> with<00:01:16.799> your<00:01:16.950> SP<00:01:17.460> lock<00:01:18.060> code<00:01:18.560> if<00:01:19.560> you

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
be used with your SP lock code if you

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.870 
be used with your SP lock code if you
using<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.979> wrong<00:01:20.100> way<00:01:20.250> around<00:01:20.310> or<00:01:20.640> get<00:01:20.790> it

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
using the wrong way around or get it

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.280 
using the wrong way around or get it
mixed<00:01:21.030> up<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.360> can't<00:01:21.570> hard<00:01:21.780> lock<00:01:21.960> your<00:01:22.140> phone

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
mixed up you can't hard lock your phone

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.030 
mixed up you can't hard lock your phone
so<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:23.100> know<00:01:23.250> better<00:01:23.490> unlock<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:25.040> so

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
so you you know better unlock it and so

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.880 
so you you know better unlock it and so
I've<00:01:26.130> got<00:01:26.310> my<00:01:26.430> codes<00:01:29.720> so<00:01:30.720> obviously<00:01:31.259> what<00:01:31.799> we

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
I've got my codes so obviously what we

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.999 
I've got my codes so obviously what we
need<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.130> do<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.579> try<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.570> first<00:01:33.810> one

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.969 

so<00:01:38.009> if<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.460> enter

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
so if I enter

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.990 
so if I enter
0<00:01:40.979> 1<00:01:41.939> 1<00:01:42.299> 1

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:57.510 

star<00:01:45.690> you<00:01:46.910> put<00:01:47.910> my<00:01:48.060> code<00:01:48.330> on<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.750> not<00:01:49.020> code

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.020 

then<00:01:58.119> hash<00:01:59.100> and<00:02:00.100> you<00:02:00.280> can<00:02:00.430> see<00:02:00.579> the<00:02:00.670> bottom<00:02:00.939> it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
then hash and you can see the bottom it

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.810 
then hash and you can see the bottom it
says<00:02:01.299> not<00:02:02.140> yet<00:02:02.290> personalized<00:02:02.890> which<00:02:03.549> means

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
says not yet personalized which means

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.270 
says not yet personalized which means
that<00:02:03.970> didn't<00:02:04.240> work<00:02:04.390> so<00:02:04.799> which<00:02:05.799> means<00:02:05.979> we<00:02:06.159> now

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
that didn't work so which means we now

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.339 
that didn't work so which means we now
need<00:02:06.460> to<00:02:06.520> try<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.729> second<00:02:07.180> code<00:02:07.360> at<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.080> bottom

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
need to try a second code at the bottom

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.839 
need to try a second code at the bottom
here<00:02:08.590> with<00:02:09.280> our<00:02:09.610> SP<00:02:10.450> lock<00:02:10.660> code<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.430> we<00:02:12.550> need<00:02:12.700> to

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
here with our SP lock code so we need to

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:32.089 
here with our SP lock code so we need to
enter<00:02:13.180> hash<00:02:15.630> 0<00:02:16.630> 1<00:02:17.640> 3<00:02:18.640> 3<00:02:19.530> start<00:02:20.849> then<00:02:21.849> the<00:02:21.880> code

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.500 

-<00:02:33.620> as<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.769> can<00:02:34.920> see<00:02:35.069> there<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.430> says<00:02:35.670> if<00:02:36.420> you

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
- as you can see there it says if you

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.989 
- as you can see there it says if you
call<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.900> it's<00:02:37.469> a<00:02:37.620> personalization<00:02:38.249> council

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:38.999 
call that it's a personalization council

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:42.589 
call that it's a personalization council
which<00:02:39.659> means<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.109> has<00:02:40.230> worked<00:02:41.480> they<00:02:42.480> would

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
which means it has worked they would

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.229 
which means it has worked they would
just<00:02:42.780> skip<00:02:42.959> all<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:44.299> so<00:02:45.299> I<00:02:45.359> can<00:02:45.569> show<00:02:45.599> you<00:02:47.239> the

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
just skip all this so I can show you the
