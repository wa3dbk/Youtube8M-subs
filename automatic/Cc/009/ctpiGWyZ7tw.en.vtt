 Today we give you a do it 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:10.260
 yourself tip how to look for under 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.639
 five euros a beauty of builds each of the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.349
 himself with the portrait photography 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.299
 has employed can be determined ever 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.060
 on the term or as unread 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.100
 beauty table the british is a light 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.980
 form of such a mixture of very 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.170
 soft and very hard light is and yes 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.970
 just portrait or in and 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.310
 beauty area is very popular for him 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.189
 flatters the model 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.280
 which brings contrasts in the face 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.840
 but also quite expensive 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.700
 no matter if you have such a solution for one now 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.129
 uses flash or maybe for 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.070
 a studio lightning costs easy money 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.600
 we show you today how to look for 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.890
 the flash a bloody 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:53.399
 tinkering under five euros you are 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:57.320
 needs a big styrofoam balls one 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:02.670
 small styrofoam balls roulades skewers 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:04.860
 a carpet knife a pen and a 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.049
 tacker is as good as nothing 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.030
 other than a big normal reflector 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.799
 in the middle still a hemisphere 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.500
 a small disc has the light 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.950
 from lightning a little awkward the lightning 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.830
 sits on the back of the light comes in 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.189
 the hemisphere is pure and then by the 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.790
 other smaller area reflected 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.189
 so reflected and come illuminated 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.600
 only then forward to the model so 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.460
 a hemisphere and a ball like that 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.350
 here there are in each craft invite 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.240
 that is so well sorted or even at 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.590
 amazon the link to this we put you 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.750
 below in the video description 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.600
 with pure 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.570
 yes, that's it , too, offer yourself 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.270
 and we'll start now and 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.119
 tinker this Aufsteckblitz here behind 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.460
 and fix this here 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.680
 in front of this big reflector as 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.979
 First, let's look at the excerpt 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.140
 we need the lightning then through 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.270
 the hemisphere and through styrofoam 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.619
 you can just push that with you 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.950
 a pen down in 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.080
 tracing or even easier 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.980
 if maybe the pen times 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.050
 not at hand or a mine anything 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.269
 the styrofoam as and the flashes out 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.430
 Hard plastic is one can here 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.370
 so press a little bit and 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.950
 has thereby the exact knew and the 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:28.900
 exact size of lightning then on the 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:31.780
 scirocco hemisphere marks take us 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.940
 then the cutter knife there you have to 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.970
 really work that very well 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.250
 also very fitting then later and is 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.629
 with a sharp blade we go 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.060
 just along the mark of 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:50.349
 pen or simply imprint 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:58.239
 of lightning so very carefully 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:59.709
 the rough knew rather use 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.569
 Bit smaller if you do not feel like it 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:06.340
 sure is too big it would be the first 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:09.220
 go through a bit now 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.609
 deeper we have so good two here 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.760
 centimeters are the must then too 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:17.849
 really completely cut through 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.849
 become 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:42.400
 we check if we are already through 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.820
 okay in some places we still have to 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.820
 rework 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.150
 ok then we break the whole house 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:09.310
 and you see the hole is for the flash 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:11.590
 ready for check the whole thing fits 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.800
 ever good that one is stuck 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.950
 can also move it does not fall off 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.870
 Look inside and out enough 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.220
 the next step will be the 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.770
 So the second little ball 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.100
 Simply with roulade needles we have 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.570
 maybe here from wood maybe too 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.190
 the prices once again says the whole thing 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.990
 under five euros the ball has three 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.500
 tasted the big hemisphere here three 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.470
 Euro 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.730
 which somehow 90 cent and they are in the 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.130
 Supermarket run two euros 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.360
 or yes, yes, yes 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.550
 everyone in a typical lying around 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.960
 We are here for metal 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.500
 Wood was just decided 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.800
 cheaper we grab us this way 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.120
 two thirty-four and you may already know 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.020
 what comes now one or the other 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.710
 doctor already 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:59.140
 we push that as easy from the outside 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.460
 into the hemisphere and fix it 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.120
 the other little ball 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.120
 I'll do that 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.349
 since you have now from not much 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.210
 measure or something 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.889
 that should at least from the 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.229
 distance ago 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:19.229
 to be on the same height 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:38.480
 this is the finished please you see 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:40.720
 the lightning flashes in the back here 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.690
 but first meets the first 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:47.390
 small ball because they are down 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.310
 the light breaks a little and throws that 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.690
 then in the big hemispheres only then 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.070
 it gets to the front 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.990
 we'll show you an example 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.670
 pictures like the effect then really 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.590
 comes off once with the 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.330
 homemade political and once without 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.400
 and you will really see it 

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.550
 great light what is created very 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.590
 color neutral because it is white and 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.600
 just super fast built that 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.190
 whole then on the camera from the 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.140
 ascended it is on it I offer it 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.040
 on the front and you could go now 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.800
 taking photos 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.990
 we have to be careful 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.240
 Solution because the ball is 30 centimeters tall 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.910
 is in the wide angle asks the Sun. 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.880
 a little bit in the picture but with the kit 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:29.150
 Objective on 55 mm is not the stop 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:31.130
 to see more and can be super relaxed 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:33.200
 someone with a great light 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.300
 you prefer to portray it 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.580
 unleashed the whole tripod 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.880
 posed with radio trigger it is too 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:46.040
 no problem then you sit the 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:48.830
 lightning here on the radio trigger on the 

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.350
 Camera and you can then portraits 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.030
 maybe it should shoot too 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.890
 then set to the correct height 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.810
 so it also makes sense 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.180
 You can shoot portraits 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.620
 unleashed with a great soft light 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.270
 We'll grab us again 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.610
 one of the guys from the other league 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.360
 Editors take a few pictures and 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.360
 dazzle 1 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.620
 that was our do it yourself tip for 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.880
 the building of a beauty through you

 I liked the video and I like you 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.690
 Sonja was able to help brood quickly 

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:21.349
 recreate then gives way to thumb
