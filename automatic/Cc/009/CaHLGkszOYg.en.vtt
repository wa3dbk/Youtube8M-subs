James<00:02:23.820> Jones<00:02:24.690> young<00:02:25.290> don't<00:02:25.710> know<00:02:25.800> athletes

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
James Jones young don't know athletes

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.250 
James Jones young don't know athletes
like<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.790> but<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.420> next<00:02:27.630> way<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.780> end<00:02:28.020> gems

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
like that but the next way to end gems

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.370 
like that but the next way to end gems
is<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.980> clean<00:02:29.190> up<00:02:29.400> around<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:29.880> your<00:02:30.000> base<00:02:30.380> so

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
is to clean up around to your base so

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.030 
is to clean up around to your base so
like<00:02:31.890> clearing<00:02:32.370> chunks<00:02:32.970> chunks<00:02:33.530> chunks<00:02:34.530> the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
like clearing chunks chunks chunks the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.060 
like clearing chunks chunks chunks the
hell<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.490> chunk<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:37.290> see<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:37.680> I'm<00:02:38.010> just

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
guaranteed gems all the time but you

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.760 
guaranteed gems all the time but you
know<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.350> I<00:02:44.280> can't<00:02:44.520> show<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:45.270> fight<00:02:46.110> how

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.370 
know and I can't show you a fight how
many<00:02:46.950> times<00:02:47.160> because<00:02:47.550> my<00:02:48.540> storage<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:49.140> like

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
many times because my storage is like

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.760 
many times because my storage is like
really<00:02:49.830> bad<00:02:50.090> well<00:02:51.090> if<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.330> am<00:02:51.450> eternally<00:02:52.020> and

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
really bad well if I am eternally and

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.370 
really bad well if I am eternally and
they're<00:02:53.280> not<00:02:53.370> sure<00:02:53.550> perhaps<00:02:54.209> like<00:02:54.750> recording

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
they're not sure perhaps like recording

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.710 
they're not sure perhaps like recording
from<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:55.860> one<00:02:55.980> like<00:02:56.910> I'm<00:02:57.120> recording<00:02:57.570> from

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
from that one like I'm recording from

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.190 
from that one like I'm recording from
your<00:02:57.870> iPhone<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.650> yeah<00:02:59.420> but<00:03:00.420> anyway<00:03:00.630> let's<00:03:01.050> see

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
your iPhone so yeah but anyway let's see

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.100 
your iPhone so yeah but anyway let's see
if<00:03:01.260> this<00:03:01.380> gets<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:01.709> anything<00:03:02.270> no<00:03:03.270> that<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:03.630> 5<00:03:03.810> XP

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
if this gets is anything no that is 5 XP

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.400 
if this gets is anything no that is 5 XP
but<00:03:04.890> this<00:03:05.880> you<00:03:06.270> can<00:03:06.300> get<00:03:06.570> a<00:03:06.600> gem<00:03:06.870> box<00:03:07.140> which

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
but this you can get a gem box which

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.500 
but this you can get a gem box which
costs<00:03:07.770> 1000<00:03:08.370> elixir<00:03:08.820> I<00:03:08.850> think<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.300> and

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
costs 1000 elixir I think it is and

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.380 
costs 1000 elixir I think it is and
you're<00:03:10.230> guaranteed<00:03:10.739> 25<00:03:11.340> gems<00:03:11.640> each<00:03:11.850> time<00:03:12.150> as

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
you're guaranteed 25 gems each time as

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.670 
you're guaranteed 25 gems each time as
you<00:03:12.510> can<00:03:12.630> see<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:12.810> want<00:03:13.020> to<00:03:13.140> shown<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:13.500> but<00:03:13.620> I

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
you can see I want to shown you but I

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.280 
you can see I want to shown you but I
cleared<00:03:14.040> mine<00:03:14.190> before<00:03:14.370> there's<00:03:15.239> 25<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:15.959> don't

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
cleared mine before there's 25 I don't

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.850 
cleared mine before there's 25 I don't
know<00:03:16.350> if<00:03:16.410> you<00:03:16.470> can<00:03:16.620> see<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:16.890> good<00:03:17.220> yeah<00:03:17.880> 25<00:03:18.860> so

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
know if you can see that good yeah 25 so

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.500 
know if you can see that good yeah 25 so
there's<00:03:20.040> another<00:03:20.220> way<00:03:20.400> doing<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.790> gem<00:03:21.030> boxes

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
there's another way doing the gem boxes

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.979 
there's another way doing the gem boxes
and<00:03:22.730> what's<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.820> called<00:03:23.970> lava<00:03:24.269> just<00:03:24.540> bubble

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
and what's it called lava just bubble

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.170 
and what's it called lava just bubble
around<00:03:25.170> your<00:03:25.590> stuff<00:03:25.769> as<00:03:26.549> you<00:03:26.730> can<00:03:26.760> also<00:03:27.000> get
