started<00:00:43.960> on<00:00:44.530> scaling<00:00:45.280> some<00:00:45.460> fish<00:00:46.260> one<00:00:47.260> of<00:00:47.350> the

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
started on scaling some fish one of the

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.860 
started on scaling some fish one of the
older<00:00:47.769> processes<00:00:48.489> of<00:00:48.609> cleaning<00:00:48.969> a<00:00:49.059> fish<00:00:49.269> was

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
older processes of cleaning a fish was

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.110 
older processes of cleaning a fish was
to<00:00:49.960> take<00:00:50.140> a<00:00:50.199> spoon<00:00:50.620> and<00:00:50.890> just<00:00:50.980> sort<00:00:51.640> of<00:00:51.670> plow

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
to take a spoon and just sort of plow

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.660 
to take a spoon and just sort of plow
through<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:52.840> scales<00:00:53.260> to<00:00:53.739> get<00:00:53.949> them<00:00:54.100> off<00:00:54.280> and

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
through the scales to get them off and

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.090 
through the scales to get them off and
as<00:00:54.940> you<00:00:54.969> see<00:00:55.329> it's<00:00:55.570> a<00:00:55.629> messy<00:00:55.899> process<00:00:56.230> and<00:00:56.949> you

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
as you see it's a messy process and you

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.139 
as you see it's a messy process and you
do<00:00:57.280> miss<00:00:57.519> a<00:00:57.550> lot<00:00:57.789> of<00:00:57.969> scales<00:00:58.210> when<00:00:58.510> you<00:00:58.629> do<00:00:58.809> this

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
do miss a lot of scales when you do this

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.689 
do miss a lot of scales when you do this
thank<00:01:01.149> you<00:01:01.359> great<00:01:01.750> smacking<00:01:02.379> the<00:01:02.499> eye<00:01:02.699> that's

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
thank you great smacking the eye that's

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.820 
thank you great smacking the eye that's
fish<00:01:04.180> that's<00:01:04.480> fish<00:01:04.750> scaling<00:01:05.230> with<00:01:05.410> a<00:01:05.440> spoon

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
fish that's fish scaling with a spoon

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.490 
fish that's fish scaling with a spoon
but<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.610> new<00:01:06.760> process<00:01:07.300> that<00:01:07.330> we've<00:01:07.690> got<00:01:07.960> that

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
but the new process that we've got that

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.440 
but the new process that we've got that
Mister<00:01:08.920> Twister<00:01:09.100> has<00:01:09.460> introduced<00:01:10.030> with<00:01:10.360> the

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
Mister Twister has introduced with the

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:58.010 
Mister Twister has introduced with the
easy<00:01:10.630> scaler<00:01:11.200> watch<00:01:12.159> this<00:01:12.549> guy's

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.970 

one<00:01:59.020> of<00:01:59.110> the<00:01:59.170> things<00:01:59.380> you<00:01:59.470> got<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.620> take<00:01:59.800> into

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
one of the things you got to take into

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.410 
one of the things you got to take into
consideration<00:02:00.010> with<00:02:00.610> this<00:02:00.730> product<00:02:01.060> is

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
consideration with this product is

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.780 
consideration with this product is
designed<00:02:01.660> to<00:02:02.140> fit<00:02:02.440> any<00:02:02.800> of<00:02:02.980> the<00:02:03.520> Mister

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
designed to fit any of the Mister

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.270 
designed to fit any of the Mister
Twister<00:02:03.970> motor<00:02:04.540> heads<00:02:04.870> so<00:02:05.830> one<00:02:05.980> of<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.130> good

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
Twister motor heads so one of the good

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.270 
Twister motor heads so one of the good
things<00:02:06.490> about<00:02:06.670> this<00:02:06.940> is<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:08.470> pan<00:02:08.830> fatigue

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
things about this is the pan fatigue

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.580 
things about this is the pan fatigue
that<00:02:09.460> you<00:02:09.610> would<00:02:09.760> normally<00:02:10.180> get<00:02:10.360> with<00:02:10.570> a<00:02:10.600> spoon

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
that you would normally get with a spoon

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.030 
that you would normally get with a spoon
process<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:13.300> can<00:02:13.480> run<00:02:13.660> through<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:14.230> hundred

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
process you can run through a hundred

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.640 
process you can run through a hundred
fish<00:02:15.280> so<00:02:15.970> with<00:02:16.150> this<00:02:16.270> process<00:02:16.540> you'll<00:02:17.410> never

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
fish so with this process you'll never

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.130 
fish so with this process you'll never
get<00:02:17.860> tired<00:02:18.100> love<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.210> benefit<00:02:19.630> that<00:02:19.660> you<00:02:19.810> have

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
get tired love the benefit that you have

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.830 
get tired love the benefit that you have
the<00:02:20.410> speed<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.640> scaling<00:02:22.090> process<00:02:22.300> with

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
the speed of the scaling process with

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.560 
the speed of the scaling process with
the<00:02:22.930> easy<00:02:23.200> scaler<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.770> also<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.880> ease<00:02:25.540> of

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
the easy scaler and also the ease of

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.360 
the easy scaler and also the ease of
having<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:26.110> knife<00:02:26.290> built<00:02:26.710> into<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.160> same

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
having the knife built into the same

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.370 
having the knife built into the same
thing<00:02:27.670> so<00:02:27.970> it's<00:02:28.120> just<00:02:28.270> one<00:02:28.540> fluid<00:02:28.810> motion

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
thing so it's just one fluid motion

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:40.910 
thing so it's just one fluid motion
to<00:02:29.710> be<00:02:29.860> able<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.190> make<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.580> work<00:02:31.180> quickly

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.630 

as<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:42.420> fisherman<00:02:43.020> myself<00:02:43.200> I'm<00:02:43.740> skeptical<00:02:44.520> of

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
as a fisherman myself I'm skeptical of

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.490 
as a fisherman myself I'm skeptical of
most<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.120> latest<00:02:45.390> greatest<00:02:45.599> devices<00:02:46.110> that

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
most of the latest greatest devices that

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.260 
most of the latest greatest devices that
you<00:02:46.590> hear<00:02:46.800> about<00:02:46.890> but<00:02:47.520> when<00:02:47.640> we<00:02:47.730> grabbed<00:02:48.060> our

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
you hear about but when we grabbed our
