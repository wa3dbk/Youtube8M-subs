00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello youtube friends here we are with 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.189
 a new video of errors and curiosities 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.590
 of challenge champions in toca and without more 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.360
 preamble let's start with the video hey 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.180
 you did not tell me I was going to 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.210
 send greetings to a subscriber of yours is 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.030
 true I almost forgot it thanks bz for 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.800
 remember me already silly very well 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:27.370
 Subscriber I want to send greetings 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:31.310
 it's called vicente or ses rÃ­os 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:34.010
 nothing better than living life with your very 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:37.930
 well I already sent greetings now starts to 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.410
 tell the curiosities is fine 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.110
 for you I become a poet 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.540
 very good the popcorn you have here 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.730
 is a reference to those popcorn is 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.210
 say that there really are those 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.330
 popcorn popcorn calls 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.020
 I can not anymore 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.960
 will be the only 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.210
 where will I get 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.219
 another curiosity is that it takes 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.230
 beginning of the series I just wanted to do 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.369
 of the clown until he discovered his 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.369
 feelings for chloe 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.200
 very well this is not a curiosity anymore 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.360
 well a theory what what z and I learned 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.730
 we saw that the lower parts of the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.980
 containers look as if they had 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.290
 ripped off the ground so we 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.510
 we thought that the inhabitants already had 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.160
 expected the arrival of the winches so 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.990
 what they came up with was to create a 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.720
 mechanism that lifted the containers 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.730
 in so when the force arrived not 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.130
 they got their in and when the 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.840
 they are only found few on the ground 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.600
 so they are with their high technology 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.970
 caught several vessels in floating 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.310
 and they also spotted several soldiers and 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.530
 ships protecting the containers like this 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.950
 that his only alternative was to send 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.950
 breast where 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.380
 hey he feared dying 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.870
 another curiosity is that the breast where 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.180
 is very similar to the one that came out in the 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.160
 the avengers as both were created 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.370
 by aliens and they were sent to 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.140
 encroach 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.030
 another curiosity is how much can 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.860
 fly a ship very well could pilot 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.650
 this one and the one he used to escape the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.079
 zombies 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.930
 already when he learned the shot sets in 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:22.299
 when he pointed to something it looked red this 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.310
 it may be a mistake or since it is barely 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.260
 learning how to use it does not send 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.769
 completely its half of the sena its 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.769
 objective 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.940
 He also castles and is one of the few 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.830
 series that makes you think about trying that 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.850
 be a good person since in several 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.610
 chapters give you positive messages 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.400
 it's not because of the ship today it's the birthday 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.010
 of my wife's mother and had a dinner 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.880
 of family 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.819
 I could not miss 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:57.450
 quiet they know you wanted to go 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.549
 you will understand hey bz you did not leave me anything 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.889
 in saying this chapter shut up you 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.870
 you said that I would say the curiosities and 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:07.739
 you the errors and since we do not find 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.930
 no error if good point very well 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.909
 now to say curiosity good this is 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.829
 It makes me weird because that policeman walks 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:16.620
 above the tree 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:19.200
 arresting squirrels 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.209
 this legendary warrior passed it to 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.549
 club and not your partner maybe because 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.590
 both are blue and also although they are 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.450
 legendary warriors play at the same 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.980
 rhythm that the centers since in their 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.290
 youth were better 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.480
 another curiosity is that the only thing 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.640
 can overcome a vision since osen is the 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.870
 chloe speed as it was faster 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.870
 that the legendary warrior 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.740
 even so 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.890
 the border has arrived 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:01.700
 Now it 's very good now, it's already my turn 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.739
 in saying the mistakes 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.140
 the first mistake is that chloe is 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.099
 goes the ball but masterfully the ball 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.099
 appears with salt 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.900
 if the space dust 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.290
 but just 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.330
 and that to sing 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.670
 the other mistake is that the trick 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.140
 policeman appears looking at his hand but 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.140
 then look at his head 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:34.199
 while my records 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.300
 Another mistake is the change of places of 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.300
 the legendary warriors first 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:45.750
 appears with then the rose then the 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.860
 deaf and back the blue one is a matter and 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.860
 the rose change places 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.690
 the last mistake is that when they put 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:58.229
 the first carlos you feel magically 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.229
 the study disappears 

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:06.590
 in the attempt 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.020
 well that was all you have something that 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.480
 add peseta if my social networks 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.150
 they are in the description of the good video 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.880
 Anyway, I do not want to go through all that 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.860
