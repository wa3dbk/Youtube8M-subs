00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.500
 hwangboel d'Ontario YAY ONTARIO MY NATAL PROVINCE has asked the question 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.410
 What are some of the things in the culture that you have not yet adapted for as long as you try. 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.640
 I AM FIRST! I know what I want to talk about. 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.540
 OK, it goes. 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.340
 Okay. Korea We have to talk 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.860
 Get closer 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.050
 A little closer 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.480
 Come on, a little closer, this is already too close, get out a bit. 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.190
 Well Korea, if you do not know it yet, we'll love you. 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.400
 You are a great country. We feel very confident here. 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.980
 In the middle of the night we can walk through the Central Park 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.840
 And the worst thing we'll see will be two people playing badminton. 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.160
 So we feel very confident here and we love it. 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.060
 BUT ... the only thing we can not get used to is when it dangerously led. 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.960
 Oh yeah 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.560
 In fact, if you're a pedestrian, you should avoid being hit by how 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.580
 Taxis and buses jumping off the red lights. 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.880
 Or if you drive a car - in our case a scooter 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.080
 You have to avoid being hit by people who do not look through the rearview mirror 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.680
 It's like, it's usually a trap. 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.890
 The red traffic lights here are rather suggestions than laws. 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.050
 I assure you, just go to a crossroads and see for a couple of minutes 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.760
 You will see a few scooters and a few buses, even a few taxis 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.250
 jumping red traffic lights according to your convenience. 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.370
 We do not joke when we say this: 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.480
 you have to look at both corners to cross the street, 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.380
 EVERYTHING it is only one direction. 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.610
 Because people will drive along the street they want. 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.600
 Mounts for Korea: Please try to kill me. 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.990
 I do not joke here: I feel in danger when I go outside. 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.240
 I'll tell you a funny thing: we have our scooter for 2 years already, 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.840
 and it is very easy to get a scooter permit in Korea, 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.750
 but to get it in Canada 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.860
 You have to pass many different levels and tests 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.760
 And I feel like telling the instructors, "there is no test that you can give me 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.080
 that is to the dangers to which I have planted face 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.610
 while driving my scooter. Your small closed circuits DO NOT SIGN UP! " 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.230
 Well I feel like I was on a Frogger level against Duke Nukem. 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.620
 And in fact I think that inside the buses it is worse than outside them, 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.620
 I do not know about this, 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.550
 Well I used to take the bus before having the scooter, 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.750
 And when you enter the bus you have to chop 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.620
 And, how, run, and stick to a bar 

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.960
 because the driver will continue, 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.460
 It's like an INDY 500 racer, and you'll run across the bus side. 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.660
 We have been on buses where an elderly woman has got on the bus 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.890
 and before he sat on the bus he started 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.590
 and she, like, ended up falling to the ground 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.300
 And he's so disrespectful and scared and we really do not like it. 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.930
 Yes, I took, like, three large women who almost ate the earth 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.230
 so...! FA POR! They came out to kill me! 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.340
 Korea: good country, very nice people: not very good driving. 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.450
 I remember when I was a child in Canada, 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.860
 When you were learning how to get in line for something, hanging was a great ptoblema. 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.780
 I mean, if someone tried it in front of you, 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.900
 YOU HAVE COLAT! YOU HAVE COLAT! MATEU-LO! MATEU 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.590
 This process of the line we learned from small 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.800
 It does not seem to be applied to Korea, 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.630
 You are waiting in line for the bus on a summer day [HOT HOT SUMMER] 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.500
 for about 20 minutes or so, in a straight line, 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.330
 everything goes well, and oh! The bus is approaching! 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.550
 Oh, look! There is a Korean that appears in 30 seconds 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.430
 And it's like "IS THE BUS?" and glue before everyone 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.140
 and walk in there because the bus stopped in front of her. 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.060
 This is how my face looks like: 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.980
 MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEe 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.480
 Now this is not only for buses. It is also seen by metro: 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.710
 If you're not getting into the subway when it arrives 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.010
 People will get caught. 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.770
 Well, we have learned a new technique to combat this. 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.280
 It's called defense. 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.500
 Have you ever played basketball? Do you need to take a bounce? 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.620
 What you have to do is snag a little, 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.430
 open your legs, stretch your arms 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.150
 and make a small fence so that people will not approach you 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.860
 Now since Martina and I come together, it's a lot easier 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.280
 because we can close the two together 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.110
 And nobody will get caught! 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.920
 But we feel a bit ridiculous for having to do it, 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.150
 But what you have to do to survive is done! 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.150
 There is a dangerous world out there. 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.860
 So that's all for TL; DR this week. 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.280
 If there is any question that you want us to answer for next week, 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.280
 go to our moderator Gogole 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.110
 and leave the question in the questions section. 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.400
 Or, if you do not want to leave a question 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.220
 you can vote up or down the questions that you like 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.810
 and hopefully we will respond to them the following week. 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:08.260
 Huzzah! 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.750
 Defense! 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.040
 GONG! 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.706
