00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:04.380
 well I'm going to show you the montage of a nymph 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.470
 Red head 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.339
 the red-headed pearl 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:10.889
 mounted on a hook 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.549
 time of him 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.099
 times and the number 14 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:16.400
 what 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.400
 It usually gives good results very well 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:26.560
 with talent and 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.560
 Dublin from season to hare's ear 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.670
 we put some butts behind 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.330
 of your mother 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.330
 of gállego 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.940
 Red Haze Plagiarism 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.190
 and we put a little bit of how 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.400
 chamartín 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.130
 of half of the seatpost of the methodology the milo lead head 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.400
 finite 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.600
 It is a fly that does not require you to go deep because we are going to 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.600
 fish with them atutxa sight 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.550
 we are before a chavista when they were these trout was wrong 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.420
 so resabiadas 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.110
 not 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.690
 they ignore the fly 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.150
 that we are throwing to him then we put him in that he puts that he is in 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.870
 infama 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.870
 that usually gives very good results 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.220
 we put a 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.220
 a copper thread to form a small jump 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.560
 and they are not rolling the dub inc 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.920
 imitation hare ear 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.190
 in Dublin 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.190
 that I like a lot 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.220
 it's a dive 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.460
 without 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.310
 from the corro 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.150
 mendia of the hare 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.720
 purito 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.920
 with many glitters 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.319
 and we are going to put up there 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.749
 we are not going to put much 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:15.109
 then sixth and we leave a space 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:18.109
 between the body and the head of the fly 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.749
 Rollo Morla jumps 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.469
 it's a sample and I tell you that 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.469
 for these trout are resabiadas 

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:45.040
 what are we going to do is talk 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.899
 with a pen 

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:50.899
 of pheasant 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:54.759
 it is very natural 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:57.759
 to the nymph 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:04.929
 we hold 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.750
 We measure the distance and there we are pretty good 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.459
 by putting the same dublin to form the thorax 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:24.199
 she is a very simple nymph 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.999
 and very fishermen 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:28.999
 we make it a little more bulky readers than the body 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:32.029
 sections for alante 

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:34.239
 the fibers of 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.239
 faisal 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.959
 and subject moss 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.059
 you're the final mode 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:47.059
 we are what we have left 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:53.289
 that's why we have to spare 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:01.309
 day we give ourselves 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:08.259
 we make the final world 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:11.889
 we already have the fly ready to fish the letter mus a little 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.129
 if we get a little bit the experts 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:17.989
 the dublin percent 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.989
 The thorax 

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:25.849
 we throw ourselves down and we equal 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.849
 with the scissors 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:32.759
 and the fly would have it ready 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.110
 for fishing 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.740
 it would be like that 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.039
 we are silent vigo 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.330
 of is very good 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
 fishing nation especially for trout that 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.830
 that will be resabiadas 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.900
 you can see 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.309
 ride it 

00:04:51.309 --> 00:04:52.919
 that will give you the results
