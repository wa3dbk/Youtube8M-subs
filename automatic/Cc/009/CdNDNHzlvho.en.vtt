00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
these four mounts I'm not sure if

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.250 
these four mounts I'm not sure if
they'll<00:01:15.380> change<00:01:15.710> this<00:01:16.010> because<00:01:16.970> you<00:01:17.960> can<00:01:18.170> only

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
they'll change this because you can only

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.900 
they'll change this because you can only
get<00:01:18.500> this<00:01:18.619> two<00:01:18.890> at<00:01:19.040> once<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:19.550> can<00:01:19.760> only

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
get this two at once so you can only

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.030 
get this two at once so you can only
obviously<00:01:20.720> get<00:01:20.930> one<00:01:21.229> of<00:01:21.410> the<00:01:21.560> Emmaus

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
obviously get one of the Emmaus

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.550 
obviously get one of the Emmaus
it<00:01:22.100> doesn't<00:01:22.729> say<00:01:22.850> mounts<00:01:23.210> it<00:01:23.330> says<00:01:23.509> mount<00:01:23.869> so

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
it doesn't say mounts it says mount so

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.800 
it doesn't say mounts it says mount so
that's<00:01:25.310> what<00:01:25.490> I'm<00:01:25.580> taking<00:01:25.880> it<00:01:25.970> as<00:01:26.090> that<00:01:26.479> you

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
that's what I'm taking it as that you

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.770 
that's what I'm taking it as that you
can<00:01:26.960> only<00:01:27.110> get<00:01:27.350> one<00:01:28.330> so<00:01:29.330> you're<00:01:29.540> going<00:01:29.660> to<00:01:29.690> have

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780
