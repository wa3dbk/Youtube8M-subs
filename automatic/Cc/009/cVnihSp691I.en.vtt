closer to top 10 but I'm getting closer
to<00:03:21.950> that<00:03:22.070> breakthrough<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:22.790> today<00:03:23.000> was<00:03:23.239> the

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
to that breakthrough and today was the

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.740 
to that breakthrough and today was the
first<00:03:24.080> step<00:03:24.380> in<00:03:24.620> making<00:03:24.890> that<00:03:25.220> gap<00:03:25.750> closing

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
first step in making that gap closing

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.510 
first step in making that gap closing
down<00:03:26.840> that<00:03:27.050> gap<00:03:27.230> early<00:03:27.709> and<00:03:27.890> now<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.070> need<00:03:28.340> to

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
down that gap early and now I need to

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.000 
down that gap early and now I need to
just<00:03:28.820> extend<00:03:29.120> that

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
just extend that

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.040 
just extend that
I<00:03:32.060> hit<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.150> ball<00:03:33.300> pretty<00:03:33.330> badly

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.660 
I spend really give you 15 miles and
then<00:03:36.270> around<00:03:36.540> 16<00:03:37.440> or<00:03:37.560> 17<00:03:37.920> my<00:03:38.070> likes<00:03:38.250> are<00:03:38.430> today

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
then around 16 or 17 my likes are today

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.150 
then around 16 or 17 my likes are today
just<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:39.000> little<00:03:39.030> bit<00:03:39.590> 18<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.740> wheels<00:03:40.890> started

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
just a little bit 18 the wheels started

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.430 
just a little bit 18 the wheels started
falling<00:03:41.340> off<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:41.910> then<00:03:42.000> 20<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:42.930> got<00:03:43.050> out<00:03:43.230> of<00:03:43.320> 8

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
falling off and then 20 you got out of 8

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.370 
falling off and then 20 you got out of 8
22<00:03:44.040> is<00:03:44.190> even<00:03:44.400> uglier<00:03:44.670> 24<00:03:45.570> was<00:03:45.870> worse<00:03:46.080> than<00:03:46.230> that

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
22 is even uglier 24 was worse than that

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.490 
22 is even uglier 24 was worse than that
so<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:47.280> is<00:03:47.520> pretty<00:03:47.850> brutal<00:03:48.000> by<00:03:48.210> the<00:03:48.270> end<00:03:48.510> but<00:03:48.750> no

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
so it is pretty brutal by the end but no

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.320 
so it is pretty brutal by the end but no
