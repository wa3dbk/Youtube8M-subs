instrument is that you want to and it's

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.720 
instrument is that you want to and it's
a<00:02:58.169> way<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.349> express<00:02:58.739> yourself<00:02:58.889> and<00:02:59.280> it's<00:02:59.430> fun

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
a way you express yourself and it's fun

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.339 
a way you express yourself and it's fun
and<00:03:00.889> you<00:03:01.889> know<00:03:02.430> external<00:03:03.239> success<00:03:03.719> and

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
and you know external success and

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.339 
and you know external success and
approval<00:03:04.739> from<00:03:04.769> other<00:03:05.069> people<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.669> secondary

approval from other people is secondary

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.409 
approval from other people is secondary
ultimately<00:03:07.349> at<00:03:08.129> least<00:03:08.340> for<00:03:08.639> me<00:03:08.730> if<00:03:08.969> you<00:03:09.120> really

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:09.419 
ultimately at least for me if you really

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:10.909 
ultimately at least for me if you really
want<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.870> pick<00:03:09.989> up<00:03:10.079> an<00:03:10.200> instrument<00:03:10.379> just<00:03:10.739> to
