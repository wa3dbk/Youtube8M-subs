00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.850
 microsoft recently announced the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.310
 arrival of windows phone 8.1 new version 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.000
 system with many new features 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.130
 your users the update has been released 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.859
 last week through the project 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.320
 predicted for developers us of the world 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.660
 we had the opportunity to test all 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.370
 that microsoft has prepared to make the 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.850
 windows phone an even more system 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.219
 competitive with the android and 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.290
 will the news be able to 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.460
 make the system more eye-catching 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.910
 of the public 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:53.640
 know in our analysis the answer 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.070
 from Microsoft to the islands called cortana is 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.160
 perhaps one of the most commented functions 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.710
 windows phone 8.1 with just a few 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.449
 minutes of use it is possible to notice that it 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.000
 can combine the advantages of 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.630
 google nal assistant in 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.299
 only one element cut into the inspired 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:20.970
 in the hailu series character and even 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:22.890
 is dubbed by the same christo assistant 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.490
 gathers your information to 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.979
 submit news schedule appointments 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.659
 report travel and other things 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.659
 all through voice commands 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.850
 still in beta agreeing on opera 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.360
 only in English which can discourage 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:47.939
 some people who do not speak the language 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:50.130
 goto low here but if you can 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.720
 pronounce some ready-made phrases 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.600
 the system identifies the voice of the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.740
 user even when loaded with strong 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.680
 show mix accent is more top with 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.810
 cortiana you can book appointments 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.479
 search the internet and select 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.340
 from the library to listen in addition to 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:15.190
 answer simple questions 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.610
 play break kiss in the mouth between who 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.610
 sell it 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.440
 the only problem is that she can not 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.510
 identify very well addresses 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.670
 Brazilians because it is still focused on 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.769
 public of the united states 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.730
 this impairs its function of indicating 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.379
 directions 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.129
 through the maps application of the 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.129
 windows phone 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.910
 Nevertheless, it is possible to note that the 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.019
 microsoft worked hard on the application 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.360
 getting him to stay in 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.750
 on a par with crab and google in the 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.730
 or even in its beta version, but 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.680
 company filled the cut at distributech 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:05.920
 for you to spend a lot of time doing 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:08.260
 questions and requests one of the 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.910
 functions most requested by the owners of the 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.630
 windows phone finally became a 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.480
 reality in version 8.1 to microsoft 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.030
 presented the center a center of action 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.160
 notifications to the system 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.790
 also improve the timing with which 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.090
 notifications are displayed on your phone 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.160
 You do not have to wait anywhere from 15 to 30 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.530
 minutes to be advised that you received a 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.620
 message as it appears in the same 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.380
 when it was now sent with 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.269
 a simple pass finger on the screen you can 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.700
 view all notifications received 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.739
 and it is possible to configure which 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.579
 applications and services 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:50.500
 information in this area 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.340
 although it is a common function in other 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.709
 systems 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.750
 the arrival of the notification center to the 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.700
 windows phone fills one of the big 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.250
 gaps microsoft had in relation to 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.760
 the system leaving it closer to the 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.760
 your competitors 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.959
 since windows phone 7 microsoft has 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:10.510
 bet on a different look for the 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.599
 your system using blocks instead of 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.489
 and colors on your home screen but 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.799
 many users still lacked 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.260
 to put a custom wallpaper 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.450
 on their devices with the new update 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.820
 from windows phone this 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.910
 lived by applying any image 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.410
 the equipment stays transparent 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.000
 giving you the chance to customize the screen 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.280
 the way you do well 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.230
 understand 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.270
 even some applications that by 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.700
 pattern has colored background in its 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.770
 trailers like music is not twitter 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.050
 are transparent and that it is still 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.790
 You need to reorganize your apps 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.380
 not to have a strange image 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.930
 on the screen 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.450
 maybe this will be updated in the future 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.850
 but for now the result is still 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.440
 a little weird 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.750
 another novelty is that you can also 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.330
 increase the number of such on your screen 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.690
 something that was possible only in 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.820
 appliances with large screens 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.160
 now even smartphones with displays 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.410
 less than four inches may have 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:16.030
 more israel lines to customize 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:18.520
 the device despite bringing in three large 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.410
 windows phone 8.1 news too 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.630
 shows some changes in functions 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.460
 which were already part of the system and 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.330
 only leaving it more complete than 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.690
 Never 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:31.660
 the keyboard now has the workflow one 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.820
 Windows Phone Swap Type Only 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.310
 passing the finger through the letters causes 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.470
 words are formed with 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.270
 the result is not satisfactory you 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.330
 can write a few times the way 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.000
 and the system learns over time. 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:48.100
 showing exactly what you want 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.710
 this means that the more you use 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.180
 the better it gets 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.850
 another novelty are the different 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.260
 storage and battery management 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.510
 data plan 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:00.340
 now you can check which 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.910
 application is consuming more power 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.980
 it is possible to deactivate it itself 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.990
 system tries to save your 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:10.210
 data on the internet if it is 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:14.020
 coming to an end and you still have many 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:16.120
 days until it is renewed but the function 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.590
 that can please more people is 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.630
 related to the 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.520
 storage that allows you to 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.460
 install applications and save files 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.290
 downloaded inep directly to your card 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.550
 of memory without any type of 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.830
 gambiarra 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.720
 this way you can increase 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.760
 considerably the number of programs 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.760
 installed on your windows phone 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.760
 the impression that it takes some time to 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.070
 use of windows phone 8.1 is that the 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.810
 microsoft has decided to take all the good 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:53.090
 ideas presented in the versions 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.820
 to make everything a reality. 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:58.480
 in a practical way and that does not cause 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:00.560
 the system loses its identity 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.530
 filling some gaps in relation to 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.750
 functions that required the growing 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:07.580
 number of important applications and the 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.230
 price of equipment equipped with the 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.350
 system seems to microsoft 

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:14.750
 finally ceases to be the ugly duckling and 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:17.630
 below its level to hit the 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.490
 google and apple in the smartphone market 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.920
 in the end who wins is 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.510
 the consumer 

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:26.840
 to read the full windows scan 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:29.200
 8.1 access the internet and up to 

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.200
 next
