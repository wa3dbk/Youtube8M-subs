00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.709
 I 'm not 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.639
 hello to all friends of experience now 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:15.070
 today we are in company 9 Oct for 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.930
 unboxing as always thank you gloss 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.140
 shop always very available for 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.699
 sending these samples then we open 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.289
 the packaging this terminal that 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:26.669
 I was really curious to try that 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.279
 had hit the mobile world congress 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.810
 here is to put aside a moment 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.060
 in the package we see a little thing 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.860
 we find if I can open it a 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:43.060
 wall power supply without being with 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.210
 exit from a pearl and a half then good 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:50.800
 obviously they also give us packaging 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:53.500
 the adapter for Italian sockets let's say 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.370
 Italian hottest downstairs we have 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.890
 one usb usb micro hunter cable 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.190
 flat tangle here manual manuals 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.520
 and the paper clip to open the slot for the 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.150
 sim for the micro sd the terminal now 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.150
 we see 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:14.130
 here it is, we immediately see the slots as 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:18.280
 I'm supposed to be dual sim 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:22.210
 let's see here we have double sim format 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:26.490
 micro the first goes in 4g inside 4g e 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.330
 as an expansion for the memory 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.100
 beautiful with the phone we go to 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.840
 removing this is no water 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.610
 there is no pre-applied film 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.380
 which is not a film at the moment is one 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.400
 his film with the best of it 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.350
 anything else we leave super moment 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.670
 we turn on while it turns on as always 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.360
 leaves you quite the video 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.869
 share it and subscribe to the channel 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.270
 we speak of dimensions 14 12 cm 7 cm e 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.780
 therefore a thickness of 7.3 mm 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.119
 thin 145 grams average weight from 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.920
 a good sense of solidity always in hand 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:06.810
 really well puts forward method 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.220
 behind the 5-inch full hd display 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.730
 ips gorilla glass 3 400 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:17.720
 pixar inch the processor is a 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.540
 qualcomm snapdragon 615 oracle assad a 4 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:25.670
 bit a something a jig plus a quad 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:28.000
 recalls 1.7 ghz with adreno 405 GPU 3 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.710
 gigabyte of ram internal olive tent 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.900
 expandable 16 megapixel camera 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.730
 with autofocus triple flash led and here 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.260
 it must be a focusing system 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:45.200
 kind of from asia see a little how he did it 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.459
 very well going this band 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.610
 let's do that now I'm going to remove 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:54.770
 also the film that our best 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:03:00.140
 here is really beautiful in my opinion 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:01.430
 as a phone here now I call what is 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.680
 here we have a button for shooting 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.050
 however up to technical fly 8 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.820
 anterior megapixel 2,900 milian for the 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:12.709
 battery that as I said is a dual sim 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:18.230
 leave be soft touch is a 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:19.970
 option back now we have one 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.370
 pretty sad sun bolelli background 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.959
 screwed call later we go 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.610
 directly in the settings for 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:34.840
 see information on the phone 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:37.959
 android 5.0.2 device praises like you don't 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:42.320
 he takes memorial lies and so on 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.040
 we see a box and keys do not need room 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.930
 on Youtube 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.580
 ok promo the simple model so we have 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.480
 we said in his frame that it is 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.890
 the strong point of this device a 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.420
 leaving daita simple with this 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:05.840
 casting of the goat, and we all 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:07.970
 settings very much taken up by julia anyway 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.269
 especially virtually identical 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.519
 white balance and so on 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.910
 sorry, even here we have keys 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.810
 Select what about what about what to ge 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.780
 no then manual iso focus 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.560
 exposure 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.560
 I don't understand that 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:34.270
 we are here if in every 4 f cell 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:36.010
 maximum resolution 16 megapixel photos from 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.440
 photo viper fine etcetera 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.150
 in short, we will see better how it works 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.210
 maybe this camera will do a test 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.100
 more thorough than the usual brightness 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.350
 maximum now is now maximum is not 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.630
 very high but there is an applied film 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.330
 basically that is opaque so maybe it goes 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.860
 to lower the brightness a little 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.930
 however, I am still showing you a moment well 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:02.950
 before south and obviously beautiful 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:07.540
 very similar aluminum slopes to that 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:10.390
 of iphone 5 so here seems to line 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.010
 almost satire and nice satin here 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.820
 we loved dancing I can't say 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:19.830
 instead they are from stereo speakers 1 and 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.830
 microphone god always in the review 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:26.350
 the whole union headphones second microphone 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.920
 rate for double stroke camera 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.180
 obviously white ignition and all the 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.500
 we also have the notification led 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.140
 then a phone with a card 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.240
 really interesting technique is a 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.770
 camera phone but not overdone 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.480
 absolutely looks like a smartphone 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.760
 normal that actually is focusing on 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:46.210
 camera the back according to me is 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.730
 something really great me 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.020
 I remember seeing mauro congress with 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.940
 this phone also a flash 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.720
 particular that they sell separately 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.910
 then we'll see if john july always at 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.440
 tensions he had next week 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.880
 never 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.340
 if you have bad details before 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.500
 review me and then in the comments here 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.810
 below and with the aic noi makes us close 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.930
 video a greeting from valence to never think 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.930
 Hello
