00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
what's up guys next take care and I'm

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.280 
what's up guys next take care and I'm
going<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.669> be<00:00:02.760> checking<00:00:03.120> out<00:00:03.179> modern<00:00:03.600> combat<00:00:03.870> 4

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
going to be checking out modern combat 4

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.000 
going to be checking out modern combat 4
on<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:05.490> Nexus<00:00:05.970> 7<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:06.649> straight<00:00:07.649> away<00:00:07.799> I've

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
on the Nexus 7 and straight away I've

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.250 
on the Nexus 7 and straight away I've
noticed<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.460> difference<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:09.480> thought<00:00:09.990> on<00:00:10.230> my

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
noticed the difference I thought on my

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.080 
noticed the difference I thought on my
other<00:00:10.500> two<00:00:10.740> devices<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.370> Nexus<00:00:11.700> telling<00:00:12.000> the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
other two devices the Nexus telling the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.270 
other two devices the Nexus telling the
nexus<00:00:12.450> 4<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.080> was<00:00:13.259> running<00:00:13.679> at<00:00:13.830> its<00:00:13.860> full

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
nexus 4 that it was running at its full

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.990 
nexus 4 that it was running at its full
graphic<00:00:14.700> settings<00:00:14.969> I<00:00:15.360> just<00:00:15.960> assumed<00:00:16.320> it<00:00:16.440> was

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
graphic settings I just assumed it was

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.849 
graphic settings I just assumed it was
but<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.029> seems<00:00:18.359> like<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.750> Tegra<00:00:19.170> 3<00:00:19.199> chip<00:00:19.680> in

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
but it seems like the Tegra 3 chip in

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.130 
but it seems like the Tegra 3 chip in
here<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.460> enabling<00:00:21.029> some<00:00:21.270> extra<00:00:21.570> settings<00:00:21.930> and

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
here is enabling some extra settings and

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.349 
here is enabling some extra settings and
I'll<00:00:22.260> do<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.439> comparison<00:00:22.949> video<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.430> show<00:00:23.609> but

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
I'll do a comparison video to show but

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.650 
I'll do a comparison video to show but
the<00:00:24.990> menu<00:00:25.439> didn't<00:00:26.160> have<00:00:26.369> these<00:00:26.670> flame<00:00:27.060> effects

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
the menu didn't have these flame effects

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.140 
the menu didn't have these flame effects
on<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.109> other<00:00:28.260> two<00:00:28.500> versions<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.340> there<00:00:30.029> was

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
on the other two versions so there was

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.240 
on the other two versions so there was
obviously<00:00:30.269> some<00:00:30.810> extra<00:00:31.320> effects<00:00:31.740> going<00:00:32.009> on

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
obviously some extra effects going on

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.569 
obviously some extra effects going on
here<00:00:33.320> which<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.500> never<00:00:34.559> really<00:00:35.070> understand

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
here which I never really understand

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.430 
here which I never really understand
because<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.120> other<00:00:36.239> two<00:00:36.510> have<00:00:36.809> probably

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
because the other two have probably

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.580 
because the other two have probably
better<00:00:37.770> GPUs<00:00:38.840> but<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:40.050> because<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.440> is

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
better GPUs but just because this is

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.250 
better GPUs but just because this is
Tegra<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.219> goes<00:00:41.399> ahead<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:42.000> activate<00:00:42.870> some

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
Tegra it goes ahead and activate some

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.470 
Tegra it goes ahead and activate some
more<00:00:43.440> effects<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:44.370> I'm<00:00:44.520> armed<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.149> percent

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
more effects that I'm armed a percent

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.240 
more effects that I'm armed a percent
sure<00:00:45.719> my<00:00:45.899> nexus<00:00:46.379> 4<00:00:46.620> could<00:00:46.800> handle<00:00:47.100> because

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
sure my nexus 4 could handle because

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.760 
sure my nexus 4 could handle because
that<00:00:47.489> was<00:00:47.610> playing<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.500> stupidly<00:00:49.500> smooth<00:00:51.770> but

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
that was playing it stupidly smooth but

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.520 
that was playing it stupidly smooth but
yeah<00:00:53.039> that's<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.960> let's<00:00:54.960> check<00:00:55.140> out<00:00:55.320> what<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
yeah that's a let's check out what the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.799 
yeah that's a let's check out what the
nexus<00:00:55.829> 7<00:00:56.160> can<00:00:56.340> do<00:00:56.460> I'm<00:00:56.789> actually<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.780> my

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
nexus 7 can do I'm actually this is my

nexus 7 can do I'm actually this is my
favorite<00:00:58.410> tablet<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.280> game<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.670> just<00:01:00.000> because

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
favorite tablet to game on just because

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.510 
favorite tablet to game on just because
of<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> size<00:01:00.780> right<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.800> easily<00:01:01.949> hold<00:01:02.280> it

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
of the size right I can easily hold it

lot of the screen and it's just such a
nice<00:01:07.799> form<00:01:08.189> factor<00:01:08.610> for<00:01:08.790> gaming<00:01:09.150> it's<00:01:09.360> it's

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
nice form factor for gaming it's it's

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.130 
nice form factor for gaming it's it's
amazing<00:01:10.320> really<00:01:10.880> so<00:01:11.880> yeah<00:01:12.060> skin<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.510> here

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
amazing really so yeah skin to it here

amazing really so yeah skin to it here
we<00:01:13.229> go<00:01:16.850> we'll<00:01:17.850> skip<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.180> video

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.940 

ok

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:42.270 

and<00:01:33.399> okay<00:01:34.399> so<00:01:34.460> it's<00:01:36.969> it's<00:01:37.969> okay<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:38.659> far<00:01:39.350> the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.100 

performance<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:43.520> can<00:01:43.789> see<00:01:44.030> here<00:01:44.270> it's<00:01:44.899> not

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
performance you can see here it's not

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.800 
performance you can see here it's not
buttery<00:01:45.619> smooth<00:01:46.039> but<00:01:46.310> it's<00:01:46.460> not<00:01:46.810> overly

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
buttery smooth but it's not overly

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.460 
buttery smooth but it's not overly
horribly<00:01:48.770> slow<00:01:49.179> it<00:01:50.179> is<00:01:50.689> running<00:01:50.929> more<00:01:51.140> effects

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
horribly slow it is running more effects

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.709 
horribly slow it is running more effects
that<00:01:51.679> flame<00:01:52.039> isn't<00:01:52.759> there<00:01:53.000> in<00:01:53.270> my<00:01:53.539> other

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
that flame isn't there in my other

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.959 
that flame isn't there in my other
versions<00:01:54.289> so<00:01:54.950> there<00:01:55.100> are<00:01:55.219> obviously<00:01:55.880> some

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
versions so there are obviously some

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:57.760 
versions so there are obviously some
tape<00:01:56.390> with<00:01:56.569> three<00:01:56.750> effectors<00:01:57.229> going<00:01:57.500> on<00:01:57.649> in

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
tape with three effectors going on in

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.059 
tape with three effectors going on in
this<00:01:57.860> game<00:01:59.259> so<00:02:00.259> I<00:02:00.319> was<00:02:00.500> wrong<00:02:00.710> in<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:00.950> other

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
this game so I was wrong in the other

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.289 
this game so I was wrong in the other
videos<00:02:01.399> when<00:02:01.579> I<00:02:01.640> said<00:02:01.819> they're<00:02:01.939> running<00:02:02.210> their

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
videos when I said they're running their

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.270 
videos when I said they're running their
full<00:02:02.659> graphics<00:02:03.170> because<00:02:03.319> obviously<00:02:03.679> is<00:02:04.039> some

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
full graphics because obviously is some

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.639 
full graphics because obviously is some
other<00:02:04.429> settings<00:02:05.149> there<00:02:05.330> can<00:02:05.599> do<00:02:08.380> but<00:02:09.380> again

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
other settings there can do but again

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.740 
other settings there can do but again
this<00:02:09.890> is<00:02:09.950> what<00:02:10.910> there's<00:02:11.269> definitely<00:02:11.540> more

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
this is what there's definitely more

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.199 
this is what there's definitely more
effects<00:02:12.110> going<00:02:12.319> on<00:02:12.530> more<00:02:12.829> few<00:02:13.310> extra<00:02:14.000> lens

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
effects going on more few extra lens

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.390 
effects going on more few extra lens
flares<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:14.750> things<00:02:14.930> like<00:02:15.049> that<00:02:15.110> in<00:02:15.829> terms<00:02:16.250> of

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
flares and things like that in terms of

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.699 
flares and things like that in terms of
its<00:02:16.549> performance<00:02:17.239> I'm<00:02:17.959> sure<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.349> can<00:02:18.500> see

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
its performance I'm sure you can see

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.300 
its performance I'm sure you can see
that<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.950> frames<00:02:19.250> aren't<00:02:19.910> as<00:02:20.030> high<00:02:20.360> as<00:02:21.140> say<00:02:22.130> my

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
that the frames aren't as high as say my

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.259 
that the frames aren't as high as say my
nexus<00:02:22.760> 4<00:02:23.260> but<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.620> haven't<00:02:25.340> noticed<00:02:25.579> any<00:02:25.910> major

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
nexus 4 but I haven't noticed any major

nexus 4 but I haven't noticed any major
frame<00:02:27.200> drops<00:02:27.620> either<00:02:28.040> likes<00:02:28.750> like<00:02:29.750> a<00:02:29.930> load<00:02:30.230> of

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
frame drops either likes like a load of

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.870 
frame drops either likes like a load of
frame<00:02:30.620> drops<00:02:30.890> all<00:02:31.040> at<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.220> same<00:02:31.370> time<00:02:31.430> is

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
frame drops all at the same time is

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.120 
frame drops all at the same time is
staying<00:02:32.420> constantly<00:02:33.079> around<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.590> same<00:02:33.769> frame

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
staying constantly around the same frame

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:48.770 
staying constantly around the same frame
rate<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:35.090> far<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:35.660> I

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.940 

see<00:02:49.780> that<00:02:49.930> planar<00:02:50.200> that's<00:02:50.500> awesome<00:02:50.920> that

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
see that planar that's awesome that

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.500 
see that planar that's awesome that
definitely<00:02:51.430> isn't<00:02:51.610> on<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:51.940> other<00:02:52.060> versions

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
definitely isn't on the other versions

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
definitely isn't on the other versions
like<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:55.450> said<00:02:55.630> I'll<00:02:55.720> do<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:55.900> comparison<00:02:56.380> between

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
like I said I'll do a comparison between

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.740 
like I said I'll do a comparison between
my<00:02:56.830> nexus<00:02:57.190> 4<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.700> seven<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.450> we'll<00:02:58.570> see

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
my nexus 4 and the seven and we'll see

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.970 
my nexus 4 and the seven and we'll see
the<00:02:58.900> difference<00:02:59.200> in<00:02:59.350> effect<00:03:00.780> whoops<00:03:01.980> shooting

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
the difference in effect whoops shooting

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.730 
the difference in effect whoops shooting
randomly<00:03:03.310> there<00:03:04.110> so<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.200> performance<00:03:05.650> is

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
randomly there so the performance is

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.260 
randomly there so the performance is
pretty<00:03:06.010> good<00:03:06.190> on<00:03:06.310> this<00:03:06.430> like<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:06.880> said<00:03:07.030> it's<00:03:07.180> not

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
pretty good on this like I said it's not

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.580 
pretty good on this like I said it's not
the<00:03:07.420> smoothest<00:03:07.690> in<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.140> world<00:03:08.320> but<00:03:08.440> it's

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
the smoothest in the world but it's

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.900 
the smoothest in the world but it's
easily<00:03:09.010> playable<00:03:11.490> you<00:03:12.490> might<00:03:12.640> be<00:03:12.760> getting

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
easily playable you might be getting

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.900 
easily playable you might be getting
somewhere<00:03:13.240> between<00:03:13.560> 15<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.590> 20<00:03:15.220> frames<00:03:15.489> i

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
somewhere between 15 and 20 frames i

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.360 
somewhere between 15 and 20 frames i
think<00:03:16.360> i<00:03:16.600> mean<00:03:16.840> i'm<00:03:16.930> not<00:03:17.170> an<00:03:17.440> expert<00:03:17.830> saying

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
think i mean i'm not an expert saying

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.920 
think i mean i'm not an expert saying
how<00:03:18.610> many<00:03:18.670> friends<00:03:19.209> are<00:03:19.330> getting<00:03:19.450> but<00:03:19.780> that's

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
how many friends are getting but that's

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:32.640 
how many friends are getting but that's

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
properly awesome look at that effect

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.960 
properly awesome look at that effect
there<00:03:38.650> on<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:38.950> screen<00:03:39.130> I<00:03:39.340> don't<00:03:39.640> think<00:03:39.850> that

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
there on the screen I don't think that

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.100 
there on the screen I don't think that
was<00:03:40.150> on<00:03:40.300> the<00:03:40.420> other<00:03:40.570> ones<00:03:40.780> either<00:03:41.010> I'm<00:03:43.110> just

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
was on the other ones either I'm just

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:57.540 
was on the other ones either I'm just
going<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.320> right<00:03:44.470> now<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:44.709> I<00:03:45.000> yeah

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.240 

so<00:03:58.550> yeah<00:03:58.820> guys<00:03:59.120> that's<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.630> on<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.960> Nexus<00:04:00.470> 7<00:04:00.890> so

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
so yeah guys that's it on the Nexus 7 so

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.980 
so yeah guys that's it on the Nexus 7 so
it's<00:04:01.430> definitely<00:04:01.760> running<00:04:02.030> some<00:04:02.300> extra<00:04:02.600> tegra

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
it's definitely running some extra tegra

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.690 
it's definitely running some extra tegra
effects<00:04:03.590> that<00:04:03.710> the<00:04:03.890> others<00:04:04.190> aren't<00:04:04.430> running

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
effects that the others aren't running

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.430 
effects that the others aren't running
which<00:04:05.240> is<00:04:05.390> a<00:04:05.420> shame<00:04:05.510> because<00:04:05.720> the<00:04:06.140> others

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
which is a shame because the others

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.870 
which is a shame because the others
probably<00:04:06.770> have<00:04:07.130> a<00:04:07.160> better<00:04:07.430> GPU<00:04:08.330> anyway<00:04:09.880> but

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
probably have a better GPU anyway but

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.630 
probably have a better GPU anyway but
yeah
