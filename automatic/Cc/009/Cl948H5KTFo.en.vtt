looking at time when we had D that's at

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.120 
looking at time when we had D that's at
this<00:00:10.920> massive<00:00:11.219> pool<00:00:11.840> OVW<00:00:12.840> with<00:00:13.710> their<00:00:13.920> John

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
this massive pool OVW with their John

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.849 
this massive pool OVW with their John
Cena<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.820> Batista<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.690> these<00:00:16.410> sort<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.650> guys

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
Cena and Batista and these sort of guys

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.720 
Cena and Batista and these sort of guys
Randy<00:00:17.820> Orton<00:00:18.170> or<00:00:19.170> was<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.189> they<00:00:20.520> were<00:00:20.580> being

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
Randy Orton or was it they were being

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.929 
Randy Orton or was it they were being
trained<00:00:21.060> correctly<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.890> think<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.250> was<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.789> was

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
trained correctly I think it was it was

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.519 
trained correctly I think it was it was
just<00:00:24.180> one<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.420> those<00:00:24.570> times<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.170> people<00:00:25.410> came

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
just one of those times and people came

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.980 
just one of those times and people came
along<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.519> think<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.939> double<00:00:27.300> W<00:00:27.630> at<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.779> time

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
along and I think a double W at the time

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.310 
along and I think a double W at the time
spent<00:00:28.470> more<00:00:28.680> time<00:00:28.740> on<00:00:29.340> on<00:00:30.269> talent<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.960> was<00:00:31.140> it

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
spent more time on on talent it was it

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.770 
spent more time on on talent it was it
was<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> smaller<00:00:32.189> pool<00:00:32.489> where<00:00:33.300> than<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.600> think

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
was a smaller pool where than I think

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.200 
was a smaller pool where than I think
and<00:00:34.230> absolutely<00:00:34.680> I'm<00:00:34.860> not<00:00:35.040> I'm<00:00:35.399> not<00:00:35.700> I'm<00:00:35.969> not<00:00:36.000> a

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
and absolutely I'm not I'm not I'm not a

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.610 
and absolutely I'm not I'm not I'm not a
name<00:00:36.480> at<00:00:36.600> all<00:00:36.690> because<00:00:36.899> they<00:00:37.140> did<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> great<00:00:37.590> job

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
name at all because they did a great job

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.110 
name at all because they did a great job
I<00:00:38.100> don't<00:00:38.430> explain<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.940> later<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:40.879> you<00:00:41.879> can

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
I don't explain that later is you can

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.880 
I don't explain that later is you can
train<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> smaller<00:00:43.020> group<00:00:43.379> than<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.860> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
train a smaller group than you can a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.319 
train a smaller group than you can a
bigger<00:00:44.399> group<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.850> know<00:00:44.940> if<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.149> have<00:00:45.300> a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
bigger group you know if you have a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.880 
bigger group you know if you have a
hundred<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.840> twenty<00:00:46.079> wrestlers<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:46.680> hard

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
hundred and twenty wrestlers it's hard

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.410 
hundred and twenty wrestlers it's hard
to<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.219> hard<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.489> keep<00:00:47.610> tabs<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.059> all<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.329> them

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
to it's hard to keep tabs on all of them

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.569 
to it's hard to keep tabs on all of them
it's<00:00:48.570> hard<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.840> like<00:00:49.190> individualize<00:00:50.190> them<00:00:50.430> but

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
it's hard to like individualize them but

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.049 
it's hard to like individualize them but
I<00:00:50.760> think<00:00:51.030> obw<00:00:51.390> was<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> smaller<00:00:52.110> facility

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
I think obw was a smaller facility

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.380 
I think obw was a smaller facility
therefore<00:00:54.059> they<00:00:54.210> had<00:00:54.449> more<00:00:54.780> input<00:00:55.710> but<00:00:56.489> you

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
therefore they had more input but you

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.090 
therefore they had more input but you
know<00:00:57.449> Randy<00:00:57.809> Orton<00:00:58.109> was<00:00:58.199> destined<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:58.890> good

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
know Randy Orton was destined to be good

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.130 
know Randy Orton was destined to be good
anyway<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.850> know<00:00:59.969> he's<00:01:00.270> third<00:01:00.539> generation

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
anyway you know he's third generation

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.479
