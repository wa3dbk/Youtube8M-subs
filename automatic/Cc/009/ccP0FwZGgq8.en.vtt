00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.760
 yesterday 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.500
 Hello everyone, guys and welcome 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.910
 finally in this new video well 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.890
 yes guys I came back later 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.500
 practically three weeks of absence 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.600
 on my channel and then guys are 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.260
 come back here to justify me in this 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.390
 video 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.220
 I immediately start making excuses 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.860
 even earlier for all that is 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.170
 success for the earthquake made that 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.420
 you are currently seeing a picture 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.430
 fixed then I do not know if in phases of video 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.050
 editing I'll fix a little bit 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.790
 etc. but for now you are seeing 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.040
 I want to apologize for a still image but 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.920
 unfortunately I don't really know what 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.769
 put yourself in front 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.390
 anyway guys then we're here in 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.210
 this new video in which I owe you 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.150
 talk about the status of my channel in the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.370
 sense that for those who did not know youtube 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.729
 is a social network on which you can 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.400
 upload videos freely but with videos 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.200
 small restrictions in the sense that if me 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.270
 I had to go and upload on youtube a 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.890
 copyrighted video for those who do not 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.320
 the copyright and the right d 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.640
 author for which I go practically to 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.420
 violating your right becomes a video 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.550
 reportable so once you get me 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.830
 is reported I have a reputation 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.660
 dirty in my channel I'm going to explain 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.730
 good guys 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.470
 youtube has constraints as mentioned in 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.210
 precedence among which for example there is 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.030
 the constraint of not being able to load 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.970
 of course video songs protected by 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.550
 copyright or violent content 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.610
 or pornographic content for 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.460
 example and above all we cannot 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.570
 upload illegal content inside 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.300
 of youtube 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.740
 in theory then guys what happened 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.950
 in youtube channels 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.620
 when you go for example a 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.070
 illegal tutorial and you are reported 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.620
 a warning is accumulated to a total 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.080
 of three warnings the account will come 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.790
 permanently closed I will now be fine 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.670
 to explain to me what happened to mine 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.500
 once I had made a video 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.019
 tutorial on downloading adobe 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.780
 photoshop cs 6 free of charge crack 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.030
 he went 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.650
 this video was reported to me ed 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.540
 actually I didn't say anything 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.830
 youtube cabbage I was told a 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.720
 video I had made and was 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.390
 actually illegal 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.610
 I apologized and that's why mine 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.510
 channel had scored a warning 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.060
 of copyright suter and this period 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.830
 just new year's day boys 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.010
 among other things, I was in New York 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:43.270
 scared when i heard this thing 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.920
 I received another warning a 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.680
 another warning that you gave me 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.269
 a video that I now as now not 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.790
 I can explain why it was me 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.519
 signaled was a video on a glitch of 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.340
 gta 5 I have no idea why 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.959
 you love me they had to report a video 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.970
 of the kind because in any case it was not a 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.250
 illegal driving or something like that was 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.540
 a very simple video that in any case 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.940
 was reported to me 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.660
 I forwarded the complaint to youtube 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.819
 telling him that I think that video doesn't 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.620
 had to be marked youtube has me 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.900
 dismissed the complaint practically in 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.910
 few words put no look that second 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.880
 we must be reported with the video 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.530
 them and for which the problem is enough 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.269
 problem is not that I now have two 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.160
 certain warnings also that is a 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.810
 great problem because if I had to 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.420
 receive another warning from me 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.640
 channel would be closed guys so 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.130
 now I will also tell you what to do in 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.320
 case of channel closure in any case 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.650
 the youtube guys had turned me off 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.920
 the account for two weeks so 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.350
 me in two weeks of my absence 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.040
 I made them for the simplistic done that 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.560
 I really didn't have the chance to 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.989
 go record videos and then 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.370
 charging them this was a big one 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.230
 problem for my channel but in each 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.910
 case guys we will try to solve in the 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:06.579
 better and I also say something sorry 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.570
 in case my channel came 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.100
 closed 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.709
 you always have to check 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.329
 in the last video the comments 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.739
 if my channel was closed in 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.120
 michele rho immediately a new one 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.130
 account that will always be called 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.870
 will always apply etcetera 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.330
 I go out and comment, guys have me 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.150
 closed the account, sign up for this 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.400
 account 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.169
 unfortunately boys will have to start over from 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.330
 boss but i really hope it doesn't happen to me 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.400
 nothing now I'm rechecking everything 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.860
 the channel eliminating all the videos that 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.300
 could be reported for which 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.979
 hope for the best 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.970
 the first warning will expire at 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:44.150
 February I think February 11 or 12 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.430
 February so on February 12th you see 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.979
 my channel as it always was 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.060
 because I will only have a warning in 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.250
 total in my channel 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.539
 this guy was just a big one 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.030
 problem for my channel was a 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.979
 big shot anyway we will try to 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.800

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:03.199

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.180
