for<00:01:57.840> hospitals<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.500> compared<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.979> controls

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
for hospitals and compared to controls

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.870 
for hospitals and compared to controls
they<00:01:59.670> cut<00:01:59.850> their<00:02:00.000> death<00:02:00.149> rates<00:02:00.420> 18%

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
they cut their death rates 18%

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.700 
they cut their death rates 18%
and<00:02:02.690> again<00:02:02.870> though<00:02:03.110> looking<00:02:03.350> at<00:02:03.500> South

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
and again though looking at South

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.649 
and again though looking at South
Carolina<00:02:04.310> what<00:02:04.760> he'd<00:02:04.880> been<00:02:05.000> doing<00:02:05.240> there<00:02:05.450> and

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
Carolina what he'd been doing there and

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.930 
Carolina what he'd been doing there and
what<00:02:06.200> are<00:02:06.290> your<00:02:06.350> hopes<00:02:06.409> in<00:02:06.800> that<00:02:06.950> state<00:02:07.250> yeah

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
what are your hopes in that state yeah

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.419 
what are your hopes in that state yeah
so<00:02:08.149> now<00:02:08.479> that<00:02:08.539> we<00:02:08.840> have<00:02:08.869> the<00:02:09.679> evidence<00:02:10.250> that

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
so now that we have the evidence that

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:11.290 
so now that we have the evidence that
it's<00:02:10.550> beneficial

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
it's beneficial

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.020 
it's beneficial
that<00:02:11.750> doesn't<00:02:12.170> mean<00:02:12.290> places<00:02:12.890> do<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.490> and

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
that doesn't mean places do it and

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.050 
that doesn't mean places do it and
that's<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.170> hardest<00:02:15.560> part<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:16.010> working<00:02:16.640> to

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
that's the hardest part is working to

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.270 
that's the hardest part is working to
make<00:02:17.300> sure<00:02:17.330> implementation<00:02:18.080> occurs<00:02:18.350> South

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
make sure implementation occurs South

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.680 
make sure implementation occurs South

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
making it the routine of care which is a

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.540 
making it the routine of care which is a
striking<00:02:29.810> level<00:02:30.200> of<00:02:30.320> commitment<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.980> so

striking level of commitment and so

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.870 
striking level of commitment and so
we've<00:02:31.790> been<00:02:31.910> working<00:02:32.090> with<00:02:32.300> them<00:02:32.630> both<00:02:33.320> to

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
we've been working with them both to

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.830 
we've been working with them both to
measure<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.090> monitor<00:02:35.209> what<00:02:35.660> are<00:02:35.750> the

as a whole but then also being able to
structure<00:02:41.209> a<00:02:41.570> process<00:02:42.350> that<00:02:42.590> could<00:02:42.709> walk<00:02:43.010> the

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
structure a process that could walk the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.090 
structure a process that could walk the
hospitals<00:02:43.790> through<00:02:44.150> an<00:02:44.360> eight-week

hospitals through an eight-week
implementation<00:02:46.100> program<00:02:46.520> we<00:02:47.120> do<00:02:47.270> it<00:02:47.470> through

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
implementation program we do it through

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.640 
implementation program we do it through

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
get it off the ground and then an online

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.390 
get it off the ground and then an online
WebEx<00:02:54.769> that<00:02:55.130> we<00:02:55.910> now<00:02:56.060> have<00:02:56.300> had<00:02:56.450> 45<00:02:56.989> of<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.769> 67

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
WebEx that we now have had 45 of the 67

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.790 
WebEx that we now have had 45 of the 67
hospitals<00:02:58.880> walk<00:02:59.150> their<00:02:59.480> way<00:02:59.510> through<00:03:00.080> this

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
hospitals walk their way through this

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.009 
hospitals walk their way through this
process<00:03:01.070> with<00:03:01.489> us<00:03:01.519> with<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:01.910> kind<00:03:02.150> of<00:03:02.209> weekly

process with us with a kind of weekly

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.170 
process with us with a kind of weekly
check-in<00:03:03.440> almost<00:03:03.739> like<00:03:03.890> homework<00:03:04.130> that<00:03:04.700> that

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
check-in almost like homework that that

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.090

we<00:03:05.269> do<00:03:05.420> with<00:03:05.600> them<00:03:05.780> each<00:03:05.930> week<00:03:06.170> we

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
we do with them each week we

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.160 
we do with them each week we
troubleshoot<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:07.940> help<00:03:08.150> solve<00:03:08.420> problems<00:03:08.510> and

troubleshoot and help solve problems and

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.520 
troubleshoot and help solve problems and
then<00:03:10.630> after<00:03:11.630> a<00:03:11.660> cycle<00:03:11.900> of<00:03:12.140> eight<00:03:12.290> weeks

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
then after a cycle of eight weeks

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.530 
then after a cycle of eight weeks
they've<00:03:12.860> been<00:03:13.010> able<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.400> walk<00:03:14.030> through<00:03:14.360> their

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
they've been able to walk through their

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.570 
they've been able to walk through their
process<00:03:14.989> of<00:03:15.110> getting<00:03:15.290> it<00:03:15.560> piloted<00:03:16.100> and<00:03:16.280> into

from one state to five States make sure
we<00:03:49.700> can<00:03:49.880> replicate<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.420> at<00:03:50.510> that<00:03:50.660> level<00:03:50.690> for<00:03:51.200> a

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
we can replicate it at that level for a

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.729

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
way for all the hurdles that come so

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.320 
way for all the hurdles that come so
that<00:05:33.650> people<00:05:34.280> are<00:05:34.370> taught<00:05:34.580> how<00:05:34.729> to<00:05:34.760> do<00:05:35.000> it<00:05:35.180> and

that people are taught how to do it and

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.600 
that people are taught how to do it and
then<00:05:35.510> there's<00:05:35.780> a<00:05:36.020> return<00:05:36.710> to<00:05:37.010> checking<00:05:37.430> and

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
then there's a return to checking and

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.719 
then there's a return to checking and
improving<00:05:38.300> and<00:05:38.570> seeing<00:05:38.810> how<00:05:38.990> it<00:05:39.139> goes<00:05:39.729> the

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
improving and seeing how it goes the

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.719 
improving and seeing how it goes the
value<00:05:41.240> of<00:05:41.419> it<00:05:41.539> is<00:05:41.660> that<00:05:42.070> when<00:05:43.070> places<00:05:43.580> have

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:43.729 
value of it is that when places have

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.050 
value of it is that when places have
adopted<00:05:44.150> it<00:05:44.300> they<00:05:44.680> see<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:45.830> results<00:05:45.919> but<00:05:46.430> they

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
adopted it they see the results but they

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.420 
adopted it they see the results but they
also<00:05:47.210> experience<00:05:48.110> just<00:05:48.380> the<00:05:49.010> better<00:05:49.160> morale

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
also experience just the better morale

also experience just the better morale
of<00:05:49.789> teams<00:05:50.030> that<00:05:50.539> work<00:05:50.690> together<00:05:50.870> we've<00:05:51.410> seen
