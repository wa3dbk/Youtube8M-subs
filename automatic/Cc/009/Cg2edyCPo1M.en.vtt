I and in there I just keep my Texas
Instruments<00:02:06.810> calculator<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.440> one<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.680> like

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
Instruments calculator this one is like

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.969 
Instruments calculator this one is like
old<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.580> used<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.210> last<00:02:09.360> year<00:02:09.630> for<00:02:09.810> math<00:02:09.930> and<00:02:10.920> I'm

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
old I used it last year for math and I'm

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.470 
old I used it last year for math and I'm
using<00:02:11.130> it<00:02:11.310> again<00:02:11.490> this<00:02:11.640> year<00:02:11.850> like<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.270> looks

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
using it again this year like it looks

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.360 
using it again this year like it looks
different<00:02:12.720> now<00:02:12.960> but<00:02:13.350> it's<00:02:13.500> like<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.920> same<00:02:14.130> one

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
different now but it's like the same one

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.040 
different now but it's like the same one
you<00:02:14.580> can<00:02:14.700> buy<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.850> at<00:02:14.940> Target<00:02:15.090> it's<00:02:15.330> like<00:02:15.420> $12

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
you can buy it at Target it's like $12

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.740 
you can buy it at Target it's like $12
so<00:02:16.320> yeah<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.490> use<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:17.850> for<00:02:18.150> my<00:02:18.210> physics

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
so yeah and I use this for my physics

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.540 
so yeah and I use this for my physics
class<00:02:18.810> well<00:02:19.350> it's<00:02:19.470> like<00:02:19.560> IPS<00:02:20.070> intro<00:02:20.430> to

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
class well it's like IPS intro to

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.520 
class well it's like IPS intro to
physical<00:02:20.820> science<00:02:21.180> or<00:02:21.390> conceptual<00:02:22.350> physics

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
physical science or conceptual physics

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.020 
physical science or conceptual physics
which<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.010> what<00:02:23.220> they<00:02:23.340> call<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.550> at<00:02:23.640> my<00:02:23.730> school

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
which is what they call it at my school

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.230 
which is what they call it at my school
and<00:02:24.210> a<00:02:25.200> ton<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.470> math<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.890> it's<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.340> hard<00:02:26.700> so<00:02:27.210> I

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
and a ton of math and it's so hard so I

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.740 
and a ton of math and it's so hard so I
use<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.480> for<00:02:27.690> math<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.080> for<00:02:28.380> physics<00:02:28.860> but

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
use this for math and for physics but

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.020 
use this for math and for physics but
yeah<00:02:30.750> my<00:02:31.320> binder<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.040> just<00:02:32.220> have<00:02:32.400> it's<00:02:32.790> like

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
yeah my binder and I just have it's like

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.310 
yeah my binder and I just have it's like

divider and a folder for every subject

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.180 
divider and a folder for every subject
so<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.050> divider<00:02:46.320> I<00:02:46.410> keep<00:02:46.650> homework<00:02:47.040> and

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
so in the divider I keep homework and

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.360 
so in the divider I keep homework and
then<00:02:47.310> in<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.870> folder<00:02:49.380> I<00:02:49.530> keep<00:02:49.830> like

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
then in the the folder I keep like

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.100 
then in the the folder I keep like
handouts<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.150> finished<00:02:51.480> homework<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:51.959> all

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
of that so that's my binder pretty

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.640 
of that so that's my binder pretty
standard<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:54.750> it's<00:02:54.870> already<00:02:55.140> falling<00:02:55.440> apart

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
standard and it's already falling apart

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.560 
standard and it's already falling apart
which<00:02:55.860> sucks<00:02:56.220> but<00:02:56.520> my<00:02:56.880> camera<00:02:57.090> is<00:02:57.270> dying<00:02:57.450> so

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
which sucks but my camera is dying so

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.699 
which sucks but my camera is dying so
I'm<00:02:57.630> gonna<00:02:57.720> have<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:57.990> go<00:02:58.080> through<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:58.410> pretty

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
I'm gonna have to go through this pretty

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.860 
I'm gonna have to go through this pretty
fast<00:02:58.980> but<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.370> has<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.490> ton<00:02:59.820> of<00:02:59.850> pockets<00:03:00.330> so<00:03:00.780> I'm

fast but it has a ton of pockets so I'm

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.640 
fast but it has a ton of pockets so I'm
just<00:03:00.990> going<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.170> start<00:03:01.350> with<00:03:01.410> this<00:03:01.590> first

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
just going to start with this first

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.750 
just going to start with this first
pouch<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.459> zipper<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:03.420> in<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.810> pouch<00:03:04.050> I<00:03:04.320> have

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
headphones because some teachers let us

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.180 
headphones because some teachers let us

zipper pouch I have like my school ID

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.420 
zipper pouch I have like my school ID
which<00:03:18.300> is<00:03:18.420> in<00:03:18.600> here<00:03:18.720> somewhere<00:03:19.110> here<00:03:19.890> it<00:03:20.010> is<00:03:20.130> I

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
which is in here somewhere here it is I

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.000
