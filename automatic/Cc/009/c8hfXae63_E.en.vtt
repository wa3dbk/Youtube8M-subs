00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.000
 Well, here we are, I'm still a little 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.710
 malito so it's listen to me weird can 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.110
 be normal but good here I am in the 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.360
 callao mall in the cut 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.580
 English of Plaza Callao in Madrid and now 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.470
 I wanted to try the xbox here you have my 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.119
 I look but you are probably 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.609
 watching a little bit bad but good not 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.469
 nothing happens so nothing now I will record 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.999
 or I'll try to record something when I'm 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.999
 playing or something like that so we 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:50.769
 we see 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.460
 of 226 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.520
 despite the corn 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.710
 ah 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.940
 we have already counted in bar I have arrived 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.210
 to vote we're going to take the first 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.210
 part 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.500
 if you notice that we are going 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.500
 now I'm going to play like with the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.500
 sensitivity because 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.800
 in peace 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.570
 and sensitivity 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.250
 we are going to put her back because as 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.840
 at the moment what it does is use a lot 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.840
 position the same triplet 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.120
 I really like the textures 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.260
 we need in xbox vall you know that 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.430
 no 4 usually the strike cobbles 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.430
 from xbox 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:28.480
 saying that interest has always been 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.739
 seen a little worse than on xbox 360 the 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.409
 theme of the textures that you have 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.040
 occupied on the hard drive and I do not know if 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.040
 the same thing will happen 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.730
 Cuadre has told me 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.379
 also said pretty textures 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.780
 not to try to move around the whole 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.099
 map so you can see it is a 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.200
 little bit of a glimpse you already know that 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.420
 I put record directly on the screen 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.569
 by copyright issues 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.750
 but something you can see the structure I 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.700
 I think not 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.400
 pretty pretty minimal colors though 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:11.770
 it already happened always all you have 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.590
 listened to you see we're playing here 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.990
 three people and then they are online 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.990
 from the USA to be able to do this 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.880
 when we launched the commotions now its 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:31.030
 similar team apparently there is like a 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.110
 ridiculous takes some withdrawal which then 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.460
 the vice yes 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.620
 that is, it can not explode 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.950
 ourselves apparently then not 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.250
 We can send more warm or less 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.070
 see that slip that you make 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.630
 but good if you make the equivalent of 25 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.630
 this time what it does is drag 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.750
 but not shoot while so is 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.250
 quite then pull out a dog comes out 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.250
 they say there we go 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.540
 all 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:18.139
 they treated us the elegant 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:23.490
 he is quite handsome although I imagine 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:25.520
 for investors so pretty 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.520
 all right 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.780
 hardly 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:50.169
 until I imagine that tomorrow 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.479
 I will try to upload something more than 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:55.680
 tell me if you want me to try to see something 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.680
 specifically or something like that
