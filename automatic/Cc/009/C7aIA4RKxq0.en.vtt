00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.150
 hello today our review is two 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.650
 absolutely identical antenna from 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:17.230
 companies crocs tkp 14 2050 but with one 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.690
 only the difference is that there is a first 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.950
 n-type connector to second container 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:26.260
 ordinary f connector type f connector usually 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.720
 used in the body apparatus 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.289
 this is a satellite tv usual 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.510
 antennas 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.899
 but many companies are now starting 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.180
 produce antenna just sf connector 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.770
 iii tf connector they are much cheaper and 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.590
 accordingly the cable to them is much 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.430
 cheaper than cable for radio equipment 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.770
 i.e. n-type connector or 5d fbi cable 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.430
 ka-50 rg-58 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.430
 and so on TV cable he and 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.530
 does not have a characteristic impedance of 75 ohms 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.420
 ordinary cable which is used when 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.750
 cellular networking 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.119
 it has an impedance of 50 ohms 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.009
 responsibly with resistance cable 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.970
 wave in the 75th 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.900
 must be 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.310
 big loss on approval in 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.550
 today's test and we want to check 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.170
 how much more will the loss be 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.180
 use cheaper 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.820
 television 70 dark cable 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.660
 compared with classic cable but also 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.620
 very popular cable 5 d lb 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.550
 today's test we use 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.670
 cavel sat TV cable 703 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:38.870
 quality 50 have stala use cable 5 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.340
 dl b from the company peaked villages testing 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.210
 we spend in the huawei modem 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.670
 I am 3131 SIM card Beeline and also speak to 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.229
 me and type on crc9 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.600
 and pigtail am f connector she is crc9 in 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.640
 quality control signal from 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.119
 we use the program m yes my last 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.280
 version here we watch signal strength 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.740
 signal quality and noise per hour to the modem 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.500
 Antenna connected with a classic and she 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.660
 connector and cable 5 d lb look 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.660
 mdma result 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:22.210
 signal level -90 add quality 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:27.390
 noise and -100 2 minus 11 minus 4 best 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:30.430
 the result was of the order also -99 -9 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.130
 now we have connected the antenna with the f connector 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.940
 and TV cable see what 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.950
 signal level 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.950
 now em d em up 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:49.090
 signal level is also -99 dbf quality 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:51.910
 signal -97 -11 also wanted to note that 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.640
 antenna height has almost no effect on 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.410
 signal level we tried to raise 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.930
 up down swapped included 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.200
 the antenna in turn always got 1 that 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.020
 same result signal level 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.660
 which includes a model with son's antenna 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:12.390
 connectors f connector inserted 5 dfb 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:16.090
 either cable 75 smart but expensive cavel 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.040
 703 it turns out the same therefore 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.080
 can save you can install of 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.110
 the connector can be installed good 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.300
 quality cable 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.250
 75 are smart further we want to check and 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.770
 connect the cheapest cable which 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.840
 found for 5 rubles a meter also include 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.390
 very taking the jack and see the level 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.730
 signal by the way without antennas level 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.420
 signal either disappears and exposes from 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.610
 -100 7 to minus 109 we add now 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:47.290
 hooked up the cheapest rexant cable 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:50.350
 rg 6u for 5 rubles and see what 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:55.800
 the result will be with this cable from us 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.800
 cable is connected and container 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:03.710
 and cable 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.710
 via pigtail connected 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.470
 modem 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.470
 signal level 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.000
 also past with 90 bl and signal quality 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.610
 about comparable 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.580
 she jumps constantly but remains 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:25.310
 about the same level 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:28.220
 summing up the use of expensive and 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.210
 quality cable in March 5d p-8d in 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:34.400
 10 is equal at such powers when 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.800
 just connect the antenna directly to 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.710
 the modem is not necessarily possible 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.880
 use the flesh the cheapest cable 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.470
 for 5 rubles and get the same 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.690
 signal strength results by 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.920
 quality and noise but the only thing 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.700
 need to take into account 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:56.970
 cheap cable 75 smart tv it 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.220
 cracks in the winter they are inconvenient to work he 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.610
 very so flimsy better to use 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:04.800
 all the same average snow cable he is comfortable in 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.810
 work in the winter you will not crack and 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.070
 will live for many years 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.070
 Thank you for watching
