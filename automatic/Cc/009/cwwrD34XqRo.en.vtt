00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
to get this thing running properly and I

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.279 
to get this thing running properly and I
probably<00:00:21.300> have<00:00:21.449> one<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.779> first<00:00:21.930> ones<00:00:22.199> that

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
probably have one of the first ones that

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.800 
probably have one of the first ones that
came<00:00:22.529> into<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.010> u.s.<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.670> beat<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.480> pretty

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
came into the u.s. and beat it pretty

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.630 
came into the u.s. and beat it pretty
severely<00:00:25.260> for<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.650> couple<00:00:26.010> days<00:00:26.160> before<00:00:26.400> I

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
severely for a couple days before I

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.660 
severely for a couple days before I
started<00:00:27.060> seeing<00:00:27.529> real<00:00:28.529> issues<00:00:29.130> but<00:00:29.400> these<00:00:29.519> are

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
started seeing real issues but these are

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.849 
started seeing real issues but these are
issues<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.060> can<00:00:30.420> be<00:00:30.449> fixed<00:00:30.869> if<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.349> just<00:00:31.560> go

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
issues that can be fixed if you just go

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.549 
issues that can be fixed if you just go
through<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.189> properly<00:00:32.880> before<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.559> start

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
through it properly before you start

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.650 
through it properly before you start
bashing<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.460> we'll<00:00:35.610> get<00:00:35.730> right<00:00:35.969> into<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.420> what

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
bashing so we'll get right into it what

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.510 
bashing so we'll get right into it what
needs<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.079> be<00:00:37.260> fixed<00:00:37.680> or<00:00:37.800> right<00:00:38.040> off<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.370> bat

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
needs to be fixed or right off the bat

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.270 
needs to be fixed or right off the bat
most<00:00:39.300> importantly<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.320> your<00:00:40.800> slipper<00:00:41.250> clutch

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
most importantly is your slipper clutch

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.119 
most importantly is your slipper clutch
needs<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:42.300> loosened<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:43.050> take<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.620> rear

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
needs to be loosened you take this rear

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.940 
needs to be loosened you take this rear
plate<00:00:44.550> off<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.270> bottom<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.530> can<00:00:46.710> get

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
plate off of the bottom and you can get

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.340 
plate off of the bottom and you can get
to<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> slipper<00:00:47.610> clutch<00:00:47.640> tension<00:00:48.480> spring<00:00:48.840> you

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
to the slipper clutch tension spring you

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.020 
to the slipper clutch tension spring you
need<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.649> back<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.129> off<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> point<00:00:50.910> that

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
need to back that off to the point that

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.760 
need to back that off to the point that
it<00:00:51.180> actually<00:00:51.690> activates<00:00:52.079> because<00:00:52.530> mine<00:00:52.739> was

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
it actually activates because mine was

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.580 
it actually activates because mine was
too<00:00:53.219> tight<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.730> ended<00:00:54.600> up<00:00:54.719> stripping<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
too tight and ended up stripping the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.580 
too tight and ended up stripping the
main<00:00:56.070> gear<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.820> my<00:00:57.360> differential<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.230> main

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
main gear on my differential the main

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.380 
main gear on my differential the main
bevel<00:00:59.039> gear<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.340> my<00:00:59.460> differential<00:00:59.879> started

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
bevel gear on my differential started

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.080 
bevel gear on my differential started
stripping<00:01:00.780> out<00:01:01.190> it's<00:01:02.190> still<00:01:02.430> working<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:03.059> I

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
stripping out it's still working but I

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.729 
stripping out it's still working but I
can<00:01:03.300> hear<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.600> starting<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.080> go<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.559> that's

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
can hear it starting to go and that's

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.440 
can hear it starting to go and that's
because<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.339> slipper<00:01:05.670> clutch<00:01:05.700> was<00:01:06.150> just

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
because the slipper clutch was just

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.649 
because the slipper clutch was just
simply<00:01:06.750> locked<00:01:07.170> down<00:01:07.530> too<00:01:07.979> tight<00:01:08.430> okay<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.240> get

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
simply locked down too tight okay so get

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.510 
simply locked down too tight okay so get
that<00:01:09.689> done<00:01:10.200> before<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.830> start<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.250> after

it's<00:01:45.180> an<00:01:45.299> aluminum<00:01:45.509> shaft<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.170> very<00:01:46.350> light

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
it's an aluminum shaft it's very light

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.399 
it's an aluminum shaft it's very light
it<00:01:46.829> works<00:01:46.979> great<00:01:47.369> but<00:01:48.030> there's<00:01:48.479> no<00:01:48.689> cover<00:01:49.049> over

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.139 
it works great but there's no cover over
it<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.740> what<00:01:49.890> happens<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.549> get<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.729> bunch<00:01:50.820> of

it so what happens is you get a bunch of
rocks<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.720> chassis<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.380> they<00:01:53.340> start

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
rocks in the chassis and they start

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.600 
rocks in the chassis and they start
grooving<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.420> up<00:01:55.009> I'll<00:01:56.009> show<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.340> couple

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
grooving it up I'll show you a couple

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.459 
grooving it up I'll show you a couple
pictures<00:01:56.759> here<00:01:56.969> what<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.689> did<00:01:57.810> was<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.290> used

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
pictures here what I did was I used

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.709 
pictures here what I did was I used
popsicle<00:01:59.130> sticks<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.520> knoweth<00:02:00.030> darky<00:02:00.479> it's

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
popsicle sticks and knoweth darky it's

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.499 
popsicle sticks and knoweth darky it's
really<00:02:01.140> corny<00:02:01.409> but<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:02.100> does<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.969> job<00:02:03.180> and

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
really corny but it does the job and

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.410 
really corny but it does the job and
glue<00:02:04.170> them<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.619> top<00:02:04.969> I'm<00:02:05.969> pretty<00:02:06.240> sure

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
glue them to the top I'm pretty sure

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.479 
glue them to the top I'm pretty sure
there's<00:02:06.659> going<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.049> be<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.350> aftermarket<00:02:08.310> piece

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
there's going to be a aftermarket piece

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.420 
there's going to be a aftermarket piece
to<00:02:08.789> cover<00:02:09.000> that<00:02:09.209> shaft<00:02:09.509> up<00:02:09.810> but<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:11.099> know<00:02:11.220> who

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
to cover that shaft up but you know who

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.949 
to cover that shaft up but you know who
knows<00:02:11.580> how<00:02:11.760> long<00:02:11.970> ago<00:02:12.150> or<00:02:12.540> how

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
knows how long ago or how

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.259 
knows how long ago or how
that's<00:02:13.469> gonna<00:02:13.680> take<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.549> make<00:02:14.760> sure<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:15.030> cover

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
that's gonna take so make sure you cover

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.699 
that's gonna take so make sure you cover
up<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:15.540> driveshaft<00:02:16.019> otherwise<00:02:16.349> if<00:02:16.590> you

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
up that driveshaft otherwise if you

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.410 
up that driveshaft otherwise if you
really<00:02:17.099> go<00:02:17.250> out<00:02:17.430> there<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.790> bash<00:02:18.030> it's

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
really go out there and bash it's

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.349 
really go out there and bash it's
possible<00:02:18.870> you'll<00:02:19.019> grind<00:02:19.290> through<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:20.359> the

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
possible you'll grind through it the

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:23.929 
possible you'll grind through it the
components<00:02:22.170> are<00:02:22.409> actually<00:02:22.769> very<00:02:23.370> nice<00:02:23.640> the

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
components are actually very nice the

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.030 
components are actually very nice the
motor<00:02:24.150> doesn't<00:02:24.629> get<00:02:24.750> hot<00:02:24.959> ESC<00:02:25.620> doesn't<00:02:25.920> get

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
motor doesn't get hot ESC doesn't get

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.539 
motor doesn't get hot ESC doesn't get
hot<00:02:26.250> it's<00:02:26.579> pretty<00:02:27.299> fast<00:02:27.689> as<00:02:28.019> it<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.650> the

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
hot it's pretty fast as it is and the

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.640 
hot it's pretty fast as it is and the
servo<00:02:29.879> hasn't<00:02:30.239> stripped<00:02:30.480> out<00:02:30.659> on<00:02:30.840> me<00:02:30.989> another

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
servo hasn't stripped out on me another

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.679 
servo hasn't stripped out on me another
issue<00:02:31.859> that<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.189> have<00:02:32.400> had<00:02:32.639> is<00:02:32.909> the<00:02:33.180> wheels<00:02:33.420> will

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
issue that I have had is the wheels will

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:36.259 
issue that I have had is the wheels will
deform<00:02:34.049> slightly<00:02:34.290> with<00:02:34.739> heavy<00:02:35.010> bashing<00:02:35.579> so

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
deform slightly with heavy bashing so

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.470 
deform slightly with heavy bashing so
you<00:02:36.629> want<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:37.430> let<00:02:38.430> those<00:02:38.609> go<00:02:38.909> until<00:02:39.299> they're

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
you want to let those go until they're

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.440 
you want to let those go until they're
unusable<00:02:40.349> and<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.129> bet<00:02:41.849> most<00:02:42.120> people

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
unusable and and I I bet most people

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.879 
unusable and and I I bet most people
wouldn't<00:02:42.719> have<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:42.930> single<00:02:43.139> problem<00:02:43.500> with<00:02:43.739> them

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:43.889 
wouldn't have a single problem with them

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.280 
wouldn't have a single problem with them
but<00:02:44.069> I<00:02:44.250> was<00:02:44.700> going<00:02:44.970> full<00:02:45.180> throttle<00:02:45.780> for<00:02:45.810> a

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
but I was going full throttle for a

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.119 
but I was going full throttle for a
really<00:02:46.709> rocky<00:02:47.010> terrain<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:47.730> it<00:02:47.819> it<00:02:48.239> ended<00:02:48.540> up

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
really rocky terrain and it it ended up

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.640 
really rocky terrain and it it ended up
warping<00:02:50.129> them<00:02:50.250> slightly<00:02:50.549> so<00:02:51.419> again<00:02:52.230> things<00:02:52.500> to

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
warping them slightly so again things to

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.009 
warping them slightly so again things to
fix<00:02:52.859> loosen<00:02:53.489> that<00:02:53.579> slipper<00:02:53.879> clutch<00:02:54.019> covered

fix loosen that slipper clutch covered

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.190 
fix loosen that slipper clutch covered

loosen those up dab of glue tighten them
back<00:03:02.489> in<00:03:02.700> there<00:03:03.359> is<00:03:03.540> another<00:03:04.079> weak<00:03:04.409> point<00:03:04.769> in

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
back in there is another weak point in

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.429 
back in there is another weak point in
this<00:03:05.189> car<00:03:05.519> that<00:03:06.359> I've<00:03:06.510> seen<00:03:06.719> in<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.959> lot<00:03:07.109> of<00:03:07.230> cars

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
this car that I've seen in a lot of cars

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.259 
this car that I've seen in a lot of cars
it's<00:03:07.709> just<00:03:07.919> like<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.099> common<00:03:08.579> weak<00:03:08.760> point<00:03:09.060> and

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
it's just like a common weak point and

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.080 
it's just like a common weak point and
that's<00:03:10.139> one<00:03:10.349> of<00:03:10.439> your<00:03:10.530> pivot<00:03:11.010> screws<00:03:11.459> for<00:03:11.939> the

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
that's one of your pivot screws for the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.839 
that's one of your pivot screws for the
steering<00:03:12.870> knuckle<00:03:13.049> on<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:14.159> front<00:03:14.430> end<00:03:14.639> you

steering knuckle on the front end you

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.449 
steering knuckle on the front end you
need<00:03:15.329> to<00:03:15.389> take<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.409> out<00:03:16.469> put<00:03:17.099> a<00:03:17.129> dot<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.340> glue

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
need to take that out put a dot of glue

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.069 
need to take that out put a dot of glue
and<00:03:17.879> thread<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.299> back<00:03:18.329> in<00:03:18.659> because<00:03:18.810> what'll

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
and thread it back in because what'll

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.180 
and thread it back in because what'll
end<00:03:19.169> up<00:03:19.290> happening<00:03:19.379> is<00:03:19.769> with<00:03:19.919> all<00:03:20.069> the

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
end up happening is with all the

and<00:03:21.930> forth<00:03:22.139> that<00:03:22.620> screw<00:03:22.979> will<00:03:23.220> drop<00:03:23.489> out<00:03:23.699> and

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
and forth that screw will drop out and

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.899 
and forth that screw will drop out and
it<00:03:25.049> has<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.290> specific<00:03:25.620> little<00:03:26.190> aluminum

it has a specific little aluminum

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.000 
it has a specific little aluminum
coupler<00:03:27.419> that<00:03:27.629> you<00:03:28.109> really<00:03:28.470> don't<00:03:28.799> want<00:03:28.949> to

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
coupler that you really don't want to

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.640 
coupler that you really don't want to
lose<00:03:29.220> I<00:03:29.579> already<00:03:29.790> lost<00:03:29.970> one<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.540> had<00:03:31.290> to<00:03:31.439> sort

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
lose I already lost one and had to sort

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.589 
lose I already lost one and had to sort
of<00:03:31.680> make<00:03:31.859> my<00:03:32.069> own<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.549> reduce<00:03:32.879> slop<00:03:33.269> in<00:03:33.479> the

of make my own to reduce slop in the

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.830 
of make my own to reduce slop in the
wheel<00:03:33.780> but<00:03:34.970> most<00:03:35.970> important<00:03:36.449> like<00:03:36.569> you<00:03:36.689> can

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
wheel but most important like you can

wheel but most important like you can
get<00:03:36.930> away<00:03:37.079> with<00:03:37.349> most<00:03:37.590> of<00:03:37.739> this<00:03:37.829> stuff<00:03:38.129> if<00:03:38.280> you

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
get away with most of this stuff if you

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.280 
get away with most of this stuff if you
just<00:03:38.609> live<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:38.970> listen<00:03:39.449> that<00:03:39.599> slipper<00:03:40.199> clutch

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
just live and listen that slipper clutch

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.649 
just live and listen that slipper clutch
but<00:03:41.159> overall<00:03:41.639> the<00:03:42.120> car<00:03:42.329> is<00:03:42.599> a<00:03:42.840> ABS<00:03:44.209> plastic<00:03:45.209> tub

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
but overall the car is a ABS plastic tub

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.920 
but overall the car is a ABS plastic tub
chassis<00:03:46.169> very<00:03:46.379> similar<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.859> a<00:03:46.889> /<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:48.120> plastic

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
chassis very similar to a / the plastic

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.039 
chassis very similar to a / the plastic
components<00:03:49.620> have<00:03:49.979> no<00:03:50.430> problems<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.180> have<00:03:51.540> beat

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
components have no problems I have beat

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.189 
components have no problems I have beat
this<00:03:52.319> thing<00:03:52.650> up<00:03:52.889> and<00:03:53.449> haven't<00:03:54.449> broken<00:03:54.659> a<00:03:54.989> arm

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
this thing up and haven't broken a arm

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.679 
this thing up and haven't broken a arm
haven't<00:03:56.040> like<00:03:56.400> seriously<00:03:56.879> stripped<00:03:57.269> anything

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
haven't like seriously stripped anything

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:59.719 
haven't like seriously stripped anything
out<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:58.229> rear<00:03:58.379> diff<00:03:58.650> is<00:03:58.859> starting<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.340> go<00:03:59.489> just

00:03:59.719 --> 00:03:59.729 
out the rear diff is starting to go just

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:01.059 
out the rear diff is starting to go just
because<00:03:59.849> of<00:04:00.060> that<00:04:00.150> slipper<00:04:00.449> clutch<00:04:00.479> but

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
because of that slipper clutch but

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.920 
because of that slipper clutch but
nothing's<00:04:02.069> snapped<00:04:02.609> no<00:04:02.970> plastic<00:04:03.479> has<00:04:03.629> broken

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
nothing's snapped no plastic has broken

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.839 
nothing's snapped no plastic has broken
which<00:04:04.199> is<00:04:04.349> really<00:04:04.709> rare<00:04:05.009> because<00:04:05.220> I'm<00:04:05.549> used<00:04:05.759> to

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
which is really rare because I'm used to

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.879 
which is really rare because I'm used to
replacing<00:04:06.449> a<00:04:06.540> lot<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.930> plastic<00:04:07.379> bits<00:04:07.590> here<00:04:07.829> and

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
replacing a lot of plastic bits here and

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.969 
replacing a lot of plastic bits here and
there<00:04:08.239> so<00:04:09.239> I'm<00:04:09.780> really<00:04:10.319> impressed<00:04:10.560> with<00:04:10.739> its

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:10.979 
there so I'm really impressed with its

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:13.369 
there so I'm really impressed with its
suspension<00:04:11.370> is<00:04:11.669> very<00:04:11.699> good<00:04:12.509> it's<00:04:12.810> very<00:04:13.139> active

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
suspension is very good it's very active

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.580 
suspension is very good it's very active
come<00:04:14.310> set<00:04:14.639> up<00:04:14.759> a<00:04:14.909> little<00:04:15.479> bit<00:04:15.659> funky<00:04:15.989> not<00:04:16.440> as

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
come set up a little bit funky not as

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.740 
come set up a little bit funky not as
far<00:04:16.769> as<00:04:16.889> tension<00:04:17.370> goes<00:04:17.609> but<00:04:17.880> you<00:04:18.389> need<00:04:18.570> to

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
far as tension goes but you need to

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.959 
far as tension goes but you need to
adjust<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.859> camber<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.340> little<00:04:20.639> bit<00:04:20.820> because

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:20.969 
adjust the camber a little bit because

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:22.610 
adjust the camber a little bit because
you<00:04:21.150> can<00:04:21.299> tell<00:04:21.479> they<00:04:21.630> just<00:04:21.659> thread<00:04:22.019> them<00:04:22.139> who

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
you can tell they just thread them who

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.140 
you can tell they just thread them who
knows<00:04:22.830> how<00:04:23.010> many<00:04:23.070> times<00:04:23.370> pop<00:04:23.760> everything

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
knows how many times pop everything

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.760 
knows how many times pop everything
together<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:24.659> looks<00:04:24.870> ok<00:04:25.229> and<00:04:25.260> throw<00:04:25.560> it<00:04:25.620> in<00:04:25.680> the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
together it looks ok and throw it in the

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.750 
together it looks ok and throw it in the
box<00:04:25.979> but

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
box but

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.980 
box but
I<00:04:26.820> noticed<00:04:27.210> there<00:04:27.360> was<00:04:27.450> a<00:04:27.480> little<00:04:27.780> bit<00:04:27.870> of

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
I noticed there was a little bit of

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.740 
I noticed there was a little bit of
camber<00:04:28.260> issues<00:04:28.650> with<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:28.950> back<00:04:29.100> end<00:04:29.370> so<00:04:29.750> you

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
camber issues with the back end so you

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.850 
camber issues with the back end so you
just<00:04:30.900> started<00:04:31.110> flying<00:04:31.230> their<00:04:31.440> wheels<00:04:31.590> and

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
just started flying their wheels and

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.210 
just started flying their wheels and
then<00:04:31.980> tuned<00:04:32.370> from<00:04:32.550> there<00:04:32.790> but<00:04:33.920> overall<00:04:34.920> this

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
then tuned from there but overall this

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.250 
then tuned from there but overall this
thing<00:04:35.400> is<00:04:35.550> actually<00:04:36.210> really<00:04:36.450> good<00:04:36.870> I<00:04:37.050> mean

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
thing is actually really good I mean

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.310 
thing is actually really good I mean
stock<00:04:37.800> it's<00:04:38.280> quick<00:04:38.850> it<00:04:39.120> has<00:04:39.450> a<00:04:39.480> lot<00:04:39.930> of<00:04:39.960> low-end

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
stock it's quick it has a lot of low-end

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.680 
stock it's quick it has a lot of low-end
torque<00:04:40.590> it's<00:04:41.070> not<00:04:41.190> a<00:04:41.220> super<00:04:41.670> fast<00:04:42.060> truck<00:04:42.510> on

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
torque it's not a super fast truck on

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.480 
torque it's not a super fast truck on
the<00:04:42.780> top-end<00:04:43.050> but<00:04:43.500> it's<00:04:43.650> for<00:04:43.800> offroad<00:04:44.220> so<00:04:44.430> you

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
the top-end but it's for offroad so you

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.040 
the top-end but it's for offroad so you
really<00:04:44.850> don't<00:04:45.030> need<00:04:45.240> all<00:04:45.300> that<00:04:45.600> much<00:04:45.750> speed

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
really don't need all that much speed

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.200 
really don't need all that much speed
it's<00:04:46.680> plenty<00:04:47.130> fast<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.490> get<00:04:47.640> yourself<00:04:47.970> into

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
it's plenty fast to get yourself into

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.230 
it's plenty fast to get yourself into
trouble<00:04:48.440> it<00:04:49.440> jumps<00:04:49.980> really<00:04:50.400> really<00:04:51.000> well

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
trouble it jumps really really well

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.920 
trouble it jumps really really well
actually

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
actually

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.050 
actually
like<00:04:52.650> I<00:04:52.770> said<00:04:52.830> before<00:04:53.130> the<00:04:53.430> suspension<00:04:53.730> is

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
like I said before the suspension is

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.030 
like I said before the suspension is
good<00:04:54.210> if<00:04:54.450> you<00:04:54.570> want<00:04:54.750> a<00:04:54.900> little<00:04:55.110> extra<00:04:55.320> tuning

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
good if you want a little extra tuning

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.830 
good if you want a little extra tuning
after<00:04:56.520> you<00:04:56.610> adjust<00:04:56.730> your<00:04:57.060> camber<00:04:57.570> you<00:04:57.690> may

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
after you adjust your camber you may

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.480 
after you adjust your camber you may
want<00:04:58.080> to<00:04:58.110> disassemble<00:04:58.710> your<00:04:58.830> shocks<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.370> put

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
want to disassemble your shocks and put

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.830 
want to disassemble your shocks and put
a<00:04:59.520> little<00:04:59.700> bit<00:04:59.820> of<00:04:59.940> heavier<00:05:00.210> weight<00:05:00.420> oil<00:05:00.690> in

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
a little bit of heavier weight oil in

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.680 
a little bit of heavier weight oil in
there<00:05:01.020> just<00:05:01.200> to<00:05:01.770> reduce<00:05:01.920> the<00:05:02.330> rebound<00:05:03.330> a<00:05:03.480> touch

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
there just to reduce the rebound a touch

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.470 
there just to reduce the rebound a touch
but<00:05:04.380> you<00:05:04.830> know<00:05:05.100> I<00:05:05.130> would<00:05:05.400> recommend<00:05:05.820> this<00:05:05.910> 150

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
but you know I would recommend this 150

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.600 
but you know I would recommend this 150
bucks<00:05:06.660> it<00:05:06.900> blows<00:05:07.290> away<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:07.680> competition<00:05:07.830> that

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
bucks it blows away the competition that

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.090 
bucks it blows away the competition that
cost<00:05:08.910> twice<00:05:09.180> as<00:05:09.240> much<00:05:09.690> I<00:05:09.960> know<00:05:10.800> let<00:05:11.040> me

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
cost twice as much I know let me

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.920 
cost twice as much I know let me
rephrase<00:05:11.340> that<00:05:11.400> it's<00:05:11.970> not<00:05:12.120> gonna<00:05:12.300> blow<00:05:12.600> away<00:05:12.780> a

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
rephrase that it's not gonna blow away a

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.460 
rephrase that it's not gonna blow away a
slash<00:05:13.320> it's<00:05:13.770> it's<00:05:14.190> not<00:05:14.370> a<00:05:14.430> slash<00:05:15.170> those<00:05:16.170> are

really<00:05:16.920> good<00:05:17.490> cars<00:05:17.910> and<00:05:18.470> you<00:05:19.470> know<00:05:19.560> this<00:05:19.830> can

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
really good cars and you know this can

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.750 
really good cars and you know this can
