00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
thousand and the last one is five

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.999 
thousand and the last one is five
thousand<00:01:10.429> equals<00:01:11.240> forty<00:01:11.630> thousand<00:01:12.109> if<00:01:12.319> you

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
thousand equals forty thousand if you

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.260 
thousand equals forty thousand if you
tally<00:01:13.369> both<00:01:13.759> of<00:01:14.029> those<00:01:15.459> those<00:01:16.459> columns<00:01:16.969> the

tally both of those those columns the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.539 
tally both of those those columns the
first<00:01:17.539> column<00:01:17.840> equals<00:01:18.649> eight<00:01:18.829> thousand<00:01:19.399> nine

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
first column equals eight thousand nine

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.029 
first column equals eight thousand nine
hundred<00:01:19.579> and<00:01:20.029> twenty-five<00:01:20.630> dollars<00:01:21.039> the

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
hundred and twenty-five dollars the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.199 
hundred and twenty-five dollars the
second<00:01:22.579> column<00:01:22.789> tallies<00:01:23.479> to<00:01:23.599> be<00:01:23.840> 70<00:01:24.969> 1400<00:01:25.969> if

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
that is what is possible here by going

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.870 
that is what is possible here by going
through<00:01:37.700> our<00:01:38.060> cycles<00:01:38.630> one<00:01:39.200> time<00:01:39.950> with<00:01:40.639> never

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
through our cycles one time with never

board is open with eight spots on the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.170 
board is open with eight spots on the
outside<00:03:01.180> let's<00:03:02.180> say<00:03:02.630> in<00:03:02.900> this<00:03:03.260> example<00:03:04.180> Eli

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
outside let's say in this example Eli

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.800 
outside let's say in this example Eli
invites<00:03:05.959> you<00:03:06.230> into<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.830> program<00:03:07.750> now<00:03:08.750> you

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
invites you into the program now you

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.570 
invites you into the program now you
will<00:03:09.080> notice<00:03:09.290> that<00:03:09.650> those<00:03:09.830> eight<00:03:10.130> spots

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
will notice that those eight spots

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.940 
will notice that those eight spots
around<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:11.090> outside<00:03:11.570> have<00:03:11.900> numbers<00:03:12.350> one<00:03:12.680> two

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
around the outside have numbers one two

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.000 
around the outside have numbers one two
one<00:03:13.280> two<00:03:13.340> one<00:03:13.520> two<00:03:13.700> one<00:03:13.850> two<00:03:14.030> so<00:03:15.020> Eli<00:03:15.530> invites

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
one two one two one two so Eli invites

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.430 
one two one two one two so Eli invites
you<00:03:16.190> into<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.580> program<00:03:16.820> so<00:03:17.660> you<00:03:17.720> are<00:03:18.020> Eli's

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
you into the program so you are Eli's

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.650 
you into the program so you are Eli's
first<00:03:18.830> person<00:03:19.310> that<00:03:19.340> he's<00:03:19.610> invited<00:03:20.180> so<00:03:20.390> your

first person that he's invited so your

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.540 
first person that he's invited so your
name<00:03:20.900> goes<00:03:21.230> under<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.680> number<00:03:22.100> one<00:03:22.310> spot

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
name goes under the number one spot

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.630 
name goes under the number one spot
behind<00:03:23.230> Eli<00:03:24.230> Eli<00:03:26.650> second<00:03:27.650> person<00:03:28.100> he<00:03:28.310> invites

behind Eli Eli second person he invites
is<00:03:28.910> gene<00:03:29.620> so<00:03:30.620> genes<00:03:30.980> name<00:03:31.340> goes<00:03:31.760> in<00:03:32.060> number<00:03:32.930> two

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
is gene so genes name goes in number two

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.699 
is gene so genes name goes in number two
now<00:03:35.540> Mary<00:03:36.459> brings<00:03:37.459> in<00:03:37.670> her<00:03:37.880> to<00:03:38.090> people<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:38.810> her

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
now Mary brings in her to people and her

people and they are Nate and Amy now

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.810 
people and they are Nate and Amy now
again<00:05:19.330> you're<00:05:19.810> on<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:20.229> top<00:05:20.500> the<00:05:20.979> top<00:05:21.220> is<00:05:21.490> full

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
again you're on the top the top is full

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.839 
again you're on the top the top is full
it<00:05:22.120> must<00:05:22.750> split<00:05:23.050> to<00:05:23.199> make<00:05:23.590> room<00:05:23.889> for<00:05:24.190> other<00:05:24.460> new

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:10.589 
on board number two when the top is full
it's<00:07:08.949> always<00:07:09.280> the<00:07:09.460> right<00:07:09.639> side<00:07:10.060> that<00:07:10.300> flip

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599 
it's always the right side that flip

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:14.760 
it's always the right side that flip
sounds<00:07:11.220> so<00:07:12.220> that's<00:07:12.849> pretty<00:07:13.840> much<00:07:13.960> it<00:07:14.169> for<00:07:14.410> the

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:14.770 
sounds so that's pretty much it for the

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.320 
sounds so that's pretty much it for the
board<00:07:16.259> how<00:07:17.259> they<00:07:17.979> work<00:07:18.250> and<00:07:18.490> how<00:07:18.580> they<00:07:18.729> split

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:19.330 
board how they work and how they split

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.060 
board how they work and how they split
and<00:07:19.539> how<00:07:19.659> they<00:07:19.870> move<00:07:20.139> so<00:07:21.130> let's<00:07:21.580> go<00:07:21.849> on
