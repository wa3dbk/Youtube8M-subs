00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.009
 good channel friends and we are today that 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.080
 smile the passive of 

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.370
 let's see the base deducted as you know 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.710
 tip 3 clear 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.350
 and well, you have to have for this 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.660
 as you can see the voice of this character is the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.710
 His voice 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.600
 from Washington the governor then the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.290
 same bolt same bender and when you see 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.250
 the jokes and then they say that I have a 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:37.129
 lousy sense of humor worth a little 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.269
 death is mercy and I have plenty 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.160
 It's okay, you will not find the 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.160
 past are ghosts 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.670
 to see see 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.830
 not seriously 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.780
 I'm smiling 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.950
 you took my best half beef and what 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.190
 you left is a dangerous enemy 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.560
 you took my best half and what 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.510
 you left is a dangerous enemy like 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.850
 you have seen tells him that 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:17.120
 he took his half and left a powerful 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.120
 enemy does not have anything else to kill him 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.460
 because it only has one faculty that 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.409
 as we had previously that is that 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.970
 took his best half and has left a 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.000
 mighty deny their also 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:49.920
 Otherwise, well, let's see if 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:52.880
 in the case of a social mother 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.880
 to invest 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.970
 but yes alone 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.540
 as you see there is nothing special 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.040
 that plague 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.959
 next to the characters 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.260
 now we are the same function in three 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.909
 we are in the same team as you know 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.870
 I do not think it's passive being very 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:34.879
 but we're going to try it piece and 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.120
 then they say that I have a next sense 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.370
 of humour 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.900
 of the conditions soil death is 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.950
 mercy and I have to spare is worth nothing 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.950
 there is also control 2 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.980
 we're not going to look if 3 does anything 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.690
 different 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.690
 screaming my name help 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.060
 a shirt 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.689
 nothing 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.920
 t 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.720
 and if not me 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.300
 as you see, nothing changes only 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.600
 change opponents that logically 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.230
 because all three led to the 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.640
 for female rash that is unique and up 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.040
 I think you liked this hidden passive 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.940
 and as always thank you very much for watching me 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.940
 and a gretting
