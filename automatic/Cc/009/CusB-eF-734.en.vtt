gets locked off well we can get away
from<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.840> one<00:00:28.080> for<00:00:28.289> now<00:00:28.470> what<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:29.490> have<00:00:29.670> on

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
from this one for now what we have on

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.930 
from this one for now what we have on
here<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> one-man<00:00:30.810> bleeding<00:00:31.380> here<00:00:31.820> well<00:00:32.820> it

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
here is a one-man bleeding here well it

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.520 
here is a one-man bleeding here well it
isn't<00:00:33.239> actually<00:00:33.420> it's<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.899> pressure<00:00:34.170> bleeder

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
isn't actually it's a pressure bleeder

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.670 
isn't actually it's a pressure bleeder
it<00:00:35.280> uses<00:00:35.670> air<00:00:35.820> pressure<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.239> push<00:00:36.630> brake<00:00:37.200> fluid

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
it uses air pressure to push brake fluid

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.850 
it uses air pressure to push brake fluid
through<00:00:38.000> this<00:00:39.000> one<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.570> from<00:00:39.899> paddock<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.500> it

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
through this one is from paddock and it

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.340 
through this one is from paddock and it
comes<00:00:41.399> with<00:00:41.520> your<00:00:41.640> kit<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> spare<00:00:43.050> piece

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
comes with your kit I have a spare piece

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.529 
comes with your kit I have a spare piece
of<00:00:43.590> tubing<00:00:44.040> here<00:00:44.340> which<00:00:45.059> I'm<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.480> use

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
of tubing here which I'm going to use

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.069 
of tubing here which I'm going to use
with<00:00:46.500> an<00:00:46.590> extra<00:00:47.000> so<00:00:48.000> basically<00:00:48.510> what<00:00:48.930> you've

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
with an extra so basically what you've

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.740 
with an extra so basically what you've
got<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.649> your<00:00:50.100> fluid<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.789> container<00:00:51.270> which

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
got is your fluid in a container which

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.590 
got is your fluid in a container which
is<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.199> fresh<00:00:52.469> brake<00:00:52.800> fluid<00:00:53.449> screw<00:00:54.449> on

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
is for the fresh brake fluid screw on

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.330 
is for the fresh brake fluid screw on
lid<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.530> has<00:00:55.739> got<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.010> be<00:00:56.039> pressure

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
lid and this has got to be pressure

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.689 
lid and this has got to be pressure
tight<00:00:56.699> screws<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.219> master<00:00:59.219> cylinder

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
tight screws on to the master cylinder

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.360 
tight screws on to the master cylinder
just<00:01:00.149> down<00:01:00.359> there<00:01:00.539> as<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:00.840> see<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.440> it

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
just down there as you can see and it

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.450 
just down there as you can see and it
uses<00:01:02.579> tire<00:01:03.030> air<00:01:03.390> pressure<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:04.250> pressurize<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
uses tire air pressure to pressurize the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.670 
uses tire air pressure to pressurize the
system<00:01:05.489> as<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:06.510> see<00:01:06.720> they're<00:01:06.990> all

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
system as you can see they're all

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.539 
system as you can see they're all
hunky-dory<00:01:09.049> basically<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.380> using<00:01:10.950> low<00:01:11.310> air

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
hunky-dory basically it's using low air

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.880 
hunky-dory basically it's using low air
pressure<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:12.229> pressurize<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.409> hydraulic

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
pressure to pressurize the hydraulic

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.249 
pressure to pressurize the hydraulic
system<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.549> push<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.060> fluid<00:01:15.570> through<00:01:15.840> as<00:01:16.110> we

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
system and push the fluid through as we

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.670 
system and push the fluid through as we
can<00:01:16.500> see<00:01:16.770> here<00:01:17.390> more<00:01:18.390> akin<00:01:18.750> for<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.320> older

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
can see here more akin for the older

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.350 
can see here more akin for the older
series<00:01:19.920> vehicles<00:01:20.310> where<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:20.850> problems

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
series vehicles where you have problems

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.350 
series vehicles where you have problems
and<00:01:21.600> bleeding<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> brakes<00:01:22.140> up<00:01:22.820> cap<00:01:23.820> supplied

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and bleeding the brakes up cap supplied

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.170 
and bleeding the brakes up cap supplied

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
you get it the wrong way around you're

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.660 
you get it the wrong way around you're
just<00:01:45.450> pushing<00:01:45.659> air<00:01:46.049> if<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.130> want<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.369> get<00:01:47.490> this

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
just pushing air if you want to get this

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.520 
just pushing air if you want to get this
working<00:01:47.939> properly<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.720> need<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.200> make<00:01:49.350> sure

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
working properly you need to make sure

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.010 
working properly you need to make sure
the<00:01:49.710> feed<00:01:50.070> dips<00:01:51.000> into<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.509> fluid<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.930> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
the feed dips into the fluid in the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.270 
the feed dips into the fluid in the
reservoir<00:01:52.500> there

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
reservoir there

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.240

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.370 
going to drain off your fluid from your
caliper<00:02:04.880> I've<00:02:05.880> actually<00:02:06.150> put<00:02:06.600> just<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.170> little

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
caliper I've actually put just a little

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.430 
caliper I've actually put just a little
bit<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.920> extra<00:02:08.190> tubing<00:02:09.110> fits<00:02:10.110> on<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.410> end

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
bit of extra tubing fits on the end

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.030 
bit of extra tubing fits on the end
nicely<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:12.239> gives<00:02:12.510> me<00:02:12.630> enough<00:02:13.470> length

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
nicely and this gives me enough length

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.800 
nicely and this gives me enough length
to<00:02:14.340> be<00:02:14.370> able<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.880> put<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.180> into<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.390> container

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810

tubing is fitted to your nipple and
crack<00:02:44.130> it<00:02:44.160> off<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.730> then<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.480> pump<00:02:45.780> it

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
crack it off and then you pump it

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.390 
crack it off and then you pump it
through<00:02:47.720> they<00:02:48.720> also<00:02:48.930> recommend<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.800> keep<00:02:50.250> an

through they also recommend to keep an

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.280 
through they also recommend to keep an
eye<00:02:50.489> on<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.850> reservoir<00:02:51.300> so<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.900> doesn't<00:02:52.230> get

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
eye on the reservoir so it doesn't get

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.620 
eye on the reservoir so it doesn't get
empty<00:02:52.800> over<00:02:53.340> time<00:02:53.850> you'll<00:02:54.030> find<00:02:54.330> that<00:02:54.450> these

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
empty over time you'll find that these

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.479 
empty over time you'll find that these
flexible<00:02:55.110> pipes<00:02:55.410> will<00:02:55.650> actually<00:02:55.980> get<00:02:56.190> quite

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
flexible pipes will actually get quite

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.009 
flexible pipes will actually get quite
hard<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.150> won't<00:02:57.329> be<00:02:57.480> able<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.720> reassemble

actually screen water jet tubing as you
can<00:03:07.350> see<00:03:07.530> on<00:03:07.709> here<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.160> had<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.030> pinch<00:03:09.269> a<00:03:09.390> bit<00:03:09.420> to

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
can see on here I had to pinch a bit to

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.330 
can see on here I had to pinch a bit to
braid<00:03:09.900> up<00:03:10.049> some<00:03:10.200> breaks<00:03:10.440> once<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:11.010> I'll<00:03:11.100> put<00:03:11.310> a

braid up some breaks once and I'll put a

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.220 
braid up some breaks once and I'll put a
new<00:03:11.549> piece<00:03:11.760> in<00:03:12.030> here<00:03:12.209> you<00:03:12.299> can<00:03:12.450> see<00:03:12.660> that<00:03:12.840> this
