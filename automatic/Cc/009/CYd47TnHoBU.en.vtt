00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.390
 or the average person you are watching 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:09.240
 this in the last video we did 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.809
 we learned how to make a carabiner 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.469
 for an ego competition like w or 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.469
 first lego league 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.040
 and in today's video we will learn to 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.040
 make a gearbox 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.320
 to begin with we have to know what it is 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.200
 a good gearbox a house of 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.690
 great is simply this 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.690
 that is good 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.400
 a set gears that there is one very 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.400
 big and one small 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.390
 moored with an axis and the small one is 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.090
 moored another big one that is moored 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:55.100
 with one axis to another small like that 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:57.500
 then if you turn from the big one 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.839
 here a lot of speed is done but if 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.290
 you turn upside down then you do a lot 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.640
 torque 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:08.820
 if they did not understand then they will understand 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.050
 you need three videos of 15 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.050
 some great 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.840
 and some suns 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.830
 let's start with putting a city was like that 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.830
 and a big 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.229
 now 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.340
 we continue to compose a small big one for 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.340
 that transmits the force 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.359
 and behind an insurance 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.410
 then we put another life 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.900
 and another large but large 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.410
 that way the force will be transmitted 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.310
 brooks 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.310
 but sure 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.189
 good since we have this like this 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.500
 this 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.370
 he will transmit the force 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.370
 to this 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.340
 that will transmit the force runs this 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:21.120
 and then we put this big one 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.430
 already 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.410
 an 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.410
 to the final force 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.360
 and so 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.620
 well we put here our last 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.060
 beam to support it 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.060
 a few more insurances 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:13.370
 and that's it 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:16.010
 if we pull from here it's much slower 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.549
 but you see a lot because that could be 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.910
 ideal for the challenge of the bouquet of the 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.640
 work robot Olympia 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.100
 but as I have done many times and this 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.820
 goes a lot slower but if I do this for 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.160
 that from here 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.660
 but this 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:39.820
 well like that and I'm still very fast 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.820
 then it can give or torque or speed 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.340
 but if it gives you a lot of speed then 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.630
 It takes a lot of clumsiness but here it gives you 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.780
 very stubborn but it takes away a lot 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.780
 speed 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.990
 and here it is done, it works for us 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.700
 great I hope you have been 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:04.540
 utility and if the video liked you 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.980
 Like it and share it with your friends and 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.460
 the video you do not like 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:12.430
 Like it and share it with your friends 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.770
 and so it worked 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:19.260
 well say goodbye to super cows 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.260
 powerful this is the human
