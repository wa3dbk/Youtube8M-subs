00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.049
 hello I just got to class time 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.490
 photography with alfonso díaz and good 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.949
 I wanted to show you the car that we have 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.690
 left this weekend because I'm going to 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.720
 have to return already tomorrow and if not no 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.199
 It's going to give me time to see, wait for you 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.199
 teach 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.290
 good this is 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:36.329
 now I teach you inside 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.329
 well you see that it is huge 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.510
 and so it's from behind 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.379
 we had already left with him the day of 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.449
 cabezón de la sal I hope that I 'm going to 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.449
 teach let's open it 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.789
 Let's see 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.250
 Well the only thing that's new for me has 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:06.320
 been that is automatic 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.480
 then good to see you as it is 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.770
 behind 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.109
 it's huge 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.179
 it's huge now I show you the part of 

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:18.260
 back then it's worth it because there can go other 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:20.900
 two people I do not know if you see it 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.360
 but you can go another two I'm going to 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.340
 teach how this works is the key 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.830
 but it is not necessary, it is not necessary that 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.940
 it is connected to the key no you dont 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.159
 it's needed for nothing then now 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.509
 we step on the brake 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.509
 and we give the button 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.030
 and it starts up 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.130
 and now we give a little bit back that 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.009
 see what's on the screen 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.439
 see how enjoyed according to how we turn the 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.899
 steering wheel goes to the side that I do not know if what 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.299
 you see there he looks at it we turn the wheels and he 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.909
 is turning you see the yellow and if we turn 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.749
 we are going to look at them here is to remove the 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.749
 the brake 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.270
 and then now that it 's back 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.270
 let's give a little back 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.090
 see if I turn now to there 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.020
 twist the yellow you see no and if I turn 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.190
 on the other hand 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.870
 gets inside 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.010
 is for buéno so that for us 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.860
 park assist and control in fact 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.490
 put there to control visually 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.520
 what else 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.230
 good good this and this is how it is 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.170
 automatic because nothing makes the point 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.270
 dead back to front and 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.710
 then one thing that we love about 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.500
 everything to danny who is delighted when 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.370
 what I'm going to find is this novelty that 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.540
 now let's open although it 's 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.460
 It's raining now and it's over and you've already 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.030
 seen the drops we're going to open for 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.030
 show us what 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:58.280
 see here there is a lot of good water 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.230
 well no but it has fallen there that can be 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.960
 clean less evil bad well this is the 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:07.670
 Novelty that of course it is a joy 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.410
 because you're totally in the air and now 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.690
 to close we're going to close it because if 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.690
 not at the end as we drop a suck 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.610
 that's 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.810
 and then there is already this that can be 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.890
 put forward 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.890
 that removes the light 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.250
 and if you do not look open then then it gives 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.680
 rather more light 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:43.239
 the car is worth 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:46.299
 and well nothing that I am delighted with him 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.870
 that is a joy of automatic has never 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.110
 driven an automatic car 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.819
 and I like it's comfortable, you do not have to 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.930
 you have to be aware of the 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.030
 principle has cost me and because at 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.920
 first got the key hit the brakes 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.180
 As if it were the clutch I was looking for the 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.860
 clutch and at the beginning it cost me 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.170
 but but then the trick is taken 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.920
 and there it is not super well because it is 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:11.159
 very comfortable and good nothing that you already of the 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.190
 that you have taught the car and there is no more 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:17.130
 much more than telling you so in 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.229
 followed by another video and I'm going 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.940
 counting a little bit more good 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.610
 He sent a kiss very, very, very big to 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.820
 all and I hope you liked it 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.820
 see you later
