00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.650 
my next tutorial for this trap and some
way<00:00:19.710> more<00:00:19.920> I'd<00:00:20.010> be<00:00:20.160> better<00:00:20.369> yeah<00:00:20.789> they're<00:00:21.570> just

way more I'd be better yeah they're just

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.840 
way more I'd be better yeah they're just
using<00:00:21.840> pop<00:00:22.289> into<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:22.710> trap<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.369> basically

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
using pop into this trap so basically

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.179 
using pop into this trap so basically
you<00:00:24.029> cover<00:00:24.480> yourself<00:00:24.660> with<00:00:25.170> slide<00:00:25.650> on<00:00:25.800> top<00:00:25.980> and

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
you cover yourself with slide on top and

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.429 
you cover yourself with slide on top and
you'll<00:00:27.060> switch<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.750> player<00:00:29.720> but<00:00:30.720> Lee<00:00:31.080> they

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the way so yeah pretty much you would

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.660 
the way so yeah pretty much you would
switch<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:45.450> they<00:00:45.600> are<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:45.930> example<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:47.160> I

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
switch what they are so example and I

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.119 
switch what they are so example and I
switch<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.329> player<00:00:48.570> over<00:00:49.079> here<00:00:49.320> Rihanna<00:00:49.829> slab
