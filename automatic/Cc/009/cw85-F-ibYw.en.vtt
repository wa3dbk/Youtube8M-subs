we<00:03:26.739> thought<00:03:26.980> by<00:03:27.730> changing<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.360> a<00:03:28.390> wood<00:03:28.630> chip

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840

furnace<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.530> solar<00:03:29.770> panels<00:03:30.250> yes<00:03:30.610> we<00:03:30.820> would

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
furnace and solar panels yes we would

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.690 
furnace and solar panels yes we would
achieve<00:03:31.150> savings<00:03:31.720> but<00:03:32.230> we<00:03:32.950> were<00:03:33.070> expecting

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
achieve savings but we were expecting

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.370 
achieve savings but we were expecting
that<00:03:33.850> we<00:03:34.000> weren't<00:03:34.120> going<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:34.900> be<00:03:35.020> able<00:03:35.050> to

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
that we weren't going to be able to

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.050 
that we weren't going to be able to

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
cover all a capital cost so we were

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.090
