feature<00:02:10.520> which<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.730> figured<00:02:12.180> was<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.450> same<00:02:12.750> as

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
feature which I figured was the same as

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
feature which I figured was the same as
in<00:02:13.110> fifa<00:02:13.440> 12

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
in fifa 12

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
but you cannot you have to use your

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.580 
but you cannot you have to use your
virtual<00:02:19.020> pro<00:02:19.350> for<00:02:20.220> online<00:02:20.940> Prost<00:02:21.570> clubs<00:02:22.230> and

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
stuff totally by itself you can't use

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.080 
stuff totally by itself you can't use
them<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:25.980> career<00:02:26.280> mode<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.610> can't<00:02:26.850> make<00:02:26.970> your

I made if you're going to go career
don't<00:02:45.750> even<00:02:45.930> worry<00:02:46.140> about<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.380> pro<00:02:46.980> club

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
don't even worry about the pro club

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.970 
don't even worry about the pro club
stuff<00:02:47.790> because<00:02:48.600> it's<00:02:48.630> just<00:02:49.140> totally<00:02:49.560> separate

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
stuff because it's just totally separate

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.710 
stuff because it's just totally separate
and<00:02:50.190> what<00:02:50.760> I'm<00:02:50.850> a<00:02:50.910> little<00:02:51.210> bit<00:02:51.330> worried<00:02:51.630> about

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
and what I'm a little bit worried about

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.570 
and what I'm a little bit worried about
though<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.590> fact<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.190> have<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.430> make

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
though is the fact that you have to make

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.520 
though is the fact that you have to make
a<00:02:53.610> new<00:02:54.030> player<00:02:54.570> every<00:02:55.050> time<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.380> want<00:02:55.500> to

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
a new player every time you want to

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.900 
a new player every time you want to
start<00:02:55.740> a<00:02:55.830> new<00:02:55.860> career<00:02:56.130> I<00:02:56.340> think<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.730> could

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
start a new career I think that could

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.420 
start a new career I think that could
get<00:02:57.120> old<00:02:57.360> kind<00:02:57.660> of<00:02:57.780> fast<00:02:58.080> but<00:02:58.440> luckily<00:02:59.070> for<00:02:59.370> us

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
get old kind of fast but luckily for us

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.830 
get old kind of fast but luckily for us
i'm<00:02:59.730> hoping<00:03:00.060> that<00:03:00.180> this<00:03:00.270> will<00:03:00.360> be<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.510> long

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
i'm hoping that this will be a long

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.920 
i'm hoping that this will be a long
series<00:03:01.200> hopefully<00:03:01.710> there's<00:03:01.890> no<00:03:02.070> bugs<00:03:02.490> no

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
series hopefully there's no bugs no

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.480 
series hopefully there's no bugs no
problems<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.200> i<00:03:04.620> can<00:03:04.770> just<00:03:04.920> continue<00:03:05.250> this

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
problems and i can just continue this
