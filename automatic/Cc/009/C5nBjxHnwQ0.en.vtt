00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
and you just kind of stick it right on

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.160 
and you just kind of stick it right on
there<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.000> might<00:00:57.180> bore<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.720> out<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> little<00:00:58.020> bit

but<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.559> too<00:00:58.680> big<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.070> deal<00:00:59.250> then<00:00:59.850> just

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
but it's not too big of a deal then just

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.970 
but it's not too big of a deal then just
seal<00:01:00.330> everything<00:01:00.570> up<00:01:00.809> with<00:01:01.199> electrical<00:01:01.829> tape

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
you want to pour a little bit of your

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.920 
you want to pour a little bit of your
whiskey<00:01:07.680> into<00:01:07.950> your<00:01:08.160> water<00:01:08.340> bottle<00:01:08.729> like<00:01:09.360> I'm

of<00:01:15.660> a<00:01:15.720> show<00:01:15.899> apparently<00:01:16.890> eyeballing<00:01:17.310> at<00:01:17.399> this

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
of a show apparently eyeballing at this

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.469 
of a show apparently eyeballing at this
point<00:01:17.790> but<00:01:18.240> your<00:01:18.990> next<00:01:19.170> step<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:20.190> to<00:01:20.520> pump<00:01:21.000> it

versus<00:02:07.080> whenever<00:02:08.040> you've<00:02:08.220> had<00:02:08.340> something<00:02:08.580> to

basically<00:02:11.400> what<00:02:11.550> happens<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:11.970> when<00:02:12.150> the

basically what happens is when the

basically what happens is when the

now<00:02:27.690> when<00:02:28.320> you<00:02:28.470> breathe<00:02:28.860> alcohol<00:02:29.460> this<00:02:29.880> enzyme

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
now when you breathe alcohol this enzyme

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.870 
now when you breathe alcohol this enzyme
has<00:02:30.480> no<00:02:31.080> chance<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.650> do<00:02:31.830> anything<00:02:32.070> at<00:02:32.370> all<00:02:32.490> and

has no chance to do anything at all and

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.910 
has no chance to do anything at all and
actually<00:02:33.600> breathing<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.140> in<00:02:34.290> straight<00:02:34.560> into

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
actually breathing it in straight into

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.380 
actually breathing it in straight into
your<00:02:35.010> lungs<00:02:35.250> takes<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.730> directly<00:02:36.150> into<00:02:36.330> your

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
your lungs takes it directly into your

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.970 
your lungs takes it directly into your
bloodstream<00:02:36.690> even<00:02:37.140> faster<00:02:37.590> than<00:02:37.620> through<00:02:37.920> the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
bloodstream even faster than through the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.010 
bloodstream even faster than through the
small<00:02:38.250> intestine<00:02:38.880> so<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.480> effects<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.930> this

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
small intestine so the effects of this

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.490 
small intestine so the effects of this
are<00:02:40.290> incredibly<00:02:40.560> intense<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.720> well<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:43.020> bad

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
are incredibly intense and well a bad

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.490 
are incredibly intense and well a bad
idea<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:44.640> tiny<00:02:45.240> little<00:02:45.540> bit<00:02:45.810> will<00:02:45.990> go<00:02:46.020> much

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
idea a tiny little bit will go much

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.360 
idea a tiny little bit will go much
further<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.790> just<00:02:48.330> don't<00:02:49.230> do<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.680> it's

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
further so just don't do it it's

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.370 
further so just don't do it it's
reckless<00:02:50.700> please<00:02:51.510> this<00:02:51.870> was<00:02:52.080> just<00:02:52.260> for

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380
