while so what do I do
I<00:02:27.450> could<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:28.080> could<00:02:28.530> cut<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.100> up<00:02:29.340> into

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
I could I could cut this up into

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.490 
I could I could cut this up into
sections<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.860> make<00:02:32.070> four<00:02:33.000> little<00:02:33.810> boxes

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
sections and make four little boxes

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.010 
sections and make four little boxes
those<00:02:34.740> would<00:02:34.890> be<00:02:35.010> nice<00:02:35.250> but<00:02:36.180> this<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.570> a<00:02:36.600> pretty

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
those would be nice but this is a pretty

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.580 
those would be nice but this is a pretty

just by looking at this that there's

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.830 
just by looking at this that there's
some<00:02:49.710> nice<00:02:49.830> figure<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.460> this<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:50.880> don't<00:02:51.750> why

like this this is a little pot this is

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.960 
like this this is a little pot this is
boxelder<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.770> I<00:03:01.800> get<00:03:01.980> some<00:03:02.160> color<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.640> it

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
boxelder and I get some color in it

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.680 
boxelder and I get some color in it
I<00:03:03.290> can't<00:03:04.290> core<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:05.180> alright<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.210> I'm<00:03:06.570> gonna

I can't core that alright so I'm gonna

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.650 
I can't core that alright so I'm gonna
take<00:03:07.230> this<00:03:07.440> one<00:03:07.680> big<00:03:07.920> piece<00:03:08.160> of<00:03:08.370> wood<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:09.510> I'm

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
take this one big piece of wood and I'm

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.580 
take this one big piece of wood and I'm
gonna<00:03:09.840> just<00:03:10.050> use<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.620> for<00:03:10.800> one<00:03:12.080> item<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:13.380> can

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
gonna just use it for one item I can

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.800 
gonna just use it for one item I can
turn<00:03:13.830> well<00:03:14.160> that's<00:03:15.030> probably<00:03:15.300> not<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:15.780> know

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
turn well that's probably not you know

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.510 
turn well that's probably not you know
the<00:03:15.990> full<00:03:16.200> potential<00:03:16.590> from<00:03:16.950> this<00:03:17.130> piece<00:03:17.340> of

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
the full potential from this piece of

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
the full potential from this piece of
wood<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:18.000> think<00:03:18.510> it'd<00:03:18.630> be<00:03:18.660> nice<00:03:19.490> but<00:03:20.490> but<00:03:21.420> I'm

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
wood I think it'd be nice but but I'm

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.660 
wood I think it'd be nice but but I'm
thinking<00:03:21.990> this<00:03:22.890> is<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.160> little<00:03:23.820> low<00:03:25.340> bowl<00:03:26.340> it's

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
thinking this is a little low bowl it's

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.580 
thinking this is a little low bowl it's
about<00:03:26.940> six<00:03:27.600> seven<00:03:28.020> inches<00:03:28.350> in<00:03:28.410> diameter<00:03:29.240> and

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
about six seven inches in diameter and

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.560 
about six seven inches in diameter and
it<00:03:31.590> really<00:03:31.860> highlights<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.580> grain<00:03:32.940> this<00:03:33.360> is<00:03:33.420> a

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
it really highlights the grain this is a

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.690 
it really highlights the grain this is a
little<00:03:33.750> piece<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:33.930> boxelder<00:03:34.580> and<00:03:35.580> the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
little piece of boxelder and the

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.640 
little piece of boxelder and the
highlights<00:03:36.090> agreeing<00:03:36.480> quite<00:03:36.750> well<00:03:36.990> because

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
highlights agreeing quite well because

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.949 
highlights agreeing quite well because
you're<00:03:37.770> looking<00:03:37.890> down<00:03:38.220> in<00:03:38.520> into<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.540> bowl<00:03:39.720> and

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
you're looking down in into the bowl and

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.680 
you're looking down in into the bowl and
you<00:03:40.020> can<00:03:40.170> see<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.530> entire<00:03:40.800> thing<00:03:40.830> so<00:03:41.690> that's

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
you can see the entire thing so that's

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.260 
you can see the entire thing so that's
kind<00:03:43.110> of<00:03:43.170> what<00:03:43.350> I'm<00:03:43.500> looking<00:03:43.530> at<00:03:44.010> now<00:03:44.730> I'm

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
kind of what I'm looking at now I'm

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.080 
kind of what I'm looking at now I'm
gonna<00:03:45.390> do<00:03:45.630> maybe<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:46.530> second<00:03:47.160> maybe<00:03:47.550> a<00:03:47.730> third

one<00:03:51.780> is<00:03:51.959> just<00:03:51.990> analyzing<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:52.980> piece<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.400> wood

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
one is just analyzing a piece of wood

what will I do with it how do I cut it
out<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:56.520> get<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:56.700> most<00:03:57.060> of<00:03:57.300> this<00:03:57.420> piece<00:03:58.050> of

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
out to get the most of this piece of

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.280 
out to get the most of this piece of
wood<00:03:58.290> go<00:03:59.100> to<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.310> bandsaw<00:03:59.850> I'm<00:04:00.120> gonna<00:04:00.290> cut

wood go to the bandsaw I'm gonna cut
this<00:04:01.470> round<00:04:01.830> I'm<00:04:02.760> going<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:03.209> put<00:04:03.360> it<00:04:03.450> on<00:04:03.510> my

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
this round I'm going to put it on my

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.080 
this round I'm going to put it on my
lathe<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.110> core<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:04.860> then<00:04:05.700> we'll<00:04:05.910> just

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
lathe and core it and then we'll just

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.790 
lathe and core it and then we'll just
see<00:04:06.300> what<00:04:06.450> happens<00:04:06.780> from<00:04:07.020> there
