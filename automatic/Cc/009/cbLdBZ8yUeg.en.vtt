00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.050 
didn't so this is a sponge i've been
using<00:02:41.200> it's<00:02:41.710> actually<00:02:42.100> a<00:02:42.130> little<00:02:42.400> bit<00:02:42.670> dirty

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.550 
using it's actually a little bit dirty
and<00:02:44.160> squashed<00:02:45.160> because<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.730> dries<00:02:46.290> it's<00:02:47.290> a<00:02:47.410> bit

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
bigger than actually is but because it

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.540

for the eve LOM cleanser I've never

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.340 
for the eve LOM cleanser I've never
tried<00:04:42.840> Eve<00:04:43.110> long<00:04:43.350> but<00:04:44.130> I've<00:04:45.120> been<00:04:45.840> using<00:04:46.110> it

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
tried Eve long but I've been using it

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.680 
tried Eve long but I've been using it
instead<00:04:46.500> of<00:04:46.710> mine<00:04:47.010> lizelle<00:04:47.460> which<00:04:48.150> i<00:04:48.360> think<00:04:48.420> is

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
instead of mine lizelle which i think is

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.120 
instead of mine lizelle which i think is
quite<00:04:48.840> big<00:04:49.110> step<00:04:49.380> for<00:04:49.530> me<00:04:49.560> because<00:04:49.770> usually<00:04:49.950> I

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
quite big step for me because usually I

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.160 
quite big step for me because usually I
put<00:04:50.370> liz<00:04:50.610> earle<00:04:50.760> into<00:04:51.270> just<00:04:51.540> cleanse<00:04:51.840> my<00:04:52.110> skin

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
put liz earle into just cleanse my skin

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.410 
put liz earle into just cleanse my skin
of<00:04:52.650> the<00:04:52.980> makeup<00:04:53.340> i'm<00:04:53.550> wearing<00:04:53.880> from<00:04:54.030> that<00:04:54.210> day

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
of the makeup i'm wearing from that day

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.420 
of the makeup i'm wearing from that day
and<00:04:54.690> then<00:04:55.230> i<00:04:55.260> would<00:04:55.500> go<00:04:55.530> in<00:04:55.770> with<00:04:55.920> my<00:04:56.070> cleanser

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
and then i would go in with my cleanser

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.000 
and then i would go in with my cleanser
afterwards<00:04:56.880> same<00:04:57.570> with<00:04:57.720> this<00:04:57.960> but<00:04:58.650> i<00:04:58.680> think

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
afterwards same with this but i think

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.650 
afterwards same with this but i think
this<00:04:59.100> is<00:04:59.280> helping<00:04:59.760> rather<00:05:00.150> than<00:05:00.390> just

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
this is helping rather than just

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.680 
this is helping rather than just
removing<00:05:01.080> my<00:05:01.350> makeup<00:05:01.770> i<00:05:01.950> think<00:05:02.220> is<00:05:02.370> actually

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
removing my makeup i think is actually

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.990 
removing my makeup i think is actually
helping<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.870> cleanse<00:05:04.200> my<00:05:04.500> skin<00:05:04.560> as<00:05:05.130> well<00:05:05.310> so<00:05:05.970> i
