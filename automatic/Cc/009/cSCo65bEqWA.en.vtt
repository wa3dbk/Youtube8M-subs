00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.939
 Hi seekers! Today's release will be by recently 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.839
 Magick 2 released. The game, like the first part, is very 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.310
 fun and even more fun if you play it with your friends. 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.589
 True, they will not be so long after 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:30.480
 couple of hours. 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.360
 The guys from Paradox were so kind that they gave me whole 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.290
 four keys to the game. Well, what would I share with friends 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.980
 and played with them. I took one key for myself for video, and 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.820
 the other three decided to play the heart out of you. Conditions are pretty 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.710
 standard - be subscribed to the channel and like 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.830
 under the video, attack the same subscribe to the group in contact and make 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.430
 repost records (link and conditions will be in the description 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.150
 under the video or in the comments). On Sunday I will inform the winners 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.750
 in Group. 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.710
 And now back to the Easter eggs. In the game there are a lot of them, like 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.910
 and just cool humor. I don't know how far 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.830
 I'm in the game, but everything that I show in this video is taken before 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.420
 of the moment. I will play on and for sure I will do the second 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.979
 episode. 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.049
 From the very beginning, to be attentive and inquisitive, 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.890
 you will start to notice the funny. Here is a board with the "ancient method 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.170
 learning the skill of lightning. "It has four steps, the last but one 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.479
 this is a question mark, and the last one is "BZZZ-BAM!". 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.460
 I don’t know how the last one is named in the English version 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.929
 item, but this is an explicit reference to PROFIT - the meme used 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.569
 The last item on any list. The word itself is translated 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.780
 as a "catch". Comes from the South Park TV series, where 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.240
 the word PROFIT was the last item in the underwriting business plan 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.969
 gnomes. 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:35.909
 A bit to the side you can see the skeleton of the Beholder, the monster 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.909
 from the board role-playing game in the fantasy genre "Dungeons 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.109
 and the Dragons. " 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.020
 Walking along the corridor further, having studied the power of the earth, you can see 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.100
 goblin rummaging in a pile of trash. Killing him you get 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.310
 Achivku "My Charm" - this is nothing more than a reference 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.689
 on Gollum from The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings and his 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:51.649
 a strange love for the One Ring. 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.209
 Passing by the ghosts discussing economic 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:56.909
 problems and their work ghosts will stand 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.020
 Timmy's talking training mannequin. 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.920
 In the game, all the characters speak their funny language, 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.779
 like a sims. But amid their babbling you can make out funny ones. 

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:08.549
 frazochki, like the first thing that Timmy mannequin says. 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.200
 The word "Excel" is a comic book author's favorite phrase. 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.920
 and the creator of many of the main characters Marvel. 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.269
 And then the dummy will start begging from you that 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.220
 would you beat him with all spells and weapons 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.319
 while shouting "I'm invulnerable!". This phrase is taken from the famous 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.900
 sketch "Monty Python and the Holy Grail". 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.310
 Surely you know and remember the quests in RPG games. 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.540
 Above them, there is always a noticeable exclamation mark that 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.110
 would have been more noticeable. In Magick, too, there is such, only 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.329
 here is talking. him, he will say that he can not say now, 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.920
 as busy with juggling. Peering, it is clear that 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.260
 he has a quest mark and is completely attached to his head 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.150
 on the wire. 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.420
 Near there is Easter eggs more abruptly. Passing by the strange stone 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.549
 a statuette of a guy named Duane will tell you to "piss off 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.640
 from the field in the afterburner, "and then about the fact that the game with stones 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.879
 not as hard as a rock. This is a clear nod to Dwayne. 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.280
 "Rock" Johnson - famous American wrestler 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.829
 and the actor, known for his role in the movie "Fast and Furious". 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.760
 In the same location soldiers with the strange name Swordsman 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.629
 seby, if addressed to him, will shout "Thrice hurray to the Alliance!" 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.860
 referring to the Blizzard universe of Wapkraft. 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.420
 Nearby, a resident of the settlement says that 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.360
 in the old days there were some conservation stones, but now everything 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.959
 automated. Referring to the first part, in which 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.920
 it was necessary to remain around such stones. 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.870
 A drunkard lying on a barrel says, "It's like a carpe diem for 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.379
 stupid .. ahem .. alternatively smart! ". Capre Diem - Latin 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.359
 an expression meaning "live in the present" or literally 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.439
 "Seize the day". This expression, for some reason, love to stuff 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.569
 imagine different mods. Surely, in this way the developers 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:40.680
 and decided to joke. 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.640
 Vlad, who is by no means a vampire, at the beginning 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.790
 The game appears without the right hand brush. I do not remember, connected 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.079
 whether it is with the first part of the game or not. But scattering blood 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.959
 Doesn't bother him at all. A little later we see him already with 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.780
 hook on the site of the lost hand. Almost like pirates. 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.689
 And later Vlad, apparently, decides to change uncomfortable 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:00.739
 hook on the yellow claw of LEGO. True, not for long, 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.359
 over time, the hook will come back. 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.269
 At one of the levels will meet the Veteran of the War of the Mages, he 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.370
 will say “War never changes ... except those 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.709
 when it changes. ” The first part of the phrase is obvious. 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.329
 referring to Fallout. Each part of the game begins with 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.789
 intro in which they say “War. War never 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:17.729
 changing. " 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.030
 The veteran can be attacked, while he starts singing 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.530
 to the famous Edward Gil's song on the Internet 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.830
 after all, I finally come back home ”, better known 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.120
 to you as “Troll Song” by Mr. Trololo. 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.690
 There are several other cool easter eggs nearby. Such as, 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.479
 on the island, which can be reached using 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.970
 Frost spell, worth a character named John 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.919
 Frost and informs you that “From the north is approaching 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.520
 cold front ”. He can be met twice more in 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.229
 the game and its cues will be different every time. it 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.430
 a reference to a character in the series of George Martin novels 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.979
 and the series based on HBO's “Game of Thrones” by John 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.370
 Snow and his famous phrase, which has become a meme “Winter is coming.” 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.900
 And then you meet a person watching 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.130
 binoculars for someone from the bushes. He reports that nago 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:03.830
 a strange feeling that they are watching him too. If a 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.860
 be attentive, then from above, on a small island you can see 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.490
 how because of the stone with the words “Soon ...” the head will look out 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.479
 horses. It's funny and strange, but it is also embedded 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.470
 the game of the same name Internet meme. 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.610
 I didn’t understand this thing, and I’m not even sure what it is 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.870
 Easter eggs. She is also on the island to which you want 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.139
 walk through the water using a frost spell. On the shore 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.419
 lie three models of ships and inspect each character 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.669
 with knowledge will describe each of them. 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.199
 In the game settings, before the start of the campaign, you can 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.849
 customize your character. Dress him in another 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.650
 cassock or change voice. One of the available voices 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:44.050
 - the voice of Arnold Schwarzenegger, with him much more fun 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.569
 play. 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.599
 And among the available weapons, in the description of some there is 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:50.160
 item “Call accepted?”. I think this is another meme 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.449
 “Challenge Accepted”. 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.759
 At some snowy level, I did not follow their names. 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:58.240
 or by numbering, there are two snowmen on the rock - a big one, 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.460
 holding in his hands and showing the world small. In that 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.430
 creating I see nothing else but sending 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.810
 on “The Lion King”. You remember how a monkey in 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.069
 the beginning of the cartoon showed the animals a lion cub. It seemed to me 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:10.850
 it's very funny.
