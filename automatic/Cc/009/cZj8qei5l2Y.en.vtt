00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hi then little video to see the 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.200
 difference between photos taken with 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:12.480
 a compact and with a reflex I have a 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:16.680
 compact fuji f80exr and my reflex so 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.029
 this is the canon eos 1100d both have the 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.400
 same resolution ie they are 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.359
 both noted 12 megapixels and one 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.369
 will see a little bit if there are any 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.449
 differences in automatic mode between the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.279
 compact and the reflex 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.869
 I used the mode voluntarily 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.890
 automatic because it can be 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.750
 interesting to see precisely if we can 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.520
 here it makes sense to use a reflex 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.239
 in automatic mode or if you do not win 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.840
 not much 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.960
 so this is a photo ap ride with the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.899
 compact and the same picture taken with the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.460
 reflex and that's what it gives 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.649
 so you see that the difference is 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.690
 not blatant then the colors are 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.520
 different in case maybe the balance 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.579
 whites a little different well 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.309
 maybe the fact that there is one that 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.809
 are a bit more or so does that its 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.480
 myopia the most over put light on 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.830
 on the houses but at the level of 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.470
 heaven at the level of everything else it's up to 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.900
 about the same what's me here I see 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.610
 not a glaring difference 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:16.350
 then I took a picture of an object here 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.710
 with flash associates with the compact and 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.570
 that's with the wild and a backhoe 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.200
 and my little girl who recognizes the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.119
 backhoe so that's done with reflex 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.829
 and saas with the compact so there is no 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.810
 really no good difference there is the 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.640
 flash obviously but flash are all a 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.439
 little bit different but the picture he has 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.259
 same corner and finally without a flash with the 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.869
 compact and with the reflex 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.460
 I do not know if it will be visible on the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.930
 video but there is a real difference 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.450
 in terms of definition 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.770
 that is to say that there with the compact if 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.210
 we zoom in we realize that there is 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.579
 grain because we were in a 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.430
 dark situation without flash 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.110
 so he must have 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.180
 go up in the ten to a lot more than 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.440
 on the picture with them reflexes or there 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.260
 like on the reflex we have a 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.030
 a much larger sensor it has less 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.980
 need to climb into the es10 water and into 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.390
 the more the sensor offers a better 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.940
 large sensor definition provides a 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.050
 better definition than a small sensor 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.450
 so I think that's what's at 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.590
 to remember globally is that another 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.690
 yahia times a white balance that 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.520
 is different but in the photo it's 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.110
 the same what so I think that's what 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.490
 is to remember is that basically a mode 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.080
 automatic on a reflex will do 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.420
 overall the same pictures as on a 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.550
 compact except in very situations 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.560
 particular type night photos 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.220
 dark photo where there is need to have 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.170
 a large sensor 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.010
 however, the real difference will be 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.480
 find in detail the detail 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.520
 pictures if I zoom in on art where 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.760
 the alarmed on the compact and the zoom on 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:53.410
 the road to 100% more than alas on the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.400
 reflex we see that it is not and that 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.790
 it's not the same thing anyway 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.200
 a lot more details about the reflex 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.370
 so that's all that to say that if you 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.080
 have a reflex if you do some 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.620
 photos in automatic mode only 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.260
 to share them on the internet 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.310
 put on facebook and that's it I do not see 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.080
 not really interested in having a 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.840
 reflex since it will do the same 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.090
 faults no compact case on the other hand if 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.650
 you want them if you want them 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.630
 rework behind if you want 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.550
 use the depth of field in 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.830
 using by setting yourself your 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.630
 opening 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.400
 if you want to shoot in raw for 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.739
 then change the white balance 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.239
 have set the colors etc 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.250
 there you need to have to have a 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.090
 reflex to do to make 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.709
 most beautiful pictures because the 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.660
 possibilities are many more 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.920
 as soon as you go into the teeth the 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.300
 camera settings you 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.459
 will be able to settle thousands of 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.430
 things while on a compact there is 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.400
 some modes that you can use 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.290
 with pre pre installed settings but 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.140
 finally your vote room for maneuver 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:57.220
 is very weak what so here is the 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.530
 little review of photos for friends 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.989
 girlfriends take a compact pictures 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.489
 to then make posters for 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.420
 retouch them to make a gallery of 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:09.640
 pictures buy you a reflex prefers 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.400
 a thousand times more things here it was 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.040
 the little test of the day without pretension 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.530
 it is 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.530
 my opinion on the question soon hi
