 photocell will start at thomas oldrati 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.710

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.269

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.860
 in the sand but certainly the sand

 move back on the super east bike 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.050
 I think they are the fundamental things for 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.119
 drive better on these these types 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.619

 with these conditions, however, sand me

 she always liked it and I think I'll get by 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.750
 pretty good and that's why 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:57.369
 Italy in the coming years will focus only 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.369
