we've got like a silicone gel in a show

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.030 
we've got like a silicone gel in a show
proper<00:01:03.449> flexible<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.559> moulds

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
proper flexible in that that moulds

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.800 
proper flexible in that that moulds
around<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> device<00:01:05.939> then<00:01:06.510> we've<00:01:06.630> got<00:01:06.720> this

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
around to the device then we've got this

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.130 
around to the device then we've got this
tough<00:01:07.110> outer<00:01:07.560> shell<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.479> that<00:01:09.479> Clips<00:01:09.869> around

this<00:01:10.650> here<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.630> don't<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.049> galaxy<00:01:13.380> s4

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
this here so we don't have a galaxy s4

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.560 
this here so we don't have a galaxy s4
at<00:01:14.040> time<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.250> recording<00:01:14.790> what<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.060> do<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.450> is

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
at time of recording what we do have is

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.510 
at time of recording what we do have is
an<00:01:15.689> s3<00:01:16.080> which<00:01:16.350> shares<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> same<00:01:17.130> sort<00:01:17.430> of

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
an s3 which shares the same sort of

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.429 
an s3 which shares the same sort of
profile<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.630> going<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> pop<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
profile just going to pop this in the

you<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.110> see<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.380> sits<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:23.369> you've

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
you can see that sits in there you've

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.370 
you can see that sits in there you've
got<00:01:23.520> cutouts<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.330> main<00:01:24.509> ports<00:01:24.900> controls

got cutouts for the main ports controls

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.679 
got cutouts for the main ports controls
and<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:26.130> protected<00:01:26.369> but<00:01:26.880> it's<00:01:27.030> really<00:01:27.360> loose

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
and it's protected but it's really loose

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.870 
and it's protected but it's really loose
it<00:01:27.990> flops<00:01:28.320> off<00:01:28.590> easily<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.280> it's<00:01:29.520> not<00:01:29.670> really

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
it flops off easily and it's not really

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.170 
it flops off easily and it's not really
going<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.380> give<00:01:31.380> much<00:01:31.619> protection<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:33.000> it

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
going to give much protection but it

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.960 
going to give much protection but it
does<00:01:33.360> now<00:01:33.750> give<00:01:34.470> replacement<00:01:35.070> keys<00:01:35.280> over<00:01:35.700> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
access to the microUSB port what we can

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.719 
access to the microUSB port what we can
do<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.939> we<00:01:42.030> can<00:01:42.090> then<00:01:42.270> pop<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.750> into<00:01:42.960> the

around the edge you'll see there from

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.180 
around the edge you'll see there from
the<00:02:06.869> back<00:02:07.049> angle<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> camera<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.039> now

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
the back angle that the camera is now

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.249

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
lay it that way down

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.400 
lay it that way down
we<00:02:11.910> still<00:02:12.150> got<00:02:12.270> access<00:02:12.570> to<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.810> volume<00:02:13.110> keys

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
without going super rugged and it works

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.410 
without going super rugged and it works
on<00:02:34.680> two<00:02:34.920> parts<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.430> fact<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.880> outer<00:02:36.090> shell

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
on two parts the fact the outer shell

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.360 
on two parts the fact the outer shell
takes<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.840> lot<00:02:37.020> of<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.230> impact<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.770> then<00:02:38.250> the

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
takes a lot of the impact and then the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.460 
takes a lot of the impact and then the
inner<00:02:38.640> shell<00:02:38.880> takes<00:02:39.210> a<00:02:39.450> bit<00:02:39.870> of<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.110> impact

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
inner shell takes a bit of that impact

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.430 
inner shell takes a bit of that impact
too<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.400> that's<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.940> tough<00:02:42.210> case<00:02:42.840> in<00:02:43.110> white

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
too so that's the tough case in white

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.060 
too so that's the tough case in white
for<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.830> samsung<00:02:44.280> galaxy<00:02:44.310> s4
