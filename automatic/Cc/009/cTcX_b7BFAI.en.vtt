00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.889 

so<00:00:00.719> we<00:00:00.989> have<00:00:01.319> the<00:00:01.500> radius<00:00:01.800> here<00:00:02.070> now<00:00:02.220> and<00:00:02.899> we

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
so we have the radius here now and we

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.660 
so we have the radius here now and we
also<00:00:04.049> have<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.500> distinguish<00:00:05.100> right<00:00:05.339> or<00:00:05.490> left

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
also have to distinguish right or left

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.870 
also have to distinguish right or left
radius<00:00:06.560> first<00:00:07.560> off<00:00:07.770> we<00:00:08.099> have<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.370> head<00:00:08.610> of<00:00:08.639> the

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
radius first off we have the head of the

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.140 
radius first off we have the head of the
radius<00:00:09.200> now<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.650> different<00:00:11.190> than<00:00:11.490> the

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
radius now this is different than the

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.089 
radius now this is different than the
ulna<00:00:12.450> but<00:00:12.719> as<00:00:12.840> Sam<00:00:13.080> Urick<00:00:13.230> calls<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.679> it's

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
ulna but as Sam Urick calls it it's

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.220 
ulna but as Sam Urick calls it it's
basically<00:00:14.190> like<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.549> shoebox<00:00:14.849> so<00:00:15.599> your<00:00:15.839> head<00:00:16.049> on

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
basically like a shoebox so your head on

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.929 
basically like a shoebox so your head on
the<00:00:16.440> ulna<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.070> distal<00:00:18.140> right<00:00:19.140> there<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
the ulna is distal right there and the

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.259 
the ulna is distal right there and the
radius<00:00:21.359> head<00:00:22.189> is<00:00:23.189> more<00:00:23.369> proximal<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.180> they

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
radius head is more proximal and they

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.990 
radius head is more proximal and they
fit<00:00:24.480> together<00:00:24.600> just<00:00:25.019> like<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.730> but<00:00:26.730> you're

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
fit together just like that but you're

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.460 
fit together just like that but you're
not<00:00:27.060> gonna<00:00:27.240> have<00:00:27.449> both<00:00:27.660> these<00:00:27.869> bulbs<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.289> here

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
not gonna have both these bulbs on here

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.650 
not gonna have both these bulbs on here
so<00:00:28.710> let's<00:00:28.740> stick<00:00:29.070> with<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.340> radius<00:00:29.609> we<00:00:30.510> have

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
so let's stick with the radius we have

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.080 
so let's stick with the radius we have
our<00:00:30.840> head<00:00:31.019> which<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.279> drum<00:00:32.640> kind<00:00:33.000> of

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
our head which is this drum kind of

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.870 
our head which is this drum kind of
looking<00:00:33.360> thing<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.780> then<00:00:34.410> our<00:00:34.500> neck<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:35.640> all

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
looking thing and then our neck just all

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.750 
looking thing and then our neck just all
around<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.649> then<00:00:37.649> we<00:00:37.770> have<00:00:37.800> our<00:00:38.129> shaft<00:00:38.399> which

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
around this then we have our shaft which

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.260 
around this then we have our shaft which
is<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.090> length<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.230> bone<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:41.030> then<00:00:42.030> our

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
is the length of the bone and then our

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.170 
is the length of the bone and then our
radial<00:00:42.809> tuberosity<00:00:43.100> this<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> only<00:00:44.820> big

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
radial tuberosity this is the only big

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.540 
radial tuberosity this is the only big
bump<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.050> bone<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:46.980> pretty<00:00:47.129> easy<00:00:47.370> to

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
bump on the bone so it's pretty easy to

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.810 
bump on the bone so it's pretty easy to
tell<00:00:48.230> you<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.350> also<00:00:49.469> tell<00:00:49.860> whether<00:00:50.610> it's

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
tell you can also tell whether it's

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.939 
tell you can also tell whether it's
right<00:00:51.000> or<00:00:51.149> left<00:00:51.329> because<00:00:51.870> our<00:00:52.530> radial

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
right or left because our radial

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.470 
right or left because our radial
tuberosity<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.520> gonna<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> medial

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
tuberosity is gonna be on the medial

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.040 
tuberosity is gonna be on the medial
side<00:00:54.860> closer<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> ulna<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.930> gonna

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
side closer to the ulna and it's gonna

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.479 
side closer to the ulna and it's gonna
be<00:00:58.230> anterior<00:00:59.000> so<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.149> would<00:01:00.329> be<00:01:00.539> your<00:01:00.899> right

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
be anterior so this would be your right

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.840 
be anterior so this would be your right
radius<00:01:02.489> another<00:01:03.480> thing<00:01:04.820> interosseous<00:01:05.820> border

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
radius another thing interosseous border

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.730 
radius another thing interosseous border
also<00:01:06.420> has<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.200> medial<00:01:07.560> side<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:09.740> we

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
also has to be on the medial side and we

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.460 
also has to be on the medial side and we
have<00:01:10.890> an<00:01:11.280> ulnar<00:01:11.760> notch<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.810> medial<00:01:13.140> side<00:01:13.290> as

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
have an ulnar notch on a medial side as

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.859 
have an ulnar notch on a medial side as
well<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.700> where<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.150> head<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> ulna

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
well this is where the head of the ulna

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.719 
well this is where the head of the ulna
watch<00:01:17.390> after<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.750> we<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.350> our<00:01:19.729> dorsal

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
watch after this we have our dorsal

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.630 
watch after this we have our dorsal
tubercle<00:01:21.270> dorsal<00:01:22.229> means<00:01:22.439> posterior<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.400> back

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
tubercle dorsal means posterior so back

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.940 
tubercle dorsal means posterior so back
our<00:01:24.450> posterior<00:01:24.990> tubercle<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.680> can<00:01:25.799> actually

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
our posterior tubercle you can actually

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.770 
our posterior tubercle you can actually
see<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.610> little<00:01:27.540> groove<00:01:27.720> right<00:01:27.869> there<00:01:29.390> okay<00:01:30.390> so

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
see a little groove right there okay so

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.899 
see a little groove right there okay so
that's<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.110> posterior<00:01:31.560> side<00:01:31.979> that's

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
that's on the posterior side that's

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.870 
that's on the posterior side that's
another<00:01:33.200> way<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.259> determine<00:01:34.920> anterior<00:01:35.729> or

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
another way to determine anterior or

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.020 
another way to determine anterior or
posterior<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:38.250> then<00:01:38.460> our<00:01:38.579> anterior<00:01:38.909> oblique

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
posterior and then our anterior oblique

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.420 
posterior and then our anterior oblique
line<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.810> coming<00:01:40.619> from<00:01:40.799> our<00:01:41.070> radial

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
line is coming from our radial

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.639 
line is coming from our radial
tuberosity<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.570> if<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.750> go<00:01:42.990> back<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.470> our

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
tuberosity so if you go back to our

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.920 
tuberosity so if you go back to our
radial<00:01:43.979> tuberosity<00:01:44.100> right<00:01:44.640> here<00:01:44.880> try<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.750> look

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
radial tuberosity right here try to look

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.889 
radial tuberosity right here try to look
down<00:01:46.229> along<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:48.170> shaft<00:01:49.170> will<00:01:50.159> see<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.430> nice

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
down along this shaft will see a nice

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.969 
down along this shaft will see a nice
line

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
line

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.340 
line
okay<00:01:53.789> let's<00:01:54.119> try<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.420> from<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.780> angle<00:01:54.840> here

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
okay let's try it from this angle here

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.590 
okay let's try it from this angle here
that<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.979> can<00:01:56.159> actually<00:01:56.219> see<00:01:56.549> better<00:01:56.729> Radio

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
that you can actually see better Radio

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.580 
that you can actually see better Radio
tuberosity<00:01:58.700> interosseous<00:01:59.700> border<00:02:00.590> anterior

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
tuberosity interosseous border anterior

tuberosity interosseous border anterior
oblique<00:02:01.619> line<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.969> gonna<00:02:03.119> be<00:02:03.270> kind<00:02:03.479> of

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
oblique line it's gonna be kind of

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.609 
oblique line it's gonna be kind of
curving<00:02:04.049> just<00:02:05.009> like<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.929> okay<00:02:06.929> you<00:02:07.320> actually

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
curving just like that okay you actually

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.460 
curving just like that okay you actually
see<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.069> on<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.670> nice<00:02:09.000> real<00:02:09.300> bone<00:02:09.539> but

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
see it on the on a nice real bone but

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.170 
see it on the on a nice real bone but
always<00:02:11.039> remember<00:02:11.489> that's<00:02:11.640> coming<00:02:11.970> from<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
always remember that's coming from the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.420 
always remember that's coming from the
radial<00:02:12.480> tuberosity<00:02:12.510> and<00:02:13.290> that's<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.160> for<00:02:14.310> the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
radial tuberosity and that's it for the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.730 
radial tuberosity and that's it for the
radius
