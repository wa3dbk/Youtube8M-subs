a very modern way so no tears no fears
other<00:00:52.010> things<00:00:52.309> that<00:00:53.089> are<00:00:54.519> I'm<00:00:55.519> driving<00:00:55.969> down

other things that are I'm driving down

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:03.549 
other things that are I'm driving down
the<00:00:56.269> road<00:00:57.699> in<00:00:59.860> control<00:01:00.890> I'm<00:01:01.129> coupe<00:01:01.399> I<00:01:02.559> just

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
the road in control I'm coupe I just

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.169 
the road in control I'm coupe I just
ripped<00:01:03.769> over<00:01:03.920> right<00:01:04.220> in<00:01:04.369> front<00:01:04.580> of<00:01:04.640> you<00:01:04.759> your

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:05.179 
ripped over right in front of you your

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:07.840 
ripped over right in front of you your
high<00:01:05.360> ritalin<00:01:05.810> goes<00:01:06.020> up<00:01:06.229> you<00:01:06.890> don't<00:01:07.100> shift<00:01:07.460> you

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
high ritalin goes up you don't shift you

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.359 
high ritalin goes up you don't shift you
slow<00:01:08.060> down<00:01:08.300> or<00:01:08.600> you<00:01:08.720> speed<00:01:09.020> up<00:01:09.050> you<00:01:09.410> don't<00:01:09.619> do

slow down or you speed up you don't do

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.870 
slow down or you speed up you don't do
that's<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.570> reason<00:01:11.960> why<00:01:12.110> is<00:01:12.590> because

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
that's and the reason why is because

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.279 
that's and the reason why is because
unless<00:01:13.880> you<00:01:14.149> really<00:01:14.420> know<00:01:14.720> how<00:01:14.899> to<00:01:14.960> drive<00:01:15.229> a

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
unless you really know how to drive a

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.230 
unless you really know how to drive a
car<00:01:15.619> and<00:01:15.920> I<00:01:16.100> mean<00:01:16.310> you<00:01:16.429> really<00:01:16.640> understand

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
car and I mean you really understand

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.999 
car and I mean you really understand
these<00:01:17.330> dynamics<00:01:17.539> what<00:01:18.140> you<00:01:18.259> can<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:18.649> can't<00:01:18.830> do

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
these dynamics what you can and can't do

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.210 
these dynamics what you can and can't do
with<00:01:19.039> the<00:01:19.280> car<00:01:20.020> that's<00:01:21.020> called<00:01:21.289> a<00:01:21.409> known<00:01:21.740> fear

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
with the car that's called a known fear

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.469 
with the car that's called a known fear
what<00:01:22.520> really<00:01:22.909> is<00:01:23.179> happening<00:01:23.210> is<00:01:25.149> you're<00:01:26.149> just

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
what really is happening is you're just

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.260 
what really is happening is you're just
having<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:26.929> educated<00:01:27.890> on<00:01:28.100> how<00:01:30.640> that<00:01:31.640> car<00:01:32.060> can

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
having to educated on how that car can

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.690 
having to educated on how that car can
handle<00:01:32.690> and<00:01:32.929> that<00:01:32.960> that<00:01:33.649> little<00:01:33.920> occasion<00:01:34.250> it

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
handle and that that little occasion it

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.389 
handle and that that little occasion it
wouldn't<00:01:34.940> even<00:01:34.970> matter<00:01:35.270> if<00:01:35.509> you<00:01:35.539> hit<00:01:35.929> the<00:01:36.050> car

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
wouldn't even matter if you hit the car

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.639 
wouldn't even matter if you hit the car
you<00:01:37.399> really<00:01:37.670> wouldn't<00:01:37.880> lose<00:01:38.090> control<00:01:38.479> but<00:01:39.469> you

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
you really wouldn't lose control but you

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.880 
you really wouldn't lose control but you
have<00:01:39.829> to<00:01:39.979> know<00:01:40.930> you<00:01:41.930> have<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.110> have<00:01:42.200> knowledge

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
have to know you have to have knowledge

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.800 
have to know you have to have knowledge
in<00:01:43.070> training<00:01:43.460> on<00:01:43.670> how<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.909> control<00:01:44.299> that<00:01:44.570> car

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
in training on how to control that car

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.590 
in training on how to control that car
so<00:01:45.380> that<00:01:45.560> wouldn't<00:01:45.890> freak<00:01:46.159> you<00:01:46.340> out<00:01:46.399> right<00:01:47.000> and

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
so that wouldn't freak you out right and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.660 
so that wouldn't freak you out right and
so<00:01:47.780> if<00:01:47.930> you<00:01:48.049> didn't<00:01:48.380> know<00:01:48.409> that<00:01:48.500> you<00:01:49.310> might<00:01:49.490> get

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
so if you didn't know that you might get

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.420 
so if you didn't know that you might get
a<00:01:49.789> B<00:01:49.850> what<00:01:50.509> you<00:01:50.570> would<00:01:50.869> just<00:01:51.350> simply<00:01:51.619> relax<00:01:52.130> and

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
a B what you would just simply relax and

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.709 
a B what you would just simply relax and
do<00:01:52.549> what<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.850> right<00:01:53.030> thing<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:53.420> it<00:01:53.509> wouldn't

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:53.719 
do what the right thing and it wouldn't

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:56.560 
do what the right thing and it wouldn't
be<00:01:53.869> a<00:01:53.899> big<00:01:54.110> deal<00:01:54.140> but<00:01:54.409> we<00:01:54.500> be<00:01:54.649> no<00:01:54.770> fear<00:01:55.570> there

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
be a big deal but we be no fear there

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.170 
be a big deal but we be no fear there
would<00:01:56.719> be<00:01:56.750> an<00:01:56.960> attention<00:01:57.409> up<00:01:58.250> skill<00:01:58.700> but<00:01:58.969> do<00:01:59.060> we

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
would be an attention up skill but do we

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.020 
would be an attention up skill but do we
know<00:01:59.329> fear<00:01:59.719> strimling<00:02:00.350> out<00:02:00.770> rate<00:02:01.130> or<00:02:01.460> anything

believe you could fight
let's<00:02:10.880> put<00:02:11.060> it<00:02:11.150> this<00:02:11.180> way<00:02:11.299> most<00:02:11.630> men<00:02:11.870> think

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:12.079 
let's put it this way most men think

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.360 
let's put it this way most men think
they<00:02:12.260> can<00:02:12.290> take<00:02:12.590> care<00:02:12.769> of<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.010> so<00:02:13.160> it's<00:02:13.280> that

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
they can take care of it so it's that

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.009 
they can take care of it so it's that
that's<00:02:13.700> what<00:02:13.970> they<00:02:14.090> gotta<00:02:14.299> say<00:02:14.420> that's<00:02:14.750> the

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
that's what they gotta say that's the

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.580 
that's what they gotta say that's the
inner<00:02:15.590> lie<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.640> we<00:02:16.760> tell<00:02:17.000> us<00:02:17.230> then<00:02:18.230> we<00:02:18.380> can

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
inner lie that we tell us then we can

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.920 
inner lie that we tell us then we can
take<00:02:19.010> care<00:02:19.250> of<00:02:19.370> herself<00:02:19.489> I<00:02:19.910> mean<00:02:20.209> you<00:02:20.750> can

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
take care of herself I mean you can

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.349 
take care of herself I mean you can
think<00:02:21.140> about<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.620> times<00:02:21.890> before<00:02:22.730> mostly

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:23.359 
think about the times before mostly

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:26.229 
think about the times before mostly
almost<00:02:23.660> everybody<00:02:24.079> here<00:02:24.609> fought<00:02:25.609> before<00:02:26.090> they

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
almost everybody here fought before they

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.990 
almost everybody here fought before they
came<00:02:26.420> here<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:27.070> it<00:02:28.070> was<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.250> fighting<00:02:28.579> before

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
came here and it was the fighting before
