00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:03.440
 or the ones that today I want to talk about 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.230
 new all moment 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.320
 efe 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.099
 very appreciated therefore by its 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:11.149
 your flowers 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:14.049
 p as with aroma that 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:15.449
 that emit 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.470
 said works 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.880
 It is one of my gardenia specimens 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.849
 i do the rn do it 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.949
 what I want to talk about in him 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.980
 The videos 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.970
 about your organism 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.410
 It is a plant that needs 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.680
 a beaten earth will be in its thread 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.680
 and what the resistant faker 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.370
 if we used to from the beginning now 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.220
 at temperatures 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.270
 low I know 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.480
 I am not not a supporter of with many people believe 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.720
 that covers more gardenias efe with plastics or tunas pc greenhouse 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.960
 to be put into practice 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.710
 I prefer to buy exemplary gifts in spring 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.790
 and that they are adapting the assets 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.800
 that's why I do not recommend p buying 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.800
 to plant the gardenias directly on land 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.160
 in olympic autumn 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.310
 so the town should be that we plant up gardenia 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.550
 And soon after I decide to change so abruptly I will die 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.840
 as you see now in 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.840
 in June in the third week of June 2011 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.560
 this room fell from gardenia 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.760
 is found in 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.250
 in full bloom and as you see 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.320
 p the efe cup is almost full of flowers 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.440
 the yellow characteristic flower 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.530
 p with some tones in the middle of yellow 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.360
 you can see 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.360
 as it is laden with flowers 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.680

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.260
 so that your camellias 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.999

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:11.179
