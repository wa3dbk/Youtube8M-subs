00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.699
 public 

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:10.039
 security 

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:13.239
 for the ministry 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.910
 we also have strong evidence that the disappearance of these men is 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.330
 a killer known actor if the plans 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.199
 you do not know 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.130
 inter what we are looking for is 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.869
 they did this is when he plays 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:32.780
 you said you worried about young people who are doing 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.270
 teaching them to kill mestizos do not leave us aside from magic I do not 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.300
 surprise 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.650
 the last xx fox report does not want them to be able to fight 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.910
 with the crisis 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.980
 who thinks that we are forming an army of magicians that is exactly what 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.290
 who believe that everyone is arming their forces to attack the ministry 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.100
 it is becoming more practical 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.270
 the others 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.920
 he does not want you to throw away your mother 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.110
 but things do not go at all they have the order 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.110
 8 what you have woken up whenever you can and those benefits 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.660
 that's how it started the last time 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.870
 Bolt said 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.130
 is happening 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.100
 and is that we could 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.810
 someone comes 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.410
 I regret not being able to quote the most 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.400
 at least for now 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 paris is false 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.130
 the attacker 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.000
 we have to know how to defend ourselves 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 always Chinese wants to teach us need more simple 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600
 sea 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.759
 one 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.229
 it's crazy it's unfeasible 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:23.309
 I'm waiting to tell 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.629
 it's not better than the face of toad 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:27.919
 the same 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.739
 after all 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.039
 15s 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:36.039
 the students with needs 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.549
 yes 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.089
 the rider who was crowned party 

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:51.089
 p 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.129
 there is already 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.849
 know who to vote 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.499
 by the teacher 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.109
 the master cepeda 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.109
 someone with defense experience even though those things 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.749
 because who you know if you want a point is enough that says pampatar and 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:19.770
 2002 says it because news 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.770
 the important thing is where is the proof 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.709
 and if foals told us more about the night he died said uribe 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.399
 I will not talk about celtics and they gave notice go away now 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:36.209

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.209
 what the Portuguese coach 

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:47.669
 chaves 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.209
 jarrin I had no idea about that 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.509
 i killed a basilisk 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:54.799
 with this is what we are saying world 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.799
 is true and asked for understanding of a thousand tourists 3 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.329
 and the previous year he fights with 300 coarse officers 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:07.879
 that's why it sounds 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.719
 simple when the designs and pedro 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:13.669
 the crisis was not luck 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.669
 sometimes you do not have news I always had 

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:20.499
 this last destination gelmini is the truth 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.880
 facing those things in real life is not the same as it is not fault 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.440
 If you make a mistake in class, you try the next day but 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.870
 min 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.930
 when you are a second 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.400
 of being killed 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.400
 ccoo to see a very strict friend 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:47.969
 knife 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.330
 if it arose 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.550
 why we need 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.550
 to have the opportunity to win 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.599
 the agents 

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:14.309
 in the sample 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.860
 the army of santomera 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.860
 percent 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.860
 first we need a policy of sanctions in standing the case fatality rate is 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.990
 very small 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.229
 the basketball of life 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:44.259
 nor the clients 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.259

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.349
 link this motion to the plenary 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:53.289
