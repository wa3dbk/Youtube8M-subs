00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.869 
Dreamcast well so far the games already
got<00:00:41.340> me<00:00:41.520> thinking<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.390> hardcore<00:00:42.750> enough

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
got me thinking is it hardcore enough

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.340 
got me thinking is it hardcore enough
start<00:00:44.879> off<00:00:45.120> with<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> only<00:00:45.809> possible

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
start off with the only possible

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.170 
start off with the only possible
criticism<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.160> game<00:00:47.430> in<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:47.910> not

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
criticism of this game in that it's not

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.720 
criticism of this game in that it's not
actually<00:00:48.690> just<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.410> hard<00:00:49.770> enough<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.370> it's

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
actually just that hard enough but it's

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.939 
actually just that hard enough but it's
very<00:00:51.120> fair<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.350> does<00:00:52.530> feature<00:00:52.739> a

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
very fair and it does feature a

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.069 
very fair and it does feature a
checkpoint<00:00:53.399> system<00:00:53.610> which<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.090> like<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.870> makes

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
checkpoint system which I like it makes

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.860 
checkpoint system which I like it makes
you<00:00:55.320> try<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> bit<00:00:56.340> harder<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.730> memorize<00:00:57.480> bullet

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
you try a bit harder to memorize bullet

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.959 
you try a bit harder to memorize bullet
patterns<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.469> get<00:00:59.039> good<00:00:59.219> at<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.430> game<00:00:59.640> and

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
patterns and get good at the game and

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.450 
patterns and get good at the game and
the<00:01:00.719> check<00:01:00.930> points<00:01:01.199> are<00:01:01.289> very<00:01:01.469> fairly<00:01:01.920> spaced

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the check points are very fairly spaced

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.660 
the check points are very fairly spaced
and<00:01:02.789> there<00:01:03.390> are<00:01:03.510> five<00:01:03.719> per<00:01:04.049> level<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.739> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
and there are five per level and the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.030 
and there are five per level and the
Saturn<00:01:06.090> version<00:01:06.240> has<00:01:06.630> limited<00:01:07.200> continues

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.980 

there<00:01:14.040> are<00:01:14.159> eight<00:01:14.400> levels<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> game<00:01:15.479> so

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
there are eight levels to the game so

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.480 
there are eight levels to the game so
coupled<00:01:16.409> with<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.560> checkpoint<00:01:17.040> system

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
coupled with the checkpoint system

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.210 
coupled with the checkpoint system
you've<00:01:18.240> got<00:01:18.270> some<00:01:18.689> real<00:01:19.020> lost<00:01:19.350> ability<00:01:19.619> here

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
you've got some real lost ability here

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.910 
you've got some real lost ability here
it's<00:01:21.180> such<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.479> nice<00:01:21.720> game<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.290> really

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
it's such a nice game that I really

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.590 
it's such a nice game that I really
don't<00:01:23.130> want<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.340> cheat<00:01:23.610> too<00:01:23.759> much<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.360> gets

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
don't want to cheat too much and gets

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.390 
don't want to cheat too much and gets
the<00:01:24.750> last<00:01:24.900> levels<00:01:25.380> through<00:01:25.650> infinite

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
the last levels through infinite

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.609 
the last levels through infinite
continues<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.240> play<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:27.960> Saturn<00:01:28.409> version

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
continues so play the Saturn version

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.039 
continues so play the Saturn version
don't<00:01:29.369> play<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.729> ps2<00:01:30.150> version<00:01:30.180> with<00:01:30.659> infinite

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
don't play the ps2 version with infinite

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.069 
don't play the ps2 version with infinite
continues<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:33.060> second<00:01:33.479> thing<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.720> think<00:01:33.750> is

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
continues the second thing I think is

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.899 
continues the second thing I think is
great<00:01:34.110> about<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.710> game<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.220> difficulty

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
great about this game is the difficulty

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.090 
great about this game is the difficulty
curve<00:01:36.119> which<00:01:36.810> i<00:01:36.960> think<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.320> set<00:01:37.560> about<00:01:37.829> right

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
curve which i think is set about right

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.920 
curve which i think is set about right
you<00:01:38.729> play<00:01:38.970> through<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> first<00:01:39.450> couple<00:01:39.750> of

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
you play through the first couple of

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.050 
you play through the first couple of
levels<00:01:40.079> without<00:01:40.380> really<00:01:41.040> any<00:01:41.280> problems<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
levels without really any problems and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.060 
levels without really any problems and
then<00:01:42.509> things<00:01:42.810> start<00:01:43.110> getting<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.409> bit<00:01:43.439> tough<00:01:43.920> on

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
then things start getting a bit tough on

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.149 
then things start getting a bit tough on
the<00:01:44.130> third<00:01:44.460> level<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.119> crap<00:01:45.509> boss<00:01:45.750> and

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
the third level with this crap boss and

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.410 
the third level with this crap boss and
from<00:01:47.159> there<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.790> really<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.210> got

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
from there on in you really have got

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.270 
from there on in you really have got
your<00:01:48.540> work<00:01:48.600> cut<00:01:48.810> out<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.770> really<00:01:50.100> is

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
your work cut out but it really is

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.789 
your work cut out but it really is
pretty<00:01:50.579> fair<00:01:50.960> third<00:01:51.960> thing<00:01:52.200> that's<00:01:52.380> good<00:01:52.619> is

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
pretty fair third thing that's good is

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.710 
pretty fair third thing that's good is
there's<00:01:53.130> never<00:01:53.399> any<00:01:53.670> shortage<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.240> power-ups

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
there's never any shortage of power-ups

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.289 
there's never any shortage of power-ups
you<00:01:55.219> do<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.460> work<00:01:56.610> for<00:01:56.850> them<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.119> they're

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
you do have to work for them but they're

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.750 
you do have to work for them but they're
always<00:01:57.420> there<00:01:57.750> which<00:01:58.710> seems<00:01:59.009> on<00:01:59.280> greedy

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760

next up we have the reason that the

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.840 
next up we have the reason that the
hitbox<00:03:07.970> is<00:03:08.600> quite<00:03:08.930> small<00:03:09.400> which<00:03:10.400> means<00:03:10.700> in

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
hitbox is quite small which means in

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.760 
hitbox is quite small which means in
combination<00:03:11.420> with<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:12.440> ships

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
combination with the ships

combination with the ships
maneuverability<00:03:13.550> and<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.209> fact<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.480> can

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
maneuverability and the fact you can

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.590 
maneuverability and the fact you can
collect<00:03:14.930> speed<00:03:15.380> up<00:03:15.590> icons<00:03:16.520> means<00:03:17.420> you're

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
collect speed up icons means you're

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.750 
collect speed up icons means you're
actually<00:03:17.690> playing<00:03:18.680> with<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.040> really<00:03:19.489> nicely

actually playing with a really nicely
controlled<00:03:20.330> ship<00:03:20.810> which<00:03:21.590> means<00:03:21.860> that<00:03:22.040> dodging

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
controlled ship which means that dodging

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.970 
controlled ship which means that dodging
is<00:03:22.550> fun<00:03:22.910> I<00:03:23.209> don't<00:03:23.780> get<00:03:23.900> bogged<00:03:24.140> down<00:03:24.260> you<00:03:24.830> can

dying in most cases but is worth saying
