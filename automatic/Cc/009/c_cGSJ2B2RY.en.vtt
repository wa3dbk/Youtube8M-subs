00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
classic VW Beetle I want to show how

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.709 
classic VW Beetle I want to show how
real<00:00:09.210> simple<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:10.849> conversion<00:00:11.849> is<00:00:12.090> from<00:00:12.509> an

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
real simple a conversion is from an

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.620 
real simple a conversion is from an
external<00:00:14.120> regulated<00:00:16.520> alternator<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:18.330> an

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
external regulated alternator is to an

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.310 
external regulated alternator is to an
internal<00:00:19.109> regulated<00:00:19.710> alternator<00:00:20.990> okay<00:00:21.990> so

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
internal regulated alternator okay so

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.200 
internal regulated alternator okay so
right<00:00:22.529> here<00:00:22.560> you'll<00:00:23.430> see<00:00:23.490> it's<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.910> brand-new

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
right here you'll see it's a brand-new

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.650 
right here you'll see it's a brand-new
alternator<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.779> put<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.350> brand<00:00:26.250> new<00:00:26.310> pulley

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
alternator I put in a brand new pulley

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.259 
alternator I put in a brand new pulley
and<00:00:27.660> if<00:00:28.470> you'll<00:00:28.590> take<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.859> look<00:00:29.099> right<00:00:30.029> back

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
and if you'll take a look right back

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.849 
and if you'll take a look right back
here<00:00:30.750> you're<00:00:31.140> going<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.349> see<00:00:31.470> your<00:00:31.679> main

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
here you're going to see your main

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
battery post here a little bit further

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.700 
battery post here a little bit further
back<00:00:35.579> here<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.239> hard<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.480> see<00:00:37.430> there<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.760> a

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
back here it's hard to see there is a

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.090 
back here it's hard to see there is a
your<00:00:40.710> green<00:00:41.399> wire<00:00:41.790> which<00:00:42.510> will<00:00:42.750> go<00:00:42.950> to<00:00:43.950> that

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
your green wire which will go to that

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.760 
your green wire which will go to that
post<00:00:44.309> right<00:00:44.610> there<00:00:44.719> which<00:00:45.719> will<00:00:46.140> lead<00:00:46.469> into

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
post right there which will lead into

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.139 
post right there which will lead into
your<00:00:47.870> in<00:00:48.870> underneath<00:00:49.379> your<00:00:49.590> backseat<00:00:50.149> you'll

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
your in underneath your backseat you'll

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.580 
your in underneath your backseat you'll
have<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> red<00:00:51.629> wire<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:52.430> you'll<00:00:53.430> also<00:00:53.579> have

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
have a red wire and you'll also have

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.069 
have a red wire and you'll also have
your<00:00:55.590> main<00:00:55.770> power<00:00:56.070> wire<00:00:56.219> there<00:00:56.640> as<00:00:56.789> well<00:00:57.079> I'm

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
your main power wire there as well I'm

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.299 
your main power wire there as well I'm
not<00:00:58.199> sure<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:58.410> you<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.530> really<00:00:58.770> see<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.129> but

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
not sure if you can really see it but

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.420 
not sure if you can really see it but
there's<00:00:59.520> also<00:01:00.090> there's<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.690> post<00:01:00.989> there<00:01:01.370> or<00:01:02.370> a

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
there's also there's a post there or a

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.200 
there's also there's a post there or a
ground<00:01:02.940> wire<00:01:03.180> brown<00:01:03.660> wire<00:01:04.220> attached<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
ground wire brown wire attached to the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.399 
ground wire brown wire attached to the
alternator<00:01:06.479> itself<00:01:07.080> as<00:01:07.290> well<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:08.220> every<00:01:09.409> 1974

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
alternator itself as well so every 1974

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.080 
alternator itself as well so every 1974
Super<00:01:10.770> Beetle<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.070> I've<00:01:11.340> come<00:01:11.580> across<00:01:11.610> so

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
Super Beetle that I've come across so

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.750 
Super Beetle that I've come across so
far<00:01:12.380> seems<00:01:13.380> like<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.619> alternators<00:01:14.070> are<00:01:14.220> very

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
far seems like the alternators are very

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.670 
far seems like the alternators are very
in<00:01:15.000> certain<00:01:15.420> ways<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.170> want<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.439> show<00:01:16.590> you

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
in certain ways so I want to show you

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.039 
in certain ways so I want to show you
the<00:01:16.799> original<00:01:16.979> one<00:01:17.340> here<00:01:17.600> here<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.780> my

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
the original one here here is my

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.620 
the original one here here is my
original<00:01:20.780> alternator<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.560> original

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
original alternator and the original

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.179 
original alternator and the original
connection<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.439> here<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:25.890> your<00:01:25.979> red

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
connection so here you have your red

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.910 
connection so here you have your red
wire<00:01:26.430> your<00:01:27.180> brown<00:01:27.420> wire<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.930> your<00:01:28.020> green<00:01:28.229> this

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
wire your brown wire and your green this

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.539 
wire your brown wire and your green this
green<00:01:29.280> wire<00:01:29.490> goes<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:31.259> your<00:01:31.590> regulator<00:01:32.100> which

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
green wire goes to your regulator which

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.530 
green wire goes to your regulator which
is<00:01:32.820> right<00:01:33.119> here

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
is right here

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.679 
is right here
and<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.710> usually<00:01:34.890> will<00:01:35.189> find<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.659> a

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
and you usually will find this this is a

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.600 
and you usually will find this this is a
Motorola<00:01:37.200> one<00:01:37.409> sometimes<00:01:37.799> there's<00:01:37.979> Bosch<00:01:38.220> and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
Motorola one sometimes there's Bosch and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.630 
Motorola one sometimes there's Bosch and
other<00:01:38.759> name<00:01:39.000> brands<00:01:40.130> this<00:01:41.130> happens<00:01:41.490> being

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
other name brands this happens being

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.030 
other name brands this happens being
early<00:01:41.880> making<00:01:42.060> 74<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.110> not<00:01:43.320> exactly

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
early making 74 so it's not exactly

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.389 
early making 74 so it's not exactly
reliable<00:01:44.640> when<00:01:45.329> later<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.689> 96<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.320> 1974<00:01:47.250> they'd

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
reliable when later in 96 in 1974 they'd

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.039 
reliable when later in 96 in 1974 they'd
also<00:01:47.610> actually<00:01:48.060> change<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.540> different<00:01:48.689> kind

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
also actually change to a different kind

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.999 
also actually change to a different kind
of<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:50.030> external<00:01:51.030> regulator<00:01:51.590> anyways<00:01:52.590> as

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
of a external regulator anyways as

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.740 
of a external regulator anyways as
you'll<00:01:53.250> see<00:01:53.460> here<00:01:53.759> again<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.329> have<00:01:54.360> our<00:01:54.479> green
