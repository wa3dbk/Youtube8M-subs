to<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.530> couple<00:03:03.100> large<00:03:03.310> ones<00:03:03.720> that's<00:03:04.720> just<00:03:05.020> me

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
to a couple large ones that's just me

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.910 
to a couple large ones that's just me
but<00:03:06.190> uh<00:03:06.990> you<00:03:07.990> know<00:03:08.080> I<00:03:08.110> spent<00:03:08.200> my<00:03:08.470> entire<00:03:08.560> life

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
but uh you know I spent my entire life

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.640 
but uh you know I spent my entire life
eating<00:03:09.190> fistfuls<00:03:09.490> of<00:03:10.000> things<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.350> it's<00:03:11.560> just

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
eating fistfuls of things so it's just

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.370 
eating fistfuls of things so it's just
kind<00:03:11.860> of<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.280> way<00:03:12.550> my<00:03:12.790> brain<00:03:13.000> is<00:03:13.180> morphed<00:03:13.570> but

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
kind of the way my brain is morphed but

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.290 
kind of the way my brain is morphed but
um<00:03:14.800> one<00:03:15.580> thing<00:03:15.610> I<00:03:15.940> will<00:03:16.000> bring<00:03:16.330> up<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:18.300> most

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
um one thing I will bring up and most

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.120 
um one thing I will bring up and most
candies<00:03:19.840> that<00:03:19.870> produce<00:03:20.230> a<00:03:20.590> giant-sized

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
candies that produce a giant-sized

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.650 
candies that produce a giant-sized
novelty<00:03:24.130> or<00:03:24.160> otherwise<00:03:24.520> suffer<00:03:25.300> from<00:03:25.480> the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
novelty or otherwise suffer from the

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.350 
novelty or otherwise suffer from the
same<00:03:25.690> problem<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:26.650> that<00:03:27.310> is<00:03:27.459> one<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:27.810> volume

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
same problem and that is one of volume

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.530 
same problem and that is one of volume
now<00:03:31.360> you<00:03:31.959> may<00:03:32.080> not<00:03:32.200> remember<00:03:32.470> this<00:03:32.740> from

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
now you may not remember this from

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:43.979 
now you may not remember this from
geometry<00:03:34.950> but<00:03:36.600> as<00:03:39.209> the<00:03:40.209> surface<00:03:40.780> area<00:03:41.110> of<00:03:42.330> a<00:03:43.330> of

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
geometry but as the surface area of a of

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.000 
geometry but as the surface area of a of
an<00:03:44.170> object<00:03:44.950> increases<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:47.080> volume<00:03:47.350> of<00:03:47.860> it

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
an object increases the volume of it

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:55.259 
an object increases the volume of it
increases<00:03:49.000> at<00:03:49.300> a<00:03:49.360> much<00:03:49.810> faster<00:03:49.840> rate<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:54.269> even

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
increases at a much faster rate so even

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.120 
increases at a much faster rate so even
though<00:03:55.300> you<00:03:55.540> may<00:03:55.959> be<00:03:56.709> getting<00:03:58.769> twice<00:03:59.769> as<00:03:59.800> much

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
though you may be getting twice as much

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.910 
though you may be getting twice as much
shell<00:04:00.720> you're<00:04:01.720> going<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:01.930> end<00:04:02.110> up<00:04:02.260> with<00:04:02.560> three

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
shell you're going to end up with three

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.740 
shell you're going to end up with three
times<00:04:03.160> as<00:04:03.430> much<00:04:03.580> chocolate<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.500> think<00:04:05.940> so<00:04:06.940> not

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
times as much chocolate I think so not

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.960 
times as much chocolate I think so not
necessarily<00:04:08.260> don't<00:04:08.560> know<00:04:09.280> you<00:04:09.519> might<00:04:09.640> want<00:04:09.880> to

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
necessarily don't know you might want to

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.690 
necessarily don't know you might want to
get<00:04:10.060> all<00:04:10.950> mathematical<00:04:11.950> on<00:04:12.130> me<00:04:12.310> and<00:04:12.519> actually

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
get all mathematical on me and actually

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.969 
get all mathematical on me and actually
calculate<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.600> volume<00:04:13.750> of<00:04:14.110> M&amp;M<00:04:14.709> but<00:04:16.799> this<00:04:17.799> is

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
calculate the volume of M&amp;M but this is

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.240 
calculate the volume of M&amp;M but this is
a<00:04:18.010> problem<00:04:18.340> I<00:04:18.640> had<00:04:19.290> one<00:04:20.290> a<00:04:20.320> few<00:04:20.500> years<00:04:20.560> ago<00:04:20.830> they

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
a problem I had one a few years ago they

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.270 
a problem I had one a few years ago they
released<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:21.790> gigantic<00:04:23.010> Reese's<00:04:24.010> peanut

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
released the gigantic Reese's peanut

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.680 
released the gigantic Reese's peanut
butter<00:04:24.310> cups<00:04:24.520> I<00:04:24.850> mean<00:04:25.000> seriously<00:04:25.180> there<00:04:25.660> is

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
butter cups I mean seriously there is

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.969 
butter cups I mean seriously there is
the<00:04:26.020> big<00:04:26.200> as<00:04:26.350> your<00:04:26.500> hand<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:28.450> I<00:04:29.440> thought<00:04:29.620> oh<00:04:29.830> my

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.630 
your fist and so of course I bought it
I'm<00:04:40.960> not<00:04:41.110> going<00:04:41.289> to<00:04:41.350> buy<00:04:41.470> a<00:04:41.710> gigantic<00:04:42.340> peanut

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
I'm not going to buy a gigantic peanut

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.710 
I'm not going to buy a gigantic peanut

gigantic peanut butter
up<00:04:44.849> but<00:04:47.310> aside<00:04:48.310> from<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.819> novelty<00:04:49.300> of<00:04:49.330> it<00:04:49.630> the

up but aside from the novelty of it the

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.110 
up but aside from the novelty of it the
were<00:04:50.440> all<00:04:50.620> experience<00:04:51.310> wasn't<00:04:51.639> as<00:04:51.849> good

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
were all experience wasn't as good

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.490 
were all experience wasn't as good
because<00:04:54.509> even<00:04:55.509> though<00:04:55.599> the<00:04:55.720> proportions<00:04:56.349> were

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
because even though the proportions were

because even though the proportions were
the<00:04:56.650> same<00:04:58.289> the<00:04:59.289> volume<00:04:59.560> of<00:04:59.889> it<00:05:00.069> was<00:05:01.000> different

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.009 
the same the volume of it was different

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.980 
the same the volume of it was different
in<00:05:03.009> proportion<00:05:03.970> to<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.180> surface<00:05:04.360> area<00:05:04.660> which

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
means the chocolate the peanut butter

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.900 
means the chocolate the peanut butter
ratio<00:05:09.330> was<00:05:10.330> off<00:05:10.889> see<00:05:11.889> if<00:05:11.919> the<00:05:12.550> peanut<00:05:12.880> butter

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
ratio was off see if the peanut butter

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.809 
ratio was off see if the peanut butter
cup<00:05:13.270> was<00:05:13.449> perfect<00:05:13.990> when<00:05:14.319> you<00:05:14.470> enlarge<00:05:15.340> it<00:05:15.639> it

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:15.819 
cup was perfect when you enlarge it it

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:18.300 
cup was perfect when you enlarge it it
throws<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.180> ratio<00:05:16.750> off<00:05:17.050> just<00:05:17.560> like<00:05:17.650> the

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
throws the ratio off just like the

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.240 
throws the ratio off just like the
chocolate<00:05:18.550> to<00:05:19.300> shell<00:05:19.569> ratio<00:05:20.110> of<00:05:20.409> the<00:05:20.530> mm<00:05:20.979> is

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
chocolate to shell ratio of the mm is

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.719 
chocolate to shell ratio of the mm is
off<00:05:21.460> in<00:05:21.759> these<00:05:21.909> larger<00:05:22.330> eminem's<00:05:23.460> we<00:05:24.460> did<00:05:24.580> not

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
off in these larger eminem's we did not

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:30.089 
off in these larger eminem's we did not
say<00:05:24.970> that<00:05:25.000> they're<00:05:25.240> bad<00:05:25.270> I<00:05:27.150> mean<00:05:28.919> it's<00:05:29.919> pretty

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099 
say that they're bad I mean it's pretty

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.920 
say that they're bad I mean it's pretty
much<00:05:30.280> just<00:05:30.479> bigger<00:05:31.479> than<00:05:31.690> them<00:05:31.840> but<00:05:33.930> explains

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
much just bigger than them but explains

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.050 
much just bigger than them but explains
why<00:05:35.199> I<00:05:35.229> don't<00:05:35.830> really<00:05:36.099> prefer<00:05:36.460> the<00:05:36.849> bigger

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
why I don't really prefer the bigger

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.960 
why I don't really prefer the bigger
ones<00:05:38.280> so<00:05:39.280> for<00:05:39.669> those<00:05:39.849> reasons<00:05:40.060> I<00:05:41.819> would<00:05:42.819> not

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
ones so for those reasons I would not

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:49.589 
ones so for those reasons I would not
eat<00:05:43.300> these<00:05:45.449> given<00:05:46.449> a<00:05:47.159> choice<00:05:48.159> of<00:05:48.849> the<00:05:49.240> normal

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:49.599 
eat these given a choice of the normal

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:55.770 
eat these given a choice of the normal
