testers very simple we're going to
obviously<00:00:17.970> pull<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.539> cap<00:00:18.720> off<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.770> we're

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
obviously pull the cap off and we're

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.460 
obviously pull the cap off and we're
going<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.070> turn<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.640> meter<00:00:20.939> on<00:00:21.260> once<00:00:22.260> the

will begin and doesn't take too long as

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.380 
will begin and doesn't take too long as
you<00:00:31.199> can<00:00:31.380> see<00:00:31.700> what<00:00:32.700> we're<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.000> do<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.300> go

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
you can see what we're going to do to go

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.299 
you can see what we're going to do to go
into<00:00:33.630> calibration<00:00:34.320> mode<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:34.739> calibrate<00:00:35.130> this

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
into calibration mode and calibrate this

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.979 
into calibration mode and calibrate this
tester<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.940> we're<00:00:36.090> going<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.239> hold<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.600> mode

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
tester is we're going to hold that mode

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.680 
tester is we're going to hold that mode
button<00:00:37.380> down<00:00:37.590> till<00:00:38.370> we<00:00:38.399> see<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.820> go<00:00:39.000> through

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
button down till we see it go through

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.860 
button down till we see it go through
off<00:00:40.020> into<00:00:40.739> CA<00:00:41.280> L<00:00:41.579> or<00:00:41.760> calibration<00:00:42.420> mode<00:00:42.600> and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
off into CA L or calibration mode and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.369 
off into CA L or calibration mode and
then<00:00:42.960> we're<00:00:43.079> going<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.260> let<00:00:43.410> go<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.829> button

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
then we're going to let go of the button

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.580 
then we're going to let go of the button
as<00:00:46.879> you<00:00:47.879> can<00:00:48.059> probably<00:00:48.360> see<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:48.960> same<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.410> use

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
as you can probably see it's same to use

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.930 
as you can probably see it's same to use
7.01<00:00:50.579> buffer<00:00:55.250> so<00:00:56.250> we're<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.579> stick<00:00:56.820> it

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
7.01 buffer so we're going to stick it

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.229 
7.01 buffer so we're going to stick it
in<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.059> 7.01<00:00:57.690> buffer<00:00:58.550> and<00:00:59.550> give<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> few

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
in the 7.01 buffer and give it a few

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:11.340 
in the 7.01 buffer and give it a few
seconds

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.740 

once<00:01:11.980> the<00:01:12.159> tester<00:01:12.580> has<00:01:12.760> accepted<00:01:13.600> the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
once the tester has accepted the

once the tester has accepted the
calibration<00:01:14.409> automatically<00:01:15.100> you'll<00:01:15.640> see<00:01:15.880> it

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
calibration automatically you'll see it

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.030 
calibration automatically you'll see it
requests<00:01:16.390> for<00:01:17.020> 0.01<00:01:17.650> buffer

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:36.450 

we'll<00:01:27.040> do<00:01:27.160> a<00:01:27.190> quick<00:01:27.400> rinse<00:01:27.700> in-between<00:01:35.340> put<00:01:36.340> in

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
we'll do a quick rinse in-between put in

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.590 
we'll do a quick rinse in-between put in
for<00:01:36.850> buffer<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.790> give<00:01:39.790> it<00:01:39.880> a<00:01:39.940> few<00:01:40.060> seconds<00:01:40.510> to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
for buffer and give it a few seconds to

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:49.899 
for buffer and give it a few seconds to
automatically<00:01:41.229> accept<00:01:41.590> that<00:01:41.740> calibration

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.809 

all<00:01:50.479> right<00:01:50.710> when<00:01:51.710> it<00:01:51.829> has<00:01:52.009> accepted<00:01:52.579> the

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
all right when it has accepted the

calibration automatically you'll see it

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.989 
calibration automatically you'll see it
just<00:01:54.439> jump<00:01:54.859> right<00:01:54.920> back<00:01:55.069> into<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.759> normal

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:55.999 
just jump right back into the normal

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:57.730 
just jump right back into the normal
measurement<00:01:56.450> mode<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:56.810> you're<00:01:57.109> good<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:57.380> go

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
measurement mode and you're good to go

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.060 
measurement mode and you're good to go
it's<00:01:58.100> really<00:01:58.490> as<00:01:58.579> simple<00:01:58.640> as<00:01:59.030> that
