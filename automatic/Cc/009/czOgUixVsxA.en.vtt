Barney<00:00:11.820> or<00:00:12.000> something<00:00:12.450> it's<00:00:12.660> a<00:00:12.960> really<00:00:13.860> weird

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
Barney or something it's a really weird

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.919 
Barney or something it's a really weird
design<00:00:14.400> it's<00:00:14.940> kind<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.269> like<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.420> mix<00:00:15.660> between<00:00:15.719> a

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
design it's kind of like a mix between a

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.510 
design it's kind of like a mix between a
dragon<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.529> slug<00:00:16.830> or<00:00:17.070> something<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.490> guess

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
dragon and a slug or something I guess

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.870 
dragon and a slug or something I guess
but<00:00:18.199> it's<00:00:19.199> it's<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.949> pretty<00:00:20.130> good<00:00:20.279> pokemon<00:00:20.580> it

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
but it's it's a pretty good pokemon it

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.759 
but it's it's a pretty good pokemon it
wasn't<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.570> good<00:00:21.630> no<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.140> when<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.650> was

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
wasn't that good no you when it was

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.620 
wasn't that good no you when it was
there<00:00:23.070> but<00:00:23.310> now<00:00:23.460> it's<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.390> think

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
there but now it's you you and I think

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.380 
there but now it's you you and I think
it's<00:00:24.900> very<00:00:25.410> viable<00:00:25.830> there<00:00:26.220> as<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.550> prominent

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
it's very viable there as a prominent

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.560 
it's very viable there as a prominent
special<00:00:27.930> attacker<00:00:28.289> however<00:00:29.189> one<00:00:30.060> thing<00:00:30.090> that

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
special attacker however one thing that

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.290 
special attacker however one thing that
people<00:00:30.960> kind<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.260> fail<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.590> forget<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.099> that

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
people kind of fail to forget is that

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.569 
people kind of fail to forget is that
gurus<00:00:33.300> attack<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.899> not<00:00:34.469> too<00:00:34.800> much<00:00:34.950> lower<00:00:35.280> than

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
gurus attack is not too much lower than

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.340

the cool thing about sap zipper

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.990 
the cool thing about sap zipper
is<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.469> most<00:02:13.680> common<00:02:14.099> sleep<00:02:14.370> inducing<00:02:14.790> move

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
is the most common sleep inducing move

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.679 
is the most common sleep inducing move
is<00:02:15.930> sleep<00:02:16.319> powder<00:02:16.579> as<00:02:17.579> well<00:02:17.879> as<00:02:18.000> sport<00:02:18.329> and<00:02:18.510> but

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
is sleep powder as well as sport and but

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.869 
is sleep powder as well as sport and but
both<00:02:18.959> of<00:02:18.989> those<00:02:19.230> are<00:02:19.530> grass-type<00:02:19.950> moves<00:02:20.459> so

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
both of those are grass-type moves so

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.839 
both of those are grass-type moves so
you<00:02:21.540> can<00:02:21.840> come<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.379> safely<00:02:23.340> not<00:02:23.609> to<00:02:23.760> worry
