might<00:00:31.470> want<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.859> support<00:00:32.160> me<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.369> patreon<00:00:32.969> if<00:00:33.450> I

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
might want to support me on patreon if I

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.870 
might want to support me on patreon if I
set<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.020> pear<00:00:34.290> tree<00:00:34.320> look<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.550> if<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.760> had

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
set a pear tree look that is so if I had

to teamspeak for all of you guys then

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.200 
to teamspeak for all of you guys then
you<00:00:37.290> could<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.590> jump<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:37.950> chat<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.460> me<00:00:38.610> game

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
you could just jump in chat with me game

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.389 
you could just jump in chat with me game
with<00:00:39.390> me<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.809> maybe<00:00:40.170> hurt<00:00:40.680> me<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> coil<00:00:41.250> and

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
with me and maybe hurt me a coil and

with me and maybe hurt me a coil and
recording<00:00:41.820> footage<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.270> games<00:00:42.510> as<00:00:42.780> well<00:00:42.989> so

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
recording footage of games as well so

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.959 
recording footage of games as well so
I'll<00:00:43.680> leave<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:43.890> at<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.250> end<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.730> video

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
I'll leave that at the end of the video

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.819 
I'll leave that at the end of the video
so<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.660> same<00:00:45.809> Euler<00:00:45.960> crop<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.440> course<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
so the same Euler crop is of course the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.979 
so the same Euler crop is of course the
test<00:00:47.010> area<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.610> gain<00:00:47.760> access<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.180> after

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
test area that you gain access to after

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.690 
test area that you gain access to after
you<00:00:49.079> spent<00:00:49.350> 50<00:00:49.649> times<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.010> reputation<00:00:50.579> or

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
you spent 50 times in reputation or

normal enemies for minor reputation as
well<00:01:17.549> using<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.180> scanners<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.380> buy

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
well using the scanners that you can buy

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.380 
well using the scanners that you can buy
after<00:01:20.040> town<00:01:20.220> when<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> inside<00:01:20.820> his<00:01:21.030> room<00:01:21.210> as

after town when the inside his room as
well<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:22.439> pretty<00:01:22.650> straightforward<00:01:22.830> stuff

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
well it's pretty straightforward stuff

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.859 
well it's pretty straightforward stuff
but<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:23.850> you're<00:01:23.970> still<00:01:24.150> unsure<00:01:24.299> about<00:01:24.659> this

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
but if you're still unsure about this

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.080 
but if you're still unsure about this
location<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.560> where<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.799> accesses<00:01:26.430> or<00:01:26.580> where

location and where to accesses or where
to<00:01:27.119> buy<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.390> key<00:01:27.659> then<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:28.110> retrace<00:01:28.500> my

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
to buy the key then just retrace my

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.890 
to buy the key then just retrace my
steps<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.579> footage<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.540> should<00:01:30.720> be

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
steps in this footage and you should be

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.399 
steps in this footage and you should be
good<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.229> go

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
good to go

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.649 
good to go
remember<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.400> need<00:01:32.520> 50,000<00:01:33.240> standing

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
remember that you need 50,000 standing

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.690 
remember that you need 50,000 standing
or<00:01:33.750> reputation<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.829> buy<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.130> key

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
or reputation to buy the key

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.280 
or reputation to buy the key
so<00:01:35.970> get<00:01:36.150> scanning<00:01:36.570> with<00:01:36.720> those<00:01:36.900> scanning

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
so get scanning with those scanning

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.140 
so get scanning with those scanning
devices<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.799> Samara<00:01:38.070> says<00:01:38.400> will<00:01:38.909> tell<00:01:39.060> you

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
devices that Samara says will tell you

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.760 
devices that Samara says will tell you
of<00:01:39.210> an<00:01:39.299> OP<00:01:39.420> reputation<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.140> then<00:01:40.290> buy<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.530> key

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
of an OP reputation and then buy the key

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.340 
of an OP reputation and then buy the key
also<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.640> spawn<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.360> certain<00:01:42.780> enemies<00:01:43.110> into

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
also to spawn in certain enemies into

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.289 
also to spawn in certain enemies into
the<00:01:43.619> simulacrum<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.670> need<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.149> them

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
the simulacrum you need to have them

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.300 
the simulacrum you need to have them
scanned<00:01:45.630> plenty<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.170> claims<00:01:46.380> as<00:01:46.649> well<00:01:46.680> you

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
scanned plenty of claims as well you

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.190 
scanned plenty of claims as well you
can't<00:01:47.549> just<00:01:47.729> jump<00:01:47.820> into<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.420> simulacrum<00:01:48.780> and

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
can't just jump into the simulacrum and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.830 
can't just jump into the simulacrum and
spawn<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:49.979> any<00:01:50.220> enemy<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.850> want<00:01:51.119> ones<00:01:51.659> that

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
spawn in any enemy you want ones that

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.660 
spawn in any enemy you want ones that
you<00:01:51.960> haven't<00:01:52.290> scanned<00:01:52.560> will<00:01:52.799> be<00:01:52.979> black<00:01:53.220> -<00:01:53.250> and

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
you haven't scanned will be black - and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.920 
you haven't scanned will be black - and
ones<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.119> haven't<00:01:54.420> scanned<00:01:54.630> enough

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
ones that you haven't scanned enough

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.350 
ones that you haven't scanned enough
will<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.560> kind<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.890> faded<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.820> still<00:01:57.090> can't

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
will be kind of faded so you still can't

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.120 
will be kind of faded so you still can't
spawn<00:01:57.570> them<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.350> hopefully<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.860> helps

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
spawn them in so hopefully this helps

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.350 
spawn them in so hopefully this helps

the<00:04:28.800> last<00:04:29.100> thing<00:04:29.280> I<00:04:29.340> wanted<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.670> talk<00:04:29.880> about

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
the last thing I wanted to talk about

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.220 
the last thing I wanted to talk about
which<00:04:30.300> is<00:04:30.420> something<00:04:30.570> I<00:04:30.780> mention<00:04:31.080> at<00:04:31.140> the

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
which is something I mention at the

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.230 
which is something I mention at the
start<00:04:31.500> of<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:31.770> video<00:04:31.860> is<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.670> possibility

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
start of the video is the possibility

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.240 
start of the video is the possibility
about<00:04:33.720> setting<00:04:34.080> up<00:04:34.170> a<00:04:34.290> patreon<00:04:34.800> for<00:04:35.070> the

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
about setting up a patreon for the

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.070 
about setting up a patreon for the
channel<00:04:35.550> now<00:04:35.940> I'm<00:04:36.060> extremely<00:04:36.510> skeptical

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
channel now I'm extremely skeptical

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.530 
channel now I'm extremely skeptical
about<00:04:37.500> setting<00:04:38.040> up<00:04:38.100> a<00:04:38.190> patreon<00:04:38.580> page<00:04:38.790> for<00:04:39.390> the

about setting up a patreon page for the

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.060 
about setting up a patreon page for the
simple<00:04:39.870> reason<00:04:39.930> it<00:04:40.410> can<00:04:40.680> have<00:04:40.919> a<00:04:40.950> negative

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
simple reason it can have a negative

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.760 
simple reason it can have a negative
effect<00:04:41.790> on<00:04:41.880> people's<00:04:42.720> opinion<00:04:43.050> of<00:04:43.140> you<00:04:43.260> and<00:04:43.500> it

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
effect on people's opinion of you and it

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.050 
effect on people's opinion of you and it
can<00:04:43.919> kind<00:04:44.040> of<00:04:44.160> make<00:04:44.310> you<00:04:44.400> come<00:04:44.580> across<00:04:44.850> as

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
can kind of make you come across as

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:46.760 
can kind of make you come across as
looking<00:04:45.300> greedy<00:04:45.540> or<00:04:45.780> moaning<00:04:45.990> dropping<00:04:46.350> which

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
looking greedy or moaning dropping which

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.440 
looking greedy or moaning dropping which

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
is something I really don't want to do

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.170

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
rewards will have to be more than just

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.580 
rewards will have to be more than just
early<00:04:53.880> access<00:04:54.180> on<00:04:54.360> videos<00:04:54.660> like<00:04:55.140> I<00:04:55.169> see<00:04:55.440> a<00:04:55.470> lot

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
early access on videos like I see a lot

of really really big youtubers do I
don't<00:04:58.110> see<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.530> point<00:04:58.740> in<00:04:59.010> that<00:04:59.040> when<00:04:59.370> you<00:04:59.490> can

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
don't see the point in that when you can

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.950 
don't see the point in that when you can
just<00:04:59.790> wait<00:04:59.910> an<00:05:00.030> extra<00:05:00.300> day<00:05:00.419> and<00:05:00.600> watch<00:05:00.810> the

really really watered like maybe a

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.670 
really really watered like maybe a
community<00:05:06.570> teamspeak<00:05:06.930> where<00:05:07.260> we<00:05:07.440> could<00:05:07.560> all

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
community teamspeak where we could all

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.740 
community teamspeak where we could all
hang<00:05:07.890> out<00:05:08.040> and<00:05:08.220> game<00:05:08.820> together<00:05:09.210> or<00:05:09.510> something

hang out and game together or something

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.150 
hang out and game together or something
like<00:05:09.960> that<00:05:10.110> that<00:05:10.260> makes<00:05:10.500> a<00:05:10.620> really<00:05:10.860> really

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
like that that makes a really really

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.130 
like that that makes a really really
worthwhile<00:05:11.400> I<00:05:11.880> don't<00:05:12.360> know<00:05:12.540> like<00:05:12.750> I<00:05:12.870> said<00:05:13.020> I'm

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
worthwhile I don't know like I said I'm

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.020 
worthwhile I don't know like I said I'm
extremely<00:05:13.470> skeptical<00:05:13.979> of<00:05:14.280> setting<00:05:14.669> one<00:05:14.790> up<00:05:14.820> on

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
extremely skeptical of setting one up on

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.400 
extremely skeptical of setting one up on
it's<00:05:15.210> only<00:05:15.390> I've<00:05:15.870> been<00:05:16.020> getting<00:05:16.229> a<00:05:16.260> few

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
it's only I've been getting a few

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.960 
it's only I've been getting a few
masters<00:05:16.800> is<00:05:16.919> about<00:05:17.130> and<00:05:17.250> this<00:05:17.310> idea<00:05:17.520> of<00:05:17.760> the

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
masters is about and this idea of the

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.510 
masters is about and this idea of the
teamspeak<00:05:18.270> actually<00:05:19.080> came<00:05:19.290> from<00:05:19.520> subscribers

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
teamspeak actually came from subscribers

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.100 
teamspeak actually came from subscribers
so<00:05:20.669> that's<00:05:21.180> why<00:05:21.330> I'm<00:05:21.479> putting<00:05:21.510> it<00:05:21.810> right<00:05:21.840> there

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110
