shades<00:02:35.530> of<00:02:35.680> brown<00:02:35.770> and<00:02:36.330> then<00:02:37.330> I'm<00:02:37.840> going<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.140> go

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
shades of brown and then I'm going to go

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.100 
shades of brown and then I'm going to go
over<00:02:38.320> it<00:02:38.620> with<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:39.220> highlight<00:02:40.120> color<00:02:40.150> again

over it with a highlight color again

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.870 
over it with a highlight color again
from<00:02:41.320> phase<00:02:41.530> 2<00:02:41.800> I<00:02:41.830> don't<00:02:42.220> have<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.430> name<00:02:42.580> for

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
from phase 2 I don't have the name for

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.420 
from phase 2 I don't have the name for
it<00:02:42.970> because<00:02:43.150> I'm<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:44.410> pallets<00:02:44.830> never<00:02:45.130> written

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
it because I'm the pallets never written

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.890 
it because I'm the pallets never written
on<00:02:45.580> them<00:02:45.730> but<00:02:45.820> it's<00:02:45.970> very<00:02:46.120> similar<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.480> shroom

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
on them but it's very similar to shroom

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.220 
on them but it's very similar to shroom
so<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:47.350> would<00:02:47.470> work<00:02:47.500> as<00:02:47.830> well<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:49.840> if<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:50.050> can

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
so that would work as well so if you can

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.900 
so that would work as well so if you can
see<00:02:50.410> that<00:02:50.440> it<00:02:50.740> is<00:02:50.770> it's<00:02:51.040> very<00:02:51.130> very<00:02:51.580> similar<00:02:51.790> to

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
see that it is it's very very similar to

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.430 
see that it is it's very very similar to
true<00:02:52.180> then<00:02:54.660> when<00:02:55.660> I<00:02:55.690> decided<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.200> make<00:02:56.320> this

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440
