00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
people like to do that basically we've

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.580 
people like to do that basically we've
already<00:01:13.149> took<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.780> liberty<00:01:14.080> of<00:01:14.110> starting

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
already took the liberty of starting

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.800 
already took the liberty of starting
just<00:01:14.770> for<00:01:14.920> time<00:01:15.159> we've<00:01:15.850> already<00:01:16.030> excavated

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
just for time we've already excavated

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.840 
just for time we've already excavated
out<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.140> trench<00:01:17.470> where<00:01:18.250> we're<00:01:18.369> going<00:01:18.580> to<00:01:18.670> put

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
out the trench where we're going to put

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.600 
out the trench where we're going to put
the<00:01:18.970> wall<00:01:19.180> we<00:01:19.810> feel<00:01:20.170> that's<00:01:20.380> that<00:01:20.799> trench<00:01:21.250> with

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
the wall we feel that's that trench with

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.370 
the wall we feel that's that trench with
a<00:01:21.640> at<00:01:22.360> least<00:01:22.630> six<00:01:22.960> inches<00:01:23.110> of<00:01:23.439> a<00:01:23.530> crushed<00:01:23.830> stone

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
a at least six inches of a crushed stone

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.320 
a at least six inches of a crushed stone
roughly<00:01:26.380> two<00:01:26.560> foot<00:01:26.830> wide<00:01:26.860> and<00:01:27.430> six<00:01:28.000> inches

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
roughly two foot wide and six inches

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.380 
roughly two foot wide and six inches
deep<00:01:29.220> from<00:01:30.220> this<00:01:30.400> point<00:01:30.610> on<00:01:30.850> we're<00:01:31.060> now<00:01:31.180> going

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
deep from this point on we're now going

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.030 
deep from this point on we're now going
to<00:01:31.509> compact<00:01:31.930> this<00:01:32.140> to<00:01:32.290> get<00:01:32.409> a<00:01:32.439> good<00:01:32.650> solid<00:01:32.860> base

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
to compact this to get a good solid base

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.679 
to compact this to get a good solid base
and<00:01:33.520> then<00:01:33.610> we'll<00:01:33.790> start<00:01:34.060> putting<00:01:34.299> in<00:01:34.540> our

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
and then we'll start putting in our

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:57.899 
and then we'll start putting in our
block

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.010

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
moisture content of your base before

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.440 
moisture content of your base before
compaction<00:02:00.770> is<00:02:00.890> very<00:02:01.130> essential<00:02:01.460> today<00:02:01.850> our

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
compaction is very essential today our

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.060 
compaction is very essential today our
material<00:02:02.990> was<00:02:03.109> a<00:02:03.140> little<00:02:03.350> bit<00:02:03.469> dry<00:02:03.649> so<00:02:03.679> we<00:02:03.890> had

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
material was a little bit dry so we had

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.010 
material was a little bit dry so we had
to<00:02:04.159> add<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:04.280> little<00:02:04.340> bit<00:02:04.520> water<00:02:04.789> to<00:02:05.450> get<00:02:05.899> our

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
to add a little bit water to get our

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.259 
to add a little bit water to get our
proper<00:02:06.350> compaction<00:02:06.740> to<00:02:07.549> drive<00:02:07.819> will<00:02:08.090> not

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
proper compaction to drive will not

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.180 
proper compaction to drive will not
compact<00:02:08.660> who<00:02:08.840> want<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.319> wet<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:09.890> will<00:02:10.009> not

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
compact who want to wet it will not

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.280 
compact who want to wet it will not
compact<00:02:10.640> so<00:02:11.269> at<00:02:11.390> this<00:02:11.510> point<00:02:11.720> we've<00:02:11.959> got<00:02:12.140> our

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
compact so at this point we've got our

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.259 
compact so at this point we've got our
base<00:02:12.440> in<00:02:12.739> or<00:02:13.069> leveling<00:02:13.550> pad<00:02:13.730> in<00:02:13.970> we're

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
base in or leveling pad in we're

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.080 
base in or leveling pad in we're
compacted<00:02:14.900> we're<00:02:15.530> fixing<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:16.040> add<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.760> little

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
compacted we're fixing to add a little

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.280 
compacted we're fixing to add a little
bit<00:02:17.299> of<00:02:17.450> what<00:02:17.629> we<00:02:17.750> call<00:02:17.959> a<00:02:18.230> 89<00:02:19.010> here<00:02:20.019> just<00:02:21.019> for<00:02:21.200> a

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
bit of what we call a 89 here just for a
