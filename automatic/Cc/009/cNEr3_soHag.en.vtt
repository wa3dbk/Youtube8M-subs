00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.940
 welcome back to what you see framed 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.759
 is the subject of today's tutorial 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.310
 Today we make these earrings that I have 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.189
 called Artemisia is the guro that I am 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.840
 simple earrings to make fast 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:27.240
 to do but in my opinion very very nice 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.029
 I like them are too pretty and 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.239
 I wanted to use these colors 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:37.469
 because I find this white 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.980
 pearl combined with this dull silver 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.540
 antique or I find it very fascinating 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.960
 I hope now I hope you can enjoy it too 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.190
 to you 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.200
 and then I leave you to the tutorial we insert 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.030
 4 July on the line 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.730
 we return to all in the opposite direction 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.070
 therefore to close it also circle for 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.100
 two or three times so that the thread 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.699
 is firmly within them 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:07.830
 then we take ourselves out of one 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:12.830
 we take on two super duo wade ed 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.830
 we enter the next taxis 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.460
 here we repeat the operation for the 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:25.799
 three more points then two super 2's here 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:30.659
 two here and 2 here we are coming out now with 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:34.520
 the thread from a super duo in practice since 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:38.189
 upper hole of the super duo 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.579
 this you see here there is the rulla this 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:46.939
 super duo then we thread one 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:50.009
 twist a tris and enter the roll 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:57.110
 superior of the first super duo of the 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:02:01.930
 next couple and pull well 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:05.180
 then we slip a white 11 0 fortress 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:10.820
 a super duo of the other color and a 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:13.970
 another cai 11 0 white and we enter the 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.340
 super duo next always in the 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.270
 small hole above 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.870
 in this way and proceed as I have 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:28.190
 shown now until all the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.100
 I go out now with the thread from the first 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.630
 fortress 11 0 inserted in the lap that 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.620
 we have just finished 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:40.430
 see this that precedes the super duo 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:45.530
 then we insert on our 3do kyle line 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:48.709
 11 0 of the color aluminum silver ed 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:56.450
 enter the top of the hole 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:03:03.320
 super duo you see this then we insert to the 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:08.390
 33 fortress el 11 0 and we enter the fortress 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:11.540
 el 11 0 of the base in the super duo in the 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:18.519
 still twist the super duo and go out 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.519
 finally in the fortress the next 11 0 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.330
 in this way we pull the thread well 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.580
 here we are and we are ready to repeat 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.360
 what we have just done for 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:34.850
 complete all the way we are going out 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:37.070
 now with the wire inserted from 3 11 0 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:41.540
 in the round just finished you see just 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:45.790
 here and we will have to insert three fortresses on 11 0 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:51.950
 this time in white and enter 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:54.670
 in the three fortresses the following 11 0 in 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.670
 this way 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:03.080
 then continue for all the beads that 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.750
 we meet up to take us out 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.650
 on the other it aims to repeat 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.540
 the insertion of three seed beads 11 0 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:16.180
 always the same as these then repeat 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.180
 the operation for another two or three times 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:23.120
 let's go out now with the thread from a rock the 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.930
 11 0 central of one of the small groups from 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.110
 three 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:33.820
 insert on the thread a pearl and 5 fortress 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:37.490
 11 silver zero we return to the pearl 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:43.730
 in the fortress 11 0 of the base but in 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:46.100
 reverse sense and then go back over 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.740
 inside both the pearl and the 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.140
 rails of this which will be ours 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.020
 understood where we are going to put then the 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.150
 nun two or three times to make sure 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.030
 that in short it is 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.180
 a safe processing for any 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.520
 bumps or such things 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.770
 done this then we pass with the thread 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.790
 through all the beads up to 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.950
 exit the central rail 11 0 of 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.540
 this group of three exactly 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.540
 that of the opposite side 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.220
 let's go out now as you see from this fortress 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.410
 l 11 0 the central of this group 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.660
 from three exactly group of 3 or 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.790
 place what we have just worked 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.550
 then insert 2 seed beads on the wire 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:35.540
 the eleven zero silver a sad local 2 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:40.120
 11 zero silver and we return to it 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.120
 11 0 base from which we are leaving 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:47.360
 then we return with the thread inside the 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.070
 rails the twister erokhin finally to 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.140
 this fortress and base we say for 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.240
 weld this ours a little 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.610
 pendant we pass with the thread 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.160
 inside the beads up to 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.260
 fix it well maybe we can too 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:04.070
 make a couple of notaries and we cut 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:06.290
 the surplus of thread remaining here 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.350
 finished also the second licker like 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.580
 See, I put a little ring through 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.350
 inside the drawer we have 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.750
 done and then I put a simple one 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.580
 monachella our ricchini are 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.780
 finished what you like you like 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.330
 this project 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:24.920
 I find it a simple project and 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:28.070
 quick to do but a little to say 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:29.500
 feature and a bit for the juxtaposition of 

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.650
 colors 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.990
 let me have such simple earrings 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:37.450
 how particular I hope you think 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.280
 so you also let me know below 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.260
 comments really if you like them there 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.170
