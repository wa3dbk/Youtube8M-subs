00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
how effective it is and it centers

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.880 
how effective it is and it centers
around<00:00:32.430> using<00:00:32.969> blitzkrieg<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:34.290> get<00:00:34.469> builders

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
around using blitzkrieg to get builders

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.920 
around using blitzkrieg to get builders
moving<00:00:35.700> quicker<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:37.340> using<00:00:38.629> see<00:00:39.629> what<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.840> it

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
try to compress them in the 10 minutes

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.990 
try to compress them in the 10 minutes
but<00:01:03.870> there<00:01:04.019> long<00:01:04.260> they<00:01:04.920> are<00:01:05.100> long<00:01:05.339> battles<00:01:05.850> i'm

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
alright pretty much I'm moving in for

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.679 
alright pretty much I'm moving in for
the<00:01:20.040> attack<00:01:22.549> to<00:01:23.549> another<00:01:24.299> part<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.570> this

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
the attack to another part of this

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.289 
the attack to another part of this
tactic<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.380> use<00:01:25.650> fanaticism<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.909> make<00:01:27.090> your

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
tactic is to use fanaticism to make your
