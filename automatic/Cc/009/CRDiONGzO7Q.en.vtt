00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.070
 Y 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:20.900
 hello guys how are you today 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:23.619
 he makes eye-catching and seductive eyes 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.610
 out there I'm going to use this palette of 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.220
 anastasia that was also a gift to 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.289
 a friend and we are going to apply this color 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.070
 like an orange an orange a little 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.540
 bright we are going to put it in our 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.480
 our mobile eyelid but only the 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.220
 part of the inside area and the same 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.989
 we're going to blur a little bit with that 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.350
 brush I will use this shadow as 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.170
 one color came and we're going to apply it with 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.719
 a brush that is not so big and what 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.030
 What we are going to do is unite those 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.070
 two colors for this also to 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.079
 little touches you can go joining them with him 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.530
 since one is very dark and the other is 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.530
 more clear 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.380
 that we're going to go patting 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:10.410
 this and also raising a little the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.080
 color until more or less feel that 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.630
 little bone we have 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.440
 in this way 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.580
 that little by little we raise 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.580
 what is the color 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.290
 Y 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.289
 yes 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.150
 then with a brush to blur what 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.500
 let's do is grab a little bit of 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.590
 that color and we are going to blur 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.330
 that we grabbed a little bit of that color and 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.330
 we blur again 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.290
 ok for this to blur is better than 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.440
 Take your time to be able 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.680
 blur it is very easy to blur if it is 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.870
 that you do it with patience and well 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.870
 in circular shapes it becomes easier 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.670
 I'm going to take this black shadow that's coming 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.440
 from the same palette and I'm going to apply it in 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.990
 the part there of cesc and half 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.300
 but let's apply it gently 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.230
 I 'm also not pushing too hard 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.340
 the brush only slowly nothing more than 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.340
 space but sure 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.900
 that I'm raising the color but what 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.900
 I do softly 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.930
 Now what we are going to do again is 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.569
 grab a bit of the color like an ink 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.209
 and we are going to blur as you can see 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:03.340
 more or less we already have something of 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.340
 smudged there on the eyelid 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.810
 use a black pencil can be 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.060
 I am using any of the 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.300
 the smoky palette that comes with a pencil 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.720
 black and it's super black and this is a hate 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:23.209
 a gandhi cake that says 24 hours or something 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.209
 well but it's a very very good pencil 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.510
 good at the bottom what we're going 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.170
 to do is use the same color this 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.900
 like wine color let's put it down ok 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.579
 let's put it does not matter if it comes out 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.489
 thick does not matter because as a me I do not 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.890
 applied base or nothing then that then 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.350
 it can be corrected 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.670
 we're going to apply it and we're going to put it together 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.670
 little with the top 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.690
 after that we will apply also 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.910
 black shadow with the same brush and this 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.240
 shadow on the side we're going to put more 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.970
 inwards and that will help us 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:07.510
 that our eyes look much more 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.510
 striking 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.370
 that as a smoked guy we're going to do 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.100
 down but we still do not have the 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.050
 smoked 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.959
 then we have done this as they can 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:22.240
 see we have spotted quite a bit so with 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.060
 a make-up remover wipe what we're going 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.010
 to do is to clean and let's make a 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.870
 small cut 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.480
 that for our makeup to be 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.690
 see a little cleaner then I'll apply 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:40.600
 mimi base because he had nothing base and 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.600
 nothing at all so let's apply 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.370
 good and after that we will use 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.830
 this vanilla shadow of visu and let's 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.960
 apply on the bone of the eyebrows and 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.160
 let's blur a little bit with the 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.160
 shadow from below 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:00.849
 what then we will use the other 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.979
 brush but let's clean up a 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:05.050
 little bit and we're going to blur all that 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.689
 bottom part as you can see it looks 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.119
 super marked and I do not want that what 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:12.909
 I want is that as I want it to look 

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:15.699
 look more like seductive then 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:20.110
 I want him to look like a smoked guy 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:22.569
 so with a lot of patience with a 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.709
 brush that is not so big to be able 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:29.769
 perform this this function so let's 

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:32.769
 to blur little by little as you can see 

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:35.429
 as you can see, you get blurred 

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:35.429
 Quick 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.169
 yes 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.630
 Y 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.070
 and then use the gel and let's do 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.890
 a delineated delineate does not have to 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:59.140
 be super big or anything we're going to do 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.850
 let's guide us only with the tail 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:04.150
 have to end up in that court that 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:06.970
 we have done so the 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:12.000
 the little tail is not going to be super long or 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.000
 super big only in that way 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.640
 ok now I'm going to use two tabs 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.670
 luxe and those and more or less than being 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.740
 result before that I apply mask and 

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.410
 applied this mask that I am already 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.860
 to finish because I am already using 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:37.900
 pretty so let's move on further down 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.900
 that up because he did not apply much 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.190
 Y 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.639
 Y 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.680
 yes 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.129
 a house 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:04.099
 because we are going to put our tabs 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:06.439
 false if you do not like it good 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:08.599
 you can use some simpler ones or 

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:10.789
 just do not use tabs 

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:14.120
 false but I like to use them 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:16.069
 so well let's paste the and then 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.379
 after that we are going to paint the line 

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:20.449
 where we have stuck the one that is false 

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:22.939
 so you can not so you can not see 

00:07:20.449 --> 00:07:24.680
 ugly the finish because there will be going over 

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:27.800
 in case you see the union so no 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.289
 we want to see that and then you can use 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:34.879
 this lipstick is called a pawn and if not me 

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:36.469
 it is wrong and you are the lg 792 

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:38.479

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:40.610
