in<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:30.370> know<00:02:30.519> clans<00:02:31.090> are<00:02:31.329> kind<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.600> cheating

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
in and I know clans are kind of cheating

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.850 
in and I know clans are kind of cheating
now<00:02:32.110> since<00:02:32.560> he<00:02:33.190> leads<00:02:33.459> not<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.880> best<00:02:34.860> the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
now since he leads not the best the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.890 
now since he leads not the best the
because<00:02:36.519> I<00:02:36.760> don't<00:02:36.970> know<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.510> didn't<00:02:37.750> really

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
because I don't know it didn't really

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.699 
because I don't know it didn't really
work<00:02:38.170> as<00:02:38.410> good<00:02:38.590> as<00:02:38.769> it<00:02:38.890> did<00:02:39.100> on<00:02:39.130> Mon<00:02:39.400> for<00:02:39.610> three

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
work as good as it did on Mon for three

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.710 
work as good as it did on Mon for three
and<00:02:41.730> it's<00:02:42.730> kind<00:02:42.880> of<00:02:43.060> sad<00:02:43.239> about<00:02:43.359> that<00:02:43.480> but

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
and it's kind of sad about that but

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.030 
and it's kind of sad about that but
this<00:02:45.080> is<00:02:45.260> something<00:02:45.530> we<00:02:45.590> have<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.740> deal<00:02:45.890> with

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
this is something we have to deal with

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.700 
this is something we have to deal with
and<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:47.210> think<00:02:47.450> holiday<00:02:47.930> egos<00:02:48.170> might<00:02:48.440> be<00:02:48.560> better

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
and I think holiday egos might be better

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.430 
and I think holiday egos might be better
since<00:02:49.190> it's<00:02:49.400> just<00:02:49.640> more<00:02:49.850> of<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.440> Infinity

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
since it's just more of the Infinity

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.880 
since it's just more of the Infinity
Ward's<00:02:51.880> so<00:02:52.880> hopefully<00:02:53.690> elite<00:02:54.350> will<00:02:54.560> be<00:02:54.680> better

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
Ward's so hopefully elite will be better

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.580 
Ward's so hopefully elite will be better
