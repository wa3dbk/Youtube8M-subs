00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.699 
use the 12 hour it's just my preference
so<00:02:28.709> 8:30<00:02:29.550> and<00:02:30.080> that's<00:02:31.080> pretty<00:02:31.320> much<00:02:31.470> how<00:02:31.680> you

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
so 8:30 and that's pretty much how you

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.000 
so 8:30 and that's pretty much how you
set<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.010> up<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:33.050> you<00:02:34.050> want<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.410> be<00:02:34.530> at<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.770> main

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
set it up so you want to be at the main

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.220

time<00:02:35.310> when<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:36.030> hold<00:02:36.330> down<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.870> second

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
time when you hold down the second

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.130 
time when you hold down the second
button<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:38.190> edit<00:02:38.520> it<00:02:38.850> I<00:02:39.150> guess<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:39.780> could<00:02:39.930> say
