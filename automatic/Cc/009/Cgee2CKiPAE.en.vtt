00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.350
 hello to everyone for our hand my 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.269
 need a roll of puff pastry 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:18.100
 the redder the better I jam 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:21.390
 I chose that with berries and 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.390
 almonds already shelled 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.640
 first we take a card 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.779
 where we have precisely cut from mafer 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.680
 our hand rested on the 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.680
 puff pastry 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.100
 here we go to cut health 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.290
 we need a lot of our hands here 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.460
 in fact, I left the area 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.660
 sister because she knows exactly 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.660
 practically zero 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.899
 we remove the edges we help each other with with a 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.120
 knife 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.769
 also because as you know the pasta 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.879
 puff very very thin then 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:01.829
 however we must pay attention to 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.259
 this point we take the almonds and le 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.310
 rest on the fingers 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.299
 just like they were nails 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:15.840
 let's just make it very light 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:19.170
 pressure bake in oven 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.350
 preheated to 180 degrees for 15 minutes 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.350
 about 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.650
 here is our hand as you see 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.360
 some almonds have come off and for 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.870
 hang up simply let's take a 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.930
 little bit of jam and the reality I call 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.550
 so he also quotes a bit of 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.630
 that blood effect on the longs that 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.630
 not bad 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.560
 and here it is ready 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.930
 obviously this is not a version 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.530
 very edible in the sense that I have it 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.660
 made more known to give that 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.750
 that color in parenthesis more fearful 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.930
 but if you want a more version 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.170
 eatable just let it cook less 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.720
 you will surely have a different color 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.910
 however it will be equally to the loved ones born in 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:18.820
 see this time used the 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.430
 puff pastry that they sell in the 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.580
 frozen department for the simple fact 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.790
 which is a type of pasta that generally does not 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.650
 tends to grow a lot in the oven then 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.230
 I wanted to opt for that because 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.530
 otherwise if the hand then grows too much 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.630
 therefore it is a little too deformed 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.420
 no need to take it by force 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.340
 the pasta is fresh there from the counter 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.890
 mobile fridge also frozen one not 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:51.400
 worry it's nothing that some photos 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:54.100
 poster or recipe also on the blog vi 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.730
 I send a kiss and feel fresher 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.730
 bye Bye
