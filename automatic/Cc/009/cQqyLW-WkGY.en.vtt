00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.490
 as a vet where people check to see if the condition of a pony or 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.240
 a few it is good 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.020
 yes i like you 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.469
 10 have not completed all the complex reports 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.029
 then you take the pulse 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.629
 that's it that's always the best month for us you look at hama and it is 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:17.300
 just see the outside 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.619
 wonderfully simple with him and a watch to count the number of strokes per minute 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.119
 still on the pulse 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.110
 how can I say the 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.370
 measuring the post of my pony or horse and linking it to that conclusion 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.140
 is because simple 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.440
 well at the head z then both cards cover could be there is one 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.660
 it rather has radar 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.810
 and you can therefore for the knock you have very carefully driven fingers 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:46.879
 put it under the map and slide it back and forth until you feel that person 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.260
 so don't close it 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.210
 and then you feel musk lop lover with your hand and then you can 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.170
 just count 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.040
 the neighborhood with my watch 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.100
 and how do you do that then how long should count 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.250
 10 you can do a thicker one that we will do soon 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.420
 doing is counting 15 seconds and then multiplying by four 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.640
 the tastiest but sometimes some sort of was dangerous with the head you can 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.710
 had ten seconds and then multiplied by 6 also 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.680
 Well then you know the number of hard beats per minute 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.950
 and that is normal what she had to assume 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.640
 after the normal heartbeat and in Russia after about 40 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.820
 it's a horse that stands out 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.070
 say moderate in spans 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.950
 both 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.080
 then around sixty 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.270
 and a few vicious extreme authority that can 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.550
 easily go in the direction of 120 160 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.580
 how can i make sure that she is in good condition with my horse or pony 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.220
 just improved by working at home 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.220
 how can that best be tackled with the help of a heartbeat 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.350
 So measure the heart rate 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.700
 see if that is not too high such an example and a bit too 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.930
 watch the general condition of a horse's sweat and breathing 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.930
 and then the sjiem bit that you like it 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.479
 at a low heart rate 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.979
 get a separate waves fairly and then don't go but first you agree 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:16.529
 restore state and then 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:20.889
 that pass the work on party is going to expand so slowly that you are longer 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.549
 time to do your work are other things that improve the condition of a horse or 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.779
 pony can improve 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.269
 but who 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.980
 of course I have the amount of exercise that you just get the horses ponies 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.809
 if you stand so many buildings and you go and say loose in the 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:38.470
 meadow or whatever 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.060
 we will also see that the condition thereof has improved 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.199
 more space and more exercise always gives this condition 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.459
 you can do something with upbringing and 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.359
 another management 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.949
 we will also be able to get china counter results 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:58.859
 How essential is it ultimately to just condition your horse or pony 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.839
 good to have 

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:06.289
 this is essential for your ears as well as for sports 

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:07.239
 sold a lot of money
