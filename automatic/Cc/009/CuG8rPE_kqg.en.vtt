00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
more of a casual style and you need to

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.410 
more of a casual style and you need to
fit<00:05:36.860> a<00:05:37.070> little<00:05:37.370> bit<00:05:37.490> more<00:05:37.670> than<00:05:37.850> the<00:05:37.940> basics

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
fit a little bit more than the basics

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.370 
fit a little bit more than the basics

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
kind of lock in place I think this is

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.500 
kind of lock in place I think this is
more<00:05:45.020> worth<00:05:45.620> the<00:05:46.100> money<00:05:46.340> I<00:05:46.580> would<00:05:47.090> have<00:05:47.120> paid

would ever pay the full 195 for this

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.190 
would ever pay the full 195 for this
because<00:05:58.760> it's<00:05:59.060> a<00:05:59.120> little<00:05:59.330> bit<00:05:59.450> too<00:05:59.660> small<00:06:00.020> to

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
because it's a little bit too small to

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.390 
because it's a little bit too small to
be<00:06:00.310> daily<00:06:01.310> practical<00:06:02.860> now<00:06:03.860> I'm<00:06:03.980> not<00:06:04.130> gonna<00:06:04.250> go

an<00:06:11.960> everyday<00:06:12.290> bag<00:06:12.590> I'm<00:06:12.770> finding<00:06:13.100> it<00:06:13.190> just<00:06:13.370> a

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
an everyday bag I'm finding it just a

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.240 
an everyday bag I'm finding it just a
little<00:06:13.640> bit<00:06:13.880> too<00:06:14.090> small<00:06:14.410> so<00:06:15.410> overall<00:06:15.800> I<00:06:16.190> don't

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
little bit too small so overall I don't

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.590 
little bit too small so overall I don't
think<00:06:16.610> this<00:06:16.730> is<00:06:16.760> worth<00:06:17.060> the<00:06:17.240> full<00:06:17.420> retail

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
think this is worth the full retail

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.020 
think this is worth the full retail
price<00:06:17.810> but<00:06:18.470> I<00:06:18.680> do<00:06:18.800> think<00:06:19.340> this<00:06:19.490> is<00:06:19.730> you<00:06:19.910> can

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
price but I do think this is you can

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.970 
price but I do think this is you can
just<00:06:20.210> feel<00:06:20.450> the<00:06:20.810> leather<00:06:21.020> just<00:06:21.260> feels<00:06:21.500> nicer

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:21.980 
just feel the leather just feels nicer

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.730 
just feel the leather just feels nicer
and<00:06:22.220> I<00:06:22.460> think<00:06:23.000> this<00:06:23.120> is<00:06:23.300> a<00:06:23.480> more<00:06:23.810> versatile<00:06:24.530> bag

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740
