00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.820
 hello friends of learning 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:10.590
 dotcom beauty today I will teach you 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.519
 how to make a hairstyle for girls with 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.679
 leagues I hope you like it 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.560
 The first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:22.009
 split from ear to ear going through the 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.680
 crown and to this division we are going to 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.289
 make some subdivisions in the form of 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.359
 rectangle 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.480
 this subdivision we will not do more 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:34.059
 less than two fingers all depending on the 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.949
 thickness that they want to do we are going to 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:42.350
 comb backwards we collect the hair 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:45.920
 with a rubber like this in this way 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.430
 we do a side and then we follow the 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.430
 other side 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.210
 the little pieces that we are going to use to 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.519
 decorate the hairstyle we can use 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.370
 depending on the decoration that you 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.589
 let's put on the hairstyle or the clothes 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.869
 have the girl put we can 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.759
 use different colors or a color 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.880
 In general it depends on the taste of each 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.880
 person 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.190
 so that these hairstyles are left more 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.150
 polished we can use what we can 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.370
 use gel myself in this aspect and nothing 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.500
 I'm using only lacquer because 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.500
 I do not want the hairstyle to look wet 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.010
 now let's make another division a 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:42.680
 little more than the 1st 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.680
 to continue collecting our comb 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.090
 and we collect the rest of hair in a 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.579
 pigtail just so we do not get mixed up 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.860
 with the division that we made because now 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.079
 we'll let it go to make another 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.290
 division then we just grabbed it 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.770
 Meanwhile 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.470
 now we start making some squares 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.480
 also like the previous ones only that 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.030
 let's put like brick 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.960
 so let's start with the part 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.590
 superior and we're going to make them have 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.260
 brick shape we will take from the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.930
 first of the policies that we leave the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.880
 half is going to go for a little picture and the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.920
 another half is going to go for the other one 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.560
 this way 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.230
 that is the first queue we divide it into 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.440
 two one side is going for a little square and the 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:44.230
 another side goes to the other little box and 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.230
 we make another pigtail further back 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:09.500
 and we do the same to the other side 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:12.290
 exactly the same a pigtail the 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.260
 we divide in two and we make two paintings 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.870
 for pigtails until you get to 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.870
 I even remember the hair we have 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.879
 now we make the last division a little 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.349
 more behind the second we did 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:41.069
 we pick up the hair so that we do not know 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:44.269
 mix with the hair of the division and 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.269
 we started doing the same 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:51.430
 we take a half square equal in 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.330
 brick shape we take half of the 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:58.180
 left pigtail and half of the pigtail 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:01.319
 right and we join it to the little box that 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.709
 we did comb back 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.450
 and we collect with a little bit in this case 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.260
 we are also going to use the cachitos 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:14.830
 whites 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.830
 so we take and hold with a rubber 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.750
 and we continue like this towards the side 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:31.120
 left taking half of a ponytail 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:36.060
 and half of the other we join it to 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.060
 box and we collect all the hair 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:49.180
 and finally we just take a rectangle 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.190
 of hair and we add the other half 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.639
 of the pigtail that was left of the ponytail 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:58.200
 earlier and there we ended one side and 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.200
 we continue with the other side 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.000
 we started from the top we do 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.540
 a rectangle 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.720
 we comb it back and add the 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.540
 half of our pigtail there use lacquer 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.840
 you know they can use lacquer or they can 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.480
 use gel depending as you do 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:30.000
 want to do and so we continue 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.000
 picking hair in politics 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.920
 and there we are going to finish our 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.410
 divisions if we wanted to do 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.200
 more divisions we could do it but 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:54.740
 we're just going to make those three now 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.530
 finally we make a ponytail and 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.430
 we collect the ends of the tails 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.430
 what do we have left 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:10.380
 we take a rubber we put two hooks 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:13.139
 to each end we buried a hook 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.360
 between the hair very carefully what 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.860
 we turn and bury the other to 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.630
 hold it up 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.460
 Now let's take a bit of 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:24.630
 hair from the bottom of the 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:27.389
 pigtail and surround the rubber to cover it 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:28.910
 and to hold the hair we put a 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:31.430
 hook 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.710
 This is the result of our hairstyle 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.010
 with leagues for girls I hope you have them 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.010
 liked
