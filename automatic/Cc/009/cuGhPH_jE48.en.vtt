right here you see if you probably

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.840 
right here you see if you probably
packing<00:00:30.570> up<00:00:30.840> just<00:00:31.650> backing<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.160> up<00:00:32.340> back<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.790> on

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
packing up just backing on up back it on

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.130 
packing up just backing on up back it on
up<00:00:32.910> but<00:00:33.149> he's<00:00:33.239> going<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.450> drain<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.809> three

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
with nobody moving up on them i don't

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.770 
with nobody moving up on them i don't
really<00:00:35.969> know<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.210> reasoning<00:00:36.480> behind<00:00:36.570> that

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
really know the reasoning behind that

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
a trade I'm very likely going to do and

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.890 
a trade I'm very likely going to do and
it<00:03:20.459> is<00:03:20.670> something<00:03:20.850> I'm<00:03:21.090> going<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.359> do<00:03:21.450> unless<00:03:21.780> a

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
it is something I'm going to do unless a

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.199 
it is something I'm going to do unless a
lot<00:03:22.109> of<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.290> guys<00:03:22.320> think<00:03:22.560> that's<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:22.829> bad<00:03:22.920> idea

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
lot of you guys think that's a bad idea

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.460 
lot of you guys think that's a bad idea
here's<00:03:24.209> some<00:03:24.359> of<00:03:24.420> my<00:03:24.450> reasoning<00:03:24.930> some<00:03:25.350> of<00:03:25.410> my

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
here's some of my reasoning some of my

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.039 
here's some of my reasoning some of my
reasons<00:03:25.799> behind<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.280> first<00:03:27.209> off<00:03:27.480> we<00:03:27.870> don't

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
reasons behind it first off we don't

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.479 
reasons behind it first off we don't
really<00:03:28.140> need<00:03:28.320> our<00:03:28.380> first<00:03:28.650> rounders<00:03:29.010> we're

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
really need our first rounders we're

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.160 
really need our first rounders we're
going<00:03:29.609> to<00:03:29.670> be<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:29.760> playoff<00:03:30.180> team<00:03:30.390> in<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.959> first

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
going to be a playoff team in the first

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.580 
going to be a playoff team in the first
year<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:32.070> so<00:03:32.900> take<00:03:33.900> stone<00:03:34.140> with<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.290> amino

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
year and so take stone with the amino

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.819 
year and so take stone with the amino
line<00:03:35.090> when<00:03:36.090> you're<00:03:36.450> going<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.690> be<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.840> high<00:03:37.470> a

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
line when you're going to be a high a

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.590 
line when you're going to be a high a
high<00:03:38.190> pick<00:03:38.700> you're<00:03:38.940> not<00:03:39.060> going<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.299> I<00:03:39.390> me<00:03:39.510> know

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
high pick you're not going to I me know

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.970 
high pick you're not going to I me know
when<00:03:39.690> you're<00:03:39.780> going<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:39.930> be<00:03:40.019> a<00:03:40.049> low<00:03:40.260> pic<00:03:40.500> you're

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
when you're going to be a low pic you're

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.020 
when you're going to be a low pic you're
not<00:03:41.100> really<00:03:41.220> going<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.459> get<00:03:41.609> a<00:03:41.640> good<00:03:41.790> player

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
not really going to get a good player

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.539 
not really going to get a good player
and<00:03:42.380> so<00:03:43.380> I'd<00:03:43.500> much<00:03:43.680> rather<00:03:43.709> use<00:03:44.100> those<00:03:44.310> pics

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
and so I'd much rather use those pics

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.660 
and so I'd much rather use those pics
getting<00:03:44.850> a<00:03:44.910> guy<00:03:45.030> like<00:03:45.209> klay<00:03:45.390> Thompson<00:03:45.870> also

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
getting a guy like klay Thompson also

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.240 
getting a guy like klay Thompson also
klay<00:03:47.670> Thompson<00:03:48.090> is<00:03:48.180> much<00:03:48.600> cheaper<00:03:49.250> contract

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
klay Thompson is much cheaper contract

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.099 
klay Thompson is much cheaper contract
wise<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.730> Avery<00:03:50.880> Bradley<00:03:51.239> and<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:51.780> like<00:03:51.959> them

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
more as the player and they're basically

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.490 
more as the player and they're basically

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
 on Jordan Hill entire game just

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.559 
 on Jordan Hill entire game just
absolutely<00:06:12.690> justjust<00:06:13.560> demolishing<00:06:14.159> him<00:06:14.310> and

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:14.569 
absolutely justjust demolishing him and

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:17.909 
it was pretty frustrating I really don't

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:19.219 
it was pretty frustrating I really don't
have<00:06:18.120> I'd<00:06:18.360> only<00:06:18.509> think<00:06:18.750> Jordan<00:06:18.960> house<00:06:19.050> is<00:06:19.169> a

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
have I'd only think Jordan house is a

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.529 
have I'd only think Jordan house is a
great<00:06:19.440> defensive<00:06:19.860> center<00:06:20.190> so<00:06:21.000> he<00:06:21.449> doesn't

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 
great defensive center so he doesn't

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:22.820 
great defensive center so he doesn't
really<00:06:21.779> do<00:06:21.960> well<00:06:22.169> against<00:06:22.440> these<00:06:22.620> high

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
really do well against these high

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.689 
really do well against these high
caliber<00:06:23.460> players<00:06:24.529> luckily<00:06:25.529> though<00:06:25.770> late<00:06:26.520> in

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 
caliber players luckily though late in

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 
knocking him down this game he kind of

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.279 
knocking him down this game he kind of
found<00:06:32.849> his<00:06:32.969> rhythm<00:06:33.210> from<00:06:33.839> hitting<00:06:34.080> some

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:35.909 
layups and that kind of generated some

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:37.939 
layups and that kind of generated some
threes<00:06:36.209> like<00:06:36.389> in<00:06:36.569> the<00:06:36.659> game<00:06:36.810> so<00:06:37.620> right<00:06:37.740> here

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:37.949

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.250 
here's a crazy play we were up by two
with<00:06:41.010> 15<00:06:41.370> seconds<00:06:41.700> left<00:06:42.050> this<00:06:43.050> play

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
with 15 seconds left this play

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.450 
with 15 seconds left this play
determines<00:06:43.710> whether<00:06:43.860> we<00:06:43.980> go<00:06:44.100> into<00:06:44.190> overtime

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
determines whether we go into overtime

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.820 
determines whether we go into overtime
or<00:06:44.850> if<00:06:44.970> we<00:06:45.120> lose<00:06:45.390> this<00:06:45.420> game<00:06:45.720> so<00:06:46.680> they're

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
or if we lose this game so they're

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.800 
or if we lose this game so they're
dribbling<00:06:47.310> at<00:06:47.460> the<00:06:47.640> perimeter<00:06:47.880> right<00:06:48.180> now<00:06:48.330> if

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:48.810 
dribbling at the perimeter right now if

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.660
