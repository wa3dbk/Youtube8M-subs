00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
of my head and it gets really confusing

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.910 
of my head and it gets really confusing

to<00:01:21.119> be<00:01:21.240> fair<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.930> could<00:01:22.140> use<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.530> gel<00:01:22.920> at<00:01:22.979> this

to be fair you could use a gel at this

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.020 
to be fair you could use a gel at this
point<00:01:23.310> because<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.670> not<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.880> fully

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
point because it's not the fully

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.580 
point because it's not the fully
finished<00:01:24.150> look<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.750> really<00:01:25.049> not<00:01:25.140> much<00:01:25.259> at<00:01:25.409> all

it's messy but it's on its way now as
you<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:34.110> see<00:01:34.259> because<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.560> use<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.890> gel<00:01:35.130> when

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
you can see because I use the gel when

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.740 
you can see because I use the gel when
it<00:01:35.549> was<00:01:35.670> damp<00:01:35.820> but<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.090> really<00:01:36.390> worked<00:01:36.570> through

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
it was damp but I really worked through

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.539 
it was damp but I really worked through
my<00:01:36.930> hair<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.439> dried<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.860> place<00:01:38.100> you

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
my hair and I dried it in place you

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.950 
my hair and I dried it in place you
don't<00:01:38.670> get<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.000> crispy<00:01:39.420> sort<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.689> look<00:01:39.810> that

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
don't get that crispy sort of look that

you get when you're a high school and

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.530 
you get when you're a high school and
you<00:01:41.490> trying<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.759> impress<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.150> girl<00:01:42.329> who<00:01:42.420> sits

next<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:42.960> English<00:01:43.259> clearly<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:44.009> guy<00:01:44.159> was

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
next to in English clearly that guy was

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.219 
next to in English clearly that guy was
me<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.759> I'm<00:01:45.000> quite<00:01:45.119> bitter<00:01:45.360> about<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.079> for

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
me and I'm quite bitter about it so for

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.080 
me and I'm quite bitter about it so for
this<00:01:46.290> I'm<00:01:46.470> using<00:01:46.500> VF<00:01:46.979> v<00:01:47.130> extreme<00:01:47.490> style<00:01:47.670> rework

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
this I'm using VF v extreme style rework

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.310 
this I'm using VF v extreme style rework
now<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.390> reason<00:01:48.600> I've<00:01:48.659> chosen<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.049> is

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
now the reason I've chosen this one is

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.270 
now the reason I've chosen this one is
because<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.560> gives<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.740> really<00:01:49.979> good<00:01:50.100> finish

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
because it gives a really good finish

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.740 
because it gives a really good finish
you're<00:01:50.820> not<00:01:50.939> going<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.119> have<00:01:51.240> those<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.420> shine

hair if your hair doesn't cooperate it's

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.780 
hair if your hair doesn't cooperate it's
quite<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> good<00:02:10.229> idea<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.770> layer<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.459> start

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
quite a good idea to layer it so start

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.610 
quite a good idea to layer it so start
with<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.970> little<00:02:12.209> bit

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
with a little bit

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.020 
with a little bit
put<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.010> through<00:02:13.190> if<00:02:13.489> you<00:02:13.550> need<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.730> bit<00:02:13.849> more<00:02:13.879> a

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
put it through if you need a bit more a

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.880 
put it through if you need a bit more a
little<00:02:14.330> bit<00:02:14.360> more<00:02:14.480> through<00:02:14.780> don't<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.560> hole

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
little bit more through don't you hole

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.589 
little bit more through don't you hole
out<00:02:16.099> in<00:02:16.250> one<00:02:16.370> go<00:02:16.550> okay<00:02:16.940> I<00:02:16.970> put<00:02:17.180> one<00:02:17.330> more<00:02:17.360> layer

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
out in one go okay I put one more layer

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.119 
out in one go okay I put one more layer
through<00:02:17.900> just<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.560> make<00:02:18.680> sure<00:02:18.709> it's<00:02:19.010> all<00:02:19.099> in

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
through just to make sure it's all in

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.890 
through just to make sure it's all in
place<00:02:19.489> because<00:02:20.030> I'm<00:02:20.239> layering<00:02:20.480> it's<00:02:20.720> much

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
place because I'm layering it's much

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.119 
place because I'm layering it's much
easier<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.260> know<00:02:21.410> when<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.560> stop<00:02:21.830> because<00:02:22.010> we

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
easier to know when to stop because we

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.589 
easier to know when to stop because we
just<00:02:22.310> put<00:02:22.430> loads<00:02:22.640> on<00:02:22.970> then<00:02:23.150> there's<00:02:23.269> too<00:02:23.420> late

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
just put loads on then there's too late

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.059 
just put loads on then there's too late
in<00:02:23.840> your<00:02:23.930> hair<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.349> have<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.620> wash<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:24.830> to

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
in your hair and you have to wash it to

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.160 
in your hair and you have to wash it to
start<00:02:25.280> again<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:26.450> by<00:02:26.629> putting<00:02:26.780> a<00:02:26.900> little<00:02:27.019> bit

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
start again so by putting a little bit

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.080 
start again so by putting a little bit
on<00:02:27.379> that<00:02:27.830> time<00:02:28.099> it<00:02:28.519> makes<00:02:28.700> life<00:02:28.879> a<00:02:28.940> lot<00:02:29.030> easier

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
on that time it makes life a lot easier

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.729 
on that time it makes life a lot easier
it<00:02:29.599> really<00:02:29.870> is<00:02:29.930> that<00:02:30.019> simple<00:02:30.080> once<00:02:30.590> you've
