whatever<00:00:09.750> you<00:00:09.840> want<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.019> call<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:11.360> the<00:00:12.360> first

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
whatever you want to call it the first

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.940 
whatever you want to call it the first
thing<00:00:12.809> you<00:00:12.960> got<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.200> mention<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.650> it's

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
thing you got to mention is it's

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.769 
thing you got to mention is it's
obviously<00:00:14.309> not<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.549> 650<00:00:15.590> it's<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:17.510> closer<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.630> an

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
obviously not a 650 it's a closer to an

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.120 
obviously not a 650 it's a closer to an
800<00:00:20.270> but<00:00:21.270> they<00:00:21.840> call<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.199> F<00:00:22.320> 650<00:00:22.800> for<00:00:22.920> some

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
800 but they call it on F 650 for some

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.710 
800 but they call it on F 650 for some
reason<00:00:23.460> probably<00:00:23.699> because<00:00:23.850> they<00:00:23.970> have<00:00:24.000> an<00:00:24.269> F<00:00:24.480> 8

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
reason probably because they have an F 8

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.769 
reason probably because they have an F 8

that's<00:02:55.860> what<00:02:56.310> I've<00:02:56.430> noticed<00:02:56.780> that's<00:02:57.780> that's

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
that's what I've noticed that's that's

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.509 
that's what I've noticed that's that's
going<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.319> be<00:02:58.380> your<00:02:58.500> average<00:03:00.260> what<00:03:01.260> else<00:03:01.519> about

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
going to be your average what else about

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.789 
going to be your average what else about
that<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.930> other<00:03:04.049> thing<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.260> would<00:03:04.470> be<00:03:04.560> nice

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
that the other thing that would be nice

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.430 
that the other thing that would be nice
and<00:03:05.220> I've<00:03:05.340> looked<00:03:05.700> into<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.120> is<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:07.079> the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
and I've looked into it is the the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.559 
and I've looked into it is the the
cruise<00:03:07.680> control<00:03:07.709> I've<00:03:08.700> seen<00:03:08.910> little<00:03:09.000> adapters

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
cruise control I've seen little adapters

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:10.759 
cruise control I've seen little adapters
you<00:03:09.690> can<00:03:09.810> put<00:03:09.959> on<00:03:10.049> your<00:03:10.140> handlebars<00:03:10.560> for

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
you can put on your handlebars for

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.059 
you can put on your handlebars for
cruise<00:03:10.950> control<00:03:11.069> I<00:03:11.519> would<00:03:12.180> say<00:03:12.450> for<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:13.040> for<00:03:14.040> a

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
cruise control I would say for a for a

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.330 
cruise control I would say for a for a
cross-country<00:03:14.579> trip<00:03:15.890> while<00:03:16.890> it's<00:03:17.069> probably

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
cross-country trip while it's probably

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.360 
cross-country trip while it's probably
dangerous<00:03:18.440> it's<00:03:19.440> probably<00:03:19.739> pretty<00:03:19.889> handy<00:03:20.250> too

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
dangerous it's probably pretty handy too

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.470 
dangerous it's probably pretty handy too
because<00:03:20.579> there's<00:03:20.700> a<00:03:20.760> lot<00:03:20.880> of<00:03:20.910> stretches<00:03:21.359> where

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
because there's a lot of stretches where

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.000 
because there's a lot of stretches where
you<00:03:21.569> go<00:03:21.660> on<00:03:21.780> two<00:03:21.989> hours<00:03:22.319> with<00:03:22.500> nothing<00:03:22.889> but
