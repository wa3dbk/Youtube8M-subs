yay<00:00:19.050> today<00:00:20.050> this<00:00:20.260> is<00:00:20.380> about<00:00:20.560> don't<00:00:21.099> break<00:00:21.369> the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
yay today this is about don't break the

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.159 
yay today this is about don't break the
ice<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:22.660> guys<00:00:22.779> remember<00:00:23.080> this<00:00:23.349> it's<00:00:24.130> a<00:00:24.400> game

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:25.169 
ice you guys remember this it's a game

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.019 
ice you guys remember this it's a game
that<00:00:26.169> you<00:00:26.410> would<00:00:26.529> play<00:00:26.800> with<00:00:27.160> two<00:00:27.369> people<00:00:27.759> or

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
that you would play with two people or

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.080 
that you would play with two people or
three<00:00:28.270> people<00:00:28.599> and<00:00:29.290> what<00:00:29.439> you<00:00:29.560> do<00:00:29.739> is<00:00:30.090> you

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
three people and what you do is you

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.080 
three people and what you do is you
would<00:00:31.180> hit<00:00:31.360> out<00:00:31.509> the<00:00:31.750> the<00:00:32.410> blocks<00:00:32.800> and<00:00:33.280> you<00:00:33.310> try

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
would hit out the the blocks and you try

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.479 
would hit out the the blocks and you try
to<00:00:34.120> do<00:00:34.329> it<00:00:34.450> without<00:00:34.570> the<00:00:35.320> polar<00:00:36.040> bear<00:00:36.280> in<00:00:36.399> the

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
to do it without the polar bear in the

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.760 
to do it without the polar bear in the
middle<00:00:36.730> falling<00:00:37.180> and<00:00:37.390> so<00:00:38.110> whoever<00:00:38.440> made<00:00:38.739> it

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
middle falling and so whoever made it

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.200 
middle falling and so whoever made it
fall<00:00:39.010> lost<00:00:41.580> early<00:00:42.580> I<00:00:42.610> was<00:00:42.850> my<00:00:42.970> understanding

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
fall lost early I was my understanding

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.080 
fall lost early I was my understanding
of<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:43.780> game<00:00:43.990> and<00:00:44.290> so<00:00:44.980> I<00:00:45.010> tried<00:00:45.430> to<00:00:45.610> recreate

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
of the game and so I tried to recreate

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.350 
of the game and so I tried to recreate
that<00:00:46.560> this<00:00:47.560> is<00:00:47.680> just<00:00:47.830> a<00:00:47.980> concept<00:00:48.520> but

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
that this is just a concept but

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.920 
that this is just a concept but
basically<00:00:50.010> what<00:00:51.010> concept<00:00:51.580> i'm<00:00:51.730> using<00:00:52.150> is<00:00:52.300> that

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
basically what concept i'm using is that

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.890 
basically what concept i'm using is that
if<00:00:53.170> we<00:00:53.230> have<00:00:53.710> some<00:00:54.430> ice<00:00:54.640> and<00:00:57.060> if<00:00:58.060> we<00:00:58.270> put<00:00:58.510> two<00:00:58.870> of

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900 
if we have some ice and if we put two of

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.450 
if we have some ice and if we put two of
these<00:00:59.340> side<00:01:00.340> by<00:01:00.370> side<00:01:01.110> now<00:01:02.110> this<00:01:02.680> one<00:01:02.950> if<00:01:03.310> you

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
these side by side now this one if you

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.819 
these side by side now this one if you
break<00:01:03.700> it<00:01:03.910> boom<00:01:04.449> nothing<00:01:05.199> happens<00:01:05.530> if<00:01:05.710> we

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:05.829 
break it boom nothing happens if we

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.260 
break it boom nothing happens if we
break<00:01:05.979> that<00:01:06.220> water<00:01:06.970> is<00:01:07.540> everywhere<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:10.090> i

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
break that water is everywhere and i

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.390 
break that water is everywhere and i
probably<00:01:10.479> screwed<00:01:10.960> up

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.810 

but<00:01:16.420> so<00:01:17.420> we<00:01:17.900> go<00:01:18.080> off<00:01:18.200> that<00:01:18.409> concept<00:01:19.040> and<00:01:19.580> we

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
but so we go off that concept and we

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.510 
but so we go off that concept and we
also<00:01:19.970> go<00:01:20.270> off<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.510> concept<00:01:21.080> that<00:01:21.830> we<00:01:22.340> know

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
also go off the concept that we know

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.730 
also go off the concept that we know
that<00:01:22.550> redstone<00:01:24.250> is<00:01:26.800> taken<00:01:27.800> away<00:01:27.890> by<00:01:28.220> water<00:01:28.520> but

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
that redstone is taken away by water but

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.370 
that redstone is taken away by water but
that<00:01:30.740> you'll<00:01:30.890> notice<00:01:31.160> is<00:01:31.550> that<00:01:31.640> if<00:01:31.910> we<00:01:31.940> put

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
that you'll notice is that if we put

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.749 
that you'll notice is that if we put
sand<00:01:33.380> on<00:01:34.270> top<00:01:35.270> of<00:01:36.110> redstone<00:01:36.520> it<00:01:37.520> will<00:01:37.610> grow

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
sand on top of redstone it will grow

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.219 
sand on top of redstone it will grow
right<00:01:37.940> there<00:01:38.150> like<00:01:38.330> that<00:01:38.570> it<00:01:38.930> will<00:01:39.050> stay

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
right there like that it will stay

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.100 
right there like that it will stay
suspended<00:01:39.500> but<00:01:39.890> if<00:01:40.040> water<00:01:40.250> comes<00:01:40.340> a<00:01:40.640> long<00:01:40.790> boom

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
suspended but if water comes a long boom

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:48.820 
suspended but if water comes a long boom
say<00:01:42.110> it<00:01:42.229> falls<00:01:44.649> so<00:01:45.789> what<00:01:46.789> we<00:01:46.910> can<00:01:47.090> do<00:01:47.300> is<00:01:47.619> is<00:01:48.619> if

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
say it falls so what we can do is is if

00:01:48.830 --> 00:02:00.490 
say it falls so what we can do is is if
someone<00:01:49.100> breaks<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:58.960> you<00:01:59.960> try<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:00.200> get<00:02:00.350> as<00:02:00.470> far

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
someone breaks it you try to get as far

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.770 
someone breaks it you try to get as far
as<00:02:00.710> you<00:02:00.770> can<00:02:00.950> remember<00:02:01.940> guys<00:02:02.300> this<00:02:02.479> is<00:02:02.630> just

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
as you can remember guys this is just

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.380 
as you can remember guys this is just
concept<00:02:03.170> see<00:02:03.410> that<00:02:03.619> falls<00:02:03.920> for<00:02:04.910> a<00:02:04.940> little<00:02:05.119> wolf

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
concept see that falls for a little wolf

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.029 
concept see that falls for a little wolf
in<00:02:05.630> there<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:07.899> then<00:02:08.899> I<00:02:08.929> have<00:02:09.320> it<00:02:09.470> so<00:02:09.709> the<00:02:09.890> red

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
in there and then I have it so the red

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.979 
in there and then I have it so the red
stone<00:02:10.280> goes<00:02:10.519> down<00:02:10.700> there<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.150> torch<00:02:11.480> beside

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
stone goes down there and a torch beside

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.020 
stone goes down there and a torch beside
it<00:02:12.170> so<00:02:12.650> it's<00:02:12.800> always<00:02:12.980> feeding<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.459> connection

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
it so it's always feeding a connection

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.850 
it so it's always feeding a connection
and<00:02:14.269> then<00:02:14.810> when<00:02:14.959> it<00:02:15.050> stops<00:02:15.320> feeding<00:02:15.620> the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
and then when it stops feeding the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.009 
and then when it stops feeding the
convention<00:02:16.310> hook<00:02:17.030> them<00:02:17.180> up<00:02:17.269> here<00:02:17.570> and<00:02:17.810> all<00:02:17.900> it

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
convention hook them up here and all it

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.310 
convention hook them up here and all it
does<00:02:18.200> is<00:02:18.320> shoot<00:02:18.470> an<00:02:18.620> arrow<00:02:18.890> but<00:02:20.049> again<00:02:21.049> it's

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
does is shoot an arrow but again it's

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.370 
does is shoot an arrow but again it's
just<00:02:21.500> a<00:02:21.650> concept<00:02:22.510> I'd<00:02:23.510> like<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.720> see<00:02:23.989> what<00:02:24.200> else

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
just a concept I'd like to see what else

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.370 
just a concept I'd like to see what else
are<00:02:24.769> people<00:02:24.920> can<00:02:25.220> do<00:02:25.370> with<00:02:25.519> it<00:02:26.110> be<00:02:27.110> kind<00:02:27.260> of

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
are people can do with it be kind of

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.380 
are people can do with it be kind of
cool<00:02:27.620> this<00:02:28.549> is<00:02:28.730> something<00:02:29.239> really<00:02:29.959> amazing<00:02:31.390> so
