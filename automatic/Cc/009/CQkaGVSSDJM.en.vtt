the small letters from A to F sometimes

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.480 
the small letters from A to F sometimes
it's<00:00:12.480> helpful<00:00:12.690> for<00:00:12.960> me<00:00:13.410> when<00:00:13.620> I'm<00:00:14.099> doing<00:00:14.280> my

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.939 
job to write on the side what the lines
are<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.490> don't<00:00:20.910> confuse<00:00:21.359> them<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.619> have

are so I don't confuse them so I have

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.810 
are so I don't confuse them so I have
the<00:00:23.189> body<00:00:23.580> height<00:00:24.029> here<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.619> sender<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.410 
the body height here the a sender the
descender<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.660> this<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.680> cap<00:00:28.920> line

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420

descender and this is the cap line
everything<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.510> going<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.689> be<00:00:30.840> written<00:00:31.080> with<00:00:31.380> a

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
everything is going to be written with a

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.610 
everything is going to be written with a
45-degree<00:00:32.640> angle<00:00:32.690> so<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.750> always<00:00:34.050> look<00:00:34.380> for

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
45-degree angle so I always look for

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.500 
45-degree angle so I always look for
that<00:00:34.710> angle<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.630> make<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.960> little<00:00:37.739> tick<00:00:38.070> mark

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
that angle and make a little tick mark

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.510 
that angle and make a little tick mark
with<00:00:39.510> my<00:00:39.540> nib<00:00:39.989> edge<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:41.160> find<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:43.399> so<00:00:44.399> you're

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
with my nib edge to find it so you're

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.040 
with my nib edge to find it so you're
always<00:00:44.700> going<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.000> be<00:00:45.090> holding<00:00:45.450> your<00:00:45.480> pen<00:00:45.809> at

arms and you relax then you'll start
with<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.150> letter<00:01:06.479> A<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:07.170> come<00:01:07.920> down<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:09.180> go

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
with the letter A you come down you go

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.499 
with the letter A you come down you go
up<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> corner<00:01:11.600> down<00:01:13.010> up<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.390> then<00:01:15.390> you

up to the corner down up and then you

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.560 
up to the corner down up and then you
finish<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.020> letter<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:16.500> two<00:01:16.939> once<00:01:17.939> again<00:01:18.270> you

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
finish the letter for two once again you

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.109 
finish the letter for two once again you
could<00:01:18.780> make<00:01:18.960> your<00:01:19.110> 45-degree<00:01:19.920> angle<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.909> come

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
could make your 45-degree angle you come

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.280 
could make your 45-degree angle you come
down<00:01:21.770> back<00:01:22.770> up<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:24.000> down<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.750> use<00:01:25.020> these

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
down back up and down and you use these

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.370 
down back up and down and you use these
lines<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.970> have<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:27.540> grid<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.170> help

lines that I have on this grid to help
you<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:29.220> determine<00:01:29.759> exactly<00:01:30.180> where<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.750> go

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
you to determine exactly where to go

with the lettering if you're not in a
place<00:01:33.509> where<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.990> can<00:01:34.170> be<00:01:34.290> using<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.770> dip<00:01:34.979> pen

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
place where you can be using a dip pen

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.670 
place where you can be using a dip pen
maybe<00:01:36.180> you're<00:01:36.450> traveling<00:01:36.750> or<00:01:37.290> you're<00:01:37.530> not

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
maybe you're traveling or you're not

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.740 
maybe you're traveling or you're not
someplace<00:01:38.100> where<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.909> have<00:01:39.180> access<00:01:39.420> to

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
someplace where you can have access to

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.469 
someplace where you can have access to
clean<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.229> up<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.619> then<00:01:41.280> recommend<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.909> use<00:01:42.180> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
clean it up I then recommend you use a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.950 
clean it up I then recommend you use a
calligraphy<00:01:43.409> marker<00:01:43.439> at<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.310> 500<00:01:45.000> size<00:01:45.450> which

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
calligraphy marker at a 500 size which

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.340 
calligraphy marker at a 500 size which
is<00:01:46.140> about<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.710> same<00:01:46.920> as<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.490> co<00:01:47.939> nib<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.259> you're

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
is about the same as a co nib so you're

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.440 
is about the same as a co nib so you're
going<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.530> get<00:01:49.619> relatively<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.250> same<00:01:50.450> sizing

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
going to get relatively the same sizing

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.929 
going to get relatively the same sizing
for<00:01:52.049> your<00:01:52.170> lettering<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:53.100> it's<00:01:53.520> convenient

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
for your lettering and it's convenient

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.910 
for your lettering and it's convenient
for<00:01:54.210> practicing<00:01:54.840> but<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.229> not<00:01:55.409> something<00:01:55.799> I

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
for practicing but it's not something I

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.090 
for practicing but it's not something I
would<00:01:55.979> use<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.579> final<00:01:56.880> project<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:58.710> make

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
would use in a final project so to make

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.090 
would use in a final project so to make
a<00:01:59.130> letter<00:01:59.460> with<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.680> marker<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.890> same

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
a letter with the marker it's the same

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.020 
a letter with the marker it's the same
thing<00:02:02.340> you're<00:02:02.430> still<00:02:02.700> going<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.030> find<00:02:03.360> your

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
thing you're still going to find your

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.839 
thing you're still going to find your
