the high fidelity of this ship just
really<00:02:01.829> makes<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.250> for<00:02:02.430> me<00:02:02.549> how<00:02:03.119> does<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
really makes it for me how does the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.730 
really makes it for me how does the
Gladius<00:02:03.780> perform<00:02:04.170> an<00:02:04.290> arena<00:02:04.590> commander

Gladius perform an arena commander

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.249 
Gladius perform an arena commander
though<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.729> ship<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.090> fast<00:02:06.360> with<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.689> max<00:02:06.960> speed

of 240 and the ship's acceleration is
very<00:02:09.629> quick<00:02:10.170> but<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:11.310> makes<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.730> very<00:02:11.760> easy

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
very quick but this makes it very easy

on your target and I find myself

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.710 
on your target and I find myself
overheating<00:02:38.520> regularly<00:02:39.120> with<00:02:39.240> both<00:02:39.480> those

mouse to control the gimbals I actually

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.810 
mouse to control the gimbals I actually
found<00:02:46.140> this<00:02:46.290> even<00:02:46.560> worse<00:02:46.830> as<00:02:47.130> it's<00:02:47.550> much

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
found this even worse as it's much

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.340 
found this even worse as it's much
harder<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.240> bring<00:02:48.420> all<00:02:48.600> your<00:02:48.720> weapons<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.140> bear

Gladius can also take a beating it's
really<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:25.980> very<00:03:26.070> tanky<00:03:26.610> ship<00:03:26.940> even<00:03:27.180> with<00:03:27.420> its

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
really a very tanky ship even with its

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.660 
really a very tanky ship even with its
shields<00:03:27.870> down<00:03:28.080> though<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.650> do<00:03:28.800> find<00:03:29.280> that<00:03:29.460> the
