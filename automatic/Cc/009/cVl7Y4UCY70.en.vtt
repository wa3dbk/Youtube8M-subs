difference between two shooters because

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.839 
difference between two shooters because
then<00:03:05.489> it's<00:03:05.700> basically<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.120> same<00:03:06.299> thing<00:03:06.359> and

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
then it's basically the same thing and

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.940 
then it's basically the same thing and

one thing you notice when you're playing
is<00:03:24.180> maybe<00:03:24.359> like<00:03:24.449> compensation<00:03:25.379> that's<00:03:25.560> it<00:03:26.150> but

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
is maybe like compensation that's it but

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.849 
is maybe like compensation that's it but
that's<00:03:27.359> that's<00:03:27.689> all<00:03:27.959> that<00:03:28.409> you<00:03:28.439> notice<00:03:28.769> from

it<00:03:59.340> feels<00:03:59.549> clunky<00:03:59.879> and<00:04:00.090> that's<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.479> fact<00:04:00.750> it's

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
it feels clunky and that's the fact it's

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.399 
it feels clunky and that's the fact it's
not<00:04:01.019> smooth<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.739> feels<00:04:01.949> really<00:04:02.220> clunky<00:04:02.609> and<00:04:03.409> so

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
not smooth it feels really clunky and so

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.050

I'm<00:04:12.599> just<00:04:12.840> saying<00:04:13.049> on<00:04:13.319> console<00:04:14.040> it<00:04:14.310> doesn't<00:04:14.790> it

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
I'm just saying on console it doesn't it
