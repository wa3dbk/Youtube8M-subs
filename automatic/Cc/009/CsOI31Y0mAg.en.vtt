always good to look along the sides of
the<00:02:56.930> carbs<00:02:57.320> because<00:02:57.560> where<00:02:58.400> people<00:02:58.760> have<00:02:58.850> been

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
the carbs because where people have been

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.610 
the carbs because where people have been
walking<00:02:59.180> they<00:02:59.540> spread<00:02:59.810> the<00:02:59.990> spores<00:03:00.320> and<00:03:00.500> they

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
walking they spread the spores and they

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.140 
walking they spread the spores and they
tend<00:03:00.860> to<00:03:00.950> sort<00:03:01.280> of<00:03:01.370> fruit<00:03:01.670> on<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.910> edge<00:03:02.000> of

paths<00:03:02.450> yeah<00:03:03.670> I'm<00:03:04.670> doing<00:03:04.880> the<00:03:04.970> right<00:03:05.090> thing

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
paths yeah I'm doing the right thing

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.140 
paths yeah I'm doing the right thing
with<00:03:05.510> my<00:03:06.220> basket<00:03:07.220> aren't<00:03:07.400> I<00:03:07.490> so<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.790> spores

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
with my basket aren't I so the spores

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.840 
with my basket aren't I so the spores
can<00:03:08.570> spread<00:03:09.410> around<00:03:09.590> while<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.010> Carol<00:03:10.490> that's<00:03:10.700> a

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
can spread around while I Carol that's a

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:11.380 
can spread around while I Carol that's a
good<00:03:11.030> idea

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390
