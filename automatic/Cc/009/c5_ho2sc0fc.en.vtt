00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
these barrels are Jay if you can

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.709 
these barrels are Jay if you can
stabilize<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.090> barrel<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.450> take<00:00:36.690> a

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
stabilize the barrel I take a

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.610 
stabilize the barrel I take a
sledgehammer<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.469> try<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:42.170> if<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.320> rely<00:00:43.590> on

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
sledgehammer and try to if you rely on

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.319 
sledgehammer and try to if you rely on
me<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.980> crush<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.520> very<00:00:44.730> we<00:00:44.910> be<00:00:45.030> here<00:00:45.210> all<00:00:45.300> day

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
me to crush this very we be here all day

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.660 
me to crush this very we be here all day
sure<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:46.350> thing<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.680> pretty<00:00:46.890> tough<00:00:47.160> so

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
sure that thing is pretty tough so

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.709 
sure that thing is pretty tough so
instead<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:48.270> night<00:00:48.390> we're<00:00:48.480> gonna<00:00:48.570> use

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
instead like this night we're gonna use

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.869 
instead like this night we're gonna use
air<00:00:48.930> pressure<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.530> crush<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.640> strong

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
air pressure to crush the strong

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.760 
air pressure to crush the strong
something<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.690> up<00:00:51.840> I'm<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.530> gonna<00:00:52.620> stick

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
something this up I'm just gonna stick

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.920 
something this up I'm just gonna stick
it<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.039> stand<00:00:53.280> here<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.760> set<00:00:54.090> okay<00:00:54.239> cuz

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
it on the stand here on set okay cuz

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.490 
it on the stand here on set okay cuz
what

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.680 

and<00:00:57.620> some<00:00:57.860> water<00:00:58.130> inside<00:00:58.490> about<00:00:58.940> six<00:00:59.300> cups<00:00:59.570> of

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
and some water inside about six cups of

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.360 
and some water inside about six cups of
water<00:00:59.900> and<00:01:00.410> what<00:01:00.560> the<00:01:00.650> Lord<00:01:00.860> is<00:01:01.010> going<00:01:01.130> to<00:01:01.190> do

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
water and what the Lord is going to do

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.250 
water and what the Lord is going to do
is<00:01:01.520> we're<00:01:01.640> going<00:01:01.730> to<00:01:01.790> create<00:01:02.390> water<00:01:02.900> vapor

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
is we're going to create water vapor

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.650 
is we're going to create water vapor
inside<00:01:03.860> then<00:01:04.400> we're<00:01:04.489> going<00:01:04.610> to<00:01:04.670> heat<00:01:04.879> up<00:01:04.910> the

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
inside then we're going to heat up the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.020 
inside then we're going to heat up the
water<00:01:05.690> vapor<00:01:06.140> when<00:01:06.380> it's<00:01:06.560> warmed<00:01:07.250> up<00:01:07.370> and<00:01:07.580> air

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
water vapor when it's warmed up and air

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.640 
water vapor when it's warmed up and air
when<00:01:08.210> it's<00:01:08.330> warmed<00:01:08.540> up<00:01:08.660> occupy<00:01:09.320> a<00:01:09.350> little<00:01:09.530> bit

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
when it's warmed up occupy a little bit

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.100 
when it's warmed up occupy a little bit
more<00:01:09.770> space<00:01:09.950> our<00:01:10.700> goal<00:01:11.060> is<00:01:11.360> to<00:01:11.390> try<00:01:11.660> to<00:01:11.690> trap

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
more space our goal is to try to trap

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.780 
more space our goal is to try to trap
some<00:01:12.380> of<00:01:12.410> that<00:01:12.530> expanded<00:01:13.250> air<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:13.610> water

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
some of that expanded air and water

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.609 
some of that expanded air and water
vapor<00:01:14.030> inside<00:01:14.510> we're<00:01:14.840> going<00:01:14.960> to<00:01:15.020> seal<00:01:15.260> this<00:01:15.410> up

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
vapor inside we're going to seal this up

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.650 
vapor inside we're going to seal this up
and<00:01:15.830> then<00:01:16.130> cool<00:01:16.340> it<00:01:16.369> down<00:01:16.640> okay<00:01:17.240> you<00:01:17.450> should

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
and then cool it down okay you should

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.940 
and then cool it down okay you should
see<00:01:17.810> some<00:01:17.960> crushing<00:01:18.260> action<00:01:18.530> at<00:01:18.590> that<00:01:18.650> point

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
see some crushing action at that point

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.370 
see some crushing action at that point
but<00:01:19.400> first<00:01:19.729> we're<00:01:20.390> going<00:01:20.479> to<00:01:20.540> need<00:01:20.690> to<00:01:20.930> heat

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
but first we're going to need to heat

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.620 
but first we're going to need to heat
that<00:01:21.500> era<00:01:21.740> so<00:01:22.490> help<00:01:22.940> me<00:01:23.000> flip<00:01:23.150> this<00:01:23.300> up<00:01:23.450> all

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
that era so help me flip this up all

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.290 
that era so help me flip this up all

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
to see a nice solid stream of steam

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.840 
to see a nice solid stream of steam
coming<00:01:33.290> out<00:01:33.530> this<00:01:33.740> opening<00:01:34.160> sure<00:01:34.430> and<00:01:34.670> in

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
coming out this opening sure and in

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.310 
coming out this opening sure and in
order<00:01:35.119> to<00:01:35.210> do<00:01:35.330> that<00:01:35.479> I<00:01:35.600> can't<00:01:35.810> just<00:01:36.020> use<00:01:36.050> like<00:01:36.290> a

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
order to do that I can't just use like a

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.609 
order to do that I can't just use like a
blowtorch<00:01:36.740> or<00:01:36.979> anything<00:01:37.130> small<00:01:37.960> as<00:01:38.960> this<00:01:39.440> is

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
blowtorch or anything small as this is

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.590 
blowtorch or anything small as this is
the<00:01:39.740> super-sized<00:01:40.280> version<00:01:40.850> we're<00:01:41.420> going<00:01:41.540> to

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
the super-sized version we're going to

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.060 
the super-sized version we're going to
use<00:01:41.690> one<00:01:41.810> of<00:01:41.840> these<00:01:41.960> Road<00:01:42.259> torches<00:01:42.710> yeah<00:01:43.039> I

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
use one of these Road torches yeah I

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.520 
use one of these Road torches yeah I
think<00:01:43.190> I'll<00:01:43.310> back<00:01:43.490> up<00:01:43.600> so<00:01:44.600> it'll<00:01:45.289> take<00:01:45.380> a<00:01:45.440> few

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
think I'll back up so it'll take a few

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.050 
think I'll back up so it'll take a few
