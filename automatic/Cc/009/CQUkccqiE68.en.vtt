00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:03.739
 Hello everyone, let me show you something 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:05.319
 stop add-ons to the game 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:07.140
 three 2010 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.120
 you are downloading a map from the internet 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.249
 script book objects 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:14.259
 m then the ruin of the virus because they ifab humiliate 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.849
 Throw on the desktop that's how I 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.050
 see on the screen 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.079
 objects and the map itself 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:22.199
 in folder 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.380
 but waving homeland let's say it will be 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.499
 they gave us a go 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:28.819
 Trojan 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:31.019
 Here's another example let's say if you have 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.679
 routes there are many objects in the folder too 

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:35.550
 throw because differently there is 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.350
 there is one fall there is a lot but in 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.570
 folder is desirable 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.400
 we go that they go content manager 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.830
 this or content manager in general and there 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.190
 choose to port the folder where it is 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.590
 fixed archive 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.020
 the Taliban got a file you can do it 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.470
 for each 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.720
 and here I am a folder 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.860
 choose this folder where we are 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.030
 started unpacked archive 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.400
 and everything went installation installation takes 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.240
 Basically, 15 minutes 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.170
 in this case, you need to click 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.760
 overwrite everything if power window 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.820
 we write rewrite everything but at 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.670
 least route makers so 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.670
 recommend doing 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.850
 but generally normal is not true 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.950
 because i'm often not overwritten 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.420
 skipping and then me everything is fine 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.670
 works 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.430
 everything went setting 10 15 minutes depends on 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.270
 route from its size 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.700
 principle you should still see which one 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.030
 version of the route what do you want nato and 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.250
 current version 44 0 88 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.280
 prince 2010 husband to her upgrade 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.030
 This is what you see on the right in Montreal 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.140
 content he's there all sorts of window icons 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.180
 don't pay attention to it at all 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.040
 here you need to follow when it's over 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.650
 setting 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.790
 so we wait by 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.790
 minutes 10 15 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.330
 all what kind and installation 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.770
 ended window appears 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.900
 task completed and what we do next 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.850
 we do not exit this program 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.439
 and we will not be able to watch that 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.280
 found that sashika interplanetary 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.889
 old woman in general we are all right 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.179
 we go to the file and called down by himself 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:14.079
 run the Ukrainians and no further 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:15.789
 evidence of these objects which 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:17.809
 just installed if you are right away 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:19.979
 run train 100 can you principle 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:22.089
 erica staal give or 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:24.659
 to be without supplement is harmless 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.659
 that is, we are waiting for confirmation 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.389
 so after we have confirmed everything 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:34.249
 three of us will start automatically 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:37.120
 go routes and see here it is the birthplace 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.999
 which we have installed 

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:41.999
 I set them up at the session if of course there is 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:43.799
 i.e 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.309
 percentage principle 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:49.289
 if you then come here you have no such 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:51.449
 routes that are installed 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:53.709
 install this separately file in 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.789
 the picture of filling the meat card in 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:57.309
 last some routes 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:59.049
 recommend installing them 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.269
 first objects then map 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.930
 but as you can see, his principle 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.679
 everything is set up normally 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:08.459
 Well, that's all very easy, and 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.069
 simply 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.219
 look beyond your version of the game 44 0 88 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:15.369
 and one more thing if you suddenly 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:18.279
 throw out of the game forest content manager 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:20.339
 just turn off the internet that's all
