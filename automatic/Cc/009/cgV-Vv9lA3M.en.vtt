all the jungle but the jungle trees
jungle<00:00:58.320> biome<00:00:58.440> grass<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.949> actually

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
jungle biome grass is actually

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.709 
jungle biome grass is actually
incredible<00:00:59.730> but<00:00:59.910> jungles<00:01:00.300> tend<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.600> pretty

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
incredible but jungles tend to be pretty

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.720 
incredible but jungles tend to be pretty
mountainous<00:01:01.199> as<00:01:01.410> well<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.770> would<00:01:02.609> recommend

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
mountainous as well I would recommend

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.210 
mountainous as well I would recommend
Plains<00:01:03.359> biomes<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.019> also<00:01:04.260> forest<00:01:04.619> biomes<00:01:05.010> and

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
Plains biomes and also forest biomes and

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.500 
Plains biomes and also forest biomes and
even<00:01:05.549> if<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.760> want<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.939> build<00:01:06.090> over<00:01:06.299> an<00:01:06.390> ocean

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
even if you want to build over an ocean

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.510 
even if you want to build over an ocean
biome<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.990> works<00:01:07.290> too<00:01:07.530> but<00:01:08.250> those<00:01:08.340> are

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
biome that works too but those are

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.100 
biome that works too but those are
pretty<00:01:08.670> much<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> two<00:01:09.060> biomes<00:01:09.479> I'd<00:01:09.630> recommend

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
pretty much the two biomes I'd recommend

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.960 
pretty much the two biomes I'd recommend
planes<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.740> forests<00:01:11.310> obviously<00:01:11.640> planes<00:01:11.850> and

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
planes and forests obviously planes and

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.950 
planes and forests obviously planes and
hearts<00:01:12.150> are<00:01:12.210> pretty<00:01:12.360> much<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> same<00:01:12.659> thing

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
hearts are pretty much the same thing

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.179 
hearts are pretty much the same thing
you<00:01:13.200> know<00:01:13.320> farce<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:13.860> need<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.010> clear

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
you know farce you just need to clear

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.010 
you know farce you just need to clear
out<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> trees<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:14.970> that's<00:01:15.630> where<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.869> would

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
out the trees but that's where I would

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.109 
out the trees but that's where I would
start<00:01:16.500> when<00:01:16.950> you're<00:01:17.070> comes<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.820> know<00:01:17.909> at

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
start when you're comes to you know at

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.370 
start when you're comes to you know at
the<00:01:18.210> very<00:01:18.420> beginning<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.780> your<00:01:18.840> city<00:01:19.110> make

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the very beginning of your city make

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.660 
the very beginning of your city make
sure<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.740> find<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.040> good<00:01:20.070> biome<00:01:20.460> and

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
sure that you find a good biome and

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.370 
sure that you find a good biome and
obviously<00:01:21.119> I'd<00:01:21.360> recommend<00:01:21.780> Plains<00:01:22.020> biomes

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
obviously I'd recommend Plains biomes

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.770 
obviously I'd recommend Plains biomes
going<00:01:22.979> along<00:01:23.189> with<00:01:23.310> biomes<00:01:23.700> my<00:01:23.939> second<00:01:24.360> tip<00:01:24.570> is

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
going along with biomes my second tip is

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.300 
going along with biomes my second tip is
make<00:01:25.140> sure<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.560> build<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.890> city<00:01:26.100> by<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
make sure that you build a city by the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.370 
make sure that you build a city by the
water<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.909> lot<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.600> cities<00:01:27.840> in<00:01:27.930> real<00:01:28.080> life<00:01:28.259> are

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
water a lot of cities in real life are

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.899 
water a lot of cities in real life are
built<00:01:28.590> right<00:01:28.770> next<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> water<00:01:29.280> give<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.759> some

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
built right next to water give you some

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.910 
built right next to water give you some
examples<00:01:30.360> like<00:01:30.509> Chicago<00:01:31.079> New<00:01:31.290> York<00:01:31.439> Los

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
examples like Chicago New York Los

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.230 
examples like Chicago New York Los
Angeles<00:01:31.950> what<00:01:32.790> are<00:01:32.850> some<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.090> major

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
Angeles what are some of the major

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.120 
Angeles what are some of the major
cities<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.720> United<00:01:34.560> States<00:01:34.799> are<00:01:34.950> built

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
cities in the United States are built

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.100 
cities in the United States are built
right<00:01:35.250> by<00:01:35.369> water<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:36.900> something

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
right by water and this is something

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.270 
right by water and this is something
that<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.470> do<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.680> Minecraft<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.159> make

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
that you can do in Minecraft to make

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.679 
that you can do in Minecraft to make
your<00:01:38.400> city<00:01:38.579> not<00:01:38.700> only<00:01:38.729> look<00:01:39.000> more<00:01:39.150> realistic

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
your city not only look more realistic

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.819 
your city not only look more realistic
but<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.960> just<00:01:40.110> looks<00:01:40.290> really<00:01:40.500> good<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.710> general

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
but it just looks really good in general

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.460 
but it just looks really good in general
so<00:01:41.189> I've<00:01:41.340> done<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.759> Los<00:01:41.880> Angeles<00:01:42.119> my<00:01:42.659> city

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
so I've done this in Los Angeles my city

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.749 
so I've done this in Los Angeles my city
is<00:01:43.619> obviously<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.100> core<00:01:44.280> in<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.430> map<00:01:44.579> pretty

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
is obviously in the core in a map pretty

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.060 
is obviously in the core in a map pretty
much<00:01:44.970> surrounded<00:01:45.119> by<00:01:45.509> water<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.990> even<00:01:46.920> when

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
much surrounded by water and even when

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.410 
much surrounded by water and even when
you<00:01:47.159> switch<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.490> over<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.640> Xbox<00:01:48.060> one<00:01:48.270> there's

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
you switch it over to Xbox one there's

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.460 
you switch it over to Xbox one there's
still<00:01:48.540> quite<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> bit<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.990> water<00:01:49.079> around<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
still quite a bit of water around the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.770 
still quite a bit of water around the
city<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.220> would<00:01:50.759> try<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.000> find<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.540> Plains

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
city so I would try to find a Plains

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.749 
city so I would try to find a Plains
biome<00:01:52.200> or<00:01:52.320> a<00:01:52.350> forest<00:01:52.680> biome<00:01:53.009> with<00:01:53.220> an<00:01:53.399> ocean

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
biome or a forest biome with an ocean

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.190 
biome or a forest biome with an ocean
biome<00:01:53.939> next<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.509> that's<00:01:54.630> going<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.020> your

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
biome next to it that's going to be your

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.380 
biome next to it that's going to be your
ideal<00:01:55.590> starting<00:01:56.549> point<00:01:56.759> when<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.000> comes<00:01:57.180> to

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
ideal starting point when it comes to

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.060 
ideal starting point when it comes to
the<00:01:57.719> very<00:01:57.930> beginning<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.409> your<00:01:58.500> city<00:01:58.740> design

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the very beginning of your city design

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.200 
the very beginning of your city design
so<00:01:59.460> when<00:01:59.579> you're<00:01:59.670> first<00:01:59.759> starting<00:01:59.880> up<00:02:00.180> your

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
so when you're first starting up your

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.880 
so when you're first starting up your
city<00:02:00.479> make<00:02:00.930> sure<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.409> do<00:02:01.530> your<00:02:01.560> roads

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
city make sure that you do your roads

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.499 
city make sure that you do your roads
first<00:02:02.159> roads<00:02:02.520> are<00:02:02.670> important<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.270> want<00:02:03.420> to

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
first roads are important you want to

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.910 
first roads are important you want to
add<00:02:03.600> your<00:02:03.750> roads<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.200> your<00:02:04.290> plots<00:02:04.500> that's<00:02:04.829> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
add your roads and your plots that's the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.679 
add your roads and your plots that's the
first<00:02:05.130> thing<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.369> want<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.549> do<00:02:05.729> because<00:02:06.299> roads

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
first thing you want to do because roads

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.479 
first thing you want to do because roads
are<00:02:06.930> obviously<00:02:07.439> extremely<00:02:07.740> important<00:02:08.429> to

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
are obviously extremely important to

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.160 
are obviously extremely important to
making<00:02:08.640> your<00:02:08.849> city<00:02:09.030> look<00:02:09.209> realistic<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:09.989> I

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
making your city look realistic so I

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.900 
making your city look realistic so I
would<00:02:10.590> start<00:02:10.830> off<00:02:10.979> with<00:02:11.190> some<00:02:11.340> small<00:02:11.670> roads

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
would start off with some small roads

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.550 
would start off with some small roads
don't<00:02:12.120> just<00:02:12.480> jump<00:02:12.810> right<00:02:12.900> in

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
don't just jump right in

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.110 
don't just jump right in
and<00:02:13.650> just<00:02:13.860> build<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.250> huge<00:02:14.550> highway<00:02:14.970> going

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
and just build a huge highway going

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.490 
and just build a huge highway going
straight<00:02:15.420> down<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.690> middle<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.959> your<00:02:16.050> map<00:02:16.260> I

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
straight down the middle of your map I

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.620 
straight down the middle of your map I
did<00:02:17.160> this<00:02:17.310> when<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.580> first<00:02:17.819> started<00:02:18.120> on<00:02:18.180> my<00:02:18.360> city

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
did this when I first started on my city

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.449 
did this when I first started on my city
and<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.990> was<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> big<00:02:19.440> failure<00:02:19.770> and<00:02:20.130> I<00:02:20.190> ended<00:02:20.340> up

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
and it was a big failure and I ended up

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.220 
and it was a big failure and I ended up
tearing<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.910> whole<00:02:21.060> thing<00:02:21.240> down<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.990> I<00:02:22.020> would

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
tearing the whole thing down so I would

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.840 
tearing the whole thing down so I would
start<00:02:22.470> with<00:02:22.500> some<00:02:22.620> basic<00:02:23.100> city<00:02:23.310> roads<00:02:23.580> make

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
start with some basic city roads make

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.640 
start with some basic city roads make
sure<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.060> add<00:02:24.209> bunch<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.660> intersections<00:02:25.380> and

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
sure you add bunch of intersections and

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.650 
sure you add bunch of intersections and
a<00:02:25.800> bunch<00:02:26.069> of<00:02:26.220> plots<00:02:26.400> just<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.540> get

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
a bunch of plots just just to get

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.300 
a bunch of plots just just to get
yourself<00:02:27.930> started<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.890> can<00:02:28.920> start<00:02:29.220> to

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
yourself started and you can start to

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.970 
yourself started and you can start to
put<00:02:29.490> some<00:02:29.640> buildings<00:02:30.000> in<00:02:30.209> and<00:02:30.440> go<00:02:31.440> from<00:02:31.590> there

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
put some buildings in and go from there

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.100 
put some buildings in and go from there
so<00:02:32.310> my<00:02:32.430> next<00:02:32.489> tip<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.330> pretty<00:02:33.569> important

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
so my next tip is is pretty important

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.870 
so my next tip is is pretty important
and<00:02:34.260> this<00:02:34.470> tip<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.770> something<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.160> I<00:02:35.190> really

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
and this tip is something that I really

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.190 
and this tip is something that I really
struggled<00:02:36.030> with<00:02:36.300> when<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.569> first<00:02:36.660> started<00:02:37.080> my

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
struggled with when I first started my

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.090 
struggled with when I first started my
city<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.560> it's<00:02:37.650> something<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.010> have

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
city and it's something that I have

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.010 
city and it's something that I have
started<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.489> learn<00:02:38.610> along<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:38.940> way<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.390> that

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
started to learn along the way and that

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.110 
started to learn along the way and that
is<00:02:40.170> don't<00:02:40.380> plan<00:02:40.680> too<00:02:40.950> far<00:02:40.980> ahead<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:41.970> when<00:02:42.090> I

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
is don't plan too far ahead so when I

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.610 
is don't plan too far ahead so when I
started<00:02:42.480> my<00:02:42.569> city<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:42.840> was<00:02:43.050> like<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.500> know

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
started my city I was like you know

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.080 
started my city I was like you know
going<00:02:43.950> through<00:02:44.069> all<00:02:44.310> these<00:02:44.459> different<00:02:44.520> ideas

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
going through all these different ideas

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.190

kind of weird so on my city I've mixed
up<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.180> heights<00:05:06.360> big<00:05:06.569> times<00:05:06.780> you<00:05:06.990> go<00:05:07.110> anything

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
up the heights big times you go anything

from<00:05:07.860> the<00:05:07.979> Eclipse<00:05:08.190> Tower<00:05:08.550> which<00:05:08.909> is

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
from the Eclipse Tower which is

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.510 
from the Eclipse Tower which is
something<00:05:10.050> like<00:05:10.319> a<00:05:10.349> hundred<00:05:10.650> and<00:05:10.860> seventy

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
something like a hundred and seventy

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.800 
something like a hundred and seventy
blocks<00:05:11.759> tall<00:05:12.030> or<00:05:12.240> something<00:05:12.479> like<00:05:12.569> that

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
blocks tall or something like that

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.930 
blocks tall or something like that
anyway<00:05:13.169> and<00:05:13.949> you<00:05:14.250> have<00:05:14.280> a<00:05:14.430> bunch<00:05:14.669> of<00:05:14.789> other

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
anyway and you have a bunch of other

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.300 
anyway and you have a bunch of other
stuff<00:05:15.840> on<00:05:15.960> my<00:05:16.080> world<00:05:16.259> that's<00:05:16.469> I<00:05:16.710> guess<00:05:16.919> like

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
stuff on my world that's I guess like

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.680 
stuff on my world that's I guess like
much<00:05:17.520> shorter<00:05:17.819> than<00:05:17.849> that<00:05:18.060> I<00:05:18.090> kind<00:05:18.360> of<00:05:18.389> mix<00:05:18.569> up

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
much shorter than that I kind of mix up

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.779 
much shorter than that I kind of mix up
the<00:05:18.840> levels<00:05:19.139> obviously<00:05:20.039> the<00:05:20.159> Eclipse<00:05:20.460> towers

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
the levels obviously the Eclipse towers

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.159 
the levels obviously the Eclipse towers
being<00:05:20.969> the<00:05:21.090> tallest<00:05:21.240> but<00:05:21.629> then<00:05:21.780> we<00:05:21.870> have<00:05:21.990> some

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
this is what it is in most games it just

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.459

makes<00:06:12.479> the<00:06:12.569> game<00:06:12.659> a<00:06:12.719> lot<00:06:12.810> more<00:06:12.960> interesting<00:06:13.440> a

00:06:13.459 --> 00:06:13.469
