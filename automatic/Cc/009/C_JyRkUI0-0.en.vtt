these rocks here now we're going to like
this<00:02:53.750> just<00:02:54.080> a<00:02:54.290> bit<00:02:54.500> with<00:02:54.770> this<00:02:55.340> rock<00:02:55.670> cover

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.730 

so<00:03:24.920> what<00:03:25.010> we're<00:03:25.130> doing<00:03:25.160> is<00:03:25.400> we're<00:03:25.580> block<00:03:26.270> in

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
so what we're doing is we're block in

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.480 
so what we're doing is we're block in
color<00:03:27.740> we're<00:03:28.040> trying<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.810> establish<00:03:29.810> the

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 
color we're trying to establish the

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.450 
color we're trying to establish the
major<00:03:31.490> shapes<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.360> then<00:03:32.740> we<00:03:33.740> refined<00:03:34.250> by

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
major shapes and then we refined by

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.210 
major shapes and then we refined by
painting<00:03:34.730> over<00:03:35.120> them<00:03:35.300> later<00:03:35.620> and<00:03:36.620> he<00:03:36.830> offers<00:03:37.190> a

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
painting over them later and he offers a

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:45.850 
painting over them later and he offers a
things<00:03:37.550> like<00:03:39.220> flies<00:03:40.220> for<00:03:42.910> problems<00:03:44.470> lines<00:03:45.470> for

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
things like flies for problems lines for

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.910 
things like flies for problems lines for
all<00:03:46.160> sorts<00:03:46.460> of<00:03:46.640> things<00:03:46.700> right<00:03:47.300> on<00:03:47.480> the<00:03:47.570> rocks

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
all sorts of things right on the rocks

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.390 
all sorts of things right on the rocks
beside<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.460> clouds<00:03:49.760> everything<00:03:51.220> but<00:03:52.220> it<00:03:52.280> all

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
beside the clouds everything but it all

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.310 
beside the clouds everything but it all
have<00:03:52.550> to<00:03:52.670> be<00:03:52.700> based<00:03:53.000> on<00:03:53.240> some<00:03:53.690> sort<00:03:53.930> of<00:03:53.990> date

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
have to be based on some sort of date

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:02.130 
have to be based on some sort of date
shapes

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:25.390 

I'll<00:04:03.140> put<00:04:03.409> it<00:04:03.530> in<00:04:03.650> some<00:04:03.860> rocks<00:04:04.099> up<00:04:04.310> front<00:04:04.670> now

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.020 

and<00:04:26.000> then<00:04:26.410> what<00:04:27.410> it<00:04:27.530> sucks<00:04:27.770> all<00:04:27.979> the<00:04:28.070> branches

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:42.270 

screwin<00:04:32.030> is<00:04:32.120> some<00:04:32.360> of<00:04:32.449> the<00:04:32.509> water<00:04:32.690> down<00:04:32.960> here

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280
