live together now - it's been a it's
been<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.470> while<00:01:01.680> for<00:01:02.040> last<00:01:02.820> time<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.089> did<00:01:03.239> that

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
been a while for last time we did that

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.270 
been a while for last time we did that
maybe<00:01:03.720> we've<00:01:03.809> been<00:01:03.960> going<00:01:04.559> out<00:01:04.650> all<00:01:05.040> together

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
maybe we've been going out all together

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.260 
maybe we've been going out all together
a<00:01:06.150> little<00:01:06.750> bit<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.820> always<00:01:09.090> fun

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
a little bit and it's it's always fun

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.800 
a little bit and it's it's always fun
but<00:01:09.450> here<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.930> same<00:01:10.290> same<00:01:11.180> age<00:01:12.180> difference<00:01:12.750> -

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
but here the same same age difference -

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.980 
but here the same same age difference -
a<00:01:12.930> little<00:01:13.110> bit<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.380> when<00:01:14.090> have<00:01:15.090> our<00:01:15.240> own<00:01:15.420> home

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
a little bit like when have our own home

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.010 
a little bit like when have our own home
friends<00:01:16.610> back<00:01:17.610> home<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.270> was<00:01:18.420> until<00:01:18.720> later

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
friends back home it was until later

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.020 
friends back home it was until later
that<00:01:19.320> we<00:01:19.439> we<00:01:20.040> went<00:01:20.250> out<00:01:20.340> together<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.880> think

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
that we we went out together I think

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.789 
that we we went out together I think
we've<00:01:21.330> always<00:01:21.509> had<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> good

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
we've always had like a good

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.580 
we've always had like a good
relationship<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.640> way<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:24.299> there's<00:01:24.630> like

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
relationship that way we there's like

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.710 
relationship that way we there's like
never<00:01:25.799> been<00:01:26.009> any<00:01:26.130> bad<00:01:26.310> blood<00:01:26.579> and

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
never been any bad blood and

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.450 
never been any bad blood and
everything's<00:01:27.720> been<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.560> good<00:01:28.829> throughout

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
everything's been like good throughout

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.670 
everything's been like good throughout
our<00:01:29.729> whole<00:01:30.060> childhood<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.900> think<00:01:31.380> there's

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
our whole childhood I think there's

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.850 
our whole childhood I think there's
probably<00:01:32.460> some<00:01:32.780> similarities<00:01:33.780> between<00:01:34.500> us

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
probably some similarities between us

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.670 
probably some similarities between us
for<00:01:35.070> sure<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.520> then<00:01:36.120> then<00:01:36.630> some<00:01:36.930> some

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
for sure and then then some some

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.070 
for sure and then then some some
differences<00:01:38.250> as<00:01:38.580> well<00:01:38.760> I<00:01:38.820> think<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.300> it's

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
differences as well I think it's it's

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.770 
differences as well I think it's it's
tough<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:41.159> tough<00:01:41.310> for<00:01:41.610> us<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.909> evaluate<00:01:42.420> that

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
tough it's tough for us to evaluate that

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.270 
tough it's tough for us to evaluate that
I<00:01:42.840> think<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.260> easier<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:43.590> somebody<00:01:44.010> looking

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
I think it's easier for somebody looking

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.190 
I think it's easier for somebody looking
outside<00:01:44.940> to<00:01:45.390> see<00:01:45.570> it<00:01:45.690> see<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.200> but<00:01:46.550> we<00:01:48.200> played

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
outside to see it see that but we played

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.620 
outside to see it see that but we played
together<00:01:49.380> for<00:01:49.729> like<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:51.000> when<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.540> were

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
together for like just when we were

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.570 
together for like just when we were
growing<00:01:51.840> up<00:01:52.080> together<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:53.130> outside

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
growing up together like just outside

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.000 
growing up together like just outside
drinks<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.210> stuff<00:01:54.540> like<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.020> probably

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
drinks and stuff like that so probably

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.810 
drinks and stuff like that so probably
we<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.360> something<00:01:57.360> similar

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.320 

I'd<00:02:02.820> say<00:02:03.090> determined<00:02:03.950> laid-back<00:02:05.330> that's

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
I'd say determined laid-back that's

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.060 
I'd say determined laid-back that's
that's<00:02:06.840> true<00:02:07.110> but<00:02:07.350> but<00:02:07.890> uh<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.490> don't<00:02:09.330> know<00:02:09.479> if

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
that's true but but uh I don't know if

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.400 
that's true but but uh I don't know if
it's<00:02:11.070> just<00:02:11.130> one<00:02:11.460> word<00:02:11.640> it's<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.840> enough<00:02:13.170> but

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
it's just one word it's is enough but

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:22.580 
it's just one word it's is enough but
let's<00:02:14.270> prove<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.540> then<00:02:15.930> it's<00:02:16.050> fine<00:02:21.590> some

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
let's prove that then it's fine some

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.880 
let's prove that then it's fine some
fish<00:02:22.920> that's<00:02:23.220> really<00:02:24.410> friendly<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:25.680> everybody

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
fish that's really friendly to everybody

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.880 
fish that's really friendly to everybody
and<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:27.210> nice<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.960> don't<00:02:28.020> know<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.470> don't<00:02:28.830> know

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
and and nice I don't know I don't know

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.730 
and and nice I don't know I don't know
what<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.280> could<00:02:29.400> be<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.820> big<00:02:30.510> goldfish<00:02:31.380> I

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
what that could be a big goldfish I

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.790 
what that could be a big goldfish I
would<00:02:32.730> say<00:02:32.880> shark<00:02:33.180> but<00:02:33.450> he's<00:02:33.870> not<00:02:34.080> mean<00:02:34.380> so

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
would say shark but he's not mean so

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.680 
would say shark but he's not mean so
that<00:02:34.830> that's<00:02:35.700> not<00:02:36.000> that's<00:02:36.720> not<00:02:36.900> good

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
that that's not that's not good
