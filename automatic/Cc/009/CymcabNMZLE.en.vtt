00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:24.900
 hello personal environment conclusion that is 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:28.919
 well the environment in the club is a 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:33.059
 related to global illumination of the 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:36.120
 right setting this feature makes 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.150
 games are getting more beautiful and 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.309
 more realistic 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.820
 initially was a technology and that 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.480
 was born a game crysis the first game 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.989
 for this so famous the wheel classes 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.750
 because it is a very heavy game and one of the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.090
 reasons he is so heavy 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.320
 It's how it was because of the environment. 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.739
 occlusion this resource has suffered several 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.430
 changes several new versions with 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.580
 new features that improve every time 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.580
 plus image quality 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.850
 after all, even mainly in 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.060
 horror games or the lighting that 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.409
 light there a reflection makes people 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.740
 scare more and have a greater immersion 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:32.520
 in play due to the environment or cross 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.430
 sure the greater the reality of that 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.439
 lighting up to much better 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:43.649
 sometimes you have a right wall right 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:47.280
 only with an ideal lighting it 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.490
 seems to be textured and have an image 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.500
 more beautiful it seems more real without 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.030
 more three-dimensional and such 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.210
 so this feature is very important 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.640
 the quality of games and 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.810
 consecutively it weighs much more 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.000
 games, right? 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.040
 so when you 're running a game and 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.489
 your machine is not handling the 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:15.209
 message is one of the resources that you 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.519
 sometimes reduce or even turn it off. 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.180
 able to have a more fluid game has 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:24.150
 a more pleasing frame rate right 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.730
 It has been useful for you to have 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.190

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.850

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.670
