00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
nests that are also not very effective

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.330 
nests that are also not very effective
they<00:01:19.020> sometimes<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.619> their<00:01:19.740> instructions

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
indicate that in order for the trap to

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.499 
indicate that in order for the trap to
work<00:01:22.979> most<00:01:23.189> effectively<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.939> should<00:01:24.119> remove

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
work most effectively you should remove

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.660 
work most effectively you should remove
existing<00:01:25.200> wasp<00:01:25.710> nests<00:01:26.070> from<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.280> yard<00:01:26.460> and
