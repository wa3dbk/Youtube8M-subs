hairstyle<00:02:45.560> when<00:02:46.070> he's<00:02:46.220> estimate<00:02:46.850> in<00:02:47.140> it's<00:02:48.140> one

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
hairstyle when he's estimate in it's one

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.990

of the coolest stars out there and you

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.220 
of the coolest stars out there and you
know<00:02:50.090> that's<00:02:50.360> why<00:02:50.510> I've<00:02:50.600> been<00:02:50.690> experiments

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
know that's why I've been experiments

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.200 
know that's why I've been experiments
because<00:02:51.320> my<00:02:51.500> hair<00:02:51.710> doesn't<00:02:52.220> do<00:02:52.460> that<00:02:52.940> sort<00:02:53.120> of

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
because my hair doesn't do that sort of

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.970

long time ago now but I'm gonna use that

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.090 
long time ago now but I'm gonna use that
and<00:04:34.300> I'm<00:04:34.780> gonna<00:04:34.930> use<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.139> forming<00:04:35.470> cream<00:04:35.650> now

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
and I'm gonna use the forming cream now

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.050 
and I'm gonna use the forming cream now
what<00:04:36.310> we're<00:04:36.400> gonna<00:04:36.490> do<00:04:36.669> is<00:04:36.759> we're<00:04:36.850> gonna<00:04:36.910> use

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.100 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna use
them<00:04:37.330> together<00:04:38.009> so<00:04:39.780> this<00:04:40.780> is<00:04:40.900> called

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
them together so this is called

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.480 
them together so this is called
cocktailing<00:04:41.500> and<00:04:41.740> it's<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:41.919> really<00:04:42.160> good<00:04:42.370> idea

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
cocktailing and it's a really good idea

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.990 
cocktailing and it's a really good idea
especially<00:04:43.449> if<00:04:43.720> you<00:04:43.810> have<00:04:43.960> some<00:04:44.110> problem<00:04:44.470> hair

especially if you have some problem hair

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.850 
especially if you have some problem hair
for<00:04:46.000> me<00:04:46.120> particulars<00:04:46.720> my<00:04:46.840> hair<00:04:47.050> is<00:04:47.229> sort<00:04:47.740> of<00:04:47.830> a

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
for me particulars my hair is sort of a

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.230 
for me particulars my hair is sort of a
nightmare<00:04:48.039> this<00:04:48.370> is<00:04:48.490> quite<00:04:48.669> dry<00:04:48.910> a<00:04:48.940> lot<00:04:49.180> of

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
nightmare this is quite dry a lot of

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.080 
nightmare this is quite dry a lot of
time<00:04:49.479> and<00:04:49.840> it's<00:04:49.990> just<00:04:50.169> big<00:04:51.070> I<00:04:51.310> need<00:04:51.789> something

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
time and it's just big I need something

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.090 
time and it's just big I need something
that's<00:04:52.210> gonna<00:04:52.360> give<00:04:52.660> it<00:04:52.690> a<00:04:52.810> bit<00:04:52.930> of<00:04:52.990> shine<00:04:53.259> but

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
that's gonna give it a bit of shine but

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.379 
that's gonna give it a bit of shine but
often<00:04:54.340> things<00:04:54.610> that<00:04:54.729> give<00:04:54.820> a<00:04:54.880> shine<00:04:55.090> that<00:04:55.240> have

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
often things that give a shine that have

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.150 
often things that give a shine that have
enough<00:04:55.539> hold<00:04:55.780> so<00:04:56.320> I<00:04:56.380> think<00:04:56.530> cocktail<00:04:57.009> if

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
enough hold so I think cocktail if

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.350 
enough hold so I think cocktail if
something's<00:04:57.520> gonna<00:04:57.639> give<00:04:57.820> some<00:04:57.970> hold<00:04:58.180> to

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
something's gonna give some hold to

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.520 
something's gonna give some hold to
which<00:04:58.600> is<00:04:58.720> exactly<00:04:58.990> what<00:04:59.110> I'm<00:04:59.169> doing<00:04:59.380> here

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
which is exactly what I'm doing here

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.340 
which is exactly what I'm doing here
because<00:05:00.479> Robinson's<00:05:01.479> hair<00:05:01.690> is<00:05:01.870> so<00:05:02.080> sort<00:05:02.320> of

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
because Robinson's hair is so sort of

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.860 
because Robinson's hair is so sort of
shiny<00:05:02.650> and<00:05:03.039> healthy<00:05:03.370> and<00:05:03.789> stuff<00:05:04.120> even<00:05:04.300> to<00:05:04.780> the

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
shiny and healthy and stuff even to the

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.029 
shiny and healthy and stuff even to the
point<00:05:05.050> sometimes<00:05:05.199> it<00:05:05.500> looks<00:05:05.590> a<00:05:05.710> bit<00:05:05.740> greasy

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
point sometimes it looks a bit greasy

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.830 
point sometimes it looks a bit greasy
when<00:05:06.280> he<00:05:06.370> doesn't<00:05:06.610> wash<00:05:06.789> so<00:05:07.419> we<00:05:07.630> need<00:05:07.750> to

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
when he doesn't wash so we need to

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.510 
when he doesn't wash so we need to
pomade<00:05:08.169> for<00:05:08.350> that<00:05:08.470> because<00:05:09.100> it's<00:05:09.310> really

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
pomade for that because it's really

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.730 
pomade for that because it's really
shiny<00:05:09.729> and<00:05:10.210> gives<00:05:10.690> really<00:05:11.020> nice<00:05:11.169> or<00:05:11.380> supple

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
shiny and gives really nice or supple

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.100 
shiny and gives really nice or supple
control<00:05:12.100> but<00:05:12.639> he's<00:05:12.880> is<00:05:13.030> also<00:05:13.360> separating<00:05:14.020> his

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
control but he's is also separating his

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.629 
control but he's is also separating his
bits<00:05:14.320> all<00:05:14.410> over<00:05:14.500> the<00:05:14.620> place<00:05:14.800> whereas<00:05:15.460> mine

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
bits all over the place whereas mine

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.370 
bits all over the place whereas mine
will<00:05:15.820> go<00:05:15.850> up<00:05:16.150> but<00:05:16.449> it'll<00:05:16.600> go<00:05:16.780> in<00:05:16.900> a<00:05:16.960> big<00:05:17.110> clump

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
will go up but it'll go in a big clump

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.409 
will go up but it'll go in a big clump
so<00:05:17.949> this<00:05:18.070> is<00:05:18.190> quite<00:05:18.310> nice<00:05:18.580> to<00:05:18.789> keep<00:05:18.910> it<00:05:19.060> give<00:05:19.300> us

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419

so won't do exactly the same thing be

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.129 
so won't do exactly the same thing be
sort<00:06:30.639> of<00:06:30.669> just<00:06:30.729> has<00:06:31.060> bits<00:06:31.330> all<00:06:31.510> over<00:06:31.780> all<00:06:32.110> over

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:32.139 
sort of just has bits all over all over

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.790 
sort of just has bits all over all over
the<00:06:32.380> place<00:06:32.620> the<00:06:33.159> fringe<00:06:33.490> is<00:06:33.909> again<00:06:34.840> everywhere

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
the place the fringe is again everywhere

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.170 
the place the fringe is again everywhere
so<00:06:36.190> there's<00:06:36.340> bit<00:06:36.550> you<00:06:36.669> know<00:06:36.760> if<00:06:36.849> you<00:06:36.969> want<00:06:37.120> to

so there's bit you know if you want to

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.029 
so there's bit you know if you want to
find<00:06:37.479> bits<00:06:37.719> and<00:06:37.930> pull<00:06:38.110> them<00:06:38.320> you<00:06:38.650> know

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 
find bits and pull them you know

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:41.100 
find bits and pull them you know
do<00:06:39.279> that<00:06:39.520> because<00:06:40.029> hair<00:06:40.389> is<00:06:40.599> all<00:06:40.839> over<00:06:40.869> the

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110 
do that because hair is all over the

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.869 
do that because hair is all over the
shop<00:06:41.229> and<00:06:41.379> it's<00:06:41.529> actually<00:06:41.860> probably<00:06:42.520> one<00:06:42.849> of

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:42.879 
shop and it's actually probably one of

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:44.129 
shop and it's actually probably one of
the<00:06:43.029> most<00:06:43.089> on-trend<00:06:43.330> looks<00:06:43.719> at<00:06:43.839> the<00:06:43.900> minute

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:44.139 
the most on-trend looks at the minute

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:47.909 
the most on-trend looks at the minute
just<00:06:44.349> messy<00:06:45.069> stuff<00:06:46.059> you<00:06:46.330> know<00:06:46.680> get<00:06:47.680> your<00:06:47.770> head

fingers in and you know mess it up okay
so<00:06:51.909> there<00:06:52.569> you<00:06:52.599> go<00:06:53.430> just<00:06:54.430> so<00:06:54.550> bear<00:06:54.759> in<00:06:54.879> mind

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:55.029 
so there you go just so bear in mind

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:56.760 
so there you go just so bear in mind
obviously<00:06:55.509> my<00:06:55.689> hair<00:06:55.930> is<00:06:56.020> a<00:06:56.080> lot<00:06:56.259> thicker<00:06:56.499> than

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
obviously my hair is a lot thicker than

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.339 
obviously my hair is a lot thicker than
his<00:06:56.800> and<00:06:57.249> not<00:06:58.180> quite<00:06:58.419> as<00:06:58.569> long<00:06:58.779> so<00:06:59.169> it's<00:06:59.289> not

00:06:59.339 --> 00:06:59.349 
his and not quite as long so it's not

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:00.600 
his and not quite as long so it's not
really<00:06:59.559> going<00:06:59.589> to<00:06:59.710> be<00:06:59.770> exactly<00:07:00.099> the<00:07:00.219> same<00:07:00.430> as

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:00.610 
really going to be exactly the same as

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.540 
really going to be exactly the same as
this<00:07:01.089> or<00:07:01.240> my<00:07:01.479> interpretation<00:07:02.259> if<00:07:03.189> you've<00:07:03.369> got

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:03.550 
this or my interpretation if you've got

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.879 
this or my interpretation if you've got
hair<00:07:03.729> that<00:07:03.909> is<00:07:04.059> not<00:07:04.599> as<00:07:04.719> thick<00:07:04.899> as<00:07:05.020> mine<00:07:05.199> it's

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:05.889 
hair that is not as thick as mine it's

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:06.869 
hair that is not as thick as mine it's
maybe<00:07:06.099> a<00:07:06.159> little<00:07:06.249> bit<00:07:06.399> thinner<00:07:06.430> then<00:07:06.759> you

00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:06.879 
maybe a little bit thinner then you

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:08.730 
maybe a little bit thinner then you
probably<00:07:07.059> have<00:07:07.210> more<00:07:07.360> luck<00:07:07.509> than<00:07:07.539> me<00:07:07.719> I<00:07:07.990> think

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:08.740 
probably have more luck than me I think

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.899 
probably have more luck than me I think
he's<00:07:08.830> quite<00:07:08.949> lucky<00:07:09.339> and<00:07:09.430> that<00:07:09.520> his<00:07:09.669> head<00:07:09.849> is

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:09.909 
he's quite lucky and that his head is

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:11.549 
he's quite lucky and that his head is
quite<00:07:10.180> easy<00:07:10.360> to<00:07:10.419> style<00:07:10.689> because<00:07:11.259> it<00:07:11.379> looks

00:07:11.549 --> 00:07:11.559 
quite easy to style because it looks

00:07:11.559 --> 00:07:13.170 
quite easy to style because it looks
like<00:07:11.740> the<00:07:11.860> consistency<00:07:12.099> of<00:07:12.399> a<00:07:12.550> baby's<00:07:12.969> hair

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.180 
like the consistency of a baby's hair

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.269 
like the consistency of a baby's hair
those<00:07:13.659> mines<00:07:13.960> really<00:07:14.199> coarse<00:07:14.559> and<00:07:14.800> horrible

00:07:15.269 --> 00:07:15.279 
those mines really coarse and horrible

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:17.579 
those mines really coarse and horrible
so<00:07:15.520> yeah<00:07:15.879> lucky<00:07:16.659> bastards<00:07:17.080> and<00:07:17.229> they<00:07:17.289> he's<00:07:17.469> got

00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:17.589 
so yeah lucky bastards and they he's got

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:18.929 
so yeah lucky bastards and they he's got
everything<00:07:17.889> the<00:07:18.099> way<00:07:18.189> we<00:07:18.309> style<00:07:18.520> our<00:07:18.639> hair<00:07:18.819> is

00:07:18.929 --> 00:07:18.939 
everything the way we style our hair is

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:20.549 
everything the way we style our hair is
quite<00:07:19.120> similar<00:07:19.360> although<00:07:19.779> he's<00:07:20.020> a<00:07:20.139> lot<00:07:20.349> nicer

00:07:20.549 --> 00:07:20.559 
quite similar although he's a lot nicer

00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:22.439 
quite similar although he's a lot nicer
texture<00:07:21.039> but<00:07:21.610> one<00:07:21.729> thing<00:07:21.879> I<00:07:21.939> noticed<00:07:22.270> is<00:07:22.330> that

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:22.449 
texture but one thing I noticed is that

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:25.200 
texture but one thing I noticed is that
when<00:07:22.689> I<00:07:22.899> do<00:07:23.559> my<00:07:23.740> own<00:07:23.770> hair<00:07:23.919> I'll<00:07:24.580> tend<00:07:24.999> to<00:07:25.059> still

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.210 
when I do my own hair I'll tend to still

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.689 
when I do my own hair I'll tend to still
get<00:07:25.330> the<00:07:25.479> whole<00:07:25.599> front<00:07:26.139> out<00:07:26.259> of<00:07:26.289> the<00:07:26.379> way<00:07:26.699> and

00:07:27.689 --> 00:07:27.699 
get the whole front out of the way and

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:30.540 
get the whole front out of the way and
it'll<00:07:28.029> all<00:07:28.180> be<00:07:28.210> worth<00:07:28.839> fringe<00:07:29.499> so<00:07:30.159> basically

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:30.550 
it'll all be worth fringe so basically

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.399 
it'll all be worth fringe so basically
where<00:07:30.639> the<00:07:30.699> fringe<00:07:30.939> and<00:07:31.149> the<00:07:31.300> side<00:07:31.809> start<00:07:32.259> is

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:32.409 
where the fringe and the side start is

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:34.139 
where the fringe and the side start is
about<00:07:32.589> here<00:07:32.800> for<00:07:32.979> me<00:07:33.099> for<00:07:33.279> him<00:07:33.729> it's<00:07:33.939> a<00:07:33.969> little

00:07:34.139 --> 00:07:34.149 
about here for me for him it's a little

00:07:34.149 --> 00:07:36.119 
about here for me for him it's a little
bit<00:07:34.240> more<00:07:34.360> of<00:07:34.509> a<00:07:34.629> sort<00:07:35.289> of<00:07:35.319> more<00:07:35.680> towards<00:07:36.069> the

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:36.129 
bit more of a sort of more towards the

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:37.709 
bit more of a sort of more towards the
middle<00:07:36.159> here<00:07:36.699> that's<00:07:37.300> just<00:07:37.449> something<00:07:37.569> I

00:07:37.709 --> 00:07:37.719 
middle here that's just something I

00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:39.689 
middle here that's just something I
noticed<00:07:37.869> so<00:07:38.199> rather<00:07:38.379> than<00:07:38.529> your<00:07:39.309> parting

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:39.699 
noticed so rather than your parting

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:41.059 
noticed so rather than your parting
there<00:07:39.849> and<00:07:40.029> that<00:07:40.119> this<00:07:40.240> one<00:07:40.389> to<00:07:40.479> that<00:07:40.599> side

00:07:41.059 --> 00:07:41.069 
there and that this one to that side

00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:44.129 
there and that this one to that side
usually<00:07:42.069> it'd<00:07:42.159> be<00:07:42.339> all<00:07:42.819> over<00:07:43.029> that<00:07:43.089> side<00:07:43.419> and<00:07:43.689> I

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:44.139 
usually it'd be all over that side and I

00:07:44.139 --> 00:07:45.420 
usually it'd be all over that side and I
quite<00:07:44.559> like<00:07:44.770> it<00:07:44.919> though<00:07:45.039> because<00:07:45.159> I<00:07:45.309> always

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:45.430 
quite like it though because I always

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.409 
quite like it though because I always
wonder<00:07:45.759> what<00:07:45.879> to<00:07:45.939> do<00:07:46.059> with<00:07:46.089> that<00:07:46.240> bit

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:46.419 
wonder what to do with that bit

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:48.480 
wonder what to do with that bit
sometimes<00:07:46.629> it<00:07:47.020> just<00:07:47.110> all<00:07:47.259> spikes<00:07:47.529> up<00:07:47.740> because

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:48.490 
sometimes it just all spikes up because

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:49.499 
sometimes it just all spikes up because
it<00:07:48.580> doesn't<00:07:48.789> really<00:07:48.909> know<00:07:49.059> whether<00:07:49.300> to<00:07:49.360> go

00:07:49.499 --> 00:07:49.509 
it doesn't really know whether to go

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:50.879 
it doesn't really know whether to go
into<00:07:49.689> one<00:07:49.839> side<00:07:50.020> and<00:07:50.199> the<00:07:50.259> other<00:07:50.289> side<00:07:50.559> in<00:07:50.800> this

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:50.889 
into one side and the other side in this

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:53.459 
into one side and the other side in this
goes<00:07:51.099> vertical<00:07:51.580> as<00:07:52.149> usual<00:07:52.599> and<00:07:52.899> professional
