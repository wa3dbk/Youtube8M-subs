00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello guys welcome back to a new one 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.330
 video of and we will talk today do not hear it 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.220
 sucks in the air 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.170
 if you don't feel you should because today 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.750
 boys are talking about schifani mali 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.599
 I premise one thing in these videos often 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.640
 I talk about parasites Valassi Tories do 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.720
 let's say some pretty nasty things 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.910
 but I never made a distinction 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.580
 in fact, animals can be fundamental 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.010
 be parasites and parasitoids i 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.680
 parasites have an interest in them 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.510
 guest be alive because from it anyway 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.000
 from something uncertain of him they draw 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.350
 nourishment ios and mac if the guest died 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.630
 they wouldn't do anything about it 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.780
 parasitoids instead to perform theirs 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.730
 tremendous cycle needs that the guest 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.250
 moria today we talk about one 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.920
 moschin family and the family of 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.010
 therefore order holes of the family 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.420
 pseudo act genus holes and one is about 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.270
 of a group of about forty species 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.129
 all the terrible parasitoids they are 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.930
 diffused in a real it goes from north america 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.390
 in Argentina we will analyze the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.760
 particular interest in the ants of 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.799
 these flies of the genus and pseudo acton 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.869
 usually prefer the molds of 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.240
 fire calls for their help 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.159
 pleasant bites that belong to the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.020
 solemn genre opsis the story begins 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.600
 when two of these small moschin e 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.640
 romantically mating nearby 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.140
 do not stop at or far from it 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.390
 the female depends a little on the massacre 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.330
 ugly in the warm weather, looking for a nice one 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.070
 formia yo and catch those formigine 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.439
 who do not have the chance to escape 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.049
 to take shelter immediately, for example 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.579
 pecks at his ideal ants during 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.350
 wedding calls 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.840
 or when it comes to colony 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.689
 rather aggressive they are reluctant to 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.520
 run away more prone to attack or ad 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.380
 example in areas where families point 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.000
 they are moments in which forms are 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.890
 disturbed that they cannot immediately 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.049
 run away the fly is based more 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.030
 what else on the nose sniffs precisely at 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.950
 substances such as pheromones produced in la 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.930
 forms and also trucks the products 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.670
 from the ant the dear flights are of the 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.729
 particular types of volatile hormones such as 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.799
 pheromones that are secret we say 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.930
 certain individual but me 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.700
 cause several disadvantages in the event that 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.530
 these ants 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.300
 the fact of being more verifiable by 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.769
 this music is counted though 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.720
 that of providing not particularly 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.060
 large and of mosques, sun formers palaces 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.819
 I do very little stuff anyway later 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.060
 and the observed fly chose its prey 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.670
 in flight passes close to the side 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.560
 openly attacks with love opponent 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.750
 which fits perfectly to the chest 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.890
 of the ant and injects a new one into the 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.410
 chest due to new days it opens and 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.840
 the fly larva immediately nice to 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.420
 feed on the body fluids of the 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.700
 ant and does it for two weeks though 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.519
 right now there is a mold if not 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.380
 he realizes or at least I don't think so 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.780
 however ants continue to do 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.459
 why does they were doing without 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.799
 to be particularly affected when the 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.440
 larva succeeds and becomes a little more 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.220
 corpulent the nightmare begins because 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.410
 begins from the chest to dig 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.480
 biting everything is lost head 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.400
 ant up to get there 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.500
 after which the cerebral ganglia is eaten 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.209
 of the ant and at that point I don't know if 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.069
 the family actually has none 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.370
 realizes and the most disturbing thing is that 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:16.549
 then it begins to secrete a substance that 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.400
 practically it damages the membrane which 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.560
 holds the head attached to the chest and 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.079
 therefore ant practically to the ant 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.019
 stalls and has some point come off her 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.870
 so ingenious test normal at that point 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.150
 the larva before becoming a pupa yes 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.160
 eat all there is to eat 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.600
 in the head to make space precisely 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.600
 that fattening complains of need of the 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.310
 space we say bouncers the structures a 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.650
 families of the mouth in the form so 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.989
 to gain even more space and stalin 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.730
 now it must be said el workers and ants 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.489
 insects are very efficient 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.170
 social have a great culture 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.569
 as regards the disposal of 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.700
 therefore refuse when this head is 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.790
 this separate body of the worker 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.310
 his are found with specifications e 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.410
 gently take the doors to a 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.140
 waste storage where they cannot 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.880
 contaminate resources 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.860
 they are useful to the anthill at that point 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.910
 when the larva inside the head arrives 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.470
 in the landfill and basically none 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.150
 the more he breaks his balls there he is free of 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.890
 do because he wants it because in an area 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.079
 quiet thing disturbing indeed e 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.590
 that flies then do not draft I have to 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.390
 which then comes the adult the fact is that 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.610
 this the net eats all that 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:31.180
 there is food to eat at the party, everything is done 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:34.840
 space and not imputed as it would 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.580
 a normal fly but basically the 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.400
 head dug from inside completely 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.410
 empty becomes his cocoon after two o 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.750
 three weeks the larva comes out transformed 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.270
 in impact from the oral life of the 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.220
 ant and whoever we have seen has been seen 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.140
 everything starts again as if nothing had happened 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.370
 an interesting consideration can 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.280
 also be made on determination 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.690
 of the sex of adult mosques because i 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.970
 Diptera sexual chromosomes 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.610
 they work similarly between 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.020
 quotes to ours and only 1 point on 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.480
 Diptera's success is often 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.370
 genetically predetermined as per 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.050
 us however in so many species of animals e 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.970
 the environment that is the master of 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.770
 the determination of sex 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.510
 depends on the environmental conditions in 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.520
 which embryos develop in many 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.770
 species happens a little bit long the other one 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.740
 in the case of these mosques, if the halberd 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.940
 in a bigger ant party between 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.160
 they will be more Christian 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.060
 probability that the adult fly will be 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.590
 female 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.210
 this is because the females are a little more 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.729
 large because they need precisely of 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:34.030
 more energy to make eggs do 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:36.040
 mature after lavish adult banquets 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.870
 you don't know what everyone is doing 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.450
 they ask that they eat these flies from 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.419
 no one has anyone even adult 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.190
 proposed to use these flies in the 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:47.590
 biological fight to fight some 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.600
 forms and allochthonous of the solemn kind 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.039
 opsis that are widespread in the united states 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.710
 which should not be there instead 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.390
 if they are better than pesticides, they don't 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.280
 you know never go steroids said 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.419
 This is why I salute here the video is finished 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.250
 as always 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.710
 like the video if there is 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.910
 liked commented let me know that 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.190
 you like those you don't like 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.780
 if you want to share the video put yourself 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.120
 like the facebook page where he puts a 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.930
 bit of updates and see you at 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.930
 next video hello
