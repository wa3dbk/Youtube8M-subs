 well the installation is really 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.359
 simple and the first step is to download 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.789

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.309
 search program if you want 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.590

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.500

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.300
 tell us about downloading skype for 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.920
 desk for windows windows i 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.050
 I have windows 8 but I'm going to lower the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.420
 desktop version is also the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.910
 version of windows 8 that works with the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.329
 interface for devices that have 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.640
 touch screens I prefer the version 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.410
 of desktop since I always work in 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.930
 the desktop and I almost never use the 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.989
 windows 8 applications we click 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.700
 there and will start the download 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.720
 automatically I will keep it in 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.110
 the desk 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.600
 is to save it in another location so 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.340
 we have the first step ready, we are going to 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.640
 go to the second part which is to install 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.500
 skype on our computer I had it 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.630
 downloaded to the desktop so I'm going to 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.670
 double click will ask me for the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.590
 administrator permissions so there are 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.870
 that give you the permissions there's no problem 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.490
 Select your language Spanish not 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.260
 wants to execute skype when starting the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.750
 very careful team here you have to 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.240
 uncheck this option we accept 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.920
 next install click to call with 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.840
 Skype of this application is useful but I 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.090
 I do not want to give it to continue 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.540
 I want to use bing and messenger myself 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.520
 I use google and ready and will start 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.229
 install will take a few 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.140
 I 'll accelerate it for seconds 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.140
 make you wait no problem and already what 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.270
 we have installed the skype now we are going to 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.920
 log in to verify that everything 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.979
 be well remember that you can use 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.050
 a hotmail account so there's no 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.509
 problem in which you find anyone 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.250
 of your friends since everyone has 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.959
 a hotmail account you can also 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.050
 do with an account 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.840
 outlook or a microsoft account 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.780
 I love your username and password and 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.340
 we give you to login here take a 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.810
 couple of seconds while they load 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.760
 our preferences 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.660
 I had already installed Skype before so 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.280
 that will load all my contacts if 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.040
 everything uses this month yesterday once 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.680
 possibly all of them appear here 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.980
 contacts that you had in your messenger yes 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.350
 so let's give it to recent well 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.780
 it seems that everything is fine now we are going to 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.090
 check a trick and it's how to close 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.640
 session correctly on skype look for 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.100
 close session gives you search close session 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.130
 and apparently we are ready and we are going 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.420
 to click here on the X but 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.600
 we go back to the desk and there he continues 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.420
 sing we close it we go back to the desk 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.240
 and it's still there the skype does not leave we're going like this 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.080
 that right click leave skype tells us 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.910
 if he does leave and ready with it we go 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.130
 to return to the desk and now yes 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.290
