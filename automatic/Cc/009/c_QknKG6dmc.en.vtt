 Hello friends with you in the same

 This video will show you a few 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.620
 various teams that you can 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.780
 come in handy when playing counter-strike 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.500
 source v34 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.830
 I wish you a pleasant viewing and the first 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.189
 team as you probably already understood it 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.349
 on a very small sight 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.810
 some players don't know which one 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:36.090
 command for this is used but in this 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:38.219
 the video you all learn here means how 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.500
 you can make a small sight for this 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:46.440

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.899
 small sight apply ok here 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.660
 I personally play with such a sight mania he 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.930
 quite satisfied but someone this 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.140
 not enough here if you want to have you 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.850
 the sight was like four points for this 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:12.000
 we enter into the console the following command to 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:14.700
 crosshair rocks 20000 and here we have such 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:24.030
 sight as you see four small 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:29.270
 points if you want to return the former 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.200

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:48.480
 here is such a command following command 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.480

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:22.650
 your pink servers can drop to 1 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:25.140
 but on some server installed such 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:30.270
