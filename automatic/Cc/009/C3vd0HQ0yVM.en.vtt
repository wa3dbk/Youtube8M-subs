00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.670 
that actually wanted to pay the
university<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.640> lease<00:00:54.090> from<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.960> University

the right to operate that University's
football<00:00:57.690> program<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.590> think<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.219> could<00:00:59.370> lead

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
football program I think that could lead

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.639 
football program I think that could lead
to<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.730> lot<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.030> innovation<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.469> could

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
to a lot of innovation and it could

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.110 
to a lot of innovation and it could
actually<00:01:01.859> potentially<00:01:02.160> attract<00:01:02.820> high

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
actually potentially attract high

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.690 
actually potentially attract high
quality<00:01:03.629> high<00:01:03.930> school<00:01:04.229> players<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.489> no
