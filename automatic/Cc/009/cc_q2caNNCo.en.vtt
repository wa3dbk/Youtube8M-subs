the bad thing about nail polish is like

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.670 
the bad thing about nail polish is like
this<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:55.049> they<00:01:55.229> don't<00:01:55.590> tend<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.369> be<00:01:56.490> as<00:01:56.670> um

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
this is that they don't tend to be as um

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.280 
this is that they don't tend to be as um
true<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.610> bottle<00:02:00.420> like<00:02:00.689> when<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.960> look<00:02:01.140> at

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
true to the bottle like when you look at

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.780 
true to the bottle like when you look at
it<00:02:01.320> doesn't<00:02:01.860> really<00:02:02.040> come<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.759> I

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
it doesn't really come on like that I

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.090 
it doesn't really come on like that I
think<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.149> need<00:02:03.360> about<00:02:03.479> three<00:02:04.350> or<00:02:04.380> four<00:02:04.500> coats

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
think you need about three or four coats

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.270 
think you need about three or four coats

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
but I wanted to try it anyhow because

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.470
