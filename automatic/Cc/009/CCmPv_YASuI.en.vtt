 hello welcome to the back my 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.040
 day and today we do one of my 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.230
 favorite poquÃ© recipes we make 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.670
 namely cookies with macadamia nuts 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.859
 white chocolate and caramel 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.400
 they're really good for that 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.029
 first and foremost the mother and the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.430
 sugar and suggest that to say both 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.019
 look at me and take it easy 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.820
 a little bit of time so if you are like that 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.320
 let it go for about three minutes 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.020
 It will then be mixed with the hand mixer 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:40.170
 really nice fluffy so much the better 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:43.620
 then the look then you take that 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:54.120
 vanilla exactly or vanilla sugar 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:58.969

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.969

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.460
 just so that everything is mixed up as well 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.460

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:46.960
 ruse and make so big little balls 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:48.640

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.020

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.190

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.400
 the oven 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.770
