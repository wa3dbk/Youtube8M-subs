change the reference of your move you
have<00:01:17.250> your<00:01:17.400> distance<00:01:17.850> limit<00:01:18.210> which<00:01:18.659> will

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
have your distance limit which will

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.780 
have your distance limit which will
effectively<00:01:19.890> change<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.520> radius<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.140> your<00:01:22.140> of

you can modify this F curve and modify
your<00:01:44.759> final<00:01:45.270> shape<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:46.140> if<00:01:46.259> we<00:01:46.409> go<00:01:46.530> ahead<00:01:46.649> here

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
your final shape so if we go ahead here

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.639 
your final shape so if we go ahead here
and<00:01:47.220> get<00:01:47.490> kind<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.970> more<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.110> round<00:01:49.320> shape

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
and get kind of a more of a round shape

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.899 
and get kind of a more of a round shape
and<00:01:49.979> let's<00:01:50.310> add<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.520> few<00:01:50.729> more<00:01:50.790> keyframes<00:01:52.909> let's

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
and let's add a few more keyframes let's

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.830 
and let's add a few more keyframes let's
see<00:01:54.180> here<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.880> let's<00:01:57.060> go<00:01:57.180> ahead<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.479> add<00:01:57.810> a

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
see here so let's go ahead and add a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.959 
see here so let's go ahead and add a
keyframe<00:01:58.140> here<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.579> can<00:01:59.880> see<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:01.759> if<00:02:02.759> we

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
keyframe here so you can see that if we

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.580 
keyframe here so you can see that if we
select<00:02:03.180> these<00:02:03.479> guys<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.170> change<00:02:04.439> our

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
select these guys and change our

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.389 
select these guys and change our
tangents<00:02:05.750> maybe<00:02:06.750> let's<00:02:06.990> do<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> linear

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
tangents maybe let's do a linear

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.559 
tangents maybe let's do a linear
and<00:02:09.519> then<00:02:10.239> at<00:02:10.479> another<00:02:10.780> point<00:02:11.110> that<00:02:12.569> move

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
and then at another point that move

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.869 
and then at another point that move
these<00:02:13.720> guys<00:02:14.019> you<00:02:14.590> can<00:02:14.739> see<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:15.189> you're<00:02:15.730> able

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
these guys you can see that you're able

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.089 
these guys you can see that you're able
to<00:02:16.150> get<00:02:16.239> interesting<00:02:16.599> shapes<00:02:17.140> now<00:02:17.769> by<00:02:18.040> default

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
to get interesting shapes now by default

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.050 
to get interesting shapes now by default
with<00:02:18.819> in<00:02:19.030> my<00:02:19.390> current<00:02:19.810> settings<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.560> have<00:02:21.060> have

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
with in my current settings I have have

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.660 
with in my current settings I have have
all<00:02:22.409> new<00:02:23.409> curves<00:02:23.709> generated<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.489> have<00:02:24.640> a

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
all new curves generated to have a

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.300 
all new curves generated to have a
stepped<00:02:26.549> to<00:02:27.549> be<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.700> stepped<00:02:28.090> curve<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:29.310> that's

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
stepped to be a stepped curve so that's

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.130 
stepped to be a stepped curve so that's
why<00:02:30.489> you<00:02:30.549> can<00:02:30.730> see<00:02:30.939> that<00:02:30.970> all<00:02:31.329> my<00:02:31.480> curves<00:02:31.780> ended

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
why you can see that all my curves ended

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.649 
why you can see that all my curves ended
up<00:02:32.260> all<00:02:32.829> my<00:02:33.370> new<00:02:33.519> curves<00:02:33.819> ended<00:02:34.180> up<00:02:34.269> with<00:02:34.450> this

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
up all my new curves ended up with this

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.750 
up all my new curves ended up with this
kind<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:34.989> step<00:02:35.260> look<00:02:35.500> so<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.069> can<00:02:36.400> just<00:02:36.519> go<00:02:36.670> ahead

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
kind of step look so I can just go ahead

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.869 
kind of step look so I can just go ahead
here<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:37.620> turn<00:02:38.620> on<00:02:38.769> to<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:41.010> busy<00:02:42.010> a<00:02:42.040> kind<00:02:42.790> of

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
here and turn on to a a busy a kind of

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.879 
here and turn on to a a busy a kind of
handle<00:02:43.299> here<00:02:43.599> so<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:45.430> now<00:02:45.549> you<00:02:45.609> can<00:02:45.819> see<00:02:46.030> that

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
handle here so so now you can see that

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:50.940 
handle here so so now you can see that
my<00:02:47.889> settings<00:02:48.370> for<00:02:48.700> my<00:02:48.849> proportional<00:02:49.450> tool<00:02:49.950> end

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
my settings for my proportional tool end

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.949 
my settings for my proportional tool end
up<00:02:51.159> looking<00:02:51.459> like<00:02:51.489> this<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.989> also<00:02:53.139> have<00:02:53.440> this

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.849 

okay<00:02:58.959> well<00:03:00.389> there<00:03:01.389> was<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:01.569> setting<00:03:01.900> that<00:03:02.019> I<00:03:02.260> I

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
okay well there was a setting that I I

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.190 
okay well there was a setting that I I
did<00:03:03.280> skip<00:03:03.609> if<00:03:03.819> you<00:03:04.180> look<00:03:04.329> at<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.569> consider

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
did skip if you look at the consider

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.369 
did skip if you look at the consider
neighborhood<00:03:05.650> option<00:03:06.359> if<00:03:07.500> if<00:03:08.500> we<00:03:08.829> go<00:03:09.069> to<00:03:09.129> our

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
neighborhood option if if we go to our

mouse button click portion or by going
to<00:03:15.430> component<00:03:16.180> proportional<00:03:16.690> setup<00:03:16.959> you<00:03:17.799> can

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
to component proportional setup you can

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.920 
to component proportional setup you can
set<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.730> option<00:03:19.120> for<00:03:19.359> you<00:03:19.480> move<00:03:19.629> before

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
set the option for you move before

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.599 
set the option for you move before
before<00:03:20.829> you<00:03:21.160> move<00:03:21.370> it<00:03:21.629> so<00:03:22.629> by<00:03:22.840> default<00:03:23.430> we<00:03:24.430> have

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
before you move it so by default we have

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.689 
before you move it so by default we have
this<00:03:24.790> consider<00:03:25.180> neighborhood<00:03:26.459> turned<00:03:27.459> off

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:27.699 
this consider neighborhood turned off

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.610 
this consider neighborhood turned off
and<00:03:28.359> you<00:03:28.449> can<00:03:28.569> see<00:03:28.780> if<00:03:28.900> i<00:03:28.989> were<00:03:29.139> to<00:03:29.230> grab<00:03:29.440> any

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
and you can see if i were to grab any

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.009 
and you can see if i were to grab any
points<00:03:29.980> over<00:03:30.159> here<00:03:30.519> it's<00:03:30.730> going<00:03:30.909> to<00:03:30.970> grab<00:03:31.209> all

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
points over here it's going to grab all

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.580 
points over here it's going to grab all
the<00:03:32.440> all<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:32.799> points<00:03:33.370> within<00:03:33.549> my<00:03:33.819> range<00:03:34.319> so<00:03:35.319> in

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
the all the points within my range so in

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.849 
the all the points within my range so in
this<00:03:35.739> case<00:03:35.980> i'm<00:03:36.190> using<00:03:36.220> my<00:03:37.169> tweak<00:03:38.169> tool<00:03:38.530> might

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
this case i'm using my tweak tool might

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.009 
this case i'm using my tweak tool might
tweak<00:03:39.489> component<00:03:40.000> tool<00:03:40.180> in<00:03:40.329> conjunction<00:03:40.870> with

tweak component tool in conjunction with
my<00:03:41.349> proportional<00:03:41.949> tool<00:03:42.159> and<00:03:42.430> i'm<00:03:42.970> able<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:43.299> go

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
my proportional tool and i'm able to go

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.559 
my proportional tool and i'm able to go
ahead<00:03:43.750> and<00:03:44.079> just<00:03:44.290> kind<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.639> sculpt<00:03:45.639> this

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
ahead and just kind of sculpt this

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:50.369 
ahead and just kind of sculpt this
movement<00:03:48.209> if<00:03:49.209> i<00:03:49.419> turn<00:03:49.479> on<00:03:49.810> consider

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
movement if i turn on consider

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:52.819 
movement if i turn on consider
neighborhood<00:03:50.919> it's<00:03:51.220> going<00:03:51.459> to<00:03:51.489> look<00:03:51.879> at

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
neighborhood it's going to look at

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.259 
neighborhood it's going to look at
essentially<00:03:53.829> the<00:03:54.099> topology<00:03:54.699> to<00:03:54.879> decide

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
essentially the topology to decide

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.119 
essentially the topology to decide
whether<00:03:55.510> or<00:03:55.690> not<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:56.470> verts<00:03:56.739> are<00:03:56.919> within

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
whether or not the verts are within

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:59.280 
whether or not the verts are within
range<00:03:57.459> so<00:03:58.120> in<00:03:58.180> this<00:03:58.299> case<00:03:58.569> i'm<00:03:58.750> able<00:03:58.959> to<00:03:59.079> bring

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
range so in this case i'm able to bring

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.170 
range so in this case i'm able to bring
these<00:03:59.470> guys<00:03:59.739> super<00:04:00.190> close<00:04:00.370> together<00:04:00.579> and<00:04:01.030> you

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
these guys super close together and you

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.020 
these guys super close together and you
can<00:04:01.299> see<00:04:01.449> that<00:04:01.479> there<00:04:02.409> is<00:04:02.440> no<00:04:02.829> no<00:04:03.669> bleeding

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
can see that there is no no bleeding

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.969 
can see that there is no no bleeding
over<00:04:04.180> into<00:04:04.329> the<00:04:04.510> selection<00:04:05.019> it's<00:04:05.319> pretty

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:05.979 
over into the selection it's pretty

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:07.830 
over into the selection it's pretty
useful<00:04:06.159> when<00:04:06.909> you<00:04:07.000> want<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.239> isolate<00:04:07.359> certain

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
useful when you want to isolate certain

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.020 
useful when you want to isolate certain
areas<00:04:08.379> like<00:04:08.979> in<00:04:09.129> mouths<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:09.609> such<00:04:10.680> so<00:04:11.729> that<00:04:12.729> is

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
areas like in mouths and such so that is

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.770 
areas like in mouths and such so that is
the<00:04:13.739> proportional<00:04:14.739> modeling<00:04:15.220> tool<00:04:15.659> just<00:04:16.659> an

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:18.729 
added note for using the proportional

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:20.729 
added note for using the proportional
modeling<00:04:19.090> tool<00:04:19.329> if<00:04:19.659> you<00:04:20.109> would<00:04:20.320> like<00:04:20.500> to
