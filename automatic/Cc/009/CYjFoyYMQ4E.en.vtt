here<00:00:22.939> so<00:00:23.939> let's<00:00:24.210> move<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.900> now<00:00:25.170> we're

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
here so let's move on and now we're

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.450 

so<00:01:33.859> how<00:01:34.100> is<00:01:34.280> this<00:01:34.369> project<00:01:34.670> done<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:36.380> dem<00:01:36.710> wfs

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
so how is this project done the dem wfs

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.279 
so how is this project done the dem wfs
service<00:01:37.850> from<00:01:38.060> Geoscience<00:01:38.659> Australia<00:01:38.719> was

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
service from Geoscience Australia was

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.160 
service from Geoscience Australia was
used<00:01:39.560> with<00:01:39.770> huge<00:01:40.130> is<00:01:40.340> to<00:01:40.819> export<00:01:41.179> a<00:01:41.329> GF<00:01:41.810> image

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
used with huge is to export a GF image

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.539 
used with huge is to export a GF image
which<00:01:42.439> could<00:01:42.619> be<00:01:42.710> brought<00:01:42.920> into<00:01:43.189> the<00:01:43.520> world

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
which could be brought into the world

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.999 
which could be brought into the world
building<00:01:44.060> software<00:01:44.299> within<00:01:44.719> minecraft<00:01:45.259> it

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
building software within minecraft it

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.529 
building software within minecraft it
required<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:46.549> bit<00:01:46.700> of<00:01:46.819> fiddling<00:01:46.969> to<00:01:47.270> get<00:01:47.420> the

required a bit of fiddling to get the
vertical<00:01:47.899> heights<00:01:48.079> correct<00:01:48.500> so<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.979> map<00:01:49.159> was

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
vertical heights correct so the map was

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.309 
vertical heights correct so the map was
not<00:01:49.399> too<00:01:49.729> flat<00:01:50.060> or<00:01:50.240> too<00:01:50.420> hilly<00:01:50.810> while
