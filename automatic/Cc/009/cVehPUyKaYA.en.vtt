$100
all<00:00:12.190> right<00:00:12.490> I<00:00:12.519> have<00:00:12.849> chosen<00:00:13.120> a<00:00:13.360> very<00:00:13.690> dark

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
all right I have chosen a very dark

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.959 
all right I have chosen a very dark
dramatic<00:00:14.349> color<00:00:14.860> for<00:00:15.130> the<00:00:15.219> top<00:00:15.429> of<00:00:15.610> this<00:00:15.700> wall

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:15.969 
dramatic color for the top of this wall

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.050 
dramatic color for the top of this wall
simply<00:00:16.450> because<00:00:16.779> this<00:00:16.990> wall<00:00:17.349> is

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
simply because this wall is

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.569 
simply because this wall is
approximately<00:00:19.060> 40<00:00:19.450> feet<00:00:19.689> wide<00:00:19.950> from<00:00:20.950> end<00:00:21.279> to

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:21.579 
approximately 40 feet wide from end to

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.540 
approximately 40 feet wide from end to
end<00:00:21.790> and<00:00:22.210> very<00:00:22.989> very<00:00:23.560> high<00:00:23.829> of<00:00:23.980> the<00:00:24.099> cathedral

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
end and very very high of the cathedral

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.359 
end and very very high of the cathedral
ceiling<00:00:25.000> so<00:00:25.180> I<00:00:25.210> feel<00:00:25.599> like<00:00:25.630> a<00:00:25.840> dark<00:00:26.259> color<00:00:26.619> will

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
ceiling so I feel like a dark color will

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.460 
ceiling so I feel like a dark color will
not<00:00:27.910> make<00:00:28.149> them<00:00:28.329> have<00:00:28.570> been<00:00:28.809> prepped<00:00:29.140> and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
not make them have been prepped and

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.920 
not make them have been prepped and
painted<00:00:29.680> and<00:00:30.189> they're<00:00:30.610> dry<00:00:30.939> now<00:00:30.969> so<00:00:31.450> we<00:00:31.809> can

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
painted and they're dry now so we can

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.960 
painted and they're dry now so we can
move<00:00:31.960> on<00:00:32.290> to<00:00:32.320> the<00:00:32.529> molding<00:00:32.890> now<00:00:33.430> I've<00:00:33.610> come<00:00:33.850> up
