00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.689
 I'm Sal and along with Dr. Andy Connely is in Stanford medicine 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.847
 And this is the second video from our series. 

00:00:08.847 --> 00:00:15.209
 Last time we ended up in a normal-looking gut, 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:21.107
 we would see it on the edge of the cancer sample. 

00:00:21.107 --> 00:00:26.169
 Now I have something that makes the pathologist a little more concerned, 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.721
 when looking at the intestine. I'll get a little closer. 

00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:36.386
 It's very worrying compared to the previous sample. 

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:41.123
 We don't like the appearance of glands. 

00:00:41.123 --> 00:00:46.092
 The normal gland has the shape of a tube pointing downwards with normal cells. 

00:00:46.092 --> 00:00:51.804
 Here the tissue is suddenly denser, we no longer see the straight tubes 

00:00:51.804 --> 00:00:56.866
 on the contrary, they branch in and out. 

00:00:56.866 --> 00:01:04.528
 Are they still test tubes, just like circles on the cross-section? 

00:01:04.528 --> 00:01:09.500
 Yes, but if we look below - 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.469
 it does not normally grow. 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.667
 Branching is always bad. 

00:01:16.417 --> 00:01:23.708
 There is a small hole in the middle on a normal cross-section 

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:26.773
 where the mucin flows. 

00:01:26.773 --> 00:01:40.705
 Here it looks different, bigger, the cells are inflated 

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:42.427
 and branches. 

00:01:46.597 --> 00:01:47.532
 We ask: 

00:01:47.532 --> 00:01:51.572
 "Is it a tumor? Precancerosis? Or just irritation?" 

00:01:52.632 --> 00:01:57.516
 Change is a common body reaction to irritation. 

00:01:57.516 --> 00:02:04.204
 The epithelium as the top layer is in contact with the external environment. 

00:02:04.204 --> 00:02:10.473
 When the epithelium is irritated, it changes, multiplies. 

00:02:10.473 --> 00:02:15.999
 Is there a risk that multiplication will turn into a tumor in the future? 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:21.015
 Many tumors arise in places 

00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:25.886
 which are either irritated or permanently stimulated by the environment, 

00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:31.275
 Some of the tumors are due to excessive cell division, 

00:02:31.275 --> 00:02:33.972
 in which DNA errors may occur. 

00:02:33.972 --> 00:02:36.897
 I understand why skin cells, intestines ... 

00:02:36.897 --> 00:02:39.173
 Yes, even the liver, 

00:02:39.173 --> 00:02:42.377
 liver damage is a major risk of cancer. 

00:02:42.977 --> 00:02:47.160
 When a pathologist looks at this preparation, he says: 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.111
 Glands with branches 

00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:51.526
 at this point it's a little weird ... 

00:02:51.526 --> 00:02:55.891
 But, cells still produce mucin and long cells 

00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:58.445
 likely to absorb water. 

00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:04.396
 Are there also absorption cells in glands that look like tubes? 

00:03:06.676 --> 00:03:11.541
 Yes. We call this finding hyperplasia. 

00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:15.876
 Hyperplasia. Hyper- means much of something and -plasia? 

00:03:16.046 --> 00:03:21.175
 The beach is multiplying. Hyperplasia is an overgrowth. 

00:03:21.665 --> 00:03:26.372
 Importantly, if we remove the source of irritation, excessive propagation will not take place. 

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:29.792
 When we remove everything that causes irritation and hyperplasia, 

00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:31.612
 the tissue returns to normal. 

00:03:31.882 --> 00:03:39.684
 The changes were caused by some stimulus - chemical, diet, etc. 

00:03:40.884 --> 00:03:44.839
 Yes. We are seldom sure, because so many things will go through the surface. 

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:51.201
 It's really hard to figure out, but probably excessive growth is caused by some irritation. 

00:03:51.201 --> 00:03:56.356
 It is possible that this happens when a part of the intestine is removed, 

00:03:56.356 --> 00:04:00.118
 and if it happened a day later, wouldn't hyperplasia be there? 

00:04:00.408 --> 00:04:02.765
 It takes longer, a few weeks. 

00:04:02.765 --> 00:04:07.687
 Cells come from below and work up, 

00:04:07.687 --> 00:04:09.870
 finally they are up ... 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.141
 It works a bit like skin, cells are constantly renewing 

00:04:15.141 --> 00:04:16.871
 because they are scuffed. 

00:04:17.811 --> 00:04:25.892
 Yes. We know a lot about stem cells, the stem cells are just these. 

00:04:25.892 --> 00:04:28.815
 How do we recognize them from other cells? 

00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:33.879
 At the very bottom of the lower layer are cells that do not have free chromatin 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:38.523
 and they are elongated. Could be endocrine cells 

00:04:38.523 --> 00:04:41.448
 that release hormones. 

00:04:43.028 --> 00:04:46.697
 But it turns out that the cells in the lower layer are the tribal ones. 

00:04:46.697 --> 00:04:51.341
 Stem cells do not have a predetermined function? 

00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:58.214
 They don't. Stem cells are of many types and are capable of creating an entire body, being 

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:01.511
 and we also have stem cells that can complete the intestine. 

00:05:02.091 --> 00:05:05.784
 And here we have those that can complete the rest of the epithelium 

00:05:05.784 --> 00:05:10.346
 with two different cell types. They're down here. 

00:05:14.026 --> 00:05:21.807
 This is hyperplasia. I want to show you another preparation where the precancerous area is. 

00:05:21.827 --> 00:05:24.089
 Let's go to the next video!
