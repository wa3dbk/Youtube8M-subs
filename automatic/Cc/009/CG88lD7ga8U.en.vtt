00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.790
 give 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.810
 sweeps 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.780
 is denominated garrido to the imbalance of the adversary removing him only a point of 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.780
 support of the two existing 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.830
 projections 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.660
 it is called projection to the complete disequilibrium of the adversary taking away the 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.660
 two points of support falling sharply against the ground 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.250
 the sweeps the projections in sandro's work are a part 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.550
 fundamental within its technical arsenal in the projections is used 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.610
 mainly three types of force 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.690
 a force 'cross of the fallin sector and a soft force joaquin in a fight is 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.750
 necessary to use both alternatively 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.180
 what is not important 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.200
 is the use of a third force that is that of our adversary 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.050
 it is necessary to absorb the strength of the adversary not to resist 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.990
 rather on the contrary accompanying them movement implies the use 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.490
 of the soft force the force that transforms 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.490
 and that makes the strength of his opponent to himself 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.560
 either by barrel projection 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.980
 the correct execution 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.160
 it must be done thanks to the imbalance of its central line 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.920
 through a superior movement as can be an example of it 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.760
 the network the pull 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.980
 pujol 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.740
 an imbalance of the opposite 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.940
 using and absorbing your own energy movement energy to 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.939
 continue with us with others 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:16.199
 It is very important for projection tables to be effective 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.519
 their displacements are very fast if well balanced 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.459
 risking as much as possible 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.069
 making the names of the possible to the opponent's attack techniques 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.739
 innovating time to react opponent
