of course everything's built on that why
the<00:00:57.269> snow<00:00:57.689> is<00:00:57.839> failing<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.350> usually<00:00:58.739> because

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the snow is failing is usually because

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.310 
the snow is failing is usually because
of<00:00:59.039> weather<00:00:59.789> because<00:01:00.479> it's<00:01:00.659> dumping<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
of weather because it's dumping and

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.279 
of weather because it's dumping and
snowing<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.799> ton<00:01:02.039> or<00:01:02.729> it's<00:01:02.939> warming<00:01:03.510> or<00:01:04.170> it's

into<00:01:06.270> play<00:01:06.479> first<00:01:07.200> thing<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.619> do<00:01:07.679> is<00:01:08.159> check<00:01:08.220> what

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
into play first thing I do is check what

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:11.450 
into play first thing I do is check what
the<00:01:09.270> weather<00:01:09.479> has<00:01:09.659> been<00:01:09.690> doing<00:01:10.310> check<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
the weather has been doing check the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.940 
the weather has been doing check the
forecast<00:01:12.020> check<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.170> avalanche<00:01:13.679> conditions

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
forecast check the avalanche conditions

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.899 
forecast check the avalanche conditions
and<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.819> Avalanche<00:01:15.149> forecast<00:01:16.580> it's<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.640> little

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
and the Avalanche forecast it's a little

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.620 
and the Avalanche forecast it's a little
windy<00:01:18.179> it<00:01:18.869> was<00:01:18.959> so<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.799> hammered<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.640> few<00:01:21.479> days

it's<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:04.200> know<00:02:04.289> really<00:02:04.530> important<00:02:05.129> to<00:02:05.250> dig<00:02:05.459> we

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
it's you know really important to dig we

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.999 
it's you know really important to dig we
got<00:02:06.060> Kent<00:02:06.390> digging<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.840> pit<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.409> know<00:02:07.860> it's

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
got Kent digging a pit you know it's

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.639 
got Kent digging a pit you know it's
been<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.269> bunch<00:02:09.269> of<00:02:09.450> snow<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:10.140> bunch<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.440> weather

been a bunch of snow a bunch of weather

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.360 
been a bunch of snow a bunch of weather
and<00:02:11.330> so<00:02:12.330> kind<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.599> our<00:02:12.720> first<00:02:13.010> first<00:02:14.010> thing<00:02:14.220> we

and so kind of our first first thing we

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.729 
and so kind of our first first thing we
do<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.760> we<00:02:14.879> roll<00:02:15.090> out<00:02:15.300> here<00:02:15.629> and<00:02:15.930> do<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.680> little

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
do is we roll out here and do a little

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.320 
do is we roll out here and do a little
snow<00:02:17.069> assessment<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.819> importance<00:02:18.209> of

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
snow assessment the importance of

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.899 
snow assessment the importance of
digging<00:02:18.569> a<00:02:18.659> pit<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.140> just<00:02:19.409> the<00:02:20.069> ability<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.580> get

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
digging a pit is just the ability to get

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.000 
digging a pit is just the ability to get
some<00:02:21.209> sort<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.540> idea<00:02:21.930> of<00:02:22.019> what<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.440> snow<00:02:22.739> path

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
some sort of idea of what the snow path

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.820 
some sort of idea of what the snow path
below<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.519> is<00:02:23.909> doing<00:02:24.319> and<00:02:25.319> when<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.620> dig<00:02:25.800> a

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
below you is doing and when you dig a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.649 
below you is doing and when you dig a
snow<00:02:25.950> pit<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.580> get<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.849> see<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.239> layers<00:02:27.480> you

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
snow pit you get to see the layers you

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.100 
snow pit you get to see the layers you
get<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.050> see<00:02:28.260> how<00:02:28.860> well<00:02:29.129> they're<00:02:29.310> holding<00:02:29.760> up

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
get to see how well they're holding up

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.449 
get to see how well they're holding up
there<00:02:31.110> are<00:02:31.230> many<00:02:31.319> ways<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.590> assess<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.250> snow

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
there are many ways to assess the snow

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.550 
there are many ways to assess the snow
and<00:02:32.700> for<00:02:33.060> sure<00:02:33.239> digging<00:02:33.780> pits<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.319> great

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
and for sure digging pits is a great

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.089 
and for sure digging pits is a great
thing<00:02:34.890> but<00:02:35.989> by<00:02:36.989> generally<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.560> think<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.920> best

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
thing but by generally I think the best

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.210 
thing but by generally I think the best
rule<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.700> be<00:02:38.730> able<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:40.739> imagine<00:02:41.099> it's

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
rule is to be able to to imagine it's

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.920 
rule is to be able to to imagine it's
going<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.489> slide<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:42.060> then<00:02:42.180> you're<00:02:42.390> right<00:02:42.599> in

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
going to slide and then you're right in

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.230 
going to slide and then you're right in
consequence<00:02:43.580> depending<00:02:44.580> on<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.760> day<00:02:44.909> you<00:02:44.970> go

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
consequence depending on the day you go

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.140 
consequence depending on the day you go
out<00:02:45.270> there<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:46.200> can<00:02:46.380> usually<00:02:47.340> always<00:02:47.550> find<00:02:47.970> a

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
out there you can usually always find a

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.559 
out there you can usually always find a
safe<00:02:48.360> way<00:02:48.569> to<00:02:48.600> venture<00:02:49.080> in<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.230> back

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
safe way to venture in the back

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.869 
safe way to venture in the back
country<00:02:49.959> simply<00:02:50.890> by<00:02:51.219> choosing<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:51.730> right

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879

really<00:02:56.590> for<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.129> couple<00:02:57.670> different<00:02:57.999> factors

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
really for a couple different factors

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.319 
really for a couple different factors
one<00:02:58.689> being<00:02:58.889> identifying<00:02:59.889> traps<00:03:00.430> or<00:03:00.790> places

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
where you can get caught up if the snow

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.179 
where you can get caught up if the snow
came<00:03:03.849> from<00:03:04.299> above<00:03:04.629> and<00:03:04.989> it<00:03:05.650> would<00:03:05.799> pile<00:03:06.159> up

you want to stay out of it's really

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.500 
you want to stay out of it's really
important<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.129> identify<00:03:15.280> more<00:03:15.909> of<00:03:16.030> like<00:03:16.180> safe

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
avalanches come down the snow kind of

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.379 
avalanches come down the snow kind of
flows<00:03:23.680> like<00:03:23.980> water<00:03:24.280> if<00:03:24.969> you<00:03:25.030> think<00:03:25.269> of<00:03:25.329> that

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
flows like water if you think of that

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.449 
flows like water if you think of that
when<00:03:25.540> you're<00:03:25.659> selecting<00:03:25.900> terrain<00:03:26.560> then<00:03:27.250> you

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
when you're selecting terrain then you

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.309 
when you're selecting terrain then you
can<00:03:27.609> identify<00:03:27.790> different<00:03:28.090> areas<00:03:28.989> on<00:03:29.199> the

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
can identify different areas on the

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.069 
can identify different areas on the
slope<00:03:29.650> that<00:03:29.889> the<00:03:30.549> snow<00:03:31.299> or<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.569> water<00:03:31.810> might

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
slope that the snow or the water might

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.250 
slope that the snow or the water might
not<00:03:32.260> touch<00:03:32.590> so<00:03:33.219> you<00:03:33.250> can<00:03:33.519> ski<00:03:34.449> from<00:03:34.629> islands<00:03:35.169> of

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
not touch so you can ski from islands of

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.409 
not touch so you can ski from islands of
safety<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.709> islands<00:03:36.069> of<00:03:36.189> safety<00:03:36.579> so<00:03:36.849> or<00:03:37.030> stay

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419 
safety to islands of safety so or stay

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:40.080 
safety to islands of safety so or stay
on<00:03:37.449> ridges<00:03:38.079> and<00:03:38.260> get<00:03:38.709> up<00:03:38.859> out<00:03:39.040> on<00:03:39.069> spines<00:03:39.760> or

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
on ridges and get up out on spines or

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.580 
on ridges and get up out on spines or
whatever<00:03:40.480> you<00:03:40.629> can<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:41.049> get<00:03:41.199> up<00:03:41.319> and<00:03:41.469> out<00:03:41.530> of

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
whatever you can to get up and out of

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.129 
whatever you can to get up and out of
the<00:03:41.799> slope<00:03:42.129> so<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.400> idea<00:03:42.790> is<00:03:42.909> to<00:03:43.150> get<00:03:43.750> in<00:03:43.870> there

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
the slope so the idea is to get in there

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.250 
the slope so the idea is to get in there
do<00:03:44.980> your<00:03:45.129> cuts<00:03:45.430> or<00:03:45.669> your<00:03:45.760> turns<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:46.449> then<00:03:46.959> get

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
do your cuts or your turns and then get

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.959 
do your cuts or your turns and then get
up<00:03:47.439> and<00:03:47.560> out<00:03:47.769> to<00:03:48.099> see<00:03:48.280> how<00:03:48.430> the<00:03:48.489> snow<00:03:48.819> is

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:48.969 
up and out to see how the snow is

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:50.849 
up and out to see how the snow is
actually<00:03:49.299> reacting<00:03:49.870> in<00:03:49.989> there<00:03:50.199> when<00:03:50.769> I'm

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
actually reacting in there when I'm

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.679 
actually reacting in there when I'm
looking<00:03:50.980> at<00:03:51.159> a<00:03:51.219> line<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:51.459> also<00:03:51.699> want<00:03:52.419> to<00:03:52.510> have<00:03:52.599> a

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:52.689 
looking at a line I also want to have a

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:55.080 
looking at a line I also want to have a
plan<00:03:53.049> going<00:03:53.409> into<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.919> as<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.459> what<00:03:54.639> I<00:03:54.909> should

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
plan going into it as to what I should

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.420 
plan going into it as to what I should
do<00:03:55.209> if<00:03:55.449> the<00:03:55.540> pocket<00:03:55.840> does<00:03:55.989> rip<00:03:56.139> and<00:03:56.349> that<00:03:57.220> means

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
do if the pocket does rip and that means
