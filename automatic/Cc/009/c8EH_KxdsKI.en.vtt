pressure on the All Blacks bucket came

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.460 
pressure on the All Blacks bucket came
into<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> 22<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.059> putting<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> lineup<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
into the 22 and putting the lineup and

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.649 
into the 22 and putting the lineup and
pressure<00:01:04.769> was<00:01:04.979> not<00:01:05.189> filled<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.610> co<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.540> know

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
pressure was not filled and co you know

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.420 
pressure was not filled and co you know
it<00:01:06.780> couldn't<00:01:07.110> use<00:01:07.320> pressure<00:01:07.590> balance<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.400> i

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
it couldn't use pressure balance but i

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.429 
it couldn't use pressure balance but i
still<00:01:08.700> think<00:01:08.880> any<00:01:09.150> massive<00:01:09.720> kicked<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.110> bit<00:01:10.260> too

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
still think any massive kicked a bit too

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.280 
still think any massive kicked a bit too
much<00:01:10.490> i<00:01:11.490> think<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.450> know<00:01:12.570> when<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.990> saw

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
much i think that you know when you saw

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.109 
much i think that you know when you saw
pretty<00:01:13.619> dynamic<00:01:13.890> school<00:01:14.369> at<00:01:14.520> trial<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.030> know

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
pretty dynamic school at trial you know

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.280 
pretty dynamic school at trial you know
that's<00:01:15.330> when<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.570> thought<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.930> was<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> most

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
that's when I thought it was the most

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.620 
that's when I thought it was the most
positive<00:01:16.500> movement<00:01:16.920> will<00:01:17.220> again<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.759> have

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
positive movement will again we have

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.840 
positive movement will again we have
tutorials<00:01:19.110> kicked<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> ball<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.979> hand<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.490> he

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
tutorials kicked the ball in hand and he

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.490 
tutorials kicked the ball in hand and he
had<00:01:21.180> some<00:01:21.360> sublime<00:01:21.750> parcels<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.439> that

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
had some sublime parcels in that

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.980 
had some sublime parcels in that
movement<00:01:22.830> which<00:01:23.220> created<00:01:23.909> their<00:01:24.030> tribe<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.720> I

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
movement which created their tribe so I

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.469 
movement which created their tribe so I
don't<00:01:25.380> feel<00:01:25.530> that<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:25.799> he<00:01:25.950> he<00:01:26.460> does<00:01:27.060> keep<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.420> a

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
don't feel that if he he does keep it a

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.780 
don't feel that if he he does keep it a
bit<00:01:27.659> more<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.930> hand<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.470> think<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.460> we<00:01:29.579> can

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
bit more in hand I think that we can

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.420 
bit more in hand I think that we can
again<00:01:30.270> confidence<00:01:30.570> from<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.530> thought

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
again confidence from that and thought

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.700 
again confidence from that and thought
scoring<00:01:32.820> more<00:01:32.970> clients<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:34.079> bach<00:01:34.259> midfield

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
scoring more clients the bach midfield

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.800 
scoring more clients the bach midfield
was<00:01:35.430> something<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> little<00:01:36.299> bit<00:01:36.450> different<00:01:36.750> to

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
was something a little bit different to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.359 
was something a little bit different to
see<00:01:36.960> why<00:01:37.079> not<00:01:37.140> Olivia<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.799> number<00:01:38.009> 13

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
back into that position know in the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.980 
back into that position know in the
comment<00:02:24.490> i<00:02:24.580> thought<00:02:24.819> don't<00:02:25.180> think<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.630> to<00:02:25.840> this

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
comment i thought don't think it to this

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.199 
comment i thought don't think it to this
one<00:02:26.320> field<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.770> we<00:02:26.980> that<00:02:27.640> we<00:02:27.670> have<00:02:27.970> in<00:02:28.090> the

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
one field that we that we have in the

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.390 
one field that we that we have in the
country<00:02:28.600> have<00:02:28.720> obviously<00:02:29.110> Joffrey<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.890> John

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
country have obviously Joffrey and John

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.740 
country have obviously Joffrey and John
the<00:02:30.490> way<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.670> prove<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.240> they<00:02:31.420> are<00:02:31.450> the

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
the way to prove that they are the

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.260 
the way to prove that they are the
probably<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.140> best<00:02:32.320> combination<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:33.250> far<00:02:33.520> but

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
probably the best combination so far but

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.229 
probably the best combination so far but
I<00:02:34.300> feel<00:02:34.750> this<00:02:34.959> that<00:02:35.440> your<00:02:35.739> fries<00:02:36.239> this

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
I feel this that your fries this

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.120 
I feel this that your fries this
position<00:02:37.480> will<00:02:37.810> probably<00:02:38.380> fool<00:02:38.590> back<00:02:38.800> because

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
position will probably fool back because

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.160 
position will probably fool back because
I<00:02:39.310> think<00:02:39.520> he<00:02:39.640> just<00:02:39.790> add<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:40.270> much<00:02:40.390> value<00:02:40.450> coming

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
I think he just add so much value coming

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.440 
I think he just add so much value coming
in<00:02:41.410> from<00:02:41.590> there<00:02:41.770> and<00:02:41.980> joining<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:42.730> line<00:02:42.940> I<00:02:43.209> think

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
in from there and joining a line I think

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.990 
in from there and joining a line I think
that<00:02:43.630> either<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:45.190> guys<00:02:45.310> kicking<00:02:45.610> game<00:02:45.790> will

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
that either you guys kicking game will

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.150 
that either you guys kicking game will
be<00:02:46.150> obviously<00:02:46.660> will<00:02:46.900> have<00:02:47.020> to<00:02:47.200> improve<00:02:47.500> but<00:02:47.739> I

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
be obviously will have to improve but I

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.860 
be obviously will have to improve but I
feel<00:02:48.459> that<00:02:48.640> he's<00:02:48.760> such<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.000> trick<00:02:49.360> at<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.660> back

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
feel that he's such a trick at the back

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.479 
feel that he's such a trick at the back
there<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.290> way<00:02:50.440> he<00:02:50.560> joined<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:50.920> line<00:02:51.190> and

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
there the way he joined the line and

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.610 
there the way he joined the line and
he's<00:02:51.940> big<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.300> strong<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:53.170> sort<00:02:53.560> of

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
he's big and strong and and sort of

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.410 
he's big and strong and and sort of
pretty<00:02:53.830> haven't<00:02:54.310> really<00:02:54.519> offered<00:02:54.850> us<00:02:55.000> that<00:02:55.239> in

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
think we got again let's change focus

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.350 
think we got again let's change focus
maybe<00:03:30.340> a<00:03:30.430> little<00:03:30.549> bit<00:03:30.700> just<00:03:30.820> to<00:03:31.000> have<00:03:31.239> a<00:03:31.269> look

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
maybe a little bit just to have a look

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.000 
maybe a little bit just to have a look
at<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.570> Australians<00:03:32.049> for<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.260> while<00:03:32.530> how<00:03:32.950> do

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
at the Australians for a while how do

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.440 
at the Australians for a while how do
you<00:03:33.070> see<00:03:33.280> them<00:03:33.459> approaching<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:34.000> game<00:03:34.150> where

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
you see them approaching the game where

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.449 
you see them approaching the game where
do<00:03:34.570> you<00:03:34.630> think<00:03:34.720> they<00:03:34.900> will<00:03:34.980> look<00:03:35.980> to<00:03:36.130> target

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
do you think they will look to target

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.150 
do you think they will look to target
the<00:03:36.549> box<00:03:36.730> well<00:03:37.660> I<00:03:37.690> think<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:38.680> know<00:03:38.890> I<00:03:38.920> think

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
the box well I think you know I think

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.280 
the box well I think you know I think
oddly<00:03:39.790> have<00:03:40.000> improved<00:03:40.390> immediately<00:03:40.989> over<00:03:41.230> the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
oddly have improved immediately over the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.259 
oddly have improved immediately over the
last<00:03:41.470> couple<00:03:41.680> of<00:03:41.860> months<00:03:42.010> with<00:03:42.700> the<00:03:42.730> nuker

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
last couple of months with the nuker

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.090 
last couple of months with the nuker
searching<00:03:43.989> regime<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.380> think<00:03:44.590> that<00:03:44.739> they

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
searching regime I think that they

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.580 
searching regime I think that they
taught<00:03:45.370> father<00:03:45.700> is<00:03:45.880> improved<00:03:46.299> them<00:03:46.570> you<00:03:47.470> know

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
taught father is improved them you know

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.890 
taught father is improved them you know
compared<00:03:48.070> to<00:03:48.190> what<00:03:48.370> they<00:03:48.549> do<00:03:48.610> that<00:03:49.390> tour<00:03:49.660> that

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
compared to what they do that tour that

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.530 
compared to what they do that tour that
disastrous<00:03:50.530> turn<00:03:51.070> away<00:03:51.280> into<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:51.610> UK<00:03:52.090> on<00:03:52.269> and

disastrous turn away into the UK on and

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.830 
disastrous turn away into the UK on and
I<00:03:53.019> feel<00:03:53.860> that<00:03:54.040> you<00:03:54.820> know<00:03:54.910> they've<00:03:55.450> always<00:03:55.480> at
