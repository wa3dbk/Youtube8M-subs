lightweight<00:02:53.390> but<00:02:53.750> at<00:02:53.840> the<00:02:53.959> same<00:02:54.170> time<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.709> does

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
lightweight but at the same time it does

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.430 
lightweight but at the same time it does
not<00:02:55.010> feel<00:02:55.370> plasticky<00:02:56.300> though<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.080> volume

is<00:03:06.380> my<00:03:06.620> biggest<00:03:06.860> complaint<00:03:07.400> on<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.850> Pistons

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
is my biggest complaint on the Pistons

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.570 
is my biggest complaint on the Pistons
2.1<00:03:08.989> but<00:03:09.290> while<00:03:09.470> I<00:03:09.500> love<00:03:09.860> about<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.250> Pistons

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
2.1 but while I love about the Pistons

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.690 
2.1 but while I love about the Pistons
2.1<00:03:11.269> is<00:03:11.540> simply<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.709> sound<00:03:13.010> although<00:03:13.310> the

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
2.1 is simply the sound although the

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.009 
2.1 is simply the sound although the
base<00:03:13.850> was<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.150> little<00:03:14.480> bit<00:03:14.600> too<00:03:14.750> weak

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
base was a little bit too weak

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.979 
base was a little bit too weak
everything<00:03:15.890> of<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.190> audio<00:03:16.549> is<00:03:16.600> really<00:03:17.600> clear

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
everything of the audio is really clear

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.100 
everything of the audio is really clear
and<00:03:18.430> after<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:19.459> short<00:03:19.549> burn<00:03:20.060> in<00:03:20.269> there's<00:03:20.840> more

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
and after a short burn in there's more

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.470 
and after a short burn in there's more
depth<00:03:21.500> into<00:03:21.830> the<00:03:21.920> audio<00:03:22.310> and<00:03:22.580> even<00:03:22.820> a<00:03:22.880> base<00:03:23.120> got

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
depth into the audio and even a base got

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.449 
depth into the audio and even a base got
a<00:03:23.510> little<00:03:23.840> bit<00:03:24.019> better<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.799> may<00:03:24.980> not<00:03:25.010> be<00:03:25.160> the

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
a little bit better it may not be the

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.180 
a little bit better it may not be the
ideal<00:03:25.640> earphone<00:03:26.510> for<00:03:26.540> base<00:03:27.410> hits<00:03:27.680> but<00:03:27.980> the

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
ideal earphone for base hits but the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.940 
ideal earphone for base hits but the
mini<00:03:28.489> Pistons<00:03:28.970> do<00:03:29.480> handle<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.470> dynamics

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
mini Pistons do handle the dynamics

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.640 
mini Pistons do handle the dynamics
really<00:03:31.310> well<00:03:31.519> especially<00:03:32.410> orchestral<00:03:33.410> music

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
really well especially orchestral music

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.590 
really well especially orchestral music
and<00:03:33.920> for<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.310> fact<00:03:34.549> that<00:03:34.610> a<00:03:34.700> sound<00:03:35.090> quality<00:03:35.570> is

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
and for the fact that a sound quality is

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.210 
and for the fact that a sound quality is
comparable<00:03:35.989> with<00:03:36.470> other<00:03:36.769> your<00:03:36.950> phones

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
comparable with other your phones

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.500 
comparable with other your phones
they're<00:03:37.400> more<00:03:37.580> expensive<00:03:38.200> this<00:03:39.200> thing<00:03:39.709> is<00:03:40.010> a

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
they're more expensive this thing is a

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.500 
they're more expensive this thing is a
bang<00:03:41.510> for<00:03:42.049> a<00:03:42.080> buck<00:03:42.320> so<00:03:43.100> this<00:03:43.310> is<00:03:43.489> all<00:03:43.700> for<00:03:44.360> the

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
bang for a buck so this is all for the

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.539 
bang for a buck so this is all for the
overview<00:03:45.049> and<00:03:45.230> a<00:03:45.320> rear<00:03:45.560> view<00:03:45.590> of<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.070> Pistons
