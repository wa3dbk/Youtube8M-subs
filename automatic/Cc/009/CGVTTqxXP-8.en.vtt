00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.560 

oh<00:03:48.960> it<00:03:49.960> just<00:03:50.140> doesn't<00:03:50.470> show<00:03:50.680> it<00:03:50.860> on<00:03:51.010> there

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.740 

gotcha<00:03:55.830> all<00:03:56.830> right<00:03:57.040> so<00:03:57.730> I<00:03:58.300> think<00:03:58.510> that's

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
gotcha all right so I think that's

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.920 
gotcha all right so I think that's
everything<00:03:59.020> so<00:03:59.650> we<00:03:59.770> will<00:03:59.950> accept<00:04:00.690> so<00:04:01.690> now<00:04:01.870> that

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
everything so we will accept so now that

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.720 
everything so we will accept so now that
we<00:04:02.290> have<00:04:02.320> all<00:04:02.710> the<00:04:02.860> items<00:04:03.190> we<00:04:03.370> will<00:04:03.460> go<00:04:03.640> ahead

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
we have all the items we will go ahead

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.199 
we have all the items we will go ahead
and<00:04:03.850> save<00:04:04.300> and<00:04:04.330> quit<00:04:05.220> so<00:04:06.220> that<00:04:06.459> it<00:04:06.610> makes<00:04:06.880> sure

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
and save and quit so that it makes sure

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.710 
and save and quit so that it makes sure
that<00:04:07.240> we<00:04:07.840> have<00:04:07.870> those<00:04:08.470> items<00:04:09.300> and<00:04:10.300> that<00:04:10.540> is

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
that we have those items and that is

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.020 
that we have those items and that is
basically<00:04:11.230> it<00:04:11.530> then<00:04:11.860> you<00:04:12.040> will<00:04:12.250> go<00:04:12.700> ahead<00:04:12.730> and

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
basically it then you will go ahead and

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.289 
basically it then you will go ahead and
go<00:04:13.270> back<00:04:13.540> into<00:04:13.810> the<00:04:14.020> game<00:04:14.820> you<00:04:15.820> know<00:04:15.940> if<00:04:16.090> you

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
go back into the game you know if you

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.150 
go back into the game you know if you
have<00:04:16.450> if<00:04:16.780> it's<00:04:16.959> a<00:04:17.049> second<00:04:17.410> player<00:04:17.590> obviously

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
have if it's a second player obviously

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.500 
have if it's a second player obviously
you<00:04:18.220> just<00:04:18.489> join<00:04:18.730> back<00:04:18.940> with<00:04:19.150> the<00:04:19.239> second

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
back in and that's it so you're

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.370

basically<00:04:24.490> just<00:04:24.669> trading<00:04:25.450> and<00:04:25.720> then<00:04:25.870> quickly

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
basically just trading and then quickly

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.800 
basically just trading and then quickly
signing<00:04:26.919> out<00:04:27.070> so<00:04:27.370> that<00:04:27.550> you<00:04:27.760> beat<00:04:28.540> the

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810
