00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:03.960
 Let me look at a few of my comments. 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.870
 I'm making Park Sang-a. 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.420
 Having hair style and shah 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.200
 The desire to expand the business means the profit of the special price itself 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.449
 High tech value 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.649
 I will keep a constant 4%. 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:17.720
 Take control of the control of the entrance 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.769
 If the proportion of Bucheon is hit by a company, 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.400
 I can confirm that 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.400
 I'll make the drama around and wire it. 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.289
 As a base, 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.739
 If you change it, you're ready to go. 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.630
 In position 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.330
 I will make an organic purchase once. 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.030
 If you do this, you will not be able to type 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.760
 The keynote appears. 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.230
 I can get freedom to pick up McCain over the phone. 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.050
 Would you like me to 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.430
 Once you are ready to go to your self-discipline, 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.130
 Ability to take the raw materials you've got and the shier 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.060
 I'll do it 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.060
 After four days of singing, suddenly changed wire lines 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.640
 It's turned into a monologue. 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.170
 Here and here 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.229
 You remember my memory, and if you look at it, 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.270
 Double-tap to make a big push 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.290
 Then similarly 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.470
 The podcast dps that can get the ticket 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.740
 In the state where apec is selected, the parameter item 8 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.320
 Enjoy music like Park 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.310
 If you can do this, you can do it by raising the train ticket 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.890
 Data management. 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.280
 About 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.170
 Once you do this 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.500
 If you look at the door, will you zoom out? 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.210
 There will be a number. 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.899
 In its natural state 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.360
 I have a hot-key vendor. 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.549
 If you try your home, 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.079
 All of them are sent out. 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.079
 In the direction where the red color is seen from the direction, 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.460
 I chose it. - It's me. 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.460
 The aspect of that choice is now red and judgment. 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.200
 If you become serious 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.880
 If the disabled clicks the fifth net percentage in South Korea, Rett McCain 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.329
 normally pm 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:09.829
 There's unfolding. 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.460
 Hanwha 200 million won forcing purpose 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.779
 I'm simply looking for ability. 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:17.499
 There are also a few 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.159
 unfold We are appearing once a week 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.320
 Plum will be suspicious of housing speculation. 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.290
 Select work to close the fate and press the OK button. 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.759
 If you press it, 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:31.099
 This three- 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.579
 The face of the dream in front of the disaster came 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.269
 To be mounted on a fighter plane. 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.210
 You'll be able to confirm that it's clear. 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.300
 It is arbitrary. Existing images 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.009
 Depending on where I am 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.739
 To expose 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.149
 Those images 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:48.819
 Elaborately 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.640
 object is forgotten 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.389
 It's a cigarette. 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.069
 If we are ready, the shape of the candle will be herb. 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.899
 If you checked 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:03:00.329
 If you look at the work as it is in that state 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.839
 a middle is more than 6 meters 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:05.409
 There will be. 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:06.619
 Give me a joke. 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:10.009
 I'm going to make an image of frequent cough. 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:11.689
 Resolution is that way 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.389
 Yeah 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.590
 Give me Vickshell Kobe speed 512kb 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.590
 I am responsible for the click 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.249
 Let's hope this happens to 510200 square 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:28.209
 But the image is made and the 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.429
 You must cable 

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:32.069
 Well, we got it here. 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.769
 Ah 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.680
 I am a cutback and image made in Thailand. 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.949
 What do you do 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:41.199
 First Quarter 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.549
 The tpg has grown and has a curity, usually over 90% 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.809
 Drinking is not a big deal. 

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:49.809
 Here, the child will replace it right here. 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.499
 We got it. 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:57.290
 If you are professionally responsible for the ping axis for the month, 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:59.320
 I'm professionally replaced again. 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.809
 Those who are not 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:04.659
 A basic screen wave supported by Indian paper 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:06.849
 In turn 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.150
 There are four 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.309
 Have free will 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:11.249
 character 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:14.449
 I will be sure to open the ccp preview 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:15.259
 I'll do it. 

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:16.700
 To us 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.080
 I'm in a state where I can keep my home secret. 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.870
 It is qualified. Simply between weeks 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.270
 Let's hear the image once. 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.329
 Push it by spreading 

00:04:29.329 --> 00:04:32.329
 When you select the second tag, 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.889
 You'll be able to identify the cause, such as the flag. 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.880
 She is 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.830
 What you want 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.830
 Plum fatigue 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.430
 World occupation 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.930

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:54.069
 Get 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:55.600
 So 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.780
 So this way, I can now get a prism sheet 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.210
 But with the same image editing tools you want 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.810
 But because the ticket was confirmed 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.810
 And give me the image I want. 

00:05:08.429 --> 00:05:11.770
 I'll have a tap from the first chapter of my own. 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.599
 Signature Ettune goes like that. Give 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.569
 The materials are different. 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:19.659
 I'll try to make a fortune for you. 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:22.689
 If you are in the regiment, you should bring even the cf system. 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.300
 However, for wireframes that can not escape at all 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.349
 I will return to the director in the open. 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.679
 If you have chosen a character for the first time, please select it first. 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.479

 Zedena's rod is a test kpga college student 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:48.289
 I retired the image 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:49.599
 ocn shah 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.499

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.809
 After the third scissor, 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:57.809
 The fourth test induction derivative on the right side 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.270
 In this way, 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.619
 I want to get the 19 already wanted 

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:06.690
 It allows you to get the images you want 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.610
 Preliminary 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.430

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.159
 I'll get you out.
