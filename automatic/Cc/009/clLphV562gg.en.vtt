00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 today we want to talk about 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:10.440
 Wireless scanners June barcodes 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:14.360
 tms 910 it comes in such 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.930
 the box itself the scanner looks like this 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.359
 this scanner using two methods 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.340
 data transfer using technology 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:33.140
 bluetooth 1 meter is hit second method 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:36.030
 this cpp hit data transfer method it 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.730
 method known to all 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.750
 such that this method uses 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.820
 data transmission using standard 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.210
 drivers are the same mouse or keyboard 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:54.510
 method with dad and this is the transfer method 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:58.170
 which transmits the information immediately 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.230
 virtual comfort personal 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.230
 computers 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:08.340
 so now we will demonstrate 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:12.720
 the hit method works with a laptop and 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.250
 scanner means we already produced 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.270
 pairing scanner and but up 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:27.550
 but by bluetooth technology and if we 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:29.820
 take and open accordingly any 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.830
 text editor 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.450
 then the information will appear where 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:40.060
 blinking cursor 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:41.880
 It looks like this now 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:51.700
 wait a second 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:56.830
 pairing will happen now i'm just 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:59.220
 I take again that moment when it is peak 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.840
 barcode bills it conveys information 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.640
 any text editor or in the address 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:10.450
 string or evening as strong and like this 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.150
 Here again, I will show that there is an account 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.190
 principle all bar codes 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.900
 which are printed quality here 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.620
 small of course strongly does not take but here 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.459
 such here he still reads there is 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:29.830
 instructions 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:34.410
 test bar codes mean next 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:37.150
 data transfer point 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.160
 go for the part to translate 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:45.100
 scanners this mode you need to scan 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.980
 appropriate barcode on the bill for 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:52.780
 beginning we break the connection by scanning 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.549
 disconnect with them baked that 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.890
 symbolizes that is now broken 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:03.040
 and then select the corresponding mode 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:08.920
 nsp poetry scanners all scanner 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:11.070
 switched now so that we 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.709
 will come on the device running 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.230
 android systems and for this you need to 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.410
 device install special 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.390
 software that goes to 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.690
 cd with scanner 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.800
 barcode can also be downloaded at 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.060
 manufacturer's website 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:37.920
 means for this even such a scenario 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.920
 pairing with scanner and device 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.400
 held working yes that is there 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:48.659
 stated by the manufacturer that it works 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:53.159
 there is ayios that is, the apple family and 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:55.980
 exactly there is even an instruction how to tie 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:04:08.939
 his instruction is included too 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:11.000
 attached means the camera will make sure we 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.000
 this 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.340
 so here they request a pin code for 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.770
 mates 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:41.820
 1234 by default after this run 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:49.650
 software here too 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:52.170
 click connect wrote that 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.590
 connected with ska him and respectively 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:58.590
 we also scan it 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:13.610
 have scanned it adds something 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:18.540
 Now let's just make everything simple 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:20.760
 Well, and the application that she almost 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.190
 work using one or another mode 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.020
 take the information that will already be on 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.740
 device either in those countries editor 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.910
 either by using the utility here which 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.170
 polls virtual com port 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.170
 On this
