00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:11.650

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.440
 and tense and a moment that I forgot 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.439
 Do something 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.590
 Well I'm still here as I was saying today 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:23.070
 well teach how to be in the short list 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.840
 justice about the law what are we going to 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.369
 need mainly is the minecraft 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.790
 fort with the industrial craft the code 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.059
 chicken core and the tablecloth out and tense in 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.879
 law 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.800
 for this all dreams I will leave 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.800
 in the description and both downloaded it 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.969
 and let's proceed with the good fact what 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.969
 first it will be minecraft 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:53.630
 that will be I will put the description the three 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:56.420
 links as I said the same we did not open 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.110
 we will also have to open the point 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.410
 bhangra so as you know we 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.410
 we put 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.630
 it is not necessary to say that you have to have the 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.409
 latest version be the 1.5 clean points 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.409
 without any way 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.630
 it's going to open 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.500
 in right 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.500
 open with rap 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:37.020
 now sometimes opens as you know I 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.020
 I have an alternator 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.070
 as it does not open when when it has 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.620
 open to both 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.400
 good good we have here both 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:54.080
 folders first do 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:57.910
 the mein together let embroider the metal 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.910
 and here we go selecting everything 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.950
 When I determine this, we lower it 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.039
 we'll see 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.729
 finished I think you have to finish 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.729
 soon 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.570
 he left 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:21.240
 and well, since this is going to take a 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.120
 little bit and thanks for all the 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.960
 support that I am giving for that 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.960
 we select everything 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.750
 and we had a good time as I said I wanted to give 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.300
 thanks for all this support 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.070
 I'm seeing that you like my videos and 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.110
 videos that have enough 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.230
 reproductions others that do not have 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.050
 so many but they are still enough 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.150
 because 400 you have to have the video 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.150
 least seen of my channel seems to me a 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.840
 outrageous and good as I see this 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.150
 is for a while as soon as it is in 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.090
 that I know so I ask the next step then 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.130
 Well hairs like crazy just discovered 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.540
 that if we're going to record, they pass zero 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:10.380
 eat so good to accept stoppage and when 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:13.170
 be after you already know I'll be worth the 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.989
 history we have this so now we have 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.930
 what to do is close these two things and what 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.939
 what you have to do is open the minecraft 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.260
 as you know if I could not 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:27.810
 pass or open a point run file not me 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.390
 is going to let someone create recording like this 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.120
 that you already know the only thing that you have to 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.239
 make the minecraft expect it to be a 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.709
 beta in the main menu when by 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.180
 example I 'm in the main menu I'm going 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.670
 to record 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.319
 we close them and it has already been explained before 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.819
 good here as always this thing of 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.950
 always if you do not have a premium 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.510
 will appear here the mail we go as 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.219
 always center game without any 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:55.170
 problem and something for those who do not know 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:57.599
 the minecraft falls every time it starts 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.549
 the main believes you have to go down in a 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.469
 bookstore the first time in the 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.659
 mandatory the next if you do not have 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:05.370
 internet well then I imagine that 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:09.599
 we have also proven that you do not 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:13.169
 will ask not look at you download them is clear to me 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:15.120
 I think good because as I said before in 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.669
 when I finish and that number 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.560
 I 'm going back, the minecraft started 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.740
 that what I should put if you have 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.110
 lowered what I have put you and well then 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.240
 Now what we have to do is like 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.069
 it's the night folder 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.910
 it just appears these three are minecraft 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:35.760
 forges and these things so we closed the 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.770
 Minecraft 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.380
 we are going to folder hose amount and 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.670
 will create a folder account 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.120
 we are going to spend the we want 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.150
 that the only one we're going to need 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.200
 we access there 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.729
 will work 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:54.949
 and we have to drag 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.949
 these two here inside 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.180
 let's wait for it to pass, they're already 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.789
 here 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.500
 and now again we are going to start the 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:07.370
 macro 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:11.510
 already knew had already concluded in 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:14.370
 the radio so good now the souls 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.280
 that has opened center game 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:21.630
 and we wait again for it to load 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.850
 everything as you see here again is going to 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:27.060
 update to do things right now 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:31.950

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:34.590

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.560
 good guys, I'm already here after 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.210
 a few mistakes and having to go down 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.310
 of other things more because I have already 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.570

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.790
 same but because I had been wrong 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:50.880
 when downloading a version of the follow 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:54.270
 we run this and in the end I have to 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:58.760
 download another one and as a baby is already installed 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:01.490
