 It has all the flavor 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.619
 I want to add a little 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.869
 by spicy tension that is the spicy 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.960
 and we add 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:28.880
 this is 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:32.079
 Liquefied tomato with onion 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:36.430

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:36.430
 they are liquefied fires and simple 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.430

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.420
 boiling 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.930
 once 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.310
 I'm seeing what we cover and we leave it to 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.520
 slow fire 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.190
 at least one hour 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.320
 this 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.100
 it is the first step of making the sancho 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.300

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.519
 It was full of meat, not that it was 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.519
 reduced but simply 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.010

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.010
