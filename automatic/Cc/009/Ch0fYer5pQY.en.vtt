00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
you have to be able to create the

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.460 
you have to be able to create the
turbine<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.250> then<00:00:17.369> also<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:18.480> other<00:00:18.510> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
turbine and then also the other the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.450 
turbine and then also the other the
other<00:00:19.590> tool<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.830> I'm<00:00:19.980> gonna<00:00:20.070> go<00:00:20.220> pick<00:00:20.340> up

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
other tool that I'm gonna go pick up

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.010 
other tool that I'm gonna go pick up
right<00:00:20.640> now<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.150> put<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.570> turbine<00:00:21.840> right

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
right now so I put the turbine right

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.590 
right now so I put the turbine right
there<00:00:22.170> I'm<00:00:22.260> kind<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.470> staging<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.920> for<00:00:23.600> group

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
there I'm kind of staging it for group

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.580 
there I'm kind of staging it for group
and<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.779> bunch<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:24.990> zombies<00:00:25.260> together<00:00:25.500> I'm

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
and a bunch of zombies together I'm

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.779 
and a bunch of zombies together I'm
bringing<00:00:25.830> it<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.039> way<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.369> you'll<00:00:26.460> see<00:00:26.609> this

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
bringing it that way and you'll see this

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.490 
bringing it that way and you'll see this
if<00:00:27.029> you're<00:00:27.840> trying<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.050> get<00:00:28.170> there's<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> team

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
if you're trying to get there's a team

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.599 
if you're trying to get there's a team
and<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:28.740> definitely<00:00:28.949> probably<00:00:29.400> one<00:00:29.580> of

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
and this is definitely probably one of

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.970 
and this is definitely probably one of
the<00:00:29.730> easiest<00:00:29.970> ways<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.210> do<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.650> so<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.740> kind<00:00:31.859> of

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
the easiest ways to do it so I kind of

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.680 
the easiest ways to do it so I kind of
plan<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.160> out<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.730> solo<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.600> this

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
plan this out this is on solo but this

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.370 
plan this out this is on solo but this
is<00:00:33.840> device<00:00:34.140> right<00:00:34.320> here<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.040> sub

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
is device right here the the sub

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.569 
is device right here the the sub
subsurface<00:00:37.380> resonator<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.129> always<00:00:38.340> forget<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
subsurface resonator I always forget the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.680 
subsurface resonator I always forget the
name<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.969> as<00:00:39.120> well<00:00:39.300> that's<00:00:39.450> kind<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
name of it as well that's kind of a

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.240 
name of it as well that's kind of a
crazy<00:00:39.840> name<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.770> didn't<00:00:40.980> know<00:00:41.040> what<00:00:41.129> this

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
crazy name and I didn't know what this

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.910 
crazy name and I didn't know what this
thing<00:00:41.370> was<00:00:41.520> used<00:00:41.760> for<00:00:42.000> but<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.329> course<00:00:42.590> pile<00:00:43.590> or

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
thing was used for but of course pile or

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.910 
thing was used for but of course pile or
come<00:00:44.460> combined<00:00:45.450> with<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:46.050> turbine<00:00:46.739> is

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
come combined with this turbine is

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.400 
come combined with this turbine is
actually<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.730> friggin<00:00:48.239> badass<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.289> can

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
actually just friggin badass so you can

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.110 
actually just friggin badass so you can
see<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.530> put<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.739> turbine<00:00:50.070> down<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.670> then

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
see I put the turbine down here and then

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.580 
see I put the turbine down here and then
I'm<00:00:51.180> gonna<00:00:51.270> put<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:52.140> thing<00:00:52.320> right<00:00:52.469> in

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
I'm gonna put the the thing right in

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.319 
I'm gonna put the the thing right in
front<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.829> it

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
front of it

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.880
