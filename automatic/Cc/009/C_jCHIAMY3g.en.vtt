00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:09.650
 Today I would like to take a cut 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:12.620
 look at there because a lot of people doing that just on youtube is Ikure raised 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.050
 It is okay if you 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.299
 In particular 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:22.190
 The body that explains how to cut 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:25.330
 It is said that there is no particular problem if it is hitting like this in Jakuso. 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.330
 It is a video of feeling 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:36.650
 How to cut the Toka especially those such key is correct 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:39.620
 Because it is not decided whether it should be such a way of cutting 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:44.640
 Well the person who cut easy to do of their own 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.640
 It is okay to have it sold at Chanso . There is no need to pay special attention. 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.440
 Ray 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.660
 I like it 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.980
 I'll stop by now 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.980
 This is fine 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.100
 Or rather orthodox 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.100
 I also use well 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.800
 Quite quietly 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:12.070
 Because 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:14.159
 If you have something a bit heavy or if you are a bit nervous, you can feel like this 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.999
 Well if you 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.999
 It will not be a problem 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.549
 Because there are many ways to cut 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.509
 I will 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.509
 There is no problem in the most easy way to do it myself 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.860
 Another one after that 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.860
 I often use it 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.860
 What should I do? 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.860
 Do you say house 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.710
 Make a half turn 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.710
 Row with index finger 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.880
 I will come to you 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:13.930
 It is quite effective when you want to increase the speed of 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:19.020
 Yes I will come to grab you, but I can do it quite quickly 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:23.690
 A little speed for those who hit the early rainy days 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.690
 I use a song to match 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.930
 Ray 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.890
 People I mean Tsu yo I just beginner really started 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.760
 Maybe naturally 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:55.510
 How to stick to when cutting 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.510
 Come Oite 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.990
 On such an experience and experience 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.990
 think 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.209
 Grab yes, lift it and have your middle finger and video 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:22.230
 Such a feeling is still weak and for beginners 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:25.319
 d 4 there is ash on It is a hole and the second row is hard to do just to 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.090
 Because you hit the middle finger amount 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:31.650
 That time is that 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.330
 Mix various cutting methods 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.520
 So easy to say 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.520
 I think you can cut it so you can cut it easily 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.780
 Especially at this level 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:56.020

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.590

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.400
 I tried to take a video 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.400
