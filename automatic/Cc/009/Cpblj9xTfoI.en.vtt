00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.180
 hello to all this is in the ar of today 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.490
 you see me with the shiny skin you have 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.500
 complicated the cuticle oil I have 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.320
 made a very simple hangar 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.140
 because today I didn't want anything too much 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.029
 too much too flashy on the nails 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.130
 so nobody wanted a decoration 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.250
 particularly showy but I wanted 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.610
 however a particular way e 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.559
 so he opted for this nail art 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.100
 really simple it is realized 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.250
 little time and in my opinion anyway 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.579
 delicate cute used colors 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.680
 train of the moment which are the green and the 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.879
 I said purple even if it gets better 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.430
 you see very little so it's really a 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.629
 certain purple detail we know they are 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.930
 the trends of the moment I used 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.780
 this beautiful pastel color on cancel 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.000
 thumb by hand accents what time for 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.490
 make this one the most used side 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.460
 or not the same technique as the shower head ne 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.140
 I took inspiration from that after 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.320
 nail art I leave the link in the box 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.790
 information other than if you have not seen 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.200
 nothing I leave you with the very simple 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.530
 tutorial and depriving a kiss 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.530
 Hello 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.790
 start laying out a base of collistar 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.040
 on all my nails then I take this 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.110
 ivory color than the 110 of the pupa 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.229
 of the single-color stand only on the nails 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.490
 of the ring finger and per inch 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.710
 for all the other nails instead I have 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.180
 chose a color that is very fashionable and 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.360
 this point precisely that the acid green 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.410
 this is the very nice 709 pupa 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.729
 and always monocolor on the other nails 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.920
 after that I go to lay down a second one 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:58.240
 pass of both colors for 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.680
 get utility coverage etc. 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.880
 the result already so I must say second 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.670
 me is very pretty then i take painting 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.619
 white acrylic and I had no purple 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.570
 pastel so I created it all 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.060
 the white grid always mentioned before the 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.890
 light color to which added little for 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.830
 turn a purple pin up to 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.950
 get the tone that interested me 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.320
 or diluted the color to make it precisely 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.769
 more liquid and with a flat brush 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.239
 I went to pick him up right there 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.160
 and as you can see from the images almost 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.010
 long clear you will see better it goes by 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.660
 make lines first in one direction 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.299
 and then in the other direction in order to create 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.360
 a sort of retina here on this has me 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.160
 yes you perceive a little more but 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.320
 however there are photos to understand 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.700
 really simple so that's enough 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.260
 simply place the tip of the 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.170
 gently brush will do these 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.620
 thin lines and I see them all 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.620
 the nails 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.020
 I decided to make this kind 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.840
 of retina only on the angle of the nail 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.420
 because I liked that it was really a 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.660
 very delicate decoration but of course yes 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.520
 can play with this technique like 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.040
 in short, it is preferable to combine 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.350
 some dot lines do it more or less 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.840
 big in short I finally went to 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.400
 apply this cuticle oil 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.680
 It's a good habit I'm taking 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.360
 lately anyway this is all me 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.580
 I very much hope that even if it is simple I will 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.300
 liked it and see you at the next video 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.300
 a kiss bye
