00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
so they seem for this one the 975 were

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.860 
so they seem for this one the 975 were
you<00:03:45.040> looking<00:03:45.340> at<00:03:45.460> getting<00:03:45.640> the<00:03:45.760> 95<00:03:46.450> compared

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
you looking at getting the 95 compared

you looking at getting the 95 compared
to<00:03:46.960> 925<00:03:48.360> you<00:03:49.360> will<00:03:49.510> benefit<00:03:49.930> more<00:03:50.170> on<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:52.060> case

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
to 925 you will benefit more on the case

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.680 
to 925 you will benefit more on the case
and<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:53.020> charging<00:03:53.410> part<00:03:53.860> of<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.130> case<00:03:54.340> I

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
and the charging part of the case I

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.090 
and the charging part of the case I
couldn't<00:03:55.690> really<00:03:55.840> get<00:03:56.080> five<00:03:56.350> hours<00:03:56.590> talktime

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
couldn't really get five hours talktime

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.850 
couldn't really get five hours talktime
and<00:03:57.370> this<00:03:57.670> thing<00:03:57.910> but<00:03:58.390> maybe<00:03:58.960> others<00:03:59.560> will<00:03:59.590> be

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
and this thing but maybe others will be

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.670 
and this thing but maybe others will be
able<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.700> get<00:04:00.850> close<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.300> that<00:04:01.330> but<00:04:02.170> it<00:04:02.260> depends

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
able to get close to that but it depends

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.590 
able to get close to that but it depends
on<00:04:02.740> your<00:04:02.800> usage<00:04:03.100> as<00:04:03.550> well<00:04:03.580> -<00:04:04.030> so<00:04:04.060> they<00:04:04.720> see<00:04:06.600> note

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
on your usage as well - so they see note

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.650 
on your usage as well - so they see note

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
that they moved the plug in for the

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.960 
that they moved the plug in for the
adapter<00:04:11.530> -<00:04:11.680> over<00:04:11.920> here<00:04:12.190> on<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.460> side<00:04:12.670> over

adapter - over here on the side over
here<00:04:14.100> and<00:04:15.100> the<00:04:15.370> case<00:04:15.580> is<00:04:15.790> little<00:04:16.000> bit<00:04:16.090> more

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
here and the case is little bit more

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.190 
here and the case is little bit more
bulkier<00:04:16.950> you're<00:04:17.950> like<00:04:18.160> me<00:04:18.310> trying<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.180> put<00:04:20.049> in
