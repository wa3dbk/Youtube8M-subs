 the twin twin and their hip electro rock 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.540
 hop are unknown but they have the 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.110
 chance last night to play in front of 20000 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.269
 people 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.250
 after winning the contest 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.900
 music started by ricard whose goal 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.220
 is to allow young talent 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.220
 to access the scene 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.840
 thank you 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.090
 young voice performer 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.460
 english bottleed his soul rock songs 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.730
 and retro pop art she also deliver it 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.730
 crowd 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.949
 but the most expected were the babies 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.050
 brunettes and their long pants 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.000
 teenager today five years that the 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.640
 babies rockers wins music 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.890
 2009 arose on stage with their 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.890
 effervescent and melancholic melodies 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.370
 no me 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.260
 believe in us but a success too 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.260
 great language I do not think so 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.450
 your success is to sing in 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.920
 I had to play it's clear 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.229
 since suddenly it differentiates us 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.619
 still from most groups that 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.970
 sing in English and then that's it 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.970
 creates a little identity 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.880
 j 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.890
 no 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.960
 the 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.790
 in baby rats have an autograph 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.650
 or a photo with one of the 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.270
 four bb brunettes count the next day 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.550
 at liceo on facebook 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.990
 the rockers lends itself to the game but for 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.150
 the important thing is to last 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.470
 good the beatles that they do not have 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.000
 enormously long but lauriston 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.020
 until today you still need them 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.610
 concerts and get along when the albums 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.970
 that's our goal to be a paper 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.970
 rocker
