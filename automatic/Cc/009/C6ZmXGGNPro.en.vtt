00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.610
 married with two kids and docs and today I'm going 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.590
 make a completely 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.179
 this request away from the 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:24.050
 raw material garlic corn very short 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:29.269
 sometimes my black salt is responsible 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:32.660
 behind is my friend with four years old 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:38.870
 alternating is getting a folder to 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:46.760
 join some eyes join many sites 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:53.600
 here inside where it is worth saving 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:54.380
 lots of pepper and cat baths with the 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.560
 site 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.190
 now let's bring you is a person who has 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.190
 several times 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.069
 the final result of the match that we 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.840
 we intend not to extend yet vain 

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:12.590
 to bring together more than 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.479
 they look much closer to this 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.490
 process several times until we have the bread 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.950
 all season 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:30.530
 add more salt client sugar 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:35.119
 between which is already here and we are going now 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:38.539
 turn on the broa is already training with 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:42.609
 the four with salt pepper 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.609
 we've got one more that has 18 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:49.159
 just to get to this consistency 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:56.439
 of the time to collate and can claim 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:56.439
 that does not get a folder quite enough 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:06.069
 teaching some sites already had strength here 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.069
 on the platter and now it's just 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.160
 we do here it 's cool but the opposite 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.930
 it is not low 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:21.880
 so it is nevertheless to arrive here in the 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.410
 I usually leave but it's more 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.160
 productive will get it bought 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:33.850
 traditional because competitors are 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:35.260
 even more delicious and stays the same as it is 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.670
 almost an accompaniment 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:48.150
 although follow-up is by stages 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:56.350
 gets a crust trying to balance 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:03:01.269
 the plate and let's play a little 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.400
 pepper still portuguese 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.680
 the material was out of paper because 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.830
 it was a few minutes two minutes in 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.690
 of water will dance all present 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.980
 which is better with a presentation 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:18.450
 better and we managed to pass the 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:28.450
 the battle is now one place the material 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:32.290
 was in the year will stay about 35 minutes 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.570
 in medium oven photo was not the strong link 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.560
 between one thing and another 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:40.960
 and we already have our cod ready to 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.140
 going out is also 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:49.390

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.530
 absolutely fantastic fantastic such 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.850
 treatment 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:04:05.010
 now comes a mall to accept this 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:06.970
 channel of these pre salt areas 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:21.900
 even better 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:21.900
 the cimpor is us 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.759
 the opposite is the focus vote that is 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.590
 basic kitchen and technical 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.139
 a kitchen that we can get the food 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.860
 that we won at our grandparents' house 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:40.840
 in hiring with the mix of everything 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.650
 that we know from the trips that 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.210
 we do with the arrived from the other but with 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.550
 ingredients do it with them 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.919
 found in the market 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.699
 our Liffey River that offers she's 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:58.240
 thawed but fresh 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:02.520
 taste of food is to beat a Brazilian and
