00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.090
 uy can I run without 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.879
 where youtube like they are guys because 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.950
 you not very well because I am very 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:14.480
 well and well guys the day of the 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.210
 I play the review of a mod 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.890
 how good is the mode 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:24.560
 run for two let's say it this way 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.880
 good way first of all a flat I'm going to 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.070
 start in the channel also to upload 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.250
 reviews of mods and good if possible 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.820
 also review of texture packs and review 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.470
 from to not just because good let's say 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.489
 that way it would be more complete to the channel 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:43.820
 we would have mods texts maps series of his 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.479
 rival series of maps so downloadable and 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.979
 all that and well let's say that it would be 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:51.769
 making the channel more complete by 

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:54.350
 say it in a way and well I know not 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:57.890
 I have taught how mods are installed but 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.170
 it comes to them in a video next and then it 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.320
 I promise and for those who already know demo 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.960
 then I will leave the link in the description 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.720
 that they must put in their own to be 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.640
 and good continuing I also wanted them 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.520
 mention that they write by has not gone up 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.619
 videos throughout the week is that I saw 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.940
 what is the problem of my channel the 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.490
 problem of my channel is that they are not 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.869
 many videos so well now I'm going 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.299
 start uploading a video is more often 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.939
 is what I want because I know it is 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.770
 difficult but I have to achieve it because 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.780
 I'm very excited about this 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.970
 and grow on youtube and all that and then 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.790
 simply 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.740
 without suffering many more videos before 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.050
 also to cook or here is a small 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.660
 bus that has this mode or there is no how 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.340
 you see the water looks super close that is 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.140
 as it should be seen if it were not 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.180
 the mode but we do not go out and you see more 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.980
 far away has been given to us what 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.980
 I'll make here is that wool 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.530
 is very close these two blocks of 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:58.620
 sand and there I go up a little bit and it looks more 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:03.810
 far I do not know if you noticed reach 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:05.860
 to see there I am very very close and there 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.860
 I'm a little bit further 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.790
 and good is a good bug also something 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.120
 bad in this way is that it alters or alters 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.040
 the sight of the little doll I do not know if I 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.190
 I explain, that is, it looks different 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.720
 of the main crespi or should it look like this 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.850
 it's how it looks normal when we're like this 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.240
 and when I go out, we're going to see 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.750
 different then it's the only bad thing about 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.350
 So this is how you see the 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.480
 different 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.880
 good as it is distorted the 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.310
 image all the time unless 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.020
 we are underwater as you have seen but 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.250
 He is very father because we can run 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.100
 and all that 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.620
 in fact the mods serve on servers 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.770
 and why do they want me to not be 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.620
 advancing the video and none of that then 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:56.480
 just see this pig, that is if 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.460
 I was advancing the known video 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.530
 some program you would see that the animals 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.020
 they go slower but the animals go 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.630
 equal to your speed do not realize 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.910
 there's the pig I'm going faster than 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.010
 he obviously because a lot of people say 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.380
 that are camera tricks and all that but 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.960
 It is not very easy to install mods and because 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.600
 that not at the moment that you upload the 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.060
 video of how to install mods from a 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.610
 gave is because well I do not know much about 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.070
 android as you know I just have a 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.780
 ipod I know almost nothing about android out there 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.550
 and I will study to see if there is someone who 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.190
 is going to come up that he knows things from 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.830
 android that has some tutorials and 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.380
 then I'll leave that from your channel in the in 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.920
 my description so you can go see 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.540
 your android people tutorials like this 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.970
 what are people uploading android please 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.340
 someone knows or if or if your friend who is 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.590
 doing this because you know about android and 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.980
 You have some videos on your channel 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:55.790
 leave me your channel and then I will recommend 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.400
 and then nothing more 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.200
 Escobar boys as I said I hope that 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.909
 you're liking all the others that 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.959
 I'm implementing on the channel mods 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:08.720
 maps and future future good after 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.150
 in a future text parks so I would 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.310
 dismissal and right now is that I do not bring my 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.519
 skin because I just changed to 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.709
 minecraft so that to have motorcycles 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.169
 have to have the pirate minecraft or 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.910
 be the visser or the up cake and then 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.380
 I just downloaded it and name not 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.350
 well it's not that he did not give me time 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.300
 better since putting a skin but already many 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.919
 they know my corner so now 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.680

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.680
