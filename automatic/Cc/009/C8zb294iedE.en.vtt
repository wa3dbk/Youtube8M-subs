00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
have to say you did a really good job

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.289 
have to say you did a really good job
for<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.829> first<00:02:01.829> launcher<00:02:02.250> he<00:02:02.429> has<00:02:02.549> done<00:02:02.759> so

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
for the first launcher he has done so

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.840 
for the first launcher he has done so
the<00:02:03.420> first<00:02:03.630> thing<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:04.079> any<00:02:04.500> ability<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.640> rotate

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the first thing is any ability to rotate

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.919 
the first thing is any ability to rotate
I<00:02:06.569> have<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.530> say<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.819> is<00:02:09.060> slightly<00:02:09.539> on<00:02:09.899> the

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
I have to say that it is slightly on the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.680 
I have to say that it is slightly on the
slower<00:02:10.349> side<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.310> mainly<00:02:11.730> because<00:02:12.090> this

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
slower side that is mainly because this

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.940 
slower side that is mainly because this
feature<00:02:13.049> is<00:02:13.410> not<00:02:13.670> being<00:02:14.670> hardware

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
feature is not being hardware

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.589 
feature is not being hardware
accelerated<00:02:16.950> support<00:02:17.489> so<00:02:18.000> that's<00:02:18.180> why<00:02:18.390> it<00:02:18.450> is

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
accelerated support so that's why it is

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.690 
accelerated support so that's why it is
still<00:02:18.870> on<00:02:19.049> the<00:02:19.140> slow<00:02:19.380> side<00:02:19.410> but<00:02:20.190> definitely

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
still on the slow side but definitely

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.729 
still on the slow side but definitely
i'm<00:02:20.940> guessing<00:02:21.330> in<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.930> future<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.560> will

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
i'm guessing in the future you will

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.580 
i'm guessing in the future you will
improve<00:02:23.519> that<00:02:23.780> so<00:02:24.780> here's<00:02:25.110> where<00:02:25.319> you<00:02:25.440> will

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
improve that so here's where you will

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.110 
improve that so here's where you will
change<00:02:25.739> your<00:02:25.860> home<00:02:26.130> screen<00:02:26.370> settings<00:02:26.790> the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
change your home screen settings the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.240 
change your home screen settings the
search<00:02:27.329> bar<00:02:27.690> so<00:02:28.290> let's<00:02:28.440> just<00:02:28.500> check<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.069> and

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
search bar so let's just check that and

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.910 
search bar so let's just check that and
can<00:02:29.489> take<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.700> look<00:02:29.880> again<00:02:30.920> transitioning

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
can take a look again transitioning

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.699 
can take a look again transitioning
effects<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.700> within<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.750> app<00:02:33.900> drawer<00:02:34.170> itself

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
effects so within the app drawer itself

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.030 
effects so within the app drawer itself
we<00:02:35.310> can<00:02:35.459> change<00:02:36.260> also<00:02:37.260> some<00:02:37.530> other<00:02:37.709> cool

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
we can change also some other cool

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.809 
we can change also some other cool
features<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:40.250> personalization<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.489> here's

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
features and personalization so here's

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.479 
features and personalization so here's
more<00:02:42.090> for<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.420> app<00:02:42.660> drawer<00:02:43.099> let's<00:02:44.099> go<00:02:44.250> back

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
more for the app drawer let's go back

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.520 
more for the app drawer let's go back
right<00:02:44.790> here<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.420> there<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:45.959> go<00:02:46.019> you<00:02:46.110> can<00:02:46.380> see

course egos blood right here I have to

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.229 
course egos blood right here I have to
say<00:03:32.849> as<00:03:33.209> a<00:03:33.269> whole<00:03:34.170> very<00:03:34.799> smooth<00:03:35.190> very<00:03:35.489> fluid

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.140 
say as a whole very smooth very fluid
and<00:03:36.680> this<00:03:37.680> hardware<00:03:38.150> accelerated

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
and this hardware accelerated

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.860 
and this hardware accelerated
orientation<00:03:40.139> again<00:03:40.319> doesn't<00:03:40.920> work<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.400> best

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
orientation again doesn't work the best

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.280 
orientation again doesn't work the best
but<00:03:42.870> will<00:03:43.470> be<00:03:43.709> supported<00:03:44.250> in<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.760> future<00:03:45.290> it

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
but will be supported in the future it

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.280 
but will be supported in the future it
also<00:03:46.530> has<00:03:47.010> some<00:03:47.370> minor<00:03:47.760> tweaks<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.569> bugs<00:03:49.109> that

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
also has some minor tweaks and bugs that

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.460 
also has some minor tweaks and bugs that
were<00:03:49.470> replaced<00:03:50.340> because<00:03:50.720> auto<00:03:51.720> brightness<00:03:52.049> on

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
were replaced because auto brightness on

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.160 
were replaced because auto brightness on
the

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
the

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.500 
the
it<00:03:54.160> wasn't<00:03:54.550> working<00:03:54.849> it<00:03:55.090> wasn't<00:03:55.390> too

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
it wasn't working it wasn't too

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.300 
it wasn't working it wasn't too
functional<00:03:55.990> but<00:03:56.440> now<00:03:56.530> that<00:03:56.740> bug<00:03:56.920> has<00:03:57.160> been

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
functional but now that bug has been

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.640 
functional but now that bug has been
fixed<00:03:57.370> so<00:03:57.790> it<00:03:57.819> actually<00:03:58.150> works<00:03:58.540> better<00:03:58.690> and<00:03:59.110> as

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
fixed so it actually works better and as

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.910 
fixed so it actually works better and as
for<00:03:59.950> data<00:04:00.550> speeds<00:04:01.000> it<00:04:01.480> does<00:04:01.810> recognize<00:04:02.800> the

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
for data speeds it does recognize the

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.020 
for data speeds it does recognize the
difference<00:04:03.250> between<00:04:03.370> a<00:04:03.580> 3g<00:04:05.340> hsdpa<00:04:06.340> so

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
difference between a 3g hsdpa so

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.740 
difference between a 3g hsdpa so
definitely<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:08.739> good<00:04:09.340> improvement<00:04:09.640> within<00:04:10.480> the
