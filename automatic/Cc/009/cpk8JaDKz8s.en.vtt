similar<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.810> year's<00:01:10.140> card<00:01:10.530> design

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
similar to this year's card design

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.550 
similar to this year's card design
because<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:11.790> you'll<00:01:12.060> notice<00:01:12.210> from<00:01:12.479> fifa<00:01:12.869> 14<00:01:13.110> to

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
because if you'll notice from fifa 14 to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.170 
because if you'll notice from fifa 14 to
fifa<00:01:13.830> 15<00:01:13.979> they<00:01:14.369> added<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.790> little<00:01:14.909> bit<00:01:15.030> of

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
fifa 15 they added a little bit of

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.719 
fifa 15 they added a little bit of
detail<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.920> actually<00:01:16.920> well<00:01:17.159> i<00:01:17.189> think<00:01:17.460> they'll

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
detail and actually well i think they'll

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.140 
detail and actually well i think they'll
kind<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.240> do<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.570> same<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.880> again<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.090> year

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
kind of do the same and again this year

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.690 
kind of do the same and again this year
a<00:01:21.750> lot<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.409> people<00:01:22.619> would<00:01:22.950> really<00:01:23.340> love<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.670> if

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
a lot of people would really love it if

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.060 
a lot of people would really love it if
we<00:01:24.330> could<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.810> square<00:01:25.140> card<00:01:25.619> designs

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
we could have the square card designs

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.640 
we could have the square card designs
now<00:01:26.430> i<00:01:26.700> think<00:01:27.000> actually<00:01:27.479> EA<00:01:27.869> got<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.259> just<00:01:28.290> a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
now i think actually EA got in just a

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.109 
now i think actually EA got in just a
little<00:01:28.799> bit<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.100> trouble<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.579> few<00:01:29.610> years<00:01:29.790> ago

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
little bit of trouble a few years ago

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.359 
little bit of trouble a few years ago
and<00:01:30.509> because<00:01:31.049> they<00:01:31.229> kind<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.680> look<00:01:31.890> like<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
and because they kind of look like the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.800 
and because they kind of look like the
sticker<00:01:32.670> book<00:01:32.909> pictures<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.540> know<00:01:33.570> and

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
sticker book pictures you know and

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.749 
sticker book pictures you know and
there's<00:01:33.990> licensing<00:01:34.590> issues<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.549> these

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
there's licensing issues that these

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.760

that so I've toned it down from what I
initially<00:02:37.209> had<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.770> but<00:02:38.770> I've<00:02:39.010> sort<00:02:39.370> of<00:02:39.430> left

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
initially had and but I've sort of left

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.340 
initially had and but I've sort of left
it<00:02:39.790> at<00:02:39.820> this<00:02:40.030> because<00:02:40.239> i<00:02:40.270> like<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.780> cards<00:02:41.170> when

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350

they're<00:02:41.530> really<00:02:41.830> bright<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.400> really<00:02:42.520> sort<00:02:42.850> of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
they're really bright and really sort of

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.690 
they're really bright and really sort of
shiny<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.480> stuff<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:44.020> this<00:02:44.830> one<00:02:45.040> I'm<00:02:45.190> not<00:02:45.489> as

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
shiny and stuff and this one I'm not as

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.699 
shiny and stuff and this one I'm not as
keen<00:02:46.120> on<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.480> team<00:02:46.690> of<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.900> season<00:02:47.230> cards<00:02:47.590> I

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
keen on the team of the season cards I

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.530 
keen on the team of the season cards I
couldn't<00:02:48.220> quite<00:02:48.370> get<00:02:48.520> the<00:02:48.670> gold<00:02:48.940> behind<00:02:49.390> the

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
couldn't quite get the gold behind the

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.680 
couldn't quite get the gold behind the
player<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:50.020> look<00:02:50.230> at<00:02:50.940> exactly<00:02:51.940> how<00:02:52.269> I<00:02:52.300> wanted

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
player to look at exactly how I wanted

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.170 
player to look at exactly how I wanted
it<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:53.080> but<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.709> still<00:02:53.830> think<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.459> looks<00:02:54.670> kind<00:02:55.030> of

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
it to but I still think it looks kind of

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.449 
it to but I still think it looks kind of
cool<00:02:55.420> kind<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:55.930> neat<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.890> then<00:02:57.100> this<00:02:57.280> is

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
cool kind of neat and then this is

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:58.890 
cool kind of neat and then this is
probably<00:02:57.580> my<00:02:57.970> least<00:02:58.209> favorite<00:02:58.660> out<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:58.810> the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
probably my least favorite out of the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.270 
probably my least favorite out of the
lot<00:02:59.140> which<00:02:59.320> is<00:02:59.470> like<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.650> record<00:02:59.980> breaker

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
lot which is like the record breaker

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.130 
lot which is like the record breaker
card<00:03:00.700> it's<00:03:00.940> really<00:03:01.360> difficult<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.930> actually

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
card it's really difficult to actually

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.870 
card it's really difficult to actually
get<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.530> colors<00:03:02.860> right<00:03:02.890> on<00:03:03.220> these<00:03:03.370> cards<00:03:03.640> and

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
get the colors right on these cards and

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.229 
get the colors right on these cards and
so<00:03:04.660> I<00:03:04.690> spent<00:03:05.019> quite<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.320> lot<00:03:05.440> of<00:03:05.650> time<00:03:05.860> on<00:03:06.239> trying
