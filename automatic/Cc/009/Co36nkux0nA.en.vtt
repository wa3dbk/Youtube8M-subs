00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.529
 we live on our own 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.180
 frequencies for the once again of 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.370
 muscle awakening we do it on 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.650
 Tuesday with pier luigi de pascalis the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.269
 your our athletic trainer of 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.400
 trust I remind you not only fitness 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:20.340
 puntoit good morning then pierre together 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.220
 to you today we talk about pain, pain 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.140
 after training many wonder e 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.820
 among other things it has circulated a lot on the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.429
 web this thing that pain is 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.920
 it would seem to do well ie from a is a 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.620
 almost synonymous with feeling good later 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.719
 the workout actually signs that 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.950
 maybe it's not really so full it was 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.600
 unfortunately it's not really what I have 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.010
 found that to theme too easy 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.930
 all the equations too 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.120
 elementary cars often do not have it 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.010
 sound we change fc transform 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.379
 obviously in a row of mate whistles 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.300
 that therefore not in search of pain e 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.460
 as you rightly said the message 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.500
 it is very often transmitted through 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.410
 the web through social networks 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.940
 facebook in the first place where everyone is 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.340
 how many those approaching activities 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.439
 sport will have read messages that 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.970
 recite a little the idea that if not 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.680
 we feel pain we really have to 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.540
 hard men we don't really have to 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.030
 results therefore we must fall in love 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.400
 of the pain of our muscles what 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.140
 the mind does not feel the day 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.460
 after training how true it is 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.110
 this aspect 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.350
 and sorry to say that we unfortunately 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.850
 compared to evolutions it is not a piece 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.770
 Italian people I'm sorry 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.180
 use this term and we are a little 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.880
 back we are behind a few 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.700
 decade and 20 30 40 years ago in america 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.400
 there was the hub they said they think 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.840
 no pain then in mind 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.060
 leaving some time fitness have 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.530
 started to become more important e 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.369
 we found out that it's not exactly 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.049
 so 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.899
 also because those we warn 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.759
 as pain after training are 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.530
 certainly the fruit of the work that 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.070
 we had and company but if there 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.930
 premise to improve a result but 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.790
 improve all the depth that man 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.229
 they wanted our performance the 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.010
 hand that we do n't know about training but 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.150
 gets better 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.160
 inevitably the degree of pain 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.480
 decreases if we feel time 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.150
 same degree of pain 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.380
 actually we are never producing a 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.090
 adaptation 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.340
 hence the fact that pain in some 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.380
 way go to decrease and absolutely 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.720
 positive of the significant of the fact that 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.090
 we are improving the training 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.090
 furthermore there is no kind of relationship 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.370
 between intensity of work and intensity 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.410
 of the pain that then we have the days 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.180
 following is how much there is a bit of us 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.610
 a different pain story can 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.530
 producing inflammatory states or differences 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.030
 also not all of them trivially 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.740
 muscles for example the musculature of the 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.510
 ball not all of them muscles 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.150
 return a party perception of 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.640
 pain even after physical training 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.010
 while we are still searching 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.200
 then on facebook of the image from 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.480
 share to feel more men more 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.430
 last because we love pain well 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.110
 know that America is laughing instead 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.940
 around this because of the marines that 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.550
 cost us completely different but no 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.210
 dispel the myth of having to hear the 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.860
 ache 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.600
 if we want to be sure of being there 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.209
 train then to the installments in which to hear 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.860
 pain is in the order of things but not 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.320
 go and look for it inevitably 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.520
 because it is not the yardstick of the 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.440
 your workout 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.000
 thank you for being with us 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.220
 also this Tuesday we feel 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.470
 obviously this point next month 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.930
 in November always with ours 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.230
 muscle awakening good job right 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.230
 work
