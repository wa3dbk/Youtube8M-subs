00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240 

the<00:00:00.570> first<00:00:00.810> movement<00:00:01.020> of<00:00:01.380> the<00:00:01.439> concerto<00:00:02.159> is

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
the first movement of the concerto is

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.360 
the first movement of the concerto is
probably<00:00:03.049> above<00:00:04.049> all<00:00:04.290> where<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.830> influence

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
probably above all where the influence

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.059 
probably above all where the influence
of<00:00:05.430> Moto's<00:00:05.910> felt<00:00:06.210> so<00:00:06.390> strongly<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:07.529> find

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
of Moto's felt so strongly I find

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.620 
of Moto's felt so strongly I find
especially<00:00:08.250> in<00:00:08.760> terms<00:00:09.000> of<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.269> way<00:00:09.360> he<00:00:09.480> uses

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
especially in terms of the way he uses

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.419 
especially in terms of the way he uses
the<00:00:09.870> wind<00:00:10.050> instruments<00:00:10.559> they<00:00:10.710> they<00:00:11.130> become

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
the wind instruments they they become

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:12.950 
the wind instruments they they become
such<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.639> beautiful<00:00:12.000> color<00:00:12.210> on<00:00:12.480> top<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.840> this

and<00:00:36.600> also<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:36.870> in<00:00:37.079> terms<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.410> proportion<00:00:38.010> I

and also just in terms of proportion I

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.290 
and also just in terms of proportion I
mean<00:00:38.219> there's<00:00:38.370> there's<00:00:38.430> such<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> sense<00:00:39.149> of

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
mean there's there's such a sense of

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.910 
mean there's there's such a sense of
balance<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> first<00:00:40.500> theme<00:00:40.770> which

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
balance and you have a first theme which

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.430 
balance and you have a first theme which
is<00:00:40.949> is<00:00:41.390> almost<00:00:42.390> military<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.290> then<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
is is almost military and then the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.540 
is is almost military and then the
second<00:00:43.739> thing<00:00:43.769> which<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.070> incredibly

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
second thing which is incredibly

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:59.510 
second thing which is incredibly
incredibly<00:00:45.269> warm<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.989> gentle

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.590 

people<00:01:00.520> think<00:01:00.700> of<00:01:00.790> made<00:01:00.970> of<00:01:01.059> its<00:01:01.180> early<00:01:01.420> pieces

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
people think of made of its early pieces

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.100 
people think of made of its early pieces
as<00:01:01.840> being<00:01:03.150> less<00:01:04.150> substantial<00:01:04.390> in<00:01:04.900> a<00:01:04.960> way<00:01:05.050> but

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
as being less substantial in a way but

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.870 
as being less substantial in a way but
but<00:01:05.590> I<00:01:05.770> actually<00:01:05.890> completely<00:01:06.340> disagree<00:01:06.729> with

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
but I actually completely disagree with

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.920 
but I actually completely disagree with
that<00:01:06.910> and<00:01:07.030> think<00:01:07.240> that<00:01:07.330> so<00:01:07.570> many<00:01:07.600> of<00:01:07.810> this

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
that and think that so many of this

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.870 
that and think that so many of this
slope<00:01:08.260> of<00:01:08.410> winds<00:01:08.680> have<00:01:09.490> this<00:01:09.670> sort<00:01:09.850> of

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
slope of winds have this sort of

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.510 
slope of winds have this sort of
metaphysical<00:01:10.860> dealing<00:01:11.860> with<00:01:11.979> the<00:01:12.130> universe

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
metaphysical dealing with the universe

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.770 
metaphysical dealing with the universe
quality<00:01:13.060> and<00:01:13.180> this<00:01:13.270> is<00:01:13.390> certainly<00:01:13.510> no

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
quality and this is certainly no

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.740 
quality and this is certainly no
exception<00:01:13.900> already<00:01:14.530> from<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:15.090> from<00:01:16.090> from<00:01:16.540> the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
exception already from the from from the

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.600 
exception already from the from from the
opening<00:01:17.110> theme<00:01:17.350> it<00:01:17.619> has<00:01:17.770> this<00:01:17.979> quality<00:01:18.250> of

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
opening theme it has this quality of

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.310 
opening theme it has this quality of
sort<00:01:19.270> of<00:01:19.330> imagining<00:01:19.990> a<00:01:20.610> more<00:01:21.610> perfect

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
sort of imagining a more perfect

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.630 
sort of imagining a more perfect
universe<00:01:23.320> I<00:01:23.649> guess<00:01:23.800> you<00:01:23.920> could<00:01:24.100> say<00:01:24.280> it<00:01:24.430> and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
universe I guess you could say it and

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.430 
universe I guess you could say it and
certainly<00:01:25.000> it<00:01:25.330> develops<00:01:25.780> more<00:01:26.050> and<00:01:26.200> more<00:01:26.350> in

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
certainly it develops more and more in

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.990 
certainly it develops more and more in
that<00:01:26.530> direction<00:01:26.590> until<00:01:27.220> in<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:27.399> end<00:01:27.490> versus

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
that direction until in the end versus

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.480 
that direction until in the end versus
extended<00:01:28.630> path<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:29.649> piano<00:01:29.979> alone<00:01:30.310> where

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
extended path to the piano alone where

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.940 
extended path to the piano alone where
it's<00:01:30.610> relief<00:01:30.910> it's<00:01:31.720> Beethoven<00:01:32.229> stopping<00:01:32.710> time

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
it's relief it's Beethoven stopping time

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.650 
it's relief it's Beethoven stopping time
obviously<00:01:33.729> he's<00:01:33.850> so<00:01:34.030> known<00:01:34.210> for<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:34.479> from

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
obviously he's so known for that from

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.960 
obviously he's so known for that from
the<00:01:34.750> late<00:01:34.899> pieces<00:01:35.289> but<00:01:35.440> that<00:01:35.619> qualities<00:01:36.550> it's

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
the late pieces but that qualities it's

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.480 
the late pieces but that qualities it's
all<00:01:37.210> there<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:38.110> it's<00:01:38.289> in<00:01:38.590> pieces<00:01:39.100> like<00:01:39.369> the

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
all there and it's in pieces like the

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.160 
all there and it's in pieces like the
Second<00:01:39.759> Piano<00:01:39.820> Concerto<00:01:40.060> already<00:01:40.509> it's<00:01:40.660> it's

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
Second Piano Concerto already it's it's

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.980 
Second Piano Concerto already it's it's
so<00:01:41.350> remarkable<00:01:41.890> it<00:01:42.039> really<00:01:42.610> it's<00:01:43.539> the<00:01:43.690> kind<00:01:43.840> of

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
so remarkable it really it's the kind of

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.570 
so remarkable it really it's the kind of
music<00:01:44.110> that<00:01:44.350> forces<00:01:44.770> you<00:01:44.860> to<00:01:44.950> lean<00:01:45.130> forward<00:01:45.220> in

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
music that forces you to lean forward in

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.880 
music that forces you to lean forward in
your<00:01:45.610> chair<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:45.940> and<00:01:46.270> not<00:01:47.229> breathe<00:01:47.619> until

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
your chair and and not breathe until

your chair and and not breathe until
it's<00:01:48.160> over

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.410 

and<00:02:03.980> then<00:02:04.460> afterwards<00:02:04.910> come<00:02:05.120> to<00:02:05.240> last

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
and then afterwards come to last

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.469 
and then afterwards come to last
movement<00:02:05.750> which<00:02:05.870> is<00:02:06.490> which<00:02:07.490> is<00:02:07.520> our<00:02:07.820> romp

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
movement which is which is our romp

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.940 
movement which is which is our romp
initially<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.350> only<00:02:09.470> way<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.649> can<00:02:09.800> describe

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
initially the only way you can describe

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.120 
initially the only way you can describe
it<00:02:10.369> it's<00:02:11.240> somehow<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.290> find<00:02:12.500> it<00:02:12.650> very<00:02:12.710> endearing

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
it it's somehow I find it very endearing

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.370 
it it's somehow I find it very endearing
that<00:02:13.430> that<00:02:13.760> someone<00:02:14.090> sophisticated<00:02:15.080> is<00:02:15.170> beta

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
that that someone sophisticated is beta
