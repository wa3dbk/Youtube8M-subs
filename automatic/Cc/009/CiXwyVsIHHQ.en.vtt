00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 well my name is Isabel and we are here 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.150
 I'm in a double condition in this 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.880
 conference on the one hand my status as 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.559
 my status as a young entrepreneur and for 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.710
 On the other hand, my status as secretary 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.930
 general of floridablanca that is a 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.410
 newly created association that 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.910
 defends liberal ideas in Spain 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.699
 mainly among young people and between 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.900
 the political class is a project that 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.539
 what is intended is through networks 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.270
 through social encounters' you to 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.610
 you ' make a defense of these ideas 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.070
 in a context in which we believe they are 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.010
 more necessary than ever on the other hand 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.110
 in my capacity as an entrepreneur I have had 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.870
 the opportunity in this forum of power 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.329
 talk about how you can do to 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.910
 improve entrepreneurship and have more 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.129
 entrepreneurs in spain so good the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.629
 mix of professional experience and 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.940
 conviction in liberal skills 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.489
 I think they have been enough I think that 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.230
 they were attractive to the audience and I 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.059
 I think there are two things in politics in 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.309
 As for liberal ideas, there are those 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.100
 Liberals define themselves for what they 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.470
 interest 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.549
 and what usually happens is that when it arrives 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.310
 the moment of truth and assume 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.400
 responsibilities cease to be liberal 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.810
 immediately and then there's still me 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.659
 I think there are still people convinced 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.060
 of those ideas but maybe you have believed 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.530
 that the battle will not be successful and they have 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.720
 stopped giving the battle for that 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.700
 us what we are trying from 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.649
 floridablanca is to reinforce the speech 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.430
 liberal make a pedagogy of those 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.750
 ideas and put pressure on those who 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.549
 have the opportunity to put them in 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.520
 practice that they recover that ideario 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.289
 that has proven to be an ideology 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.399
 tremendously beneficial for Spain 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.050
 love so that question 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.140
 because it is exactly what we are 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.030
 assumed I think there's a need for 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.490
 do pedagogy of what it means to be 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.640
 liberal who believes a liberal in that 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.350
 defend that in which we identify and 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.140
 in fact on our website there is a 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.149
 section that are small pills where 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.399
 what we define in two or three paragraphs 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.080
 what does each of the principles mean 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.549
 liberals and also certain principles 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.619
 conservatives that we consider 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.269
 important then so that a 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.510
 liberal or liberal believes mainly in 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.450
 freedom 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.900
 in people in life believe in the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.019
 effort in the meritocracy believes in a 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.879
 rule of law that guarantees full 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:27.150
 the full development of individuals 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.769
 believes in justice and believes above all and 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.379
 above all things in 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.030
 people we believe people have 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.140
 many more capabilities than we are 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.060
 they want to give this is an idea that I 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.040
 I repeat a lot, we have many people 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.349
 more capabilities than the states 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.180
 current on protectionist we 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.280
 want to give and we also believe that the 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.989
 people have to be responsible and 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.970
 we believe that a society in which 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.879
 values ​​as meritocracy effort 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.769
 freedom empire of the law equality of 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.720
 opportunities are some more societies 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.750
 prosperous than others in which you are 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.190
 words have less importance I 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.230
 I think that in crises there 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.440
 obviously shared responsibilities 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.150
 those who had more access to 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.829
 decisiveness well maybe 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.450
 can have a little more but from 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:11.609
 then the solution is not to slam the door and 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.400
 if saying does not end I do not want to know 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.560
 nothing, not me, I think that 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.960
 institutions are fundamental to 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.150
 power 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.190
 guarantee freedom and to be able to 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.840
 guarantee the free development of 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.420
 people and what we have to work 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.190
 is to return that credibility to the 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.750
 institutions in changing what there was 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.620
 what to change improve what you have to 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.450
 improve and in all assume the importance 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.830
 of having strong institutions and 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.740
 what happens we need to the best 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.440
 less stronger institutions as 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.090
 better there has been an excessive development 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.590
 of the institutions good all that is 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.740
 can argue because the institutions are 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.920
 super necessary an entrepreneur is a 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.570
 normal person who has an idea and who 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.250
 decided to take the risk to me the 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.440
 the key word is obviously the risk 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.540
 ambition has an ambition of 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.300
 thrive of achieving the objectives of 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.770
 generate personal wealth and those who give 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.230
 to those who are part of that project 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.850
 well, a person who understands that 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.850
 life and that assume responsibilities and 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.710
 accept the risks but obviously as 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.170
 I said in the talk 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:18.580
 there are good bad and regular businessmen 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.770
 and there is not a single type that would define 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.920
 to entrepreneurs what I do believe that the 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.900
 discredit of entrepreneurship partly 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.730
 will be part of the entrepreneurs will be 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.980
 our from the small medium and large 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.110
 businessman but I think that also and this 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.710
 I have also said in the talk in the 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.180
 media and in society 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.730
 that we live there seems to be an empire 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.590
 moral of the left the ideas of 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.960
 the left seems to be better than 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.880
 others and there has been a slow process in the 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.680
 which had to discredit everything 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.320
 that comes from liberalism capitalism 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.300
 and we have been clumsy in defending the 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.190
 concepts we have not known how to do but 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.160
 you can regain the credit by 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.800
 Of course I do not know if you can date but 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.870
 Today is a Thursday before a bridge 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.230
 three days and the room is absolutely 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.830
 full of young people what is 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.530
 spectacular and I was surprised 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.820
 for good all the initiatives are 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.210
 super necessary all initiatives 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.010
 to make pedagogy of ideas in the 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.110
 that one believes in this case the ideas 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:21.700
 Liberals are fundamental 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.140
 the websites meetings we all have a 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.330
 partner with whom to have a coffee 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.500
 we all have a friend to convince 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.610
 in the bar that is to say is a 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.250
 responsibility of all those who 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.490
 we want with these ideas so that is 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.680
 very much very much to do is that 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.120
 start and we of course the fresh 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.640
 from floridablanca what we have tried 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.920
 to be one plus one more among so many that 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.880
 they are doing such good things from the 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.880
 defense of these ideas
