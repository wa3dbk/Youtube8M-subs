this<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.760> super<00:01:03.449> easy<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:04.019> probably<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
this is super easy it's probably the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.160 
this is super easy it's probably the
easiest<00:01:05.010> method<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.729> around<00:01:06.180> because<00:01:06.479> it

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
easiest method that is around because it

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.940 
easiest method that is around because it
requires<00:01:07.799> such<00:01:08.610> little<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.630> few<00:01:09.990> steps<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.680> do

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
requires such little and few steps to do

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.340 
requires such little and few steps to do
this<00:01:11.100> method<00:01:11.580> now<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.270> method<00:01:12.689> once<00:01:12.960> again

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
this method now this method once again

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.399 
this method now this method once again
will<00:01:13.560> work<00:01:13.740> for<00:01:14.130> almost<00:01:14.820> any<00:01:15.150> single<00:01:16.080> building

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
will work for almost any single building

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.039 
will work for almost any single building
there<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:17.460> doors<00:01:17.759> which<00:01:18.000> will<00:01:18.299> open<00:01:18.600> if

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
you do end up using that sort of mission

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.660 
you do end up using that sort of mission
if<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:22.020> know<00:01:22.259> any<00:01:22.380> buildings<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.070> let
