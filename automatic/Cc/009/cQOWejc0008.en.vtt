00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.400 
I went onto YouTube and had a look and
there<00:00:14.799> wasn't<00:00:15.190> really<00:00:15.580> good<00:00:16.289> information<00:00:17.289> I

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
there wasn't really good information I

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.529 
there wasn't really good information I
found<00:00:17.740> on<00:00:18.039> showing<00:00:18.550> people<00:00:18.910> just<00:00:19.090> that<00:00:19.270> what<00:00:19.510> I

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:19.539 
found on showing people just that what I

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.839 
found on showing people just that what I
found<00:00:19.869> is<00:00:20.019> the<00:00:20.080> best<00:00:20.109> ways<00:00:20.529> to<00:00:20.560> do<00:00:20.949> it

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:21.849 
found is the best ways to do it

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:25.019 
found is the best ways to do it
firstly<00:00:22.840> what<00:00:23.679> I<00:00:23.710> always<00:00:23.830> do<00:00:24.160> is<00:00:24.340> wind<00:00:24.640> up<00:00:24.849> the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
firstly what I always do is wind up the

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.109 
firstly what I always do is wind up the
lure<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.769> you've<00:00:26.920> got<00:00:27.099> about<00:00:27.369> one<00:00:27.609> foot<00:00:27.910> from

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
lure so you've got about one foot from

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.839 
lure so you've got about one foot from
the<00:00:28.210> tip<00:00:28.420> one<00:00:28.630> and<00:00:28.750> a<00:00:28.779> half<00:00:28.960> feet<00:00:29.230> so<00:00:30.220> when<00:00:30.730> I'm

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
the tip one and a half feet so when I'm

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.030 
the tip one and a half feet so when I'm
casting<00:00:31.150> I'd<00:00:31.449> usually<00:00:31.689> leave<00:00:32.020> about<00:00:32.349> probably

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
casting I'd usually leave about probably

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.350 
casting I'd usually leave about probably
bout<00:00:33.130> that<00:00:33.310> much<00:00:33.550> you<00:00:33.760> don't<00:00:33.940> want<00:00:33.970> it<00:00:34.120> up<00:00:34.180> too

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
bout that much you don't want it up too

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.590 
bout that much you don't want it up too
tight<00:00:34.690> and<00:00:34.930> you<00:00:35.410> don't<00:00:35.590> want<00:00:35.740> too<00:00:35.890> much<00:00:36.040> down

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
tight and you don't want too much down

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.170 
tight and you don't want too much down
what<00:00:37.600> you<00:00:37.720> then<00:00:37.900> do<00:00:38.170> is<00:00:38.440> turn<00:00:38.950> the<00:00:39.190> reel<00:00:39.430> so<00:00:40.060> the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
what you then do is turn the reel so the

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.240 
what you then do is turn the reel so the
actual<00:00:40.420> bail<00:00:40.750> arm<00:00:41.110> that's<00:00:41.680> where<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.010> roller

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
actual bail arm that's where the roller

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.300 
actual bail arm that's where the roller
is<00:00:42.520> is<00:00:42.730> sitting<00:00:43.060> right<00:00:43.090> on<00:00:43.330> the<00:00:43.510> very<00:00:43.750> top<00:00:44.310> now

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310 
is is sitting right on the very top now

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.620 
is is sitting right on the very top now
I'll<00:00:45.460> just<00:00:45.490> come<00:00:45.790> and<00:00:45.940> be<00:00:45.970> close<00:00:46.240> you<00:00:46.450> can<00:00:46.600> see

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
I'll just come and be close you can see

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.040 
I'll just come and be close you can see
that<00:00:47.640> if<00:00:48.640> I<00:00:49.120> know<00:00:49.180> if<00:00:49.330> you<00:00:49.420> can<00:00:49.540> see<00:00:49.720> that<00:00:49.930> well

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
that if I know if you can see that well

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.840 
that if I know if you can see that well
but<00:00:50.200> the<00:00:50.290> real<00:00:50.500> that<00:00:51.070> is<00:00:51.340> there<00:00:51.610> now<00:00:51.790> the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
but the real that is there now the

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.770 
but the real that is there now the
reason<00:00:52.300> I<00:00:52.390> do<00:00:52.540> that<00:00:52.660> is<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:54.340> then<00:00:54.760> grab<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:55.570> line

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
reason I do that is I then grab the line

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.720 
reason I do that is I then grab the line
like<00:00:56.080> that<00:00:56.110> now<00:00:56.530> a<00:00:56.740> lot<00:00:57.010> of<00:00:57.220> the<00:00:57.340> videos<00:00:57.550> I've

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
like that now a lot of the videos I've

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.940 
like that now a lot of the videos I've
seen<00:00:57.850> they<00:00:58.210> hold<00:00:58.510> it<00:00:58.660> up<00:00:58.780> here<00:00:59.020> the<00:00:59.740> whole

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
seen they hold it up here the whole

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.780 
seen they hold it up here the whole
object<00:01:00.370> of<00:01:00.460> this<00:01:00.610> is<00:01:00.670> if<00:01:01.270> you<00:01:01.780> are<00:01:02.310> this<00:01:03.310> finger

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
object of this is if you are this finger

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.289 
object of this is if you are this finger
should<00:01:03.970> be<00:01:04.110> straight<00:01:05.110> above<00:01:05.880> where<00:01:06.880> that<00:01:06.909> roll

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
should be straight above where that roll

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.349 
should be straight above where that roll
is<00:01:07.539> now<00:01:08.020> if<00:01:08.140> I<00:01:08.259> open<00:01:08.679> that<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:09.009> cast<00:01:09.280> that<00:01:10.030> can't

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:10.359 
is now if I open that to cast that can't

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:12.980 
is now if I open that to cast that can't
go<00:01:10.600> anywhere<00:01:11.049> and<00:01:11.350> keep<00:01:12.219> your<00:01:12.399> finger<00:01:12.759> off

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
go anywhere and keep your finger off

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.450 
go anywhere and keep your finger off
there<00:01:14.020> it's<00:01:14.350> money<00:01:14.710> because<00:01:15.009> when<00:01:15.189> you<00:01:15.310> do

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.219 
there it's money because when you do
release<00:01:15.820> it<00:01:16.000> this<00:01:16.420> will<00:01:16.630> give<00:01:16.810> me<00:01:16.960> a<00:01:16.990> lot<00:01:17.170> more

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
release it this will give me a lot more

I'll show you with that bail arm opens
the<00:01:21.789> line<00:01:21.969> can<00:01:22.119> normally<00:01:22.539> lock<00:01:22.749> I<00:01:22.929> can<00:01:23.409> do<00:01:23.530> that

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
the line can normally lock I can do that

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.770

sitting off there I'm in total control

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:31.169 
sitting off there I'm in total control
of<00:01:28.060> it<00:01:28.359> then<00:01:29.109> all<00:01:29.350> you<00:01:29.619> do<00:01:29.890> I<00:01:30.130> usually<00:01:30.850> turn<00:01:31.119> a

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
of it then all you do I usually turn a

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:32.609 
of it then all you do I usually turn a
little<00:01:31.450> bit<00:01:31.630> sideways<00:01:31.960> you<00:01:32.350> have<00:01:32.439> your

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
little bit sideways you have your

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.160 
little bit sideways you have your
comfortable<00:01:33.539> but<00:01:34.539> you're<00:01:34.899> literally

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
comfortable but you're literally

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.529 
comfortable but you're literally
throwing<00:01:35.560> it<00:01:35.770> out<00:01:35.920> and<00:01:36.159> then<00:01:36.609> you<00:01:36.850> just<00:01:37.030> let

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
throwing it out and then you just let

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.510 
throwing it out and then you just let
that<00:01:37.780> finger<00:01:38.200> off<00:01:38.319> if<00:01:38.770> that<00:01:38.829> finger<00:01:39.399> is<00:01:39.490> right

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
that finger off if that finger is right

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.730 
that finger off if that finger is right
up<00:01:39.880> here<00:01:40.090> it's<00:01:40.359> harder<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:40.960> control<00:01:41.109> it<00:01:41.590> it's

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
up here it's harder to control it it's

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.800 
up here it's harder to control it it's
really<00:01:41.859> a<00:01:41.950> trigger<00:01:42.280> finger<00:01:42.700> and<00:01:42.819> as<00:01:43.600> long<00:01:43.780> as

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
really a trigger finger and as long as

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.450 
really a trigger finger and as long as
you've<00:01:44.049> got<00:01:44.109> it<00:01:44.319> straight<00:01:44.770> above<00:01:45.039> that<00:01:45.159> reel

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
you've got it straight above that reel

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.249 
you've got it straight above that reel
there's<00:01:46.030> no<00:01:46.240> way<00:01:46.389> that<00:01:46.509> can<00:01:46.659> come<00:01:46.869> off<00:01:46.990> I<00:01:47.109> can

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259
