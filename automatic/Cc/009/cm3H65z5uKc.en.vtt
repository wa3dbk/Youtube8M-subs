00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.240 

maybe<00:00:50.350> I'll<00:00:50.469> just<00:00:50.649> read<00:00:52.559> yeah<00:00:53.559> don't<00:00:53.920> losing

going<00:00:54.430> on<00:00:54.550> here<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:56.260> hopefully<00:00:56.530> it<00:00:56.980> that

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
going on here so hopefully it that

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.470 
going on here so hopefully it that
infants<00:00:57.550> less<00:00:57.879> the<00:00:58.090> time<00:00:59.250> and<00:01:00.250> victory<00:01:01.059> is<00:01:01.239> I

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
infants less the time and victory is I

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:27.530 
infants less the time and victory is I
do<00:01:10.770> okay

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.300 

now<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:28.320> probably<00:01:28.590> linking<00:01:28.950> back<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
now it's probably linking back to the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:39.610 
now it's probably linking back to the
worker<00:01:30.710> well<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.830> gonna<00:01:32.190> end
