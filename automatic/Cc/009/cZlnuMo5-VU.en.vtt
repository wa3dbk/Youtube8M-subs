00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.680
 i 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.440
 ah 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.630
 hello spartan I'm a disc and it's a 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.760
 departure in swat and what I wanted them 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.480
 talk is about a very subject 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.240
 interesting which would be the 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.230
 blue light of playstation 4 death 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:35.739
 and its symptoms well first we started 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:39.220
 for clarifying something the play 4 came out 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:42.610
 a few days in the USA but it will come to our 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.600
 country that is mexico and also to euro to 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.390
 Europe 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:53.210
 the 29th of this month to the 22nd of November 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:58.129
 but they have already been presenting 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:01.729
 what some have called the blue light of 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:05.780
 the death which would come hinting 

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:08.420
 to what was known as the ring 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.710
 red of death or the three red lights 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:16.600
 that affected the launch a few years ago 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.600
 of the xbox 360 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:24.820
 what is the blue light of death 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.620
 well your symptoms are the following 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.040
 could be our four more than anything 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.610
 is that the indicator is understood in color 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.060
 blue intermittently is not output from 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.450
 audio or video the attribution the console 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.580
 it turns off after the blue blink and what 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.160
 last if after you understand your 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.940
 console the brightness does not lose the color 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:54.500
 blue and does not return white well they will be 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:58.100
 counting and why it may be due 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.860
 let's say the disease well with the 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.070
 possible causes would be the compatibility 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.010
 with your television this is in case 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.590
 your screen is very new but you can 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.500
 update faults with the Internet 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.840
 electric current support you can 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.970
 force shutdown disconnect the cable 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.000
 current until we were surprised 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.920
 the indicator or spoke of its voltage 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.620
 problem 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.200
 with the hard drive and problems with another 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.030
 Hardware component 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.900
 this would basically what 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.360
 would cause it to have said are and to 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.830
 respect 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:43.360
 for they are and this is not something new since 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:47.020
 they expected between 0.4 percent 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.410
 that your consoles will fail as they have 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:53.020
 mentioned are and have been sold in the 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.130
 first day or as they went more than one 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:00.280
 million consoles so to be a 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:04.890
 perspective is that the equivalent to 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.360
 that would be around 1 250 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.720
 conventions with more than one million 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.800
 Playstation 4 systems sold 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.500
 calculates that about 4 thousand systems are 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.140
 those who would have the faults 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.010
 although that is a small number in 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.740
 comparison with the 996,000 against 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.230
 that are working correctly but 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.510
 it is little consolation for those affected 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.970
 they have to send their floor to papers 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.500
 of 400 dollars back are and 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.030
 all right 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.569
 Another important point is what 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.170
 for example in amazon 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:51.650
 positive grades there are also 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.350
 many many negatives and negatives 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.140
 greet this problem 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:00.170
 what he is doing is and is obviously 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.330
 replace the consoles but I finish 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:06.710
 offers a series of steps that is in a 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.860
 technical support guide to try 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.630
 fix it 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.240
 but no 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:17.010
 you hope you buy a new console 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.620
 so that you failing 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.450
 but that is already everyone's decision if 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.750
 they risk now to buy it not 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.840
 although as I am saying this is very 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.190
 limited and although they are and estimated that 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:34.620
 out of 0.4 percent the errors 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:38.520
 now it is estimated that those who 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.840
 they complain they would come but about 1% and 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.600
 still do not know 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.350
 the remaining percentage in how much time 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.170
 the console will be decomposed 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.220
 it could definitely become a problem 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.010
 more serious 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.800
 but as so far many 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.870
 owners have made their shares of 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.990
 games of two hours in a row has not been 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:07.020
 decomposed nothing as it is unlikely 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:10.740
 it happens so it's part 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:14.280
 a few days of leaving elected let's hope 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:16.020
 that nothing similar arises that in the 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.330
 personal opinion I do not think it is 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.530
 pretty well designed that's why it's very 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:25.470
 very large other many fans 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.629
 a lot of everything so I want to see 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:32.540
 your comments and your position as a first 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:36.910
 play and now I did not know 5 the same 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.910
 they will save they will wait a while 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.760
 that would be all is portas I invite you to 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.500
 that they are going to see my page of this my 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.550
 mexico is in the instruction of the video 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.830
 also my facebook page of this 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.490
 There is also the page of 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.490
 facebook of 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:59.380
 of what would come from this Mexico 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.380
 and until the next video spartans
