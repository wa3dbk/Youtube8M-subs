goal<00:02:23.540> is<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:25.280> cure<00:02:25.430> cancer<00:02:25.700> she<00:02:26.510> was<00:02:27.290> able<00:02:27.410> to

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
goal is to cure cancer she was able to

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.160 
goal is to cure cancer she was able to
isolate<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:28.340> specific<00:02:29.000> protein<00:02:29.780> that<00:02:30.080> was

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
isolate a specific protein that was

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.360 
isolate a specific protein that was
related<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.650> cancer<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:33.709> that<00:02:33.920> has<00:02:34.099> led<00:02:34.310> to

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
related to cancer and that has led to

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.420 
related to cancer and that has led to
more<00:02:34.790> valuable<00:02:35.390> research<00:02:35.810> in<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.440> lab<00:02:36.620> she

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
more valuable research in the lab she

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.729 
more valuable research in the lab she
used<00:02:37.610> that<00:02:37.730> work<00:02:38.000> also<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.420> get<00:02:39.319> an<00:02:39.410> internship

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
used that work also to get an internship

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.100 
used that work also to get an internship
at<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.010> u.s.<00:02:40.370> cancer<00:02:40.880> Research<00:02:41.569> Center<00:02:41.840> and

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
at the u.s. cancer Research Center and

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.070 
at the u.s. cancer Research Center and
so<00:02:42.799> she's<00:02:43.010> really<00:02:43.430> geared<00:02:43.670> up<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.959> looking<00:02:44.959> at

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
so she's really geared up to looking at

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.690 
so she's really geared up to looking at
cancer<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.590> maybe<00:02:45.739> finding<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.459> cure<00:02:46.610> for

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
cancer and maybe finding a cure for
