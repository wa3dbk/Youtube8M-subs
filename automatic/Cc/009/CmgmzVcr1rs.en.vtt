much<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.780> talk<00:03:17.080> about<00:03:17.140> security<00:03:18.130> custody

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.750 
except now i think the above ground
level<00:03:20.230> thing<00:03:20.590> is<00:03:20.680> inaccurate<00:03:21.190> returning<00:03:21.670> to

level thing is inaccurate returning to

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.210 
level thing is inaccurate returning to
