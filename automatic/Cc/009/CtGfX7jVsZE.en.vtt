00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.579
 I do not know if it's the definitive name or 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.170
 if I'm going to give another name would see 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.090
 well in the title so playe flour 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.650
 so played to win in french and dude 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.510
 so what is it 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.940
 it simply is to actually 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.230
 make a national team so there like 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.520
 you 'll see I'll start with the 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.660
 group ares by spain because 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.440
 it's the players I have most in 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.840
 in the club 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.890
 so here is so just play with 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.300
 a national team so I'm going 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.410
 start with spain and try 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.399
 to go as far as possible to 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.370
 win the world cup 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.629
 and when I lose a match all 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.430
 simply i'm going to have to change 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.079
 the national team and so on 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.439
 to be able to test all teams 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:12.549
 of the game for example then you go to me 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.780
 propose another team in the 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.249
 comments I would take the one that will have 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.659
 the most of like and I will also take 

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:17.920
 the one I can do simply 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.630
 because I will continue Easter and 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.549
 to have a maximum of doing the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.959
 maximum number of players in my club and for 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.159
 have all the players to be able to 

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:25.659
 do with all teams 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.159
 so I hope you'll like it 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.719
 it's a bit it changes a little bit 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.709
 will allow to test all players 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.450
 on foot world cup 

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:33.009
 So we will start with Spain 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.659
 because I have the righteous and that's 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.630
 the team where I have the most players so 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.969
 the series is here is either we win or 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.229
 we change equipped to cut the 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.119
 world to try to go well 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.079
 obviously win the title of 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.270
 world champion 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.679
 So here we start with Spain 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.429
 so if now I lose directly 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:49.950
 the next match 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:52.240
 I'll have to change a team 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.549
 so instituted I think you'll have 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.899
 understood the series is simple I hope that 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.919
 it will please you because here I have 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.240
 tried to find something because 

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:59.919
 that I did not want to do a simple right 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.329
 that world cup because nadja a lot 

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:02.409
 who do it if I had only done 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.039
 a team and that's it I should have won 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.439
 world Cup 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.689
 that would have been a little too much 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.240
 classic too stiff not too much at the patro 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.160
 original 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.020
 and then I thought we're going 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.030
 test all the teams of the game so 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.780
 either we win we continue his father on 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.430
 change of equipped 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.050
 so let's get together guys 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.250
 as soon as we have our first opponent I 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.570
 just want to introduce the town team done 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.210
 so I took the players I had 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.990
 victor valdés azpilicueta ramos nihab at 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.260
 martinez 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.000
 jordi alba sergio busquets iniesta santi 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.070
 cazorla rhinos nava tigo costa david 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.490
 villa on the bench of a fabregas martinez 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.500
 reina isco soldado torres cute alberto 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.850
 moreno so it's gone guys we get 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.990
 find as soon as we have an opponent 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.610
 so here we found an opponent 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.080
 for the first match of this new 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.060
 series which I hope will please you 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.290
 finally pasqua there is sure future world 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.490
 cup I think you'll like it we're going 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.970
 go around the world with a 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.380
 team 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.700
 and then of course I have not 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.470
 specified but it's still in the field 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.600
 group phases to qualify 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.770
 for the qualifying rounds 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.920
 no to falling against a team 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:02.900
 European sailing with nab to olic en 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.760
 tip it's not me so here it is 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.830
 just win guys it's a 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.690
 principle of the series since once 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.000
 we went around the world at the qpc 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.810
 who I think the series will be 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.090
 will maybe stop talent will stop 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.650
 before I do not know we'll see maybe 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.100
 will stop after if we can find 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.140
 a 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:23.540
 an alternative for the future we will see 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:26.900
 well the guys there are intercepted for 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.580
 costa diego costa is it is 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.350
 opening the scoring first goal of 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.450
 diego costa in this series that makes 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.280
 pleasure in us of this body we are well 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.260
 so guys I also want to clarify 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.520
 that if now for example I'm going 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.780
 until the final and I win the 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.490
 final with the team of Spain 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.780
 I will not start a layer I 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.400
 still change a team into a 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.760
 time I won 6 judge that if 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.350
 I win if I do not win a match before 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.700
 to win shot before winning the cup 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.230
 I do not necessarily have coaching with this 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.090
 team but I'm going to change equipped 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.550
 just the low cost still has we going 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.460
 attempt the strike or the guard went well 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.870
 thrown out his good of course it's okay 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.440
 to force me a little easter and because 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.370
 or the niche or gorgeous strike 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.660
 beautiful against the calm at this 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.890
 is not necessary because I can 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.440
 also do it but the michel strikes 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.240
 hebert frankly guardian and it 's 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.860
 the victor victor valdés but here it is 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.120
 so I do not have casias yet 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.669
 I would have put 20 including but the typing 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.790
 is very very powerful the hip beats 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:25.180
 hop or sergio busquets you follow being 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:27.260
 calm is alas goal comes to play the 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.740
 attention attention and juan innovations 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.229
 mata who by the guys outside where that 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.640

 the airy balls zuma ross europe 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.600
 Europe or finesse that makes 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.120
 pleasure 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.620
 we come back three of these cases that's good 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.880
 by iniesta again it is played it 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.850
 iniesta the strike 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:56.690
 he got out his exits you do not go on 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.430
 will see from corner the styles are charge 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.080
 was going well shot well for a 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.700
 word is the equalization well play the 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.530
 guys hasna me very very long on 13 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.900

 sego the assault 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.180
 exit but traps were too 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.650
 powerful we take the advantage ah yes 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.070
 ok I throw up that there is no 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.720

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.620
 pti for david villa it's played well 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.760

 costa it hurts 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:49.900
 5 to 3 beats outside it will hurt 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.270
 it's the same before it's played well 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.000

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.400
 that you turn around you got back you 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:04.720
 will you cross there is still time 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.640

 the first victory and wins and that 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.430
 is a pleasure so frankly it would have 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:26.350
 been a sacred match anyway in gold 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:29.650
 welcome was conducted 3 1 3 1 that says 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.390

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.970
 will have pleased unfortunately the guys I 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.560
 I'm going to apologize because there will be 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:37.360
 only one match in this video 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.760
 it's because here I had my oral 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.530
 of bach and so I have no time to 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.640
 do more games because here I am 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.130
 think you understand that it takes me 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.210
 time but exams after those who 

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.650

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.200

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.610
 it will have pleased you this series g was 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.290

 deal only a big asset world 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.370
 cup and win only the court
