00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.309
 hello welcome to our model theme 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.820
 of the cerebral hemispheres the 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.339
 left and right hemispheres dominate 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.640
 functions and processes as well as the 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:20.390
 coordination of a part of the body the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.390
 left hemisphere 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:29.140
 specializes in abstraction 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:33.570
 is able to recognize symbols and signs 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.570
 therefore dominates the language 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.700
 It is logical 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.380
 mathematical 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.150
 It requires accuracy 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.190
 it is also 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.120
 analytical 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.710
 and progresses by steps then this 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.030
 hemisphere is characterized by being 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:05.230
 rational the right hemisphere recognizes 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.230
 space 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.920
 is able to identify dimensions 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:17.830
 distances and is integrator recognizes the 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.830
 everything has great capacity for synthesis 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.899
 knows how to join the parties and give them a 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:28.680
 sense and a form regarding the body 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:31.430
 the left hemisphere dominates 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.430
 the right part 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:42.299
 instead the right hemisphere 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.670
 the left part that's why you understand 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.970
 which are coordinated in various 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.710
 aspects in both internal processes and 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.710
 in external processes 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.760
 if the person has developed the 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.270
 ability to use processes from a 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.270
 part of the brain that is reflected in the 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.550
 thought and action who dominates the 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.550
 left hemisphere is analytical 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.390
 and who dominates the right hemisphere 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.390
 usually creative 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.180
 and the reason 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:33.510
 to one or the other hemisphere we specialist 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.460
 functions processes activities 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.319
 skills how to communicate and 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.590
 interact with him 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.930
 receive and organize the information that 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.090
 comes from abroad 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.849
 how is it easier to learn 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:54.200
 what are your processes skills and 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:55.670
 skills identify and apply 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:02.079
 I invite you to share and see others 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:02.079
