he takes it other five oceans little

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.010 
he takes it other five oceans little
tight<00:01:50.340> taking<00:01:50.580> animation<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.119> funny<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.599> for

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
tight taking animation is funny and for

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.380 
tight taking animation is funny and for
whatever<00:01:52.229> reason<00:01:52.470> this<00:01:53.160> person<00:01:53.670> has<00:01:53.940> poison

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
whatever reason this person has poison

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.139 
whatever reason this person has poison
powder<00:01:54.569> rather<00:01:55.020> than<00:01:55.259> toxic<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.130> mean<00:01:56.700> toxics

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
powder rather than toxic I mean toxics

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.359 
powder rather than toxic I mean toxics
more<00:01:57.390> accurate<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.200> does<00:01:58.380> more<00:01:58.709> poison

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
more accurate and it does more poison

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.029 
more accurate and it does more poison
damage<00:01:59.520> but<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.300> don't<00:02:00.539> get<00:02:01.349> why<00:02:01.800> you<00:02:01.860> would

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
damage but I don't get why you would

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.710 
damage but I don't get why you would
have<00:02:02.190> poison<00:02:02.580> powder<00:02:02.729> but<00:02:03.179> I<00:02:03.330> guess<00:02:03.509> that's

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
have poison powder but I guess that's

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.419 
have poison powder but I guess that's
just<00:02:03.780> as<00:02:03.959> personal<00:02:04.349> preference<00:02:04.830> I<00:02:05.069> don't<00:02:05.310> know

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429
