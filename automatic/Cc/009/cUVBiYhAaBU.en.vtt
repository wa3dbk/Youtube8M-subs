00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
few bases out there that can be dead

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.720 
few bases out there that can be dead
straight<00:00:15.690> but<00:00:16.230> generally<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:17.220> they<00:00:17.460> play<00:00:17.699> a

or<00:00:19.470> relief<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.949> them<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.970> what<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.180> like<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.510> do

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
or relief in them so what I like to do

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.070 
or relief in them so what I like to do
is<00:00:22.970> take<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.029> straight<00:00:24.300> edge<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.630> put<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.869> on

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
is take a straight edge and put it on

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.830 
is take a straight edge and put it on
the<00:00:25.260> neck<00:00:25.470> itself<00:00:26.150> and<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.449> want<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.660> look<00:00:27.750> at

the<00:00:27.930> gap<00:00:28.170> between<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.400> straight<00:00:29.670> edge<00:00:29.880> and

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the gap between the straight edge and

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.520 
the gap between the straight edge and
the<00:00:30.779> base<00:00:30.960> neck<00:00:31.230> or<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.529> frets<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:33.290> this<00:00:34.290> neck

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the base neck or the frets so this neck

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.780 
the base neck or the frets so this neck
has<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> little<00:00:35.010> more<00:00:35.130> relief<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.550> than<00:00:35.700> you

nice flat head screwdriver a big one and
tighten<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.570> up<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.689> little<00:01:30.930> bit<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.380> want

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
tighten it up a little bit and you want

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.640 
tighten it up a little bit and you want
to<00:01:31.590> go<00:01:32.270> unless<00:01:33.270> it's<00:01:33.570> really<00:01:33.930> loose<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.320> quarter

turn<00:01:34.799> at<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.040> time

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.410 

and<00:01:48.750> then<00:01:48.899> tighten<00:01:49.289> it<00:01:49.320> back<00:01:49.500> up<00:01:53.149> you<00:01:54.149> can<00:01:54.299> only

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
and then tighten it back up you can only

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.510 
and then tighten it back up you can only
tell<00:01:54.689> what<00:01:55.319> the<00:01:55.439> neck<00:01:55.590> relief<00:01:55.859> is<00:01:56.159> when<00:01:56.399> it's

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
tell what the neck relief is when it's

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.580 
tell what the neck relief is when it's
tuned<00:01:56.700> at<00:01:56.819> the<00:01:56.909> pitch<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.390> every<00:01:57.719> time<00:01:57.929> you

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
tuned at the pitch so every time you

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.039 
tuned at the pitch so every time you
make<00:01:58.770> an<00:01:58.920> adjustment<00:01:59.240> you're<00:02:00.240> more<00:02:00.840> likely

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
make an adjustment you're more likely

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.260 
make an adjustment you're more likely
going<00:02:01.289> to<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270

going to have the
guitar<00:02:03.270> detuned<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.869> need<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.049> tune<00:02:04.229> it

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
guitar detuned so you need to tune it

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.709 
guitar detuned so you need to tune it
back<00:02:04.439> up<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.740> see<00:02:04.890> what<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.100> just<00:02:05.130> did<00:02:05.719> some
