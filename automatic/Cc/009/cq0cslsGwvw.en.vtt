to the game as we can be we're going to
try<00:00:47.360> to<00:00:47.390> hit<00:00:47.629> that<00:00:47.830> one<00:00:48.830> of<00:00:48.949> the<00:00:49.010> difficult

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.329 
try to hit that one of the difficult
things<00:00:49.489> is<00:00:49.940> as<00:00:50.420> artists<00:00:51.170> we<00:00:51.199> can't<00:00:51.650> take<00:00:51.979> what

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
things is as artists we can't take what

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:53.829 
things is as artists we can't take what
happens<00:00:52.699> in<00:00:52.820> the<00:00:52.909> game<00:00:53.089> and<00:00:53.239> interpret<00:00:53.750> it

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
happens in the game and interpret it

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.320 
happens in the game and interpret it
completely<00:00:54.409> literally<00:00:54.920> Garren's<00:00:55.879> a<00:00:55.970> perfect

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
completely literally Garren's a perfect

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.180 
completely literally Garren's a perfect
example<00:00:56.390> if<00:00:56.839> Guerin<00:00:57.170> was<00:00:57.320> just<00:00:57.650> spinning

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
example if Guerin was just spinning

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.759 
example if Guerin was just spinning
around<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:58.939> CG<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.629> whole<00:00:59.809> time<00:01:00.049> we<00:01:00.619> would

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
around the CG the whole time we would

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.490 
around the CG the whole time we would
have<00:01:00.979> what<00:01:01.400> feels<00:01:01.640> like<00:01:01.760> a<00:01:01.879> cartoon<00:01:02.470> we<00:01:03.470> saw

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
have what feels like a cartoon we saw

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.410 
have what feels like a cartoon we saw
the<00:01:03.769> cut<00:01:04.280> of<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:04.430> guarantee<00:01:04.850> and<00:01:04.939> it<00:01:05.030> didn't

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
the cut of the guarantee and it didn't

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.750 
the cut of the guarantee and it didn't
have<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.990> spin<00:01:06.290> Garen<00:01:06.979> is<00:01:07.070> not<00:01:07.250> Guerin

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
have the spin Garen is not Guerin

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.820 
have the spin Garen is not Guerin
there's<00:01:08.360> no<00:01:08.540> spin<00:01:08.900> so<00:01:09.080> how<00:01:09.260> can<00:01:09.320> we<00:01:09.619> make<00:01:09.770> a

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
there's no spin so how can we make a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.440 
there's no spin so how can we make a
spin<00:01:10.220> it's<00:01:10.520> not<00:01:10.670> like<00:01:10.850> a<00:01:10.880> literal

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
spin it's not like a literal

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.630 
spin it's not like a literal
interpretation<00:01:12.259> and<00:01:12.470> then<00:01:12.830> Brad<00:01:13.100> got<00:01:13.280> up<00:01:13.460> and

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
interpretation and then Brad got up and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.969 
interpretation and then Brad got up and
he<00:01:13.700> did<00:01:13.850> his<00:01:13.939> thing<00:01:14.119> and<00:01:14.390> I<00:01:14.810> stood<00:01:15.560> up<00:01:15.619> and<00:01:15.920> I

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
he did his thing and I stood up and I

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.230 
he did his thing and I stood up and I
was<00:01:16.070> like<00:01:16.159> it<00:01:16.400> could<00:01:16.520> look<00:01:16.640> like<00:01:16.700> this<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.180> I

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
was like it could look like this and I

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.120

he's just screaming yes yes yes and that

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.470 
he's just screaming yes yes yes and that
was<00:01:25.010> it<00:01:25.040> I<00:01:25.220> was<00:01:25.340> like<00:01:25.400> the<00:01:25.610> birth<00:01:25.760> of<00:01:25.910> it<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:26.420> i

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
was it I was like the birth of it so i

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.570 
was it I was like the birth of it so i
sat<00:01:26.780> down<00:01:26.990> i<00:01:27.050> started<00:01:27.560> gesture<00:01:27.920> drawing<00:01:28.160> over

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
sat down i started gesture drawing over

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.730 
sat down i started gesture drawing over
the<00:01:28.670> actual<00:01:29.060> animation<00:01:29.390> itself<00:01:29.630> there<00:01:30.560> was<00:01:30.710> a

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
the actual animation itself there was a

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.850 
the actual animation itself there was a
lot<00:01:31.040> of<00:01:31.100> back<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:31.640> forth<00:01:31.940> on<00:01:32.480> getting<00:01:33.380> that<00:01:33.530> to

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
lot of back and forth on getting that to

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.720 
lot of back and forth on getting that to
look<00:01:34.100> really<00:01:34.940> authentic<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:36.620> Garen<00:01:37.100> but<00:01:37.490> in<00:01:37.640> a

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
look really authentic to Garen but in a

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.720 
look really authentic to Garen but in a
new<00:01:37.880> way<00:01:38.090> it<00:01:38.810> was<00:01:39.080> a<00:01:39.110> nod<00:01:39.500> to<00:01:39.950> what<00:01:40.250> happens<00:01:40.640> in

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
new way it was a nod to what happens in

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.149 
new way it was a nod to what happens in
the<00:01:40.850> game<00:01:41.060> but<00:01:41.540> completely<00:01:42.200> appropriate<00:01:42.680> to

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
the game but completely appropriate to

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.450 
the game but completely appropriate to
the<00:01:43.250> CG<00:01:43.610> another<00:01:44.450> example<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:45.080> TF<00:01:45.620> moving<00:01:46.340> in

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
the CG another example is TF moving in

the CG another example is TF moving in
on<00:01:46.580> fiddle<00:01:46.820> he's<00:01:47.420> going<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.720> initiate<00:01:48.050> that

opportunity to keep it authentic

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.850 
opportunity to keep it authentic

worth doing why not motion capture if

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.650 
worth doing why not motion capture if
we're<00:01:56.160> trying<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.400> sell<00:01:56.550> real<00:01:56.970> realistic<00:01:57.390> or
