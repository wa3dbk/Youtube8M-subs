00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.340
 original karman that go in the 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.559

 lateral americas in yellow and back 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.340

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.539
 sky 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.580

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:25.210
 third light 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.210
 I piss off black as they call 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.360
 while in the back 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.569
 because inside you can 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.569
 put on the gloves 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:48.869

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.340
 conditioned and can withstand the heat 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.340
