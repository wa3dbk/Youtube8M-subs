00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.950
 mattersburg eberhard in 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:13.440
 that's a corvette anyway 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:22.100
 Juve has the swiss rwt racing 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:24.210
 team corvette z06 equal to the 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.119
 heavy barriers over the over the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.480
 have told them before these four 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.400
 tons of heavy things shifted something 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:39.829
 That was a heavy blow to the car 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.829
 I lost even say well 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.680
 yes, of course, it's time for another race break 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:57.320
 safetycar speak it is in the parc fermÃ© 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.320
 yes, there had to be one 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.850
 the building has 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.130
 because everyone was such a small one 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.820
 small corner here in the barriers atrix 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.930
 have moved there then too 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.479
 other forces or higher 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.060
 speeds but that looks 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.090
 after battlefield and that could 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.880
 to pull oneself 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.210
 that's why more is quite possible that 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.920
 that does not continue here 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.890
 because that could really be longer 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.890
 take until the vehicle is recovered 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.039
 Rule provides that aborted 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.539
 can be 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.850
 there are not two in the case yet 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:00.270
 thirds drove the distance or three 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.270
 quarter
