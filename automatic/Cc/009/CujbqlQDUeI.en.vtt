00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hi this is yolanda vanveen and in this

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.039 
hi this is yolanda vanveen and in this
segment<00:00:02.850> we're<00:00:03.149> going<00:00:03.240> to<00:00:03.300> talk<00:00:03.419> about<00:00:03.750> how<00:00:03.990> to

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
segment we're going to talk about how to

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.210 
segment we're going to talk about how to
grow<00:00:04.290> orchids

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
grow orchids

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.490 
grow orchids
now<00:00:05.759> orchids<00:00:06.330> are<00:00:06.480> such<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:07.049> beautiful

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
now orchids are such a beautiful

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.680 
now orchids are such a beautiful
household<00:00:08.309> plant<00:00:08.580> if<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:08.940> live<00:00:09.120> in<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.420> cold

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
household plant if you live in a cold

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.600 
household plant if you live in a cold
climate<00:00:09.870> or<00:00:10.410> you<00:00:10.679> can<00:00:10.830> grow<00:00:10.980> them<00:00:11.040> outside<00:00:11.460> if

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
climate or you can grow them outside if

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.850 
climate or you can grow them outside if
you<00:00:11.730> live<00:00:11.910> in<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.120> warm<00:00:12.360> climate<00:00:12.420> but<00:00:13.380> before<00:00:13.830> I

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
you live in a warm climate but before I

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.400 
you live in a warm climate but before I
even<00:00:14.160> think<00:00:14.820> about<00:00:15.150> growing<00:00:15.450> them<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.960> like<00:00:16.230> to

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
even think about growing them I like to

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.500 
even think about growing them I like to
consider<00:00:16.590> their<00:00:17.070> natural<00:00:17.580> conditions

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
consider their natural conditions

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.800 
consider their natural conditions
now<00:00:19.020> orcas<00:00:19.500> generally<00:00:20.039> grow<00:00:20.369> either<00:00:21.000> in<00:00:21.420> trees

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
now orcas generally grow either in trees

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.160 
now orcas generally grow either in trees
out<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.289> bark<00:00:22.859> or<00:00:23.220> they<00:00:23.880> grow<00:00:24.140> terrestrially

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
out of bark or they grow terrestrially

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.410 
out of bark or they grow terrestrially
which<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.650> on<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:25.949> ground<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.580> bark<00:00:27.000> as<00:00:27.180> well

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
which is on the ground in bark as well

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.410 
which is on the ground in bark as well
so<00:00:28.140> when<00:00:28.349> you're<00:00:28.500> growing<00:00:28.650> them<00:00:29.160> inside<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
so when you're growing them inside the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.049 
so when you're growing them inside the
best<00:00:30.890> material<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.160> can<00:00:32.340> use<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.820> moss

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
best material that you can use is moss

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.299 
best material that you can use is moss
and<00:00:33.390> bark<00:00:33.450> or<00:00:33.930> sticks<00:00:34.230> or<00:00:34.440> any<00:00:34.620> real<00:00:34.890> organic

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
and bark or sticks or any real organic

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.400 
and bark or sticks or any real organic
material<00:00:36.059> where<00:00:36.660> they<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:36.870> really<00:00:37.260> good

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
material where they have really good

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.850 
material where they have really good
drainage<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.219> lots<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.850> wood<00:00:39.329> based<00:00:39.870> material

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
drainage and lots of wood based material

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.400 
drainage and lots of wood based material
and<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.910> when<00:00:42.210> you're<00:00:42.329> growing<00:00:42.600> orchids<00:00:43.230> you

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
and so when you're growing orchids you

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.630 
and so when you're growing orchids you
can<00:00:43.590> grow<00:00:43.770> them<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:43.980> many<00:00:44.219> different<00:00:44.430> ways

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
can grow them in many different ways

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.160 
can grow them in many different ways
there's<00:00:45.000> so<00:00:45.239> many<00:00:45.360> different<00:00:45.750> types<00:00:45.960> of

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
there's so many different types of

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.440 
there's so many different types of
orchids<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:47.070> easiest<00:00:47.399> way<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.640> found<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.180> grow

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
orchids the easiest way I found to grow

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.959 
orchids the easiest way I found to grow
them<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.840> right<00:00:49.110> into<00:00:49.350> bark<00:00:49.860> or<00:00:50.430> pieces<00:00:50.760> of

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
them is right into bark or pieces of

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.600 
them is right into bark or pieces of
wood<00:00:51.300> these<00:00:51.539> are<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:51.960> pieces<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:53.039> wood<00:00:53.370> when

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
wood these are just pieces of wood when

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.430 
wood these are just pieces of wood when
we<00:00:53.730> cut<00:00:53.910> down<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.120> tree<00:00:54.360> we<00:00:54.629> had<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.989> shredded

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
we cut down a tree we had it shredded

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.490 
we cut down a tree we had it shredded
and<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.510> we're<00:00:57.510> just<00:00:57.539> using<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.170> shredded

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
and so we're just using that shredded

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.189 
and so we're just using that shredded
wood<00:00:58.829> underneath<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.820> they<00:01:00.270> make<00:01:00.480> roots<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
wood underneath and they make roots and

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.229 
wood underneath and they make roots and
the<00:01:01.350> roots<00:01:01.559> need<00:01:01.680> air<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:02.789> those<00:01:02.940> roots

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the roots need air so if those roots

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.350 
the roots need air so if those roots
don't<00:01:03.960> get<00:01:04.199> air<00:01:04.470> they<00:01:04.739> will<00:01:04.920> die<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.939> they<00:01:06.150> need

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
don't get air they will die so they need

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.510 
don't get air they will die so they need
really<00:01:06.750> good<00:01:06.780> drainage<00:01:07.320> really<00:01:07.710> good<00:01:08.070> earthy

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
really good drainage really good earthy

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.609 
really good drainage really good earthy
moss<00:01:08.909> works<00:01:09.330> great<00:01:09.840> people<00:01:10.290> have<00:01:10.439> used

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
moss works great people have used

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.800 
moss works great people have used
styrofoam<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.700> different<00:01:12.420> types<00:01:12.630> of

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
styrofoam and different types of

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.499 
styrofoam and different types of
material<00:01:13.290> that's<00:01:13.439> all<00:01:13.770> air<00:01:14.189> because<00:01:15.060> they<00:01:15.450> do

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
material that's all air because they do

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.450 
material that's all air because they do
grow<00:01:15.840> out<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.080> trees<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.770> nature<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.340> they

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
grow out of trees in nature so they

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.700 
grow out of trees in nature so they
don't<00:01:17.640> really<00:01:17.820> need<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.119> lot<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.420> material<00:01:19.049> so

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
don't really need a lot of material so

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.100 
don't really need a lot of material so
to<00:01:19.770> get<00:01:20.220> them<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.610> bloom<00:01:20.909> orchids<00:01:21.689> need

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
to get them to bloom orchids need

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.410 
to get them to bloom orchids need
different<00:01:22.619> factors<00:01:23.280> they<00:01:23.549> need<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.939> dormant

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
different factors they need a dormant

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.940 
different factors they need a dormant
time<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.990> time<00:01:25.259> when<00:01:25.470> they're<00:01:25.590> not<00:01:25.740> really

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
time a time when they're not really

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.690 
time a time when they're not really
growing<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.700> they<00:01:27.270> need<00:01:27.650> an<00:01:28.650> area<00:01:28.979> time<00:01:29.369> when

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
growing and they need an area time when

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.609 
growing and they need an area time when
there's<00:01:29.909> less<00:01:30.119> light<00:01:30.450> than<00:01:30.900> others<00:01:31.229> they<00:01:31.439> grow

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
there's less light than others they grow

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.460 
there's less light than others they grow
in<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.920> jungle<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.700> basically<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.780> found<00:01:34.140> they

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
in the jungle so basically I found they

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.679 
in the jungle so basically I found they
don't<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:34.890> bright<00:01:35.189> full<00:01:35.610> hot<00:01:35.909> Sun<00:01:35.939> they<00:01:36.570> get

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
don't like bright full hot Sun they get

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.870 
don't like bright full hot Sun they get
sunburned<00:01:37.259> sunburned<00:01:37.829> really<00:01:38.220> easily

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
sunburned sunburned really easily

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.910 
sunburned sunburned really easily
so<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:39.390> almost<00:01:39.540> better<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.259> grow<00:01:40.470> them<00:01:40.680> under

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
so it's almost better to grow them under

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.880 
so it's almost better to grow them under
artificial<00:01:41.400> light<00:01:41.640> or<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.420> part<00:01:43.320> Sun<00:01:43.590> part

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
artificial light or in part Sun part

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.100 
artificial light or in part Sun part
shade<00:01:43.950> better<00:01:44.790> than<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.270> hot<00:01:45.479> afternoon<00:01:46.079> Sun

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
shade better than that hot afternoon Sun

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.480 
shade better than that hot afternoon Sun
because<00:01:46.649> sometimes<00:01:47.009> they<00:01:47.130> will<00:01:47.280> get

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
because sometimes they will get

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.429 
because sometimes they will get
sunburned<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.509> can<00:01:48.689> start<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:49.079> pretty<00:01:49.290> much

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
again

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.630 
again
but<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.500> never<00:02:06.680> want<00:02:06.980> to<00:02:07.100> get<00:02:07.250> them<00:02:07.370> below

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640

but you never want to get them below
even<00:02:07.790> 50<00:02:08.390> degrees<00:02:08.780> on<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:09.170> lot<00:02:09.440> of<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.740> warm

even 50 degrees on a lot of the warm
climate<00:02:10.280> orchids<00:02:11.210> because<00:02:11.570> they<00:02:11.720> will<00:02:11.900> get

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
climate orchids because they will get

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.620 
climate orchids because they will get
