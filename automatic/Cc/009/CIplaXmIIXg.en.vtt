00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 of the traditional Paraguayan drink we 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.309
 we refer to tereré a drink 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.410
 simple refreshing based on water and 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.780
 the yerba mate to which you can add 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.110
 also remedies yuyos know your 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.110
 history 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.119
 ah 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.939
 dt that consists of mixing water 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.759
 cold with crushed refreshing herbs 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.820
 which is taken barley in the guampa with 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.739
 yerba mate using a light bulb according to 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.809
 specialists of the Guaraní culture 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.180
 tereré already existed at the time of the 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.670
 Guarani indigenous people who took it as 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.040
 a refreshing drink when you find the 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.760
 colonizers to the Guarani asking 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.650
 have and started an analysis of it 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.930
 discovering the properties of vigor and 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.000
 energy that gives the body thus the 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.309
 Jesuits were they planted in 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.300
 Paraguayan territory and borders 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.300
 the yerba mate 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:17.799
 but first it is regional Guaraní origin 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:20.920
 and then it seems that it happened between the 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:23.979
 indigenous and non-indigenous Paraguayans 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:31.299
 they started to develop it for a long time 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:33.369
 time other investigations ensure 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:37.479
 that the tereré is consolidated during the 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:40.000
 Chaco War between 1932 to 1935 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.979
 when the Paraguayan troops took 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.560
 cold mate to not light a fire and 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.720
 thus expand its position and soldiers 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.390
 they started drinking water from tajamares 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.390
 filtered in huanta with grass machine 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:00.670
 but the common soldier took a 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:03.640
 lagoon of a water source this in the 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.619
 water as it was true and in some 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.619
 temperature the temperature 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.010
 the story also tells that drinking tea 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.080
 It was a ceremony for the 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.360
 guaranies and as a sign of respect and 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.800
 admiration the cacique or tribal chief 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.170
 he never wore the tereré 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.540
 hence, generally in a round of 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.880
 tereré at present it is preserved that 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.790
 the person in charge of serving is the most 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.560
 young the name of tereré is 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.170
 onomatopoeic and is related to 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.780
 last three deaf that is done at 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.780
 drink the drink an onomatopoeic sound 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.400
 at the bottom of the uam to the 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:50.190
 light bulb that does also mate 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:53.450
 but it produces a sound in the background though 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.450
 support tereré 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.690
 today's tea is also taken in 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.330
 other countries where there is a large 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.700
 Paraguayan emigration population that 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.400
 I take to those places the traditional 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.650
 drink was evolving in a field 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.800
 large where there is a large migration of 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.930
 Paraguayan already at the beginning of the decade 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.540
 of 20 good of them take the tereré 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.370
 as a natural matter dances in the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:23.130

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:24.360
 make besides being a habit to take 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.670
 tereré in Paraguay 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.890
 the high temperatures contribute to the 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.020
 ingestion of the drink and it is so 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.150
 we found tld sales positions in 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.550
 the whole country constituting this one 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.959

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.960
 in the streets on the way to work in the 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:09.740
 house on the court and in offices in 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.740
