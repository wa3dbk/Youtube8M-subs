00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.600
 as clotting the stuffing then it 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.299
 everything falls or you got burnt 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.370
 demonstrate them we have a divine ones a 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:11.440
 that is burned that is clearly seen 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.630
 that that is destined to another that 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.850
 is here a little soft that now the 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.410
 unit of the curved middle home and this 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.330
 that is divine that is a cake of 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.820
 super high alcauciles that we're going to do 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.530
 right now to make a good cake 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.990
 the truth is that the best thing is that 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.420
 a mass that is avoided or is is is 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.880
 the rows do not buy anymore so does the voice 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.880
 at home do not want to knead the 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.520
 people will be more and more at least and I think 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.520
 yes 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.680
 I like the cakes we always love 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.320
 oil a cup with homemade dough 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.770
 they will take us into the processor with 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.620
 flour 40 well I think they are 500 grams and 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.370
 did not give me the recipe went well because no 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.710
 I remember exactly let's put the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.630
 4 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.299
 4 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.979
 processor, do not feel excluded from 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.750
 this recipe are you going to do 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.579
 quietly and you're going to break the butter 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.159
 with my fingers what I 'm going to expose 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.530
 there is in the processor and put butter 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.360
 cheesemaker and the processor will help 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.520
 that does not heat up or too much the dough 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.530
 I want those little ones to do with the 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.060
 hand that I have the primary hands 33 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.159
 degrees and I do not have a fever and others 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.049
 then the processor is going to help you 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.509
 in this process and it's going to do that not to 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.450
 more is that it's faster but if you do not 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.310
 you have the same and if I told you here 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.200
 make the base of the cake I understand you 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.119
 you got tired doing them with dough 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.209
 bought but you make pies and you 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.679
 stay better every day we will be 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:48.479
 working all the vegetables that you have 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.939
 at your disposal 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.090
 he enjoys himself very well, well, it seems very 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:57.759
 well then flour 40 butters marÃ­a 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:01.790
 accordate cut into cubes and fine salt 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:04.340
 this I am going to process first for what 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.260
 sandblasting so that all the butter 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.509
 destroy it is plugged in 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:15.500
 processor would be spectacular for what 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.500
 it shatters and there it is 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.620
 a perfect seed apply as 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.110
 after processing the sugars 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.670
 it can be processed a little bit is ready 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.710
 so that to add a bit of 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.540
 liquid that I will add 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:40.820
 but then I saw a little zenith and cold water 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.950
 oil and for when the masses in the 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.200
 processor what is the advice when 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:50.030
 be more in the processor 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.030
 little by little 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.570
 take a little while to incorporate it 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.370
 incorporates a brake and I hope to see how 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.380
 but it does not kill her 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.600
 when he perceived 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.370
 After a little while he does not finish it 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.260
 add the one added a little more but 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.210
 do not read and it's all that until you see that 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.280
 he took because there's a delay between him 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.280
 incorporates water and dough all 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.400
 it would be exactly cold water is changing 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.350
 also the noise of the processor up 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.320
 what it takes is more the spectacular 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.030
 and listened to the processor look for change 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.030
 the noise and saying it was beyond is 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.460
 clean flame vein more to which which ricotta 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.530
 I would almost say formed here in 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.900
 we found the processor complained 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.940
 had to do more strength then to 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:47.570
 the edges of the letters very well 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:49.610
 homemade in the processor in a bowl what 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.950
 that we recommend that if the base is a 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.540
 movement of flour to grab it and 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.360
 that the bands to the refrigerator to be able 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.950
 stretch the but a guard is doing 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.620
 and we are very careful because this 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.160
 blade is short then pull out the dough 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.590
 Carefully remove the blade there is a 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.900
 perfect we go down all the nasa 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.600
 we put flour and we will take it to the 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.090
 refrigerator this little time we will use it 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.130
 I rest to rest the voice not 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.140
 it's a little pause and right away 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.140
 we continue with the threads of salt
