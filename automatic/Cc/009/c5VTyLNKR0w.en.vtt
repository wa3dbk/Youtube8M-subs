one<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.449> those<00:00:51.539> situations<00:00:51.809> where<00:00:52.140> it's<00:00:52.410> like

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
one of those situations where it's like

one of those situations where it's like
the<00:00:52.829> only<00:00:52.949> thing<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.370> supposed<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> help<00:00:53.820> you

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.209 
the only thing that supposed to help you
out<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.300> not<00:00:54.570> helping<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.050> out<00:00:55.079> well<00:00:56.070> that's

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
out is not helping you out well that's

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.970 
out is not helping you out well that's
what<00:00:56.430> happened<00:00:56.750> so<00:00:57.750> what<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:58.289> have<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.710> far<00:00:58.739> is

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
what happened so what we have so far is

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.040 
what happened so what we have so far is
the<00:00:59.340> supply<00:00:59.579> depot<00:00:59.789> being<00:01:00.149> built<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.870> side

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
the supply depot being built on the side

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.349 
the supply depot being built on the side
and<00:01:01.289> we<00:01:01.859> do<00:01:02.010> see<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> spawning<00:01:02.910> pool<00:01:03.180> and

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
and we do see a spawning pool and

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.000 
and we do see a spawning pool and
extractor<00:01:03.780> coming<00:01:04.049> out<00:01:04.110> really<00:01:04.260> relatively

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
extractor coming out really relatively

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.580 
extractor coming out really relatively
soon<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:05.549> he<00:01:05.970> does<00:01:06.150> scout<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.170> wrong

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
soon as he does scout the wrong

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.649 
soon as he does scout the wrong
direction<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:08.549> that's<00:01:08.700> quite<00:01:09.090> all<00:01:09.240> right<00:01:09.270> as

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
direction but that's quite all right as

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.460 
direction but that's quite all right as
he<00:01:10.409> will<00:01:10.530> probably<00:01:10.950> send<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.490> drone<00:01:11.760> out<00:01:12.470> this

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
he will probably send the drone out this

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.260 
he will probably send the drone out this
is<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.770> normal<00:01:13.979> way<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.280> scout<00:01:14.670> because<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.150> is

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
is the normal way to scout because it is

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.480 
is the normal way to scout because it is
the<00:01:15.420> closest<00:01:15.780> base<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.770> do<00:01:16.920> always<00:01:17.130> want

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
the closest base and you do always want

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.160 
the closest base and you do always want
to<00:01:17.520> be<00:01:17.640> able<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.880> check<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.270> see<00:01:18.299> if<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.659> air

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
to be able to check to see if the air

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.840 
to be able to check to see if the air
distance<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.950> be<00:01:20.009> rather<00:01:20.220> short<00:01:20.640> for

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
distance is going to be rather short for

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.160 
distance is going to be rather short for
you<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.119> your<00:01:21.240> opponent<00:01:21.330> because<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.140> a

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
you and your opponent because that is a

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.499 
you and your opponent because that is a
one<00:01:22.950> key<00:01:23.250> factor<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.670> determining<00:01:23.850> what<00:01:24.210> sort

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
one key factor in determining what sort

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.820 
one key factor in determining what sort
of<00:01:24.570> units<00:01:24.900> are<00:01:25.020> most<00:01:25.200> sort<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.470> build<00:01:25.650> you're

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
of units are most sort of build you're

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.590 
of units are most sort of build you're
going<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.009> go<00:01:26.159> with<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:26.939> see<00:01:27.090> an<00:01:27.180> extractor

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
going to go with we do see an extractor

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.749 
going to go with we do see an extractor
going<00:01:27.840> up<00:01:27.930> for<00:01:28.080> Hydra<00:01:28.439> as<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:29.310> barracks<00:01:29.640> is

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
going up for Hydra as the barracks is

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.819 
going up for Hydra as the barracks is
being<00:01:30.000> blocked<00:01:30.299> off<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.290> entrance<00:01:31.650> as

being blocked off for the entrance as

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.890 
being blocked off for the entrance as
well<00:01:32.040> as<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> refinery<00:01:32.759> fort<00:01:33.270> our<00:01:33.479> sins<00:01:33.720> and

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.499 
well as a refinery fort our sins and
then<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:34.650> do<00:01:34.770> see<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.250> drone<00:01:35.729> as<00:01:36.000> well<00:01:36.240> as<00:01:36.479> a

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
then we do see a drone as well as a

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.240 
then we do see a drone as well as a
Overlord<00:01:37.320> heading<00:01:37.560> out<00:01:37.680> with<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.009> dro

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
and Helen's going back to the base and

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.280 
and Helen's going back to the base and
he<00:04:47.190> blocks<00:04:47.490> it<00:04:47.640> off<00:04:47.790> and<00:04:48.030> that<00:04:48.780> Helen<00:04:49.110> looks

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
he blocks it off and that Helen looks

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.650 
he blocks it off and that Helen looks
like<00:04:49.470> it's<00:04:49.650> gonna<00:04:49.860> die<00:04:50.520> but<00:04:50.940> that's<00:04:51.240> quite<00:04:51.510> all

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
like it's gonna die but that's quite all

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
like it's gonna die but that's quite all
right<00:04:51.690> as<00:04:51.900> he<00:04:52.020> didn't<00:04:52.230> wanted<00:04:52.410> to<00:04:52.500> prevent

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
right as he didn't wanted to prevent

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.440 
right as he didn't wanted to prevent
those<00:04:52.830> zerglings<00:04:53.760> from<00:04:53.880> rushing<00:04:54.180> into<00:04:54.330> the

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
those zerglings from rushing into the

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.290 
those zerglings from rushing into the
base<00:04:54.950> Hydra<00:04:55.950> now<00:04:56.100> I<00:04:56.130> think<00:04:56.670> slightly<00:04:57.000> behind

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
base Hydra now I think slightly behind

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.000 
base Hydra now I think slightly behind
an<00:04:57.570> economy<00:04:58.080> because<00:04:58.350> he<00:04:58.470> had<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.620> bring<00:04:58.860> those

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
an economy because he had to bring those

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.730 
an economy because he had to bring those
drones<00:04:59.370> off<00:04:59.670> and<00:05:00.090> he<00:05:00.840> does<00:05:01.080> actually<00:05:01.380> have<00:05:01.710> a

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
drones off and he does actually have a

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.380 
drones off and he does actually have a
couple<00:05:01.950> of<00:05:02.220> fewer<00:05:02.460> workers<00:05:02.820> but<00:05:03.090> now<00:05:03.210> he's

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
couple of fewer workers but now he's

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.180 
couple of fewer workers but now he's
pumping<00:05:03.570> more<00:05:03.900> workers<00:05:04.350> but<00:05:04.770> that<00:05:04.920> will<00:05:05.070> hurt

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
pumping more workers but that will hurt

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.950 
pumping more workers but that will hurt
his<00:05:05.370> army<00:05:05.730> count<00:05:05.910> because<00:05:06.180> he<00:05:06.360> can't<00:05:06.660> really

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
his army count because he can't really

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.960 
his army count because he can't really
produce<00:05:07.650> that<00:05:08.070> many<00:05:08.280> things<00:05:08.670> at<00:05:08.850> a<00:05:08.910> time

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
produce that many things at a time

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.570 
produce that many things at a time
because<00:05:09.270> he<00:05:09.480> does<00:05:09.660> not<00:05:09.690> have<00:05:10.140> his<00:05:10.290> Queens<00:05:10.740> he

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
because he does not have his Queens he

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.280 
because he does not have his Queens he
did<00:05:11.760> lose<00:05:11.910> two<00:05:12.180> queens<00:05:12.510> in<00:05:12.660> that<00:05:12.780> one<00:05:12.990> attack

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
did lose two queens in that one attack

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.440 
did lose two queens in that one attack
so<00:05:13.860> it<00:05:14.100> was<00:05:14.280> rather<00:05:14.520> painful<00:05:15.000> not<00:05:15.210> only

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
so it was rather painful not only

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.750 
so it was rather painful not only
economically<00:05:15.990> but<00:05:16.080> also<00:05:16.260> for<00:05:17.100> production<00:05:17.580> as

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
economically but also for production as

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.880 
economically but also for production as
well<00:05:17.790> and<00:05:18.450> we<00:05:18.540> do<00:05:18.660> see<00:05:18.810> an<00:05:18.960> expansion<00:05:19.200> coming

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
well and we do see an expansion coming

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.460 
well and we do see an expansion coming
out<00:05:20.040> for<00:05:20.490> at<00:05:20.640> our<00:05:20.790> sins<00:05:21.030> as<00:05:21.180> he<00:05:21.360> was<00:05:21.660> thinking

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
out for at our sins as he was thinking

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.380 
out for at our sins as he was thinking
of<00:05:22.590> getting<00:05:23.010> it<00:05:23.310> and<00:05:23.550> these<00:05:23.940> organs<00:05:24.300> are

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
of getting it and these organs are

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.910 
of getting it and these organs are
coming<00:05:24.600> in<00:05:24.720> just<00:05:25.170> to<00:05:25.290> see<00:05:25.320> what<00:05:25.530> my<00:05:25.620> units

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
coming in just to see what my units

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
coming in just to see what my units
thompson's<00:05:26.850> hands<00:05:27.060> and<00:05:27.530> will<00:05:28.530> they<00:05:29.400> see<00:05:29.460> the

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
thompson's hands and will they see the

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.200 
thompson's hands and will they see the
bad<00:05:30.180> Chi<00:05:30.540> I<00:05:30.810> think<00:05:31.530> no<00:05:32.400> I<00:05:32.430> thought<00:05:32.820> I<00:05:32.970> don't

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
bad Chi I think no I thought I don't

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.620 
bad Chi I think no I thought I don't
think<00:05:33.420> they<00:05:33.660> saw<00:05:33.840> the<00:05:33.900> banshee<00:05:34.520> and<00:05:35.630> the

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
think they saw the banshee and the

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.830 
think they saw the banshee and the
overlords<00:05:37.020> getting<00:05:37.230> shot<00:05:37.410> from<00:05:37.560> the<00:05:37.680> side<00:05:37.860> and

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
overlords getting shot from the side and

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.410 
overlords getting shot from the side and
here<00:05:39.840> I<00:05:39.870> think

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:41.420 
here I think

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.510 
here I think
I<00:05:41.510> drew<00:05:42.380> did<00:05:42.560> see<00:05:42.770> something<00:05:42.980> that's<00:05:43.190> why<00:05:43.370> he's

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
I drew did see something that's why he's

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.960 
I drew did see something that's why he's
running<00:05:43.820> on<00:05:43.970> this<00:05:44.210> in<00:05:44.510> this<00:05:44.750> direction<00:05:44.960> and

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
running on this in this direction and

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.460 
running on this in this direction and
yes<00:05:46.970> he<00:05:47.120> does<00:05:47.150> catch<00:05:47.630> a<00:05:47.720> glimpse<00:05:47.900> of<00:05:48.050> the

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
yes he does catch a glimpse of the

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.130 
yes he does catch a glimpse of the
Banshee<00:05:48.890> and<00:05:49.570> the<00:05:50.570> Banshees<00:05:50.840> coming<00:05:51.050> around

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
the only thing that can defend against

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.570 
the only thing that can defend against
the<00:05:52.640> Banshee<00:05:53.390> is<00:05:53.480> the<00:05:53.600> Queen<00:05:53.840> and<00:05:54.230> the<00:05:54.580> Queen

the Banshee is the Queen and the Queen

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.370 
the Banshee is the Queen and the Queen
