00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.390
 bowes staff staff spoke moresi be 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.380
 welcome 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.810
 the official 1.4 version 1.6 of more graphics 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.109
 is here again this week with more 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.060
 minecraft assignments and to tell the 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.730
 I really was not thinking about bringing this 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.030
 version because it is basically a set 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.219
 of all the 96 updates you brought 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.170
 here in the channel but nevertheless fernandes 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.530
 they asked me very important, this is going to be 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.690
 a use of all updates of all 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.450
 implementations that have been made and 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.820
 be all too fast the first of them 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.390
 we have here the understanding in the called 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.399
 you do not have a tradition because 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.750
 It's going to be anything like a spy. 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.460
 maybe our thugs thugs do not leave 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.070
 this is an enchantment that is only 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.310
 applicable in armor hypothesis three 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.200
 levels 1 2 or 3 d entirely when 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.299
 we were attacked by young people for 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.520
 example is we are not just us 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.009
 waiting as I also carry is like 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.409
 if they were attacked by the spikes that 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.470
 we have in our mature age they can 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.570
 even dying carriers is delayed and 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.450
 to the negative side is our armor 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.030
 it's wear lasts much more care 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.150
 fast - there is now also a new 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.909
 option - you are in the options you have to 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.320
 Destroy our way of ringing in 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.420
 It's something like that. 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.310
 we stayed the year we can see that 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.770
 this will affect non- inventory 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.869
 explained we could no longer win in the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.720
 item we have to restore it goes 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.880
 be useful again the tablets I suppose 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.920
 now also whenever we take in 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.520
 I'm rendered in 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.250
 3d see this magnificent thing however 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.320
 is an option from the graphs we 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.899
 we had graffiti rapids 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.399
 we will see the normal drop without being 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.129
 held in 3d 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.229
 we only see two dimensions whatever 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.180
 be the location we have hawn 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.560
 whenever we select an item from the 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.390
 our bar 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.270
 but we got to see the name of iran 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.470
 without measuring inventory is more 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.970
 so easy 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.670
 Another interesting thing is that we 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.319
 we put, for example, a dispenser on the floor and 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.989
 we can not normally place the 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.120
 button for us to open this interface 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.300
 graphics to put and we have however 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.550
 we stay on the shift to leave us 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.530
 We can now put buttons 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.900
 I'm very fast and we 're staying now. 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.989
 in control and click on that at the same 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.450
 time we have drople whole stf 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.630
 of blocks we have in the hand like that no longer 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.940
 It is necessary to get here and 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.510
 of the blogs profession inventory is the 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.970
 your 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.069
 There is now also on the blog called the 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.349
 mega game stores and we can do 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.690
 exactly as we do the slabs of 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.930
 stone of wood and everything else we put 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.380
 three neder games horizontally and 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.940
 we do 6 never break flaps ok we 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.959
 We also have a new blog called 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.970
 260 and books or the enchanted books that 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.900
 we can use to delight our 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.750
 visitors not only pickaxes and 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.500
 normal things, but it was also 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.630
 completely weird content and things 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.400
 Bizarre even though I can not tell you now 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.530
 But I'll explain quickly to you. 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.510
 we put a book in 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.819
 on the table of incantations on the 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.510
 enchantments and we have in such a 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.880
 so in a sense with the level 1 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.829
 we did for example use in the item no 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.930
 necessarily sword does not have to be 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.060
 priest but we want to present in 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.959
 short to 13 with sword just put 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.180
 so the anvil table and managed 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.980
 to invent our books heream 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.040
 delights that we create can also 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.620
 be found in big names like 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.200
 itamar victory that found of the chest and 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.540
 also said that normally exposed 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.060
 tempted free minds has a 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.819
 rarer and more difficult 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.769
 can find support worth 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.480
 worth looking for big mistakes do not 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.250
 Look at that, cow. 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.709
 we can now also make fire of 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.389
 because they charge the new year and it is 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.970
 very easy to do we just need 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:26.520
 of powder and also paper 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.480
 compulsory and bank dyes are 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.640
 really 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.310
 but we have to focus here poor one 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.930
 dye and do a firework are we 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.080
 we have put together all the things that we 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.200
 we made and we made a ball with the various 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.390
 Small ball colors with lime and light blue 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.370
 Let's now join all the tracks. 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.110
 that this product we have created 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.270
 to make our rock 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.540
 we put so must put all 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.210
 the balls that you want and we make a 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.950
 our firehawk is totally 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.000
 customized we want that I go 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.860
 for longer 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.980
 we put the poorest we want 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.320
 that the baby will put can hang a 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.840
 smaller did not like not always that it brought 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.990
 more like then we can put by 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.320
 example sisters heads cryppa and everything else 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:15.090
 it's completely targets like 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.310
 we made the pitch we could put 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.760
 no worries we can not throw like this 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:23.600
 easily into the air and do something like this 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.600
 from im 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.190
 and last but not least the 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.610
 air was modified again 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:42.750
 now whenever we hit the others 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.970
 players we hear a sound means 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.080
 that we hit a person and that 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.490
 person is almost to die hahaha 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.650
 besides we now always look for 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.530
 in the distance we can now see the 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:58.050
 arrows in the distance if in the past 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.150
 was possible because the carnation to mother 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.180
 can bear all these things 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.450
 can not use symbols per 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.220
 do as you gassen conjugates work 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.710
 much more than is probably already 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.810
 so that's it now we can 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.670
 see the flashes farther away is not 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.080
 locking so much therefore I think 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.060
 that this is a good thing because 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.670
 sincerely the game has improved greatly in 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.010
 my opinion on this latest update 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.900
 was this implementation of a grace of the 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.910
 version 1.4 1.6 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.560
 I hope you have tanned and 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:31.080
 Of course, what are you who will be 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.750
 click did not like and added to the horn 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.180
 Diogo says everything you said it was a 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.130
 method of presenting the 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.810
 minecraft updates I only know 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.870
 and who will be in the comments or 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.480
 prefer 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.890
 this cut that this was 10 thousand bodies 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.990
 squared 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.700
 and if you want to show our 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.980
 friends because they are likely to have 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.930
 some doubts about the new version and 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.180
 about new visitors and this video 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.820
 I hope I explain everything very well. 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:01.950
 then wait - in the next video the 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.950
 Arm and until next time.
