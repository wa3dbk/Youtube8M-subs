00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.270
 prepare the cream to prepare these 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.919
 rich trapeze and they made us the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.780
 next videos because I'll be 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.440
 teaching how to prepare the papers 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.440
 different flavors 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:31.769
 we're going to need cream to beat this 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.350
 cream is from the Chantilly brand here 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.540
 you see the brand is in culiacÃ¡n the 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.670
 we bought in chantilly castle 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.890
 there are different brands also in the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.350
 super sell the lincoln brand in 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.289
 tro distribution there is another brand I think that 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.260
 rich the cream to beat is known 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.780
 as a cover and filling for pastry 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.149
 and pastry is the same cream that 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.030
 we use for strawberries with cream this 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.770
 cream comes liquid this is to beat 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.469
 now let's beat and it's going to do 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.409
 solid this cream in the usa can 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.460
 look like wild bill cream something like that 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.280
 they speak very well 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.409
 whiting cream is in the USA in any 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.770
 super where are the gallons 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.090
 there they find the incredible uip of another 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.970
 brand will not logically find 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.180
 this one is with vanilla flavor 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.909
 This cream brings vanilla flavor 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.830
 occupy a cup of cream if your cream 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.630
 It does not bring vanilla flavor 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.880
 select a teaspoon of vanilla 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.360
 if they want their cream to know 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.180
 vanilla in other countries this cream is 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.069
 known as cream to mount also 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.250
 let's add a teaspoon of 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:44.289
 sugar this cream is already sweet this 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.750
 cream the sweet but how are we going 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.090
 be using with ice we want a 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.159
 little bit more sweet then we are going to 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.170
 put a teaspoon of sugar a 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.509
 moment before preparing it I put the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.210
 mol to the freezer so that it is well 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.880
 life and I also put the blades of the 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.310
 blender is convenient that the dressing gown on 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.899
 the metal container lifts better the 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.030
 cream if they do it in containers of 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.770
 plastic we are going to put in the container 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.560
 let's put the cup 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.930
 cream 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.510
 let's put the sugar spoon 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.010
 if your cream does not bring vanilla flavor here 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.019
 additional of the same teaspoon of 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.829
 vanilla let's start beating 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.829
 low speed 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.390
 I've been here for about a minute and 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.580
 I see like that cream and it starts to 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.000
 lift now I'm going to put speed 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.000
 half 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.860
 so we will continue to beat from 3 to 5 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.150
 minutes until you see that the cream is already 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.160
 thick 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.710
 when the cream does things that are already 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.050
 still it lacks a little now I'm 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.570
 to set high speed and I will continue 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.270
 beating until you see that my cream already 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:13.190
 it's very thick and it's been moving 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.190
 does as equipment and does not fall apart 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.850
 since we see that all that that forms the 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.800
 cream no longer break down and the 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.280
 faculty with all new tapas 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.320
 we can flip the container like this and not 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.320
 it falls if you drop them the believe plus that 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:34.610
 still was not then now let's 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.740
 use a sleeve of these this is 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.500
 we miss the sleeves we can get them 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.780
 so where all the singles sell 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.080
 pastry ingredients find 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.690
 these manga to the search as manga 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.500
 pastry we will also use a 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:56.580
 doubt this is yours star these two 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.800
 already bring numbers is number 329 but 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.390
 we know comes for other than 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.310
 let's see when many know 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.610
 what is it called is amadou and you ask 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.850
 yours with the number 329 is in the form of 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.480
 star this to put this we are going to 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.480
 put inside 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:20.480
 and now let's put the cream in the 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:24.740
 sleeve to put it 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:28.000
 we are folding and filling this 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.000
 shape and we are going to throw 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.470
 the cream is not going to throw us here 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.320
 it is thrown because as it is very hard this 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.460
 it reaches him to leave no problem we 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.460
 they have to cover nothing 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:55.559
 let's crush what goes very well 

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:55.559
 down the technique 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.660
 I'm going to do here 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.350
 until you see that it starts to come out here 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.350
 by the tip 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.050
 there is already started to come out now 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.669
 our cream is ready to use the 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.229
 we can store in the refrigerator we 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.289
 can hold up to three or four days 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.940
 without it being wade and nothing happens to him not 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.530
 lose the next videos because we're going 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.259
 to be doing our own and we're going to 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.150
