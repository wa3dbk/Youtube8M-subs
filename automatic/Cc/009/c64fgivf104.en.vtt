00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
what is up guys doc redstone here and

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.130 
what is up guys doc redstone here and
today<00:00:26.270> I<00:00:26.510> have<00:00:27.140> my<00:00:27.500> tiny<00:00:28.070> tech<00:00:28.700> video<00:00:29.300> it's

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
today I have my tiny tech video it's

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.840 
today I have my tiny tech video it's
been<00:00:30.350> a<00:00:30.380> while<00:00:30.620> since<00:00:30.890> I've<00:00:31.100> done<00:00:31.130> tiny<00:00:31.550> tech

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
been a while since I've done tiny tech

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.580 
been a while since I've done tiny tech
so<00:00:32.060> i<00:00:32.120> figured<00:00:32.450> i'd<00:00:32.570> bring<00:00:32.599> it<00:00:32.900> back<00:00:33.080> i've<00:00:33.380> had

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
so i figured i'd bring it back i've had

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.400 
so i figured i'd bring it back i've had
quite<00:00:33.770> a<00:00:33.860> few<00:00:34.010> requests<00:00:34.430> for<00:00:34.700> it<00:00:34.790> and<00:00:35.540> figured

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
quite a few requests for it and figured

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.970 
quite a few requests for it and figured
you<00:00:36.560> guys<00:00:36.710> liked<00:00:37.340> it<00:00:37.809> so<00:00:38.809> we'll<00:00:39.500> go<00:00:39.650> ahead<00:00:39.770> and

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
you guys liked it so we'll go ahead and

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.210 
you guys liked it so we'll go ahead and
we'll<00:00:40.250> do<00:00:40.550> it<00:00:41.260> basically<00:00:42.260> today<00:00:42.500> what<00:00:42.830> we<00:00:42.980> have

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
we'll do it basically today what we have

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.930 
we'll do it basically today what we have
is<00:00:43.489> a<00:00:43.970> clock<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:44.860> I<00:00:45.860> like<00:00:46.370> this<00:00:46.550> one<00:00:46.610> because

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
is a clock and I like this one because

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.900 
is a clock and I like this one because
it's<00:00:47.270> a<00:00:47.360> completely<00:00:47.860> customizable<00:00:48.910> extremely

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
it's a completely customizable extremely

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.619 
it's a completely customizable extremely
tiny<00:00:50.270> clock<00:00:51.160> and<00:00:52.160> as<00:00:52.400> you<00:00:52.520> can<00:00:52.670> see<00:00:52.700> right<00:00:53.150> now

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
tiny clock and as you can see right now

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.910 
tiny clock and as you can see right now
it's<00:00:54.200> set<00:00:54.559> to<00:00:55.120> six<00:00:56.120> tix<00:00:56.480> let's<00:00:57.230> see<00:00:57.379> one<00:00:57.620> two

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
it's set to six tix let's see one two

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.899 
it's set to six tix let's see one two
four<00:00:58.610> yeah<00:00:59.120> six<00:00:59.449> tix<00:00:59.750> so<00:01:00.470> it<00:01:00.769> can<00:01:01.010> go<00:01:01.040> from<00:01:01.400> six

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
four yeah six tix so it can go from six

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.329 
four yeah six tix so it can go from six
ticks<00:01:02.239> and<00:01:02.570> can<00:01:02.690> be<00:01:02.809> a<00:01:02.839> three<00:01:03.140> tik<00:01:03.350> clock<00:01:03.680> and

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
ticks and can be a three tik clock and

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.190 
ticks and can be a three tik clock and
be<00:01:04.460> a<00:01:04.489> 4<00:01:04.760> tick<00:01:05.000> clock<00:01:05.300> a<00:01:05.630> 5<00:01:06.320> tick<00:01:06.650> clock<00:01:07.010> whoops

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
be a 4 tick clock a 5 tick clock whoops

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.660 
be a 4 tick clock a 5 tick clock whoops
reset<00:01:09.200> it<00:01:09.320> right<00:01:09.440> there<00:01:10.330> 5<00:01:11.330> tick<00:01:11.690> clock<00:01:12.020> or

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
reset it right there 5 tick clock or

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.590 
reset it right there 5 tick clock or
even<00:01:13.670> a<00:01:13.850> sixth<00:01:14.360> o'clock<00:01:15.640> so<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:16.940> it's<00:01:17.390> nice

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
even a sixth o'clock so and it's nice

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.690 
even a sixth o'clock so and it's nice
like<00:01:17.930> I<00:01:18.110> should<00:01:18.320> just<00:01:18.409> showed<00:01:18.650> because<00:01:19.130> it<00:01:19.430> has

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
like I should just showed because it has

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.570 
like I should just showed because it has
a<00:01:20.090> lever<00:01:20.360> that<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:21.350> can<00:01:21.560> power<00:01:21.920> so<00:01:22.430> you<00:01:22.460> can

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
a lever that you can power so you can

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.190 
a lever that you can power so you can
turn<00:01:22.880> it<00:01:23.210> on<00:01:23.570> or<00:01:23.870> off<00:01:25.120> so<00:01:26.120> that's<00:01:26.509> nice<00:01:26.750> as<00:01:26.990> well

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
turn it on or off so that's nice as well

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.679 
turn it on or off so that's nice as well
and<00:01:27.500> this<00:01:28.310> is<00:01:28.460> pretty<00:01:28.670> simple<00:01:28.969> to<00:01:29.180> make<00:01:29.360> pretty

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
and this is pretty simple to make pretty

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.920 
and this is pretty simple to make pretty
easy<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:30.320> pretty<00:01:30.950> compact<00:01:31.630> for<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.719> most

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
easy and pretty compact for the most

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.830 
easy and pretty compact for the most
part<00:01:33.259> this<00:01:33.710> clock<00:01:34.040> is<00:01:34.149> 12<00:01:36.189> to<00:01:37.189> three<00:01:38.060> wide<00:01:38.270> by

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
part this clock is 12 to three wide by

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.249 
part this clock is 12 to three wide by
three<00:01:39.469> so<00:01:39.979> three<00:01:40.250> by<00:01:40.430> three<00:01:40.899> and<00:01:41.899> it's<00:01:42.020> too

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
three so three by three and it's too

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.289 
three so three by three and it's too
tall<00:01:42.500> however<00:01:43.280> if<00:01:43.579> you<00:01:43.700> want<00:01:43.909> to<00:01:44.000> sacrifice

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
tall however if you want to sacrifice

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.139 
tall however if you want to sacrifice
some<00:01:44.930> space<00:01:45.460> you're<00:01:46.460> gonna<00:01:46.579> actually<00:01:46.789> go

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
some space you're gonna actually go

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.060 
some space you're gonna actually go
ahead<00:01:47.539> and<00:01:48.549> make<00:01:49.549> it<00:01:49.700> one<00:01:49.909> tell<00:01:50.210> but<00:01:51.170> at<00:01:51.920> the

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
ahead and make it one tell but at the

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.240 
ahead and make it one tell but at the
same<00:01:52.310> time<00:01:52.579> you<00:01:52.939> actually<00:01:53.149> gain<00:01:53.710> an<00:01:54.710> extra

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
same time you actually gain an extra

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.929 
same time you actually gain an extra
block<00:01:55.939> so<00:01:56.149> now<00:01:56.270> it's<00:01:56.450> for<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:58.100> that's<00:01:58.219> five<00:01:58.399> I

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
block so now it's for and that's five I

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.459 
block so now it's for and that's five I
believe<00:01:59.840> see<00:02:00.430> one<00:02:01.430> two<00:02:01.880> three<00:02:02.450> four<00:02:03.049> so<00:02:03.320> now

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
believe see one two three four so now

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.510 
believe see one two three four so now
it's<00:02:03.649> four<00:02:03.890> by<00:02:04.130> one<00:02:05.119> two<00:02:05.659> three<00:02:06.469> so<00:02:07.250> now<00:02:07.369> it's

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
it's four by one two three so now it's

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.460 
it's four by one two three so now it's
four<00:02:07.729> by<00:02:07.909> three<00:02:07.939> instead<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.810> three<00:02:08.990> by<00:02:09.140> three

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
four by three instead of three by three

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.100 
four by three instead of three by three
but<00:02:10.039> at<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.280> same<00:02:10.429> time<00:02:10.610> that's<00:02:10.850> one<00:02:11.180> tall<00:02:11.420> so

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
but at the same time that's one tall so

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.480 
but at the same time that's one tall so
it<00:02:12.380> kind<00:02:12.590> of<00:02:12.620> depends<00:02:12.890> if<00:02:13.070> you<00:02:13.160> want<00:02:13.340> to

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
it kind of depends if you want to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:20.860 
it kind of depends if you want to
compact<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.180> little<00:02:17.830> space<00:02:18.830> on<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:20.120> right<00:02:20.480> in

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
compact a little space on the right in

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.360 
compact a little space on the right in
order<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.920> make<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:22.370> not<00:02:23.090> tall<00:02:23.660> but<00:02:23.960> I<00:02:24.590> prefer

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
order to make it not tall but I prefer

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.630 
order to make it not tall but I prefer
this<00:02:26.270> way<00:02:26.570> most<00:02:27.050> of<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.230> time<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.980> block<00:02:28.280> space

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
this way most of the time to block space

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.140 
this way most of the time to block space
is<00:02:28.910> not<00:02:29.090> that<00:02:29.270> difficult<00:02:29.510> look<00:02:30.319> some<00:02:30.500> timing

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
is not that difficult look some timing

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.729 
is not that difficult look some timing
so<00:02:32.150> anyway<00:02:32.510> this<00:02:32.750> is<00:02:32.900> pretty<00:02:33.050> easy<00:02:33.290> to<00:02:33.530> make

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
so anyway this is pretty easy to make

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.250 
so anyway this is pretty easy to make
what<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:34.730> want<00:02:34.819> to<00:02:34.940> go<00:02:35.030> ahead<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.390> do<00:02:35.569> is<00:02:35.780> you

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
what you want to go ahead and do is you

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.780 
what you want to go ahead and do is you
want<00:02:36.409> to<00:02:36.440> start<00:02:36.800> off<00:02:36.980> by<00:02:37.510> building<00:02:38.950> two<00:02:39.950> pieces

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
want to start off by building two pieces

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.040 
want to start off by building two pieces
of<00:02:41.080> your<00:02:42.080> stone<00:02:42.620> block<00:02:43.250> of<00:02:43.430> choice<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:44.150> you

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
of your stone block of choice and you

the<00:02:57.409> right<00:02:57.709> hand<00:02:58.069> side<00:02:58.489> you're<00:02:58.970> going<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.180> go

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
the right hand side you're going to go

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.899 
the right hand side you're going to go
ahead<00:02:59.390> and<00:02:59.810> you<00:03:00.019> replace<00:03:00.319> your<00:03:00.349> redstone<00:03:00.909> then

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
ahead and you replace your redstone then

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.130 
ahead and you replace your redstone then
you're<00:03:02.030> going<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.180> take<00:03:02.269> your<00:03:02.420> repeater<00:03:02.959> and

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
you're going to take your repeater and

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.630 
you're going to take your repeater and
you're<00:03:03.830> just<00:03:03.890> going<00:03:04.099> to<00:03:04.159> place<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:04.370> in<00:03:04.610> the

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
you're just going to place it in the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.080 
you're just going to place it in the
center<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:05.150> by<00:03:05.720> default<00:03:06.200> like<00:03:07.099> I<00:03:07.340> said<00:03:07.400> and

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
center and by default like I said and

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.509 
center and by default like I said and
the<00:03:08.330> repeater<00:03:08.750> needs<00:03:09.019> to<00:03:09.230> be<00:03:09.319> facing<00:03:09.650> the

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
the repeater needs to be facing the

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.009 
the repeater needs to be facing the
torch<00:03:10.819> on<00:03:12.159> the<00:03:13.159> right<00:03:13.370> over<00:03:13.700> here<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.090> then

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
torch on the right over here and then

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.110 
torch on the right over here and then
you<00:03:15.080> can<00:03:15.230> go<00:03:15.349> ahead<00:03:15.440> put<00:03:16.430> your<00:03:16.459> lever<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:19.120> go

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
you can go ahead put your lever and go

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.839 
you can go ahead put your lever and go
ahead<00:03:20.330> flip<00:03:20.629> it<00:03:20.810> up<00:03:20.959> and<00:03:21.280> there<00:03:22.280> you<00:03:22.340> go<00:03:22.400> you

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
ahead flip it up and there you go you

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.580 
ahead flip it up and there you go you
got<00:03:22.879> your<00:03:23.209> clock<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:23.689> right<00:03:23.900> now<00:03:23.989> this<00:03:24.110> is<00:03:24.260> a<00:03:24.290> 5

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
got your clock and right now this is a 5

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.160 
got your clock and right now this is a 5
clock<00:03:24.890> like<00:03:25.879> I<00:03:26.000> said<00:03:26.060> I<00:03:26.209> can<00:03:26.420> turn<00:03:26.510> it<00:03:26.689> to<00:03:26.750> a<00:03:26.810> 6

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
clock like I said I can turn it to a 6

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.470 
clock like I said I can turn it to a 6
clock<00:03:27.530> or<00:03:28.189> I<00:03:28.519> can<00:03:28.760> turn<00:03:28.790> it<00:03:28.939> to<00:03:29.120> a<00:03:29.150> three

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
clock or I can turn it to a three

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.320 
clock or I can turn it to a three
o'clock<00:03:29.540> four<00:03:30.080> o'clock<00:03:30.650> five<00:03:31.610> o'clock<00:03:31.670> and

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
o'clock four o'clock five o'clock and

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.839 
o'clock four o'clock five o'clock and
for<00:03:32.900> some<00:03:33.049> reason<00:03:33.080> I<00:03:33.590> notice<00:03:34.069> this<00:03:34.220> bug<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:34.730> I

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
for some reason I notice this bug and I

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.990 
for some reason I notice this bug and I
think<00:03:35.060> it's<00:03:35.180> in<00:03:35.299> 1.8<00:03:35.930> but<00:03:36.799> if<00:03:37.129> I<00:03:37.519> switch<00:03:37.849> it<00:03:37.970> to

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
think it's in 1.8 but if I switch it to

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.589 
think it's in 1.8 but if I switch it to
a<00:03:38.090> five<00:03:38.360> o'clock<00:03:38.540> it<00:03:38.959> actually<00:03:40.330> stops<00:03:41.330> the

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
a five o'clock it actually stops the

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.630 
a five o'clock it actually stops the
whole<00:03:41.720> thing<00:03:41.959> so<00:03:42.590> just<00:03:42.769> to<00:03:42.860> turn<00:03:43.069> it<00:03:43.189> restart

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
whole thing so just to turn it restart

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.220 
whole thing so just to turn it restart
it<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:43.879> just<00:03:43.970> flick<00:03:44.269> your<00:03:44.390> lever<00:03:44.720> lever

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
it you just flick your lever lever

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.679 
it you just flick your lever lever
whatever<00:03:45.920> you<00:03:46.040> want<00:03:46.189> to<00:03:46.250> call<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.489> up<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:47.480> down

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:47.689 
whatever you want to call it up and down

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:50.949 
whatever you want to call it up and down
and<00:03:48.159> it'll<00:03:49.159> go<00:03:49.340> ahead<00:03:49.549> and<00:03:49.640> restart<00:03:49.939> and<00:03:50.180> the

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
and it'll go ahead and restart and the

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.809 
and it'll go ahead and restart and the
nice<00:03:51.140> part<00:03:51.500> go<00:03:51.950> ahead<00:03:52.099> and<00:03:52.129> turn<00:03:52.280> that<00:03:52.459> off<00:03:52.610> I'm

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
nice part go ahead and turn that off I'm

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.759 
nice part go ahead and turn that off I'm
a<00:03:52.849> little<00:03:53.060> laggy<00:03:53.209> anyway<00:03:53.659> nice<00:03:54.470> part<00:03:54.739> about

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
a little laggy anyway nice part about

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.270 
a little laggy anyway nice part about
this<00:03:55.040> clock<00:03:55.400> is<00:03:55.780> this<00:03:56.780> clock<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.709> see<00:03:57.920> we'll

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
this clock is this clock and see we'll

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.860 
this clock is this clock and see we'll
do<00:03:58.430> one<00:03:58.700> two<00:03:59.000> three<00:03:59.420> click<00:04:00.200> this<00:04:00.860> clock<00:04:01.340> can<00:04:01.819> be

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
do one two three click this clock can be

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.399 
do one two three click this clock can be
infinitely<00:04:02.870> expanded<00:04:03.799> upon<00:04:04.510> so<00:04:05.510> whoops<00:04:06.140> I

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:06.409 
infinitely expanded upon so whoops I

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:12.709 
infinitely expanded upon so whoops I
want<00:04:06.950> that<00:04:07.010> there

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:12.719 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.720 

so<00:04:13.719> we're<00:04:14.140> going<00:04:14.260> to<00:04:14.379> go<00:04:14.409> ahead<00:04:14.469> place<00:04:15.250> a<00:04:15.280> lever

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
so we're going to go ahead place a lever

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.529 
so we're going to go ahead place a lever
to<00:04:15.849> turn<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:16.449> off<00:04:16.539> a<00:04:16.780> default<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:18.329> then<00:04:19.329> we're

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
to turn it off a default and then we're

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:26.159 
to turn it off a default and then we're
going<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:19.720> place<00:04:20.489> some<00:04:21.489> redstone<00:04:23.460> Peters<00:04:25.169> c8

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
going to place some redstone Peters c8

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.960 
going to place some redstone Peters c8
I'm<00:04:26.680> 10<00:04:27.220> and<00:04:27.509> bam<00:04:28.509> and<00:04:29.280> now<00:04:30.280> you<00:04:30.340> have<00:04:30.699> a

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
I'm 10 and bam and now you have a

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.080 
I'm 10 and bam and now you have a
one-second<00:04:31.930> clock<00:04:32.280> so<00:04:33.280> this<00:04:33.669> can<00:04:34.060> be

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
one-second clock so this can be

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.600 
one-second clock so this can be
infinitely<00:04:34.660> expanded<00:04:35.259> upon<00:04:35.530> you<00:04:36.100> have<00:04:36.310> a

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
infinitely expanded upon you have a

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.999 
infinitely expanded upon you have a
really<00:04:37.090> for<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.780> most<00:04:37.900> part<00:04:38.169> compact<00:04:38.740> one

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 
really for the most part compact one

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.779 
really for the most part compact one
second<00:04:39.460> clock<00:04:39.729> and<00:04:40.680> that's<00:04:41.680> also<00:04:41.979> able<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.580> be

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
second clock and that's also able to be

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.560 
second clock and that's also able to be
turned<00:04:43.060> on<00:04:43.270> and<00:04:43.960> off<00:04:44.530> they're<00:04:45.070> off<00:04:45.099> and<00:04:45.520> on<00:04:45.639> so

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
turned on and off they're off and on so

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.870 
turned on and off they're off and on so
anyway<00:04:46.840> guys<00:04:47.020> this<00:04:47.320> has<00:04:47.410> been<00:04:47.590> doc<00:04:47.889> redstone<00:04:48.610> I
