00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:16.730
 second hailed her like that 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.730

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.950
 whenever I 'm fine the word 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.020
 I was sending a weird voice a head 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:40.700
 weird also game means like that 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:41.570
 you ca appliances nowadays I 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.070
 think I'm going to stop doing that 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.200
 because frankly I have a headache 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.760
 device nowadays halloween it's 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:54.980
 more really fashionable for a reason 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:57.500
 very simple because it's not 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.510
 everything in some places to celebrate 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.650
 halloween did the trick or treat this 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.059
 which is a very simple way for 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.580
 win good bands without spending a 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.140
 round the trick or treat is to 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.300
 wander around the city with a 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.470
 ridiculous disguise and people then 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.930
 will give you candy for 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.940
 no reason but the difference 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.770
 between Paris and other places where 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.750
 do trill or treat in places 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.909
 where does this are small houses 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.630
 with only bells are no 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:26.840
 code is nothing while in paris there are 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:33.940
 codes know who is a little bit less 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:39.310
 practice then what is the code 0 1 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.310
