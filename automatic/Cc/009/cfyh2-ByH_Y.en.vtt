00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:11.490 
hypothetical evolution machine here we
see<00:00:09.400> the<00:00:09.639> evo<00:00:09.969> grid<00:00:10.240> simulation<00:00:11.139> cube

underlaying<00:00:12.160> buying<00:00:12.519> processors<00:00:13.179> lots<00:00:13.690> and

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:13.870 
underlaying buying processors lots and

underlaying buying processors lots and
lots<00:00:13.990> of<00:00:14.200> processors<00:00:14.769> and<00:00:14.950> as<00:00:15.669> we<00:00:15.849> come<00:00:16.120> in<00:00:16.270> we

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
lots of processors and as we come in we

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.019 
lots of processors and as we come in we
see<00:00:16.630> there's<00:00:16.840> particles<00:00:17.680> in<00:00:17.859> the<00:00:17.980> cube<00:00:18.279> the

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029 
see there's particles in the cube the

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.910 
see there's particles in the cube the
particles<00:00:19.510> are<00:00:19.630> starting<00:00:20.019> to<00:00:20.050> interact<00:00:20.560> and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
particles are starting to interact and

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.490 
particles are starting to interact and
then<00:00:21.789> suddenly<00:00:22.119> we<00:00:22.480> see<00:00:22.660> a<00:00:22.689> doubling<00:00:23.230> of<00:00:23.349> the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
then suddenly we see a doubling of the

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.339 
then suddenly we see a doubling of the
processors<00:00:24.160> and<00:00:24.490> then<00:00:25.179> doubling<00:00:25.599> again<00:00:25.750> and

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
processors and then doubling again and

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.470 
processors and then doubling again and
we're<00:00:27.310> starting<00:00:27.699> to<00:00:27.820> see<00:00:27.849> some<00:00:28.269> interesting

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
we're starting to see some interesting

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.790 
we're starting to see some interesting
phenomena<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:31.179> let's<00:00:31.359> dive<00:00:31.660> in<00:00:32.020> and<00:00:32.230> see<00:00:32.620> if<00:00:32.710> we

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
phenomena so let's dive in and see if we

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.670 
phenomena so let's dive in and see if we
can<00:00:32.950> see<00:00:33.100> something<00:00:33.370> happening<00:00:33.970> and<00:00:34.470> it<00:00:35.470> looks

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
can see something happening and it looks

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.560 
can see something happening and it looks
like<00:00:35.890> with<00:00:36.250> our<00:00:36.430> little<00:00:36.610> observer<00:00:37.030> camera

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
like with our little observer camera

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.000 
like with our little observer camera
we're<00:00:37.750> finding<00:00:38.140> something<00:00:38.410> interesting

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
we're finding something interesting

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.560 
we're finding something interesting
going<00:00:39.160> on<00:00:39.400> a<00:00:39.640> little<00:00:40.300> bit<00:00:40.540> of

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
going on a little bit of

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.280 
going on a little bit of
self-organization<00:00:41.350> is<00:00:41.980> happening<00:00:42.580> here<00:00:42.850> ah

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
self-organization is happening here ah

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.290 
self-organization is happening here ah
vesicle<00:00:44.290> has<00:00:44.440> formed<00:00:44.980> and<00:00:45.850> it's<00:00:46.060> got

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
vesicle has formed and it's got

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.510 
vesicle has formed and it's got
something<00:00:46.570> inside<00:00:46.810> it<00:00:47.050> let's<00:00:47.500> go<00:00:47.740> on<00:00:47.920> a<00:00:47.950> few

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
something inside it let's go on a few

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.630 
something inside it let's go on a few
billion<00:00:49.510> generations<00:00:50.170> and<00:00:50.460> we<00:00:51.460> have

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
billion generations and we have

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
billion generations and we have
something<00:00:52.000> a<00:00:52.030> little<00:00:52.150> more<00:00:52.270> interesting

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
something a little more interesting

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.250 
something a little more interesting
going<00:00:53.080> on<00:00:53.290> in<00:00:53.500> the<00:00:53.650> vesicles<00:00:54.160> and<00:00:55.080> a<00:00:56.080> little

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
going on in the vesicles and a little

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.920 
going on in the vesicles and a little
bit<00:00:56.320> more<00:00:56.500> structure<00:00:56.920> in<00:00:57.040> this<00:00:57.220> one<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:57.670> a<00:00:58.600> few

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
bit more structure in this one and a few

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.580 
bit more structure in this one and a few
billion<00:00:59.350> generations<00:00:59.980> later<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:02.230> all<00:01:02.410> we've

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
billion generations later and all we've

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.560 
billion generations later and all we've
got<00:01:02.620> a<00:01:03.040> little<00:01:03.370> bit<00:01:03.520> of<00:01:03.550> behavior<00:01:04.119> going<00:01:04.420> on

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
got a little bit of behavior going on

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.849 
got a little bit of behavior going on
it's<00:01:04.780> more<00:01:05.229> of<00:01:05.320> an<00:01:05.439> entity<00:01:05.679> and<00:01:07.560> let's<00:01:08.560> say

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:08.859 
it's more of an entity and let's say

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:10.499 
it's more of an entity and let's say
we've<00:01:09.100> gotta<00:01:09.250> read<00:01:09.460> complex<00:01:09.939> entity<00:01:10.359> here

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
we've gotta read complex entity here

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.219 
we've gotta read complex entity here
let's<00:01:10.719> push<00:01:11.020> this<00:01:11.289> along<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:12.990> put<00:01:13.990> it<00:01:14.079> into

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
let's push this along and put it into

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.560 
let's push this along and put it into
our<00:01:14.380> scanner<00:01:15.030> scanners<00:01:16.030> going<00:01:16.179> to<00:01:16.270> take<00:01:16.450> it

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
our scanner scanners going to take it

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.020 
our scanner scanners going to take it
apart<00:01:16.869> digitally<00:01:17.380> it's<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.770> digitally<00:01:18.579> evolved

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
apart digitally it's a digitally evolved

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.050 
apart digitally it's a digitally evolved
being<00:01:19.390> of<00:01:19.509> course<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.130> build<00:01:21.130> it's<00:01:21.340> a<00:01:21.670> little

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
being of course and build it's a little

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.520 
being of course and build it's a little

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
capsule of XML data

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.590 
capsule of XML data
now<00:01:26.159> we're<00:01:26.369> going<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.549> transmit<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.330> our

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.870 
beakers the formulated chemical soup
designed<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.230> be<00:02:16.380> like<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.830> original<00:02:17.280> sim

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
designed to be like the original sim

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.930 
designed to be like the original sim
cube<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.950> let's<00:02:19.950> see<00:02:20.130> if<00:02:20.250> our<00:02:20.370> creatures

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
cube and let's see if our creatures

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.390 
cube and let's see if our creatures
recognizing<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.930> chemicals<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:22.980> its<00:02:23.130> up

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
recognizing the chemicals and its up

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.790 
recognizing the chemicals and its up
running<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.239> algorithms<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.080> it's<00:02:25.319> swimming

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
running the algorithms and it's swimming

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.650 
running the algorithms and it's swimming
off<00:02:26.069> so<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.459> seems<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:26.819> be<00:02:27.060> off<00:02:27.269> to<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.510> good
