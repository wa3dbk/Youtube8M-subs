00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.790
 but this is the standard for choosing the floor and everything 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.739

 peacefully and gray you started doing a review 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.550
 because I lost here only a short time 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:45.020
 and there are very good people bitch well, except for 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.940
 of this homeless person of course he is now in 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.560
 black list of good people so well, 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.890
 Let's start with the fact that the first that comes across 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.870
 eyes running through the work as we understand 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.090
 a marshal adatov work mashu now we 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.880
 learn more about the work and this one 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.120
 restaurant whose stella scutari 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.570
 scooter up 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.180
 you call it here happiness here it 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.460
 Happiness so here this restaurant is very 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.220
 test mapping when 300 before who 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.310
 he owns that generally a good man he 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.180
 your scooter boyfriend is missing 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.120
 thing to review 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.140
 so people here are from the most important thing here 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.420
 server from experienced people because I 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.489
 itself is hard to find I found him only 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.040
 comments so it comes across 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.380
 on the eye this is a note mapping 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.980
 very nice sea ​​to text firewood here 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.959
 these all use it all so 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.790
 here mary looks very cool but she 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.739
 First we go further, so here is lspd 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.459

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.380
 futuristic u so don't know so i dont 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.930
 I know the fish do not stich on and signs in places this 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.239
 describe it well you yourself see from the discharge 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.620
 more modernity 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.450
 yes by the way, right now it's being done again 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.269
 competition and there are a lot of events and 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.640
 events that is, I played like about 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.860
 two hours I managed to visit two 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.030
 events and where in one I won 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.160
 by the way it was a race 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.780
 there whale skins followed us 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.489
 strange all sorts of things in hand there 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.140
 something like a relay race was 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:12.380
 shorter wands there transfer my doctor 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.150
 won here is shorter server very much 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.560
 nice at home by the way everything is sorted out 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.020
 that is, here 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.400
 it's all great here so much 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.920
 nice moment for example here it is 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.140
 the grille is up more made nicer than on 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.540
 samp-rp for example here thug start 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.790
 walks just like that with gangs very 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.650
 by the way nice stuff done here they are 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.590
 more any such really know 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.870
 gangsters here all the more atmospheric want 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.660
 small online yes about 200 people but 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.970
 people here are obviously experienced here do not know 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.970
 all the rules does not mean it does not have qrp 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.489
 just whip are impossible to find Take 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.989
 and scooters i.e. easy accessibility is 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:52.220
 all for the people is done for the sake of course 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.790
 convenience for the game and not for zadrotstva 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.190
 that is why I am here is understood as 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.150
 it is for this case that the review is shorter 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.930
 then there you are on here is a faction 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.610
 street racers that is for lovers 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.000
 chase here there is a separate fraction 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.580
 now show you it so go here idea 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.980
 will remember in a dude in a hurry something random 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.530
 sent them see past it 123 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.359
 quincy in here there is a hitman system then 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.450
 look i already ordered by the way here 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.780
 see so the contract write the contract 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.320
 Fuck contract said this yes 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.870
 eg 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:32.360
 Player id let's order viku century 7 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:34.850
 go ordered for 200,000 that's all 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.260
 ordered from thousands of centuries and now hitman 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.330
 and will they hunt they somewhere on in 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.979
 the forest is the miss krabi fraction of such 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.810
 I did not have time to find it was not destined to find me 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.340
 so here is this fraction of street racers 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.180
 have here they have horse racing look 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.129
 bullets come grandfather infernusy just 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.289
 meter my beach scooter 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:56.719
 that's all well all race cars in general 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:05:00.110
 them from gta that is what they still have well 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:02.300
 respa of course the soup is realized I am not 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.639
 I know that this repair some garage 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.909
 like garage see them there is a car 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.580
 I do not know so absolutely all billboards 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:12.489
 can be an advertising platform that is 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.179
 it is very convenient they are by the way 

00:05:12.489 --> 00:05:15.769
 located that is when you go to 

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:18.229
 just look up and and automatically 

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:20.059
 I think ads are so special attention 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.839
 stand out here of course that hospital 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:23.839
 such 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:26.149
 and the insulator for the violent is a particularly insulator 

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:28.610
 it is for me probably if about 

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:30.469
 there are no secrets but you bet no 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.899
 cabinet that is people appear dying in 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:34.849
 hospital meaning it is more or more magnificent 

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:37.129
 so here there are three sites for 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.529
 recovery hp and there is a drug treatment 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:41.569
 dispensary is not an office that is donuts 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:44.539
 which in there in the groove there in the balances 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:46.309
 can easily become yes and take a course from 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:49.219
 it's from breaking and all shit 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:50.689
 i.e. it is more automated here 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:53.779
 this one here is a very hospital system 

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:57.619
 nice that you scooter hijacked 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:06:03.369
 this minus and the scooter give me the scooter sound 

00:05:57.619 --> 00:06:03.369
 Aydin yes and scooter password

 a scooter is an inseparable thing so so 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.919
 see see keiko administration this 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:25.589
 weapon in the open form of the green zone 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:26.159
 from well that is to merge here very strictly 

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:28.949

 friends play but here it is more 

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:35.759
 roleplay but at the same time 

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:37.199
 entertainment entertainment in terms of 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.029
 the fact that you need to save your 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:39.659

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:41.759
 without scooter 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:45.529
