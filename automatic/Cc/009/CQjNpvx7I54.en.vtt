you can use that whatever but i just use

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.660 
you can use that whatever but i just use
that<00:00:37.200> or<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.500> can<00:00:37.649> just<00:00:37.829> skip<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.219> part<00:00:38.280> all

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
that or you can just skip that part all

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.299 
that or you can just skip that part all
together<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:40.140> know<00:00:40.170> just<00:00:41.040> skip

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
that part but I feel that the transition

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.729 
that part but I feel that the transition
makes<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.370> blend<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:45.329> bit<00:00:45.780> better<00:00:45.989> just<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.530> don't

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
applying that to the center of my eyelid

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.690 
applying that to the center of my eyelid
and<00:01:49.110> then<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.350> went<00:01:49.619> back<00:01:49.920> again<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.280> kind<00:01:50.579> of

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
and then I went back again and kind of

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.429 
and then I went back again and kind of
added<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.360> bit<00:01:51.540> more<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.020> sides<00:01:52.259> there<00:01:53.180> and

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
added a bit more to the sides there and

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:57.080 
added a bit more to the sides there and
now<00:01:55.439> with<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.710> shorter<00:01:56.130> shader<00:01:56.430> brush<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.909> mean

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
now with the shorter shader brush I mean

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.660 
now with the shorter shader brush I mean
the<00:01:57.240> color<00:01:57.420> me9<00:01:57.960> 30<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.680> dark<00:01:59.040> purple<00:01:59.430> color

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
the color me9 30 that dark purple color

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.840 
the color me9 30 that dark purple color
and<00:01:59.939> I'm<00:02:00.719> going<00:02:00.750> into<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:02.100> inner<00:02:02.460> corner

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
and I'm going into the inner corner

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.510 
and I'm going into the inner corner
there<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.810> outer<00:02:03.960> corner<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.340> use

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
there and the outer corner you can use

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.119 
there and the outer corner you can use
the<00:02:05.700> same<00:02:05.909> brush<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.570> would<00:02:06.990> recommend<00:02:07.560> wiping

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
the same brush I would recommend wiping

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.979 
the same brush I would recommend wiping
it<00:02:08.250> off<00:02:08.340> once<00:02:08.700> you're<00:02:08.849> done<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.450> mean<00:02:09.750> when

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
it off once you're done I mean when

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:10.889 
it off once you're done I mean when
you're<00:02:10.110> done<00:02:10.560> with

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
you're done with

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.360 
you're done with
one<00:02:10.989> color<00:02:11.230> going<00:02:11.560> into<00:02:11.769> the<00:02:11.860> neck<00:02:12.069> so<00:02:12.250> they

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
one color going into the neck so they

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.949 
one color going into the neck so they
won't<00:02:12.489> kind<00:02:12.760> of<00:02:12.849> bleed<00:02:13.239> into<00:02:13.510> each<00:02:13.540> other<00:02:13.810> you

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
won't kind of bleed into each other you

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.500 
won't kind of bleed into each other you
know<00:02:14.079> so<00:02:14.290> anyway<00:02:15.250> like<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.549> said<00:02:15.579> outer<00:02:16.030> corner

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
know so anyway like I said outer corner

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.020 
know so anyway like I said outer corner
there<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.079> then<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.500> am<00:02:17.799> going<00:02:18.040> just<00:02:18.189> into<00:02:18.819> the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
there and then I am going just into the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.250 
there and then I am going just into the
crease<00:02:19.569> right<00:02:19.930> at<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.260> very<00:02:20.769> top<00:02:21.189> and<00:02:22.260> then

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
crease right at the very top and then

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.380 
crease right at the very top and then
I'm<00:02:23.709> doing<00:02:23.829> that<00:02:24.099> shape<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:24.640> always<00:02:25.180> like

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
I'm doing that shape that I always like

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.470 
I'm doing that shape that I always like
yellow<00:02:25.780> my<00:02:25.959> know<00:02:26.319> by<00:02:26.500> now<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.920> lifted<00:02:27.430> look

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
yellow my know by now that lifted look

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.020 
yellow my know by now that lifted look
y'all<00:02:28.480> can<00:02:28.629> keep<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.409> eye<00:02:29.439> shape<00:02:29.980> as<00:02:30.189> is

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
y'all can keep it the eye shape as is

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.119 
y'all can keep it the eye shape as is
but<00:02:31.510> I'm<00:02:32.019> just<00:02:32.170> doing<00:02:32.409> that<00:02:32.500> little<00:02:32.680> pointy

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
but I'm just doing that little pointy

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.380 
but I'm just doing that little pointy
shape<00:02:33.340> there<00:02:33.519> at<00:02:33.609> the<00:02:33.670> end<00:02:33.819> you<00:02:33.909> don't<00:02:34.060> have<00:02:34.209> to

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
shape there at the end you don't have to

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.569 
shape there at the end you don't have to
and<00:02:34.959> now<00:02:35.260> I'm<00:02:35.560> getting<00:02:35.859> my<00:02:36.010> shader<00:02:36.340> brush<00:02:36.400> and

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
and now I'm getting my shader brush and

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.550 
and now I'm getting my shader brush and
I'm<00:02:36.819> just<00:02:37.120> blending<00:02:37.629> the<00:02:37.780> two<00:02:37.900> colors<00:02:38.379> in

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
I'm just blending the two colors in

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.979 
I'm just blending the two colors in
together<00:02:38.890> very<00:02:39.340> softly<00:02:40.060> making<00:02:40.450> tiny<00:02:40.720> little

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
together very softly making tiny little

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.319 
together very softly making tiny little
strokes<00:02:41.319> now<00:02:42.310> I'm<00:02:42.370> getting<00:02:42.609> the<00:02:42.640> transition

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
strokes now I'm getting the transition

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.569 
strokes now I'm getting the transition
color<00:02:43.480> I'm<00:02:43.989> using<00:02:44.019> Mac<00:02:44.530> soft<00:02:44.829> Brown<00:02:45.159> and<00:02:45.489> I<00:02:45.549> am

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
color I'm using Mac soft Brown and I am

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:49.500 
color I'm using Mac soft Brown and I am
applying<00:02:45.940> that<00:02:46.299> into<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.650> crease<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:49.269> bit

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
applying that into the crease and a bit

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.379 
applying that into the crease and a bit
above<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.310> like<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.459> said<00:02:51.519> you<00:02:51.700> can<00:02:51.879> skip<00:02:52.239> the

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
above it like I said you can skip the

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.149 
above it like I said you can skip the
part<00:02:52.629> with<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:52.750> transition<00:02:53.170> color<00:02:53.440> but<00:02:53.739> I<00:02:53.769> feel

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
part with a transition color but I feel

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.190 
part with a transition color but I feel
that<00:02:54.459> it<00:02:54.670> just<00:02:54.940> brings<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.480> look<00:02:55.720> together<00:02:55.930> a

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
that it just brings the look together a

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.770 
that it just brings the look together a
bit<00:02:56.409> better<00:02:56.639> now<00:02:57.639> I'm<00:02:57.730> using<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.269> point<00:02:58.569> in

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
bit better now I'm using the point in

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.500 
bit better now I'm using the point in
blending<00:02:59.409> just<00:02:59.650> the<00:03:00.159> very<00:03:00.879> edge<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.389> the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
blending just the very edge of the

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.780 
blending just the very edge of the
purple<00:03:01.840> color<00:03:02.079> and<00:03:02.409> the<00:03:03.010> transition<00:03:03.579> color

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
purple color and the transition color

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.530 
purple color and the transition color
together<00:03:04.209> just<00:03:04.569> blending<00:03:05.230> them<00:03:05.349> together

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.780 

and<00:03:10.780> then<00:03:11.560> I'm<00:03:11.680> using<00:03:11.709> another<00:03:12.129> blender<00:03:12.670> brush

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
and then I'm using another blender brush

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.479 
and then I'm using another blender brush
a<00:03:12.909> clean<00:03:13.150> one<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.689> blend<00:03:14.379> out<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.709> very<00:03:14.950> top<00:03:15.280> of

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
a clean one to blend out the very top of

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.929 
a clean one to blend out the very top of
the<00:03:15.640> transition<00:03:16.269> color<00:03:17.310> I'm<00:03:18.310> going<00:03:18.519> back<00:03:18.760> in

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:18.939 
the transition color I'm going back in

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:20.190 
the transition color I'm going back in
with<00:03:18.970> that<00:03:19.180> purple<00:03:19.540> I<00:03:19.629> feel<00:03:19.840> like<00:03:19.989> a<00:03:20.019> little

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
with that purple I feel like a little

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.410 
with that purple I feel like a little
bit<00:03:20.439> of<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.890> darkness<00:03:21.640> of<00:03:21.879> it<00:03:22.030> was<00:03:22.180> lost

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
bit of the darkness of it was lost

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.140 
bit of the darkness of it was lost
whenever<00:03:22.870> I<00:03:22.930> blended<00:03:23.500> out<00:03:24.159> the<00:03:24.459> colors<00:03:24.790> so<00:03:25.000> I'm

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
whenever I blended out the colors so I'm

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.000 
whenever I blended out the colors so I'm
just<00:03:25.360> adding<00:03:25.599> more<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.230> I'm<00:03:26.680> getting<00:03:26.920> that

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
just adding more and I'm getting that

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.770 
just adding more and I'm getting that
transition<00:03:27.610> again<00:03:27.700> soft<00:03:28.090> Brown<00:03:28.299> and<00:03:28.480> applying

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
transition again soft Brown and applying

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.330 
transition again soft Brown and applying
that<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:28.989> the<00:03:29.230> inner<00:03:29.379> corner<00:03:30.129> and<00:03:30.280> then

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
that to the inner corner and then

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.880 
that to the inner corner and then
meeting<00:03:30.670> up<00:03:30.849> with<00:03:30.879> the<00:03:31.120> brow<00:03:31.379> I'm<00:03:32.379> getting<00:03:32.680> em

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
meeting up with the brow I'm getting em

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.210 
meeting up with the brow I'm getting em
a<00:03:33.099> 512<00:03:34.030> and<00:03:34.329> applying<00:03:34.930> that<00:03:35.140> as<00:03:35.379> the<00:03:35.680> highlight

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
a 512 and applying that as the highlight

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:44.780
