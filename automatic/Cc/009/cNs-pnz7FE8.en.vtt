okay<00:00:14.490> people<00:00:15.049> I'm<00:00:16.049> going<00:00:16.200> to<00:00:16.290> show<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.530> how<00:00:17.369> to

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
okay people I'm going to show you how to

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.810 
okay people I'm going to show you how to
build<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.820> Bombay<00:00:18.420> for<00:00:19.020> your<00:00:19.170> aircraft<00:00:19.760> this<00:00:20.760> is

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
build a Bombay for your aircraft this is

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.280 
build a Bombay for your aircraft this is
a<00:00:21.029> mock-up<00:00:22.160> that<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.189> built<00:00:23.900> just<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.110> I<00:00:25.170> could

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.290 
a mock-up that I built just so I could

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.609 
a mock-up that I built just so I could
test<00:00:25.650> my<00:00:25.830> theory<00:00:27.020> make<00:00:28.020> sure<00:00:28.230> everything

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
test my theory make sure everything

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.600 
test my theory make sure everything
worked<00:00:28.860> and<00:00:29.430> there<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.449> see<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.660> servo<00:00:31.610> it's

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
worked and there you see the servo it's

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.830 
worked and there you see the servo it's
connected<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.710> one<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.830> my<00:00:34.949> aircraft<00:00:35.660> just<00:00:36.660> for

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
connected to one of my aircraft just for

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.920 
connected to one of my aircraft just for
power<00:00:37.309> so<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.370> can<00:00:38.489> test<00:00:39.180> everything<00:00:39.510> make<00:00:39.900> sure

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
power so I can test everything make sure

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.740 
power so I can test everything make sure
it<00:00:40.290> works<00:00:40.470> correctly<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:45.059> mock-up<00:00:45.570> is

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
it works correctly the mock-up is

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.140 
it works correctly the mock-up is
approximately<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.680> same<00:00:46.890> size<00:00:46.949> and<00:00:47.699> shape<00:00:47.970> of

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
approximately the same size and shape of

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.630 
approximately the same size and shape of
the<00:00:48.210> Bombay<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.839> trying<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.229> build<00:00:49.519> except<00:00:50.519> I

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the Bombay and trying to build except I

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.280 
the Bombay and trying to build except I
made<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.000> half<00:00:51.210> an<00:00:51.390> inch<00:00:51.510> wider<00:00:54.019> so<00:00:55.019> I'd<00:00:55.140> be

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
made it a half an inch wider so I'd be

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.439 
made it a half an inch wider so I'd be
able<00:00:55.409> to<00:00:55.500> see<00:00:55.739> operation<00:00:56.519> and<00:00:56.729> ensure<00:00:57.390> that

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
able to see operation and ensure that

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.939 
able to see operation and ensure that
the<00:00:57.720> doors<00:00:58.049> are<00:00:58.409> working<00:00:59.159> properly

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
the doors are working properly

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.140 
the doors are working properly
right<00:01:01.949> now<00:01:02.100> they're<00:01:02.339> just<00:01:02.369> attached<00:01:02.879> with

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
right now they're just attached with

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.469 
right now they're just attached with
tape<00:01:04.250> eventually<00:01:05.250> they'll<00:01:05.850> be<00:01:06.000> attached<00:01:06.299> with

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
tape eventually they'll be attached with

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:06.800 
tape eventually they'll be attached with
it

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
it

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.590 
it
nylon<00:01:07.770> hinge<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.729> ensure<00:01:09.030> they<00:01:09.240> don't<00:01:09.299> move

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
nylon hinge to ensure they don't move

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.350 
nylon hinge to ensure they don't move
anywhere

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
anywhere

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.690 
anywhere
this<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.540> mock<00:01:13.170> up<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.619> just<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.979> ensure<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.430> I

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
this is mock up is just to ensure that I

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.740 
this is mock up is just to ensure that I
get<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.090> servo<00:01:15.510> operation<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:17.570> mechanism<00:01:18.570> to

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
get the servo operation the mechanism to

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.380 
get the servo operation the mechanism to
open<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.260> close<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.680> doors<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.400> get

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
open and close the doors and get

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.250 
open and close the doors and get
everything<00:01:21.540> lined<00:01:21.930> up<00:01:22.290> as<00:01:22.710> best<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.310> can<00:01:24.260> so

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
everything lined up as best I can so

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.260 
everything lined up as best I can so
here's<00:01:25.470> how<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.740> works<00:01:28.430> with<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.610> gear<00:01:29.880> switch

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
here's how it works with the gear switch

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.100 
here's how it works with the gear switch
on<00:01:30.690> my<00:01:31.140> radio<00:01:31.380> I'll<00:01:31.890> flip<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:33.120> and<00:01:33.330> hopefully

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
on my radio I'll flip that and hopefully

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.700 
on my radio I'll flip that and hopefully
get<00:01:34.560> operation<00:01:36.200> there<00:01:37.200> we<00:01:37.350> go

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
get operation there we go

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.260 
get operation there we go
like<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:37.980> said<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.640> door<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:38.970> attached<00:01:39.240> with

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
like I said the door is attached with

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.230 
like I said the door is attached with
tape<00:01:39.690> right<00:01:39.960> now<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:41.010> not<00:01:41.240> exactly

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
tape right now so it's not exactly

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.800 
tape right now so it's not exactly
perfect

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.840 

but<00:01:46.810> you<00:01:46.930> get<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.200> idea<00:01:47.890> doors<00:01:48.340> open

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
but you get the idea doors open

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.700 
but you get the idea doors open
completely<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:51.720> once<00:01:52.720> attached<00:01:53.110> with<00:01:53.530> the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
completely and once attached with the

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.969 
completely and once attached with the
nylon<00:01:53.860> hinges<00:01:54.900> they<00:01:55.900> will<00:01:56.080> close<00:01:56.320> completely

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
nylon hinges they will close completely

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.490 
nylon hinges they will close completely
and<00:01:57.520> it<00:01:58.150> will<00:01:58.270> be<00:01:58.360> a<00:01:58.390> flush<00:01:58.750> surface<00:01:59.260> across

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
and it will be a flush surface across

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.350 
and it will be a flush surface across
here<00:02:00.300> it's<00:02:01.300> large<00:02:01.720> enough<00:02:02.080> to<00:02:02.110> fit<00:02:02.530> many

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
here it's large enough to fit many

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.639 
here it's large enough to fit many
different<00:02:04.360> things<00:02:05.190> initially<00:02:06.190> I<00:02:07.440> found<00:02:08.440> this

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
different things initially I found this

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.160 
different things initially I found this
at<00:02:09.220> Target

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
at Target

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.120 
at Target
thought<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.290> would<00:02:11.350> be<00:02:11.500> perfect<00:02:11.680> it's

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
thought it would be perfect it's

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.320 
thought it would be perfect it's
approximately<00:02:12.970> 6<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.080> 3/4<00:02:14.590> inches<00:02:14.890> long<00:02:15.330> fits

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
approximately 6 and 3/4 inches long fits

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.350 
approximately 6 and 3/4 inches long fits
right<00:02:16.540> inside<00:02:17.489> closed<00:02:18.489> doors<00:02:21.030> don't<00:02:22.030> go<00:02:22.150> crazy

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
right inside closed doors don't go crazy

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.449 
right inside closed doors don't go crazy
on<00:02:22.570> me<00:02:22.780> now<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.810> we've<00:02:25.959> got<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.290> bomb<00:02:26.530> inside

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
on me now so we've got the bomb inside

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:36.410 
on me now so we've got the bomb inside
the<00:02:27.880> bomb<00:02:28.090> bay<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.820> simulate<00:02:35.280> look

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
the bomb bay and just to simulate look

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.900 
the bomb bay and just to simulate look
here<00:02:37.420> we<00:02:37.540> go<00:02:38.220> simulate<00:02:39.220> an<00:02:39.370> aircraft

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
here we go simulate an aircraft

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.290 
here we go simulate an aircraft
operation<00:02:40.750> here<00:02:41.340> it's<00:02:42.340> flying<00:02:45.060> open<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.120> bomb

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
operation here it's flying open the bomb

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.170 
operation here it's flying open the bomb
bay<00:02:46.540> doors<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:48.220> bomb<00:02:48.430> drops<00:02:48.760> out<00:02:51.180> take

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
bay doors and the bomb drops out take

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.640 
bay doors and the bomb drops out take
another<00:02:52.420> look<00:02:52.600> here<00:02:53.340> get<00:02:54.340> servo<00:02:55.230> one<00:02:56.230> servo

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
another look here get servo one servo

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.940 
another look here get servo one servo
arm<00:02:58.830> plastic<00:02:59.830> attachments<00:03:00.579> for<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.540> doors

arm plastic attachments for the doors

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.180 
arm plastic attachments for the doors
which<00:03:02.950> will<00:03:03.160> eventually<00:03:04.440> have<00:03:05.440> hinges<00:03:05.920> on<00:03:06.070> it

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
which will eventually have hinges on it

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.640 
which will eventually have hinges on it
to<00:03:06.310> hold<00:03:06.430> them<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.420> better<00:03:07.870> position<00:03:08.110> and

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
to hold them to a better position and

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.000 
to hold them to a better position and
one<00:03:09.610> servo<00:03:10.090> arm<00:03:10.329> to<00:03:11.049> actuate<00:03:11.440> it<00:03:11.560> and<00:03:11.769> open
