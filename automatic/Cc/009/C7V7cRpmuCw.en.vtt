00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.980
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.910
 another video of me in autocad 2013 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.600
 Today I thought I'll show you 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.080
 just how to be in autocad 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:18.380
 and in advance I will show you but first 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.450
 how to axis the iks and y and z 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.630
 can change 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.890
 just click on the axis 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.170
 the blue dots meet here 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.050
 which you can click on 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.649
 Just do it now 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.860
 you can see the exact stop in 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.450
 Do whatever direction you want 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.390
 But I'll leave that for now though 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.730
 show more that it works 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.130
 so 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.890
 then the y-axis would have been where I was 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:51.829
 and where it is partly nothing 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.280
 back and what we after 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.740
 need to be the dimensioning 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.390
 z-axis slip 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.390
 just like that 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.840
 but that's okay and you see that 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.840
 raster has changed now 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.049
 so 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.119
 before 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.530
 after that, in principle, the grid 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.210
 changes 90 degrees as it does 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:25.070
 actually should be ok 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.070
 Let's make his origin 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.970
 so the funny beginning 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.370
 and dimension exactly 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.500
 this is about a 3d modeling 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.500
 and let's first draw my body 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.719
 so 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.610
 I do not know how tall how wide 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.830
 long it 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.570
 and then 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.680
 already a few areas, although I thought 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.680
 me in a circle 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.940
 do 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.130
 I did not have it right now 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.430
 aligned grid 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.250
 So receive mode and there it is 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.560
 very symmetrical so has a box 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.350
 a centimeter or just hold the one 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.880
 unit 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.910
 so there would have wanted to have a free circle 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.020
 sometimes so popp knows now too 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.980
 not the circumference and not the radius 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.640
 so that a few lines around me 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.640
 show you this 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.220
 at what angle 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.900
 is now first matter 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.459
 maybe for you 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.930
 if you want to have a line with 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.579
 certain angle channel if your one 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.159
 room if you make your property 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:51.300
 want or so and there is my reason 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:54.690
 wanted to sign 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:58.220
 exactly first with the 3d dice 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.220
 I push again now to the 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.270
 not even that way 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.890
 it is also okay so dice at 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.360
 eat reasonably 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.860
 I go to the label 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.570
 up here on linear dimension 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.280
 but I 'll click the bottom one 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.280
 knew that was going on 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.910
 the corners of the dice 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:37.800
 I want to know and then shoot long 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:41.100
 and you see the thing is 1988 0 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.680
 langlau willing to see him differently 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.260
 then I go to the other side now 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.800
 because that's exactly what you want there exactly 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.470
 the same 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.990
 I go to the corner 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.090
 and a corner and watch out 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.250
 that look similar to how it arrives here 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.099
 and then the values ​​do not quite fit 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.129
 because then you have the dice 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:07.650
 the edge length of the cube plus the and 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:11.000
 he did not want that he wanted before 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.000
 have the body the dimensions 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.520
 jut 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.889
 then you can do that for so long 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:24.270
 push as you want 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:28.830
 In that case my cube is 2.4 778 long 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.830
 so now it's about the height 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.470
 if I did it like this 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:37.180
 now with the two here then that would be 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.180
 it will not work 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.520
 yes i have a little bit at the beginning 

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:46.690
 presented easier but good 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:50.400
 you see you would have seen 000 he was from 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.400
 the edge therefore 0 0 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.290
 So now we move the z-axis 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:03.180
 This meant on the axis and 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.210
 introduce ourselves again caught and 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.319
 go 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.319
 porto mode one 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:15.640
 so and you see 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.640
 the grid
