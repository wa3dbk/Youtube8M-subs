00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
kind you buy at the hardware store this

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.770 
kind you buy at the hardware store this
is<00:00:46.829> how<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.190> looks

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
is how this looks

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.150

these<00:00:48.780> were<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.110> last<00:00:49.140> chips<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:51.510> I'm<00:00:51.629> gonna

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
these were the last chips and I'm gonna

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.380 
these were the last chips and I'm gonna
toss<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.430> oil<00:00:53.820> I'm<00:00:54.000> going<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.239> use

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
toss this oil I'm going to use

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.110 
toss this oil I'm going to use
heavy-duty<00:00:54.899> foil<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.590> time<00:00:56.120> basically

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
heavy-duty foil this time basically

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.630 
heavy-duty foil this time basically
that's<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> deep<00:00:57.870> depth<00:00:58.379> depth<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.430> pot

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
that's the deep depth depth of the pot

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.090 
that's the deep depth depth of the pot
right<00:01:00.329> there<00:01:00.600> about<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.140> good<00:01:01.410> probably<00:01:01.859> 4

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
right there about a good probably 4

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.830 
right there about a good probably 4

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.700 
inches deep with some oil in there and I
got<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:08.600> actually<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.630> bought<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.170> off<00:01:10.290> finger

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
got this actually I bought it off finger

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.910 
got this actually I bought it off finger
hood<00:01:10.970> and<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.090> just<00:01:12.360> picked<00:01:12.630> up<00:01:12.780> ordered<00:01:13.770> it

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.679 
hood and I just picked up ordered it
they<00:01:14.220> shifted<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.909> paid<00:01:15.150> for<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.479> right

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
they shifted and I paid for it right

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.810 
they shifted and I paid for it right
away<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.170> didn't<00:01:16.439> get<00:01:16.530> overcharged<00:01:17.340> for<00:01:17.670> it

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
away so I didn't get overcharged for it

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.149 
away so I didn't get overcharged for it
there<00:01:18.570> was<00:01:18.720> no<00:01:18.840> interest<00:01:19.229> or<00:01:19.439> anything<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.040> it

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
there was no interest or anything so it

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.730 
there was no interest or anything so it
was<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.310> think<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.580> was<00:01:20.610> like<00:01:20.790> $90<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.780> haven't

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.390 
was I think it was like $90 I haven't
been<00:01:22.830> able<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.070> find<00:01:23.340> one<00:01:23.610> sense<00:01:25.070> but<00:01:26.070> anyway

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
been able to find one sense but anyway

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.850 
been able to find one sense but anyway
the<00:01:26.689> smoker<00:01:27.689> wood<00:01:27.900> chips<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.439> look<00:01:28.680> like

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
the smoker wood chips for this look like

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.679 
the smoker wood chips for this look like
they<00:01:29.310> come<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.610> these<00:01:29.700> containers<00:01:30.270> like<00:01:30.479> this

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
they come in these containers like this

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.550 
they come in these containers like this
they're<00:01:30.900> very<00:01:31.110> fine<00:01:31.970> almost<00:01:32.970> like<00:01:33.560> sawdust

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
they're very fine almost like sawdust

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.770 
they're very fine almost like sawdust
almost<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:35.250> not<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.759> have<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.970> little<00:01:36.509> bit<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
almost but not to have a little bit of a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.630 
almost but not to have a little bit of a
chip<00:01:37.020> consistency<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.100> they're<00:01:38.250> not<00:01:38.400> like<00:01:38.610> a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
chip consistency so they're not like a

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.020 
chip consistency so they're not like a
dust<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.350> this<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> cherry<00:01:41.040> flavor<00:01:41.430> which

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
dust and this is a cherry flavor which

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.149 
dust and this is a cherry flavor which
wood<00:01:42.540> chips<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.049> then<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.500> Hickory<00:01:43.829> I

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
wood chips and then this is Hickory I

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.520 
wood chips and then this is Hickory I
also<00:01:44.520> have<00:01:44.820> Apple<00:01:45.299> maple<00:01:45.659> oak<00:01:45.840> kind<00:01:48.530> and

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
also have Apple maple oak kind and

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.679 
also have Apple maple oak kind and
basically<00:01:50.009> just<00:01:50.430> kind<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.790> use<00:01:51.390> your<00:01:51.570> own

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
basically just kind of use your own

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.480 
basically just kind of use your own
judgement<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.320> more<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.680> use<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.920> more<00:01:53.340> they

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
judgement the more you use the more they

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.469 
judgement the more you use the more they
will<00:01:53.670> smoke<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.780> these<00:01:55.079> are<00:01:55.290> cherry<00:01:56.479> and

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
will smoke and these are cherry and

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.620 
will smoke and these are cherry and
that's<00:01:57.719> probably<00:01:58.170> about<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.890> tablespoon<00:01:59.630> and

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
that's probably about a tablespoon and

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.780 
that's probably about a tablespoon and
it<00:02:01.049> also<00:02:01.290> makes<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.740> Hickory<00:02:02.100> since<00:02:02.430> we<00:02:02.579> have

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
it also makes the Hickory since we have

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.209 
it also makes the Hickory since we have
a

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.850 

that<00:02:06.359> brown<00:02:07.359> sugar<00:02:07.390> on<00:02:07.869> there<00:02:08.259> I<00:02:08.440> didn't<00:02:08.709> want

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
that brown sugar on there I didn't want

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.350 
that brown sugar on there I didn't want
