so<00:00:00.329> you<00:00:00.420> can<00:00:00.780> see<00:00:01.050> that<00:00:01.500> bring<00:00:01.800> up<00:00:01.949> a<00:00:02.040> drum

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
so you can see that bring up a drum

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.039 
so you can see that bring up a drum
pattern<00:00:02.429> is<00:00:02.790> very<00:00:03.179> very<00:00:03.360> easy<00:00:03.540> here<00:00:03.810> just

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
pattern is very very easy here just

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.039 
pattern is very very easy here just
press<00:00:04.259> track<00:00:04.650> and<00:00:04.920> assign<00:00:05.250> a<00:00:05.279> drum<00:00:05.759> pattern<00:00:06.049> to

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
press track and assign a drum pattern to

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.970 
press track and assign a drum pattern to
it<00:00:07.370> but<00:00:08.370> you're<00:00:08.580> looped<00:00:09.000> patterns<00:00:09.769> don't<00:00:10.769> have

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
it but you're looped patterns don't have

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.220 
it but you're looped patterns don't have
to<00:00:11.130> be<00:00:11.219> pre-recorded<00:00:11.969> loops<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:13.080> can

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
to be pre-recorded loops you can

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.379 
to be pre-recorded loops you can
actually<00:00:13.440> record<00:00:13.740> loops<00:00:14.250> onto<00:00:14.670> any<00:00:14.880> open

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
actually record loops onto any open

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.540 
actually record loops onto any open
track<00:00:15.630> check<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.049> out

the very top and we'll press track and
it's<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.670> second<00:01:33.180> one<00:01:33.270> down<00:01:33.479> here<00:01:33.869> loop<00:01:34.470> turn

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
it's the second one down here loop turn

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.850 
it's the second one down here loop turn
that<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.880> okay<00:01:36.600> once<00:01:36.900> that's<00:01:37.110> turned<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:37.650> press

that on okay once that's turned on press
Enter<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.049> you<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.200> see<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.590> loop<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.130> turned

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
Enter and you can see the loop is turned

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.060 
Enter and you can see the loop is turned
on<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:41.880> this<00:01:42.090> particular<00:01:42.390> track<00:01:42.960> at<00:01:43.259> this

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
on for this particular track at this

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.300 
on for this particular track at this
point<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.390> length<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.869> time<00:01:46.310> so

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
point and for this length of time so

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.830 
point and for this length of time so
here's<00:01:47.610> what<00:01:47.729> we<00:01:47.850> do<00:01:48.000> we<00:01:48.270> go<00:01:48.479> down<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
here's what we do we go down to the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.710 
here's what we do we go down to the
position<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.470> hit<00:01:49.860> enter<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.640> check<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.600> out

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
position and hit enter and check it out

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.230 
position and hit enter and check it out
I<00:01:51.750> mean<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.439> like<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:53.549> know<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.700> high-end

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
I mean this is like you know a high-end

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.359 
I mean this is like you know a high-end
sampler<00:01:54.750> here<00:01:54.930> we<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.530> go<00:01:55.710> through<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.280> we

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
sampler here we can go through and we

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.330 
sampler here we can go through and we
can<00:01:56.549> zoom<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.719> out<00:01:57.930> at<00:01:58.469> this<00:01:59.070> waveform

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
can zoom in and out at this waveform

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.280 
can zoom in and out at this waveform
this<00:01:59.729> doesn't<00:02:00.000> change<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.420> volume<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:01.079> if

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
this doesn't change the volume but if

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.859 
this doesn't change the volume but if
you've<00:02:01.469> got<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.829> fairly<00:02:02.100> low<00:02:02.509> waveform<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:03.689> can

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
you've got a fairly low waveform we can

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.510 
you've got a fairly low waveform we can
easily<00:02:04.170> see<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.649> spikes<00:02:04.950> here<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.369> don't

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
easily see the spikes here so I don't

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.640 
easily see the spikes here so I don't
need<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.670> zoom<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.149> here

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
need to zoom in here

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.900 
need to zoom in here
but<00:02:06.830> here's<00:02:07.070> the<00:02:07.160> deal<00:02:07.340> we<00:02:07.520> want<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:07.760> go<00:02:07.880> over

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
but here's the deal we want to go over

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.150 
but here's the deal we want to go over
to<00:02:08.030> position<00:02:08.509> here<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:09.440> check<00:02:09.890> it<00:02:10.009> out

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
to position here and check it out

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.520 
to position here and check it out
because<00:02:10.520> I<00:02:10.790> played<00:02:11.300> this<00:02:11.510> in<00:02:11.750> time<00:02:12.110> with<00:02:12.380> my

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
because I played this in time with my

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.770 
because I played this in time with my
drums<00:02:12.830> I<00:02:13.040> know<00:02:13.130> that<00:02:13.700> I<00:02:13.820> want<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.240> beginning

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
drums I know that I want the beginning

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.450 
drums I know that I want the beginning
of<00:02:14.870> this<00:02:14.990> loop<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:15.500> don't<00:02:15.980> want<00:02:16.100> it<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.280> be<00:02:16.370> at

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
of this loop I don't want it to be at

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.280 
of this loop I don't want it to be at
the<00:02:16.520> beginning<00:02:16.910> right<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.300> wanted<00:02:17.660> to<00:02:17.750> advance

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
the beginning right I wanted to advance

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.520 
the beginning right I wanted to advance
that<00:02:18.680> so<00:02:19.100> that<00:02:19.220> it<00:02:19.310> starts<00:02:19.730> right<00:02:20.240> at<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:21.320> top

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
that so that it starts right at the top

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.430 
that so that it starts right at the top
of<00:02:21.740> measure<00:02:21.980> three<00:02:22.370> for<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.510> number<00:02:24.260> of

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
of measure three for a number of

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.190 
of measure three for a number of
measures<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.180> could<00:02:26.330> bring<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.600> all<00:02:27.020> the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
measures so I could bring that all the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.460 
measures so I could bring that all the
way<00:02:27.320> back<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:27.860> say<00:02:28.370> I<00:02:28.640> want<00:02:29.300> that<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.840> be<00:02:29.870> two

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
way back and say I want that to be two

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.910 
way back and say I want that to be two
measures<00:02:30.830> long<00:02:32.020> so<00:02:33.020> you<00:02:33.110> can<00:02:33.230> see<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.530> starts

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
measures long so you can see it starts

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.250 
measures long so you can see it starts
at<00:02:34.070> three<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.670> it's<00:02:35.600> going<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.810> be<00:02:35.960> two

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
at three and it's going to be two

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.949 
at three and it's going to be two
measures<00:02:36.650> long<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.330> let<00:02:38.330> me<00:02:38.420> exit<00:02:38.840> out<00:02:38.930> of

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
measures long and let me exit out of

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.949 
measures long and let me exit out of
that<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:39.730> hear<00:02:40.730> how<00:02:40.940> that<00:02:41.000> sounds<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:41.780> we'll

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
that and hear how that sounds so we'll

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.040 
that and hear how that sounds so we'll
hear<00:02:42.230> everything<00:02:42.560> play<00:02:42.950> back<00:02:43.570> remember<00:02:44.570> track

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
hear everything play back remember track

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.160 
hear everything play back remember track

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
back a built-in drum pattern and then

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.800 
back a built-in drum pattern and then
track<00:02:51.890> 8<00:02:52.130> is<00:02:52.400> my<00:02:52.670> hand<00:02:53.000> percussion<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.690> is

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
track 8 is my hand percussion that is

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.600 
track 8 is my hand percussion that is
looped<00:02:54.140> around<00:02:54.320> and<00:02:54.770> check<00:02:54.980> them<00:02:55.160> out<00:02:55.310> they

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
looped around and check them out they

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:03.449 
looped around and check them out they
play<00:02:55.850> all<00:02:56.000> together<00:02:59.320> and<00:03:00.320> that<00:03:00.500> loops<00:03:00.800> around

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.430 

and<00:03:04.459> loops<00:03:04.910> again<00:03:05.090> so<00:03:05.510> they'll<00:03:05.660> just<00:03:05.870> loop<00:03:06.170> all

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
and loops again so they'll just loop all

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.350 
and loops again so they'll just loop all
day<00:03:06.650> long<00:03:06.890> perfectly<00:03:07.430> in<00:03:07.730> time<00:03:07.910> in<00:03:08.060> fact<00:03:08.090> that

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
day long perfectly in time in fact that

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.640 
day long perfectly in time in fact that
loop<00:03:08.570> I<00:03:08.750> could<00:03:08.900> have<00:03:08.990> done<00:03:09.080> a<00:03:09.140> little<00:03:09.320> cleaner

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
loop I could have done a little cleaner

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.729 
loop I could have done a little cleaner
but<00:03:09.920> you<00:03:10.040> kind<00:03:10.250> of<00:03:10.280> get<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.520> idea<00:03:10.550> and<00:03:11.500> we<00:03:12.500> can

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
but you kind of get the idea and we can

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:22.750 
but you kind of get the idea and we can
adjust<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:13.250> level<00:03:13.580> of<00:03:13.670> these<00:03:13.760> guys<00:03:21.340> how<00:03:22.340> cool

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
adjust the level of these guys how cool

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.720 
adjust the level of these guys how cool
is<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.840> I<00:03:23.870> do<00:03:24.739> realize<00:03:24.980> that<00:03:25.010> that<00:03:25.340> loop

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
is that I do realize that that loop

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.240 
is that I do realize that that loop
could<00:03:26.060> be<00:03:26.239> a<00:03:26.420> guitar<00:03:26.930> riff<00:03:27.260> or<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.500> bass<00:03:28.130> line

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
could be a guitar riff or a bass line

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.310 
could be a guitar riff or a bass line
basically<00:03:28.580> anything<00:03:29.090> you<00:03:29.269> record<00:03:29.750> just<00:03:29.959> armor

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
basically anything you record just armor

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.500 
basically anything you record just armor
track<00:03:30.590> record<00:03:31.489> a<00:03:31.640> minute<00:03:31.910> or<00:03:32.000> two<00:03:32.209> of

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
track record a minute or two of

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.140 
track record a minute or two of
experimentation<00:03:33.350> then<00:03:34.220> set<00:03:34.519> it<00:03:34.610> to<00:03:34.760> loop<00:03:34.970> over

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
experimentation then set it to loop over

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.630 
experimentation then set it to loop over
just<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.600> few<00:03:35.690> measures<00:03:36.350> or<00:03:36.769> maybe<00:03:37.010> even<00:03:37.220> 16

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
just a few measures or maybe even 16

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.150 
just a few measures or maybe even 16
measures<00:03:37.970> whatever<00:03:38.690> you<00:03:38.870> want<00:03:39.110> very<00:03:39.920> very

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
measures whatever you want very very

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.540 
measures whatever you want very very
cool

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
cool

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.940 
cool
this<00:03:40.970> is<00:03:41.239> very<00:03:41.810> powerful<00:03:42.050> for<00:03:42.350> those<00:03:42.620> of<00:03:42.800> you

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
who use a loop based production you can

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.330 
who use a loop based production you can
regularly<00:03:46.880> pay<00:03:47.260> hundreds<00:03:48.260> or<00:03:48.350> even<00:03:48.500> thousands

this<00:03:55.160> kind<00:03:55.400> of<00:03:55.489> stuff<00:03:55.700> so<00:03:55.880> the<00:03:56.690> last<00:03:56.870> of<00:03:57.080> three

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
this kind of stuff so the last of three

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.280 
this kind of stuff so the last of three
different<00:03:57.530> audios<00:03:58.130> is<00:03:58.489> loops<00:03:59.239> through<00:03:59.510> USB<00:03:59.870> so

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
different audios is loops through USB so

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.530 
different audios is loops through USB so
