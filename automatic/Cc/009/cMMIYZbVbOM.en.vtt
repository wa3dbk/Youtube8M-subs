00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
trigger most of you may know if you put

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.609 
trigger most of you may know if you put
a<00:00:14.400> door<00:00:14.820> behind<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.420> painting<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:16.109> go<00:00:16.260> go

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
a door behind a painting you go go

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.400 
a door behind a painting you go go
through<00:00:17.039> but<00:00:17.940> right<00:00:18.270> now<00:00:18.449> I<00:00:18.480> can't<00:00:18.960> go<00:00:19.109> through

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
through but right now I can't go through

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.769 
through but right now I can't go through
because<00:00:19.560> it's<00:00:20.400> two<00:00:20.550> blocks<00:00:20.730> high<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.539> this

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
because it's two blocks high in this

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.769 
because it's two blocks high in this
case<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.980> nothing<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.640> do<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.510> i'm<00:00:24.570> going<00:00:24.720> to

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
case so nothing to do so i'm going to

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.500 
case so nothing to do so i'm going to
put<00:00:25.010> Pistons<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.220> case<00:00:26.490> right<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.269> i'm

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
put Pistons to the case right so i'm

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.179 
put Pistons to the case right so i'm
going<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.750> click<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.560> boom<00:00:28.769> i<00:00:28.980> have

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
going to click this and boom i have

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.450 
going to click this and boom i have
stairs<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.939> go<00:00:30.090> up<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:31.070> instead<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.219> door<00:00:32.430> i

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
stairs to go up and instead of a door i

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.580 
stairs to go up and instead of a door i
actually<00:00:32.969> use<00:00:33.120> signs<00:00:33.660> because<00:00:33.960> i<00:00:34.140> think<00:00:34.200> it's

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
actually use signs because i think it's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.819 
actually use signs because i think it's
more<00:00:34.890> convenient<00:00:35.780> so<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:37.200> demonstration

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
more convenient so for demonstration

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.470 
more convenient so for demonstration
purposes<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.430> actually<00:00:38.579> did<00:00:38.879> not<00:00:39.000> put<00:00:39.239> anything

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
purposes I actually did not put anything

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.880 
purposes I actually did not put anything
here<00:00:39.840> but<00:00:40.020> usually<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.530> would<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.739> your

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
here but usually you would have your

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.639 
here but usually you would have your
secret<00:00:41.340> door<00:00:41.520> here<00:00:41.760> with<00:00:42.030> your<00:00:42.690> chests<00:00:43.350> full

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
secret door here with your chests full

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.830 
secret door here with your chests full
of<00:00:43.710> diamond<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.489> goodies<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.750> actually

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
of diamond and goodies and I actually

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.700 
of diamond and goodies and I actually
have<00:00:46.110> not<00:00:46.350> found<00:00:46.559> out<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> way<00:00:47.570> to<00:00:48.570> close<00:00:49.500> it

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
have not found out a way to close it

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.080 
have not found out a way to close it
from<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> back<00:00:50.160> because<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.670> know<00:00:50.789> if<00:00:50.940> you

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
from the back because you know if you

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.240 
from the back because you know if you
use<00:00:51.270> leverage<00:00:51.570> two<00:00:51.989> levers<00:00:52.379> are<00:00:52.559> not<00:00:52.710> friends

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
use leverage two levers are not friends

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.340 
use leverage two levers are not friends
usually<00:00:53.460> because<00:00:54.420> when<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.809> get<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.140> into

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
usually because when you get it into

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.700 
usually because when you get it into
some<00:00:55.770> sort<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.190> combination<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.600> will<00:00:58.350> stop

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
some sort of combination it will stop

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.830 
some sort of combination it will stop
opening<00:00:59.219> closing<00:00:59.609> until<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.180> fix<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.690> and

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
opening closing until you fix that and

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.469 
opening closing until you fix that and
if<00:01:01.829> button<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:02.730> as<00:01:04.070> you<00:01:05.070> can<00:01:05.100> see<00:01:05.280> will<00:01:06.210> close

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
if button here as you can see will close

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.649 
if button here as you can see will close
it<00:01:06.689> for<00:01:06.720> just<00:01:07.200> couple<00:01:07.890> seconds<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.670> then<00:01:09.600> it

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
it for just couple seconds and then it

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.240 
it for just couple seconds and then it
will<00:01:10.170> go<00:01:10.439> back<00:01:10.770> up<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.790> not<00:01:11.970> good<00:01:12.240> and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
will go back up so that is not good and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.780 
will go back up so that is not good and
yeah<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:15.180> if<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:16.320> yeah<00:01:17.100> now<00:01:17.400> i'm<00:01:17.460> going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> be

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
yeah so if so yeah now i'm going to be

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.679 
yeah so if so yeah now i'm going to be
showing<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.330> how<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.170> wired<00:01:20.360> let's<00:01:21.360> walk

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
showing you how this is wired let's walk

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.960 
showing you how this is wired let's walk
through<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.220> your<00:01:23.369> wires<00:01:23.610> here

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
through this you have your wires here

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.999 
through this you have your wires here
this<00:01:24.180> one<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.630> actually<00:01:24.840> just<00:01:25.259> for<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> piston

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
this one is actually just for the piston

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.609 
this one is actually just for the piston
this<00:01:26.939> one<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.299> also<00:01:27.450> touching<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.110> piston<00:01:28.470> but

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
this one is also touching the piston but

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.530 
this one is also touching the piston but
i<00:01:28.650> put<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.040> here<00:01:29.250> for<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.640> lever<00:01:29.939> back<00:01:30.240> here

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
i put this here for this lever back here

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.060 
i put this here for this lever back here
right<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:31.710> going<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.890> go<00:01:32.009> down<00:01:33.380> go<00:01:34.380> over<00:01:34.829> here

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
right it's going to go down go over here

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.999 
right it's going to go down go over here
let's<00:01:35.280> do<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:37.790> make<00:01:38.790> sure<00:01:39.619> these<00:01:40.619> are

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
let's do this and make sure these are

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.670 
let's do this and make sure these are
not<00:01:41.280> double<00:01:42.060> wired<00:01:42.390> i<00:01:42.810> guess<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.380> could<00:01:43.470> say

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
not double wired i guess you could say

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.219 
not double wired i guess you could say
or<00:01:44.490> else<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.939> one<00:01:45.210> will<00:01:45.420> not<00:01:45.450> work<00:01:45.659> you

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
or else this one will not work you

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.929 
or else this one will not work you
actually<00:01:46.439> don't<00:01:46.770> need<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.189> one<00:01:47.340> but<00:01:47.549> i<00:01:47.579> used

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
actually don't need that one but i used

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.810 
actually don't need that one but i used
it<00:01:48.149> because<00:01:48.329> i<00:01:48.509> think<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:48.930> looks<00:01:49.350> cooler

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
it because i think it just looks cooler

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.929 
it because i think it just looks cooler
nicer<00:01:50.899> so<00:01:51.899> don't<00:01:52.259> flyer<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.549> that's

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
nicer so don't flyer it like that that's

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.330 
nicer so don't flyer it like that that's
why<00:01:54.119> i'm<00:01:54.240> not<00:01:54.299> doing<00:01:54.689> that<00:01:55.159> actually<00:01:56.159> went

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
why i'm not doing that actually went

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.300 
why i'm not doing that actually went
around<00:01:56.850> here<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.750> here<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.920> get<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.250> other

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
around here and here to get to the other

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.179 
around here and here to get to the other
one<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.840> now<00:02:00.960> i'm<00:02:01.049> going<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.229> destroy<00:02:01.710> all<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
one so now i'm going to destroy all the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.130 
one so now i'm going to destroy all the
