00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
the next thing we have to do is go into

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.590 
the next thing we have to do is go into
our<00:01:44.090> one<00:01:44.750> Ford<00:01:46.150> and<00:01:47.740> it<00:01:48.740> will<00:01:49.010> turn<00:01:49.610> out<00:01:49.670> if<00:01:50.090> you

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:12.190 

I<00:02:05.950> think<00:02:06.950> that's<00:02:07.160> it<00:02:10.330> yeah<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.780> only<00:02:11.930> can

I think that's it yeah you only can

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.320 
I think that's it yeah you only can
choose<00:02:12.590> from<00:02:13.090> red<00:02:14.140> purple<00:02:15.140> or<00:02:16.120> electric<00:02:17.120> blue

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
choose from red purple or electric blue

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.750 
choose from red purple or electric blue
music<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.950> want<00:02:19.070> to<00:02:19.160> get<00:02:19.280> three<00:02:19.550> choices

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
music so you want to get three choices

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.210 
music so you want to get three choices
that<00:02:20.120> kind<00:02:20.360> of<00:02:20.390> sucks<00:02:20.690> but<00:02:20.930> yeah<00:02:21.200> it's<00:02:21.920> worth

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
that kind of sucks but yeah it's worth

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.630 
that kind of sucks but yeah it's worth
it<00:02:22.459> but<00:02:23.180> once<00:02:24.050> you<00:02:24.260> have<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.920> code<00:02:25.250> that<00:02:25.459> you

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
it but once you have the code that you

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.870 
it but once you have the code that you
