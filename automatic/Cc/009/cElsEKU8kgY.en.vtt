as<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.160> see<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.550> artwork<00:00:53.820> seems<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.360> be

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
as you can see the artwork seems to be

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.290 
as you can see the artwork seems to be
missing<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.050> one<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.530> uh<00:00:56.000> since<00:00:57.000> figured

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
missing on this one and uh since figured

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.099 
missing on this one and uh since figured
out<00:00:58.370> that<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.210> name<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.750> artwork

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
out that you have to name the artwork

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.350 
out that you have to name the artwork
exactly<00:01:01.949> as<00:01:02.840> you've<00:01:03.840> said<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.880> in<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
exactly as you've said in the in the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.590 
exactly as you've said in the in the
configuration<00:01:06.869> file<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.310> actually<00:01:08.909> had<00:01:09.330> my

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
configuration file and I actually had my

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.160 
configuration file and I actually had my
artwork<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:11.010> uppercase<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> config<00:01:12.900> file

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
artwork in uppercase and a config file

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.399 
artwork in uppercase and a config file
was<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.490> words<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:15.090> lowercase<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.020> because<00:01:16.290> of

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
was the words in lowercase so because of

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.429 
was the words in lowercase so because of
that<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:17.159> artworks<00:01:17.549> missing<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.290> you<00:01:19.290> just

I'll sit must've missed that one but it

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.440 
I'll sit must've missed that one but it
won't<00:01:33.210> affect<00:01:33.570> how<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.869> plays<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.560> let's<00:01:34.740> just

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
won't affect how it plays so let's just

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.620 
won't affect how it plays so let's just
let's<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.689> run<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:38.090> if<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.240> don't<00:01:39.420> want<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
let's just run this if you don't want to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.590 
let's just run this if you don't want to
wait<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.200> load<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.560> can<00:01:41.060> do<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.210> turbo

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
wait for it to load you can do the turbo

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.520 
wait for it to load you can do the turbo
button<00:01:44.240> okay<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.659> let's<00:01:46.049> see<00:01:46.259> if<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.500> is

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
button okay so let's see if this is

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.240 
button okay so let's see if this is
gonna<00:01:46.770> work<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.100> put<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.640> portrait<00:01:47.880> mode

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
gonna work and put it in portrait mode

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.870 
gonna work and put it in portrait mode
and<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.909> can<00:01:51.060> toggle<00:01:51.329> between

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.160 

different<00:01:54.780> full<00:01:55.350> screen<00:01:55.380> modes<00:01:56.720> you<00:01:57.720> go<00:01:57.930> I

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
different full screen modes you go I

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.440 
different full screen modes you go I
won't<00:01:59.010> see<00:01:59.280> if<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.490> works<00:01:59.640> really<00:01:59.850> I<00:01:59.970> can't

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
won't see if it works really I can't

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.270 
won't see if it works really I can't
perfect<00:02:03.680> and<00:02:04.680> died<00:02:05.010> straightaway<00:02:07.100> but<00:02:08.100> yeah

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
perfect and died straightaway but yeah

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.720 
perfect and died straightaway but yeah
it<00:02:08.399> works<00:02:10.100> pretty<00:02:11.100> well<00:02:11.250> actually<00:02:13.580> as<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.700> can

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
it works pretty well actually as you can

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.580 
it works pretty well actually as you can
see<00:02:15.120> or<00:02:15.959> here<00:02:16.620> should<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.220> say<00:02:17.430> these<00:02:18.590> micro

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
see or here should I say these micro

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.970 
see or here should I say these micro
sort<00:02:20.160> ins<00:02:20.310> over<00:02:21.000> there<00:02:21.350> do<00:02:22.350> need<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.740> swap

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
sort ins over there do need to swap

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.410 
sort ins over there do need to swap
those<00:02:23.190> out<00:02:25.610> many<00:02:26.610> other<00:02:26.640> problem<00:02:27.090> that<00:02:27.120> seems

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
those out many other problem that seems

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.449 
those out many other problem that seems
to<00:02:27.510> find<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.530> can't<00:02:28.800> actually<00:02:29.070> come

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
to find is that you can't actually come

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.340 
to find is that you can't actually come
out<00:02:29.550> at<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.790> game<00:02:30.000> back<00:02:30.360> into<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.780> menu<00:02:30.989> in

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
out at the game back into the menu in

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.830 
out at the game back into the menu in
portrait<00:02:31.830> mode<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.160> have<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.570> flip<00:02:33.570> it<00:02:33.720> into

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
portrait mode you have to flip it into

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.250 
portrait mode you have to flip it into
portrait<00:02:34.380> mode<00:02:35.720> which<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.870> bit<00:02:37.050> annoying

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
portrait mode which is a bit annoying
