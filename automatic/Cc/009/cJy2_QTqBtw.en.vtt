00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.570
 on friday, the swb energy cup starts 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.400
 four topteams here in the ice arena 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.110
 bremerhaven that is natural for us 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.490
 but sometimes the reason to watch in 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.750
 the ice-arena as is the mood 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.029
 this important season 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.250
 The opening tournament next to us is Victor 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.720
 Beck's well-known face in Bremerhaven 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.860
 Unfortunately, unfortunately last year long 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.440
 you have been hurt now you are back 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.430
 fit viktor how are you so me 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.410
 come back in 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.910
 a bit of time, but still 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.680
 getting better week by week for me 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.260
 me getting better and now we are 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.340
 see 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.989
 live is live now the man has the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.460
 as a result, the caregiver that is part of it 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.920
 we are we are here so to speak 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.660
 running business with duets one has 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.010
 always heard in knee was more or 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.820
 less everything breaks with you is that 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.410
 then like a head thing 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.520
 Coming back to the ice because you think 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.890
 the human being hopefully does not happen 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.600
 again what you have to in any case 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.300
 adjust it one must be ready 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.750
 to be over the border so fight 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.040
 say yes and that's why I am you 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.409
 are fully fit but have not yet 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.799
 contract changes that so far now 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.470
 So my bie fall so the bg that 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.250
 green light gives because then we see 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.570
 that then goes on 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.090
 are you already doing the pinguins? 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.229
 spoken yes so that's what's called 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.270
 we once said that 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.740
 if I'm all right then that's me 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.380
 stay here 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.880
 that's good, that means viktor beck stays 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.580
 faithful to the penguins , says Victor Beck 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.080
 to the new team of penguins i 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.390
 I am very happy the team is 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.120
 everyone is in a good mood good mood 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.430
 So people can can start the season 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.619
 I do not believe in a relegation battle as in 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.030
 last year 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.890
 I do not think so, I always see that 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.900
 positively after my injuries i 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.030
 always stay positive and I hope we 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.290
 can attack front question is who 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.810
 becomes the new captain of the team 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.159
 fischtown pinguins is said to have one 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.020
 not yet determined who captain 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.030
 how's looks 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.100
 yes, that's what we'll be in right now 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.930
 team then internally settle the now 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.170
 week or next week latest think 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.959
 I have a look at the swb energy 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.250
 cup you play tomorrow against rode me 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.750
 can imagine as a home team 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.459
 Would you like to win a tournament like this? 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.140
 also to present the fans well 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.659
 yes, in any case , the thing 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.950
 win tomorrow's final over weeks 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:23.470
 the final play but 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.110
 Let's see results do not have 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.510
 but we can be happy to play 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.959
 in any case a word on mike 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.330
 stewart the new coach hard dog though 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.160
 belongs there must indeed be one must 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.569
 stay tough but fair and that's it 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.769
 be ours 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.769
 Wishing you all the best
