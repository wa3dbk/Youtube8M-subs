the new Texas heat 10 watt monster here

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.650 
the new Texas heat 10 watt monster here
what<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.039> got<00:00:26.160> going<00:00:26.189> well<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.240> Texas<00:00:27.539> heat

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
what you got going well the Texas heat

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.210 
what you got going well the Texas heat
is<00:00:27.779> something<00:00:27.990> we<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.170> came<00:00:28.380> out<00:00:28.590> with<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
is something we just came out with the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.479 
is something we just came out with the
idea<00:00:29.490> was<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.730> come<00:00:29.849> up<00:00:29.880> with<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.090> really<00:00:30.480> small

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
idea was to come up with a really small

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.569 
idea was to come up with a really small
compact<00:00:32.489> size<00:00:32.820> 112<00:00:33.680> it's<00:00:34.680> actually<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> 10<00:00:35.370> watt

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
compact size 112 it's actually a 10 watt

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.010 
compact size 112 it's actually a 10 watt
so<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.940> idea<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.540> know<00:00:36.570> have<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.809> very

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
so the idea is to you know have a very

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.229 
so the idea is to you know have a very
low<00:00:37.200> kind<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.040> wattage<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.820> people<00:00:39.000> could

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
low kind of wattage so the people could

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.660 
low kind of wattage so the people could
play<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.719> clubs<00:00:40.020> small<00:00:40.980> clubs<00:00:41.250> or<00:00:41.430> at<00:00:41.520> home

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
play it in clubs small clubs or at home

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.310 
play it in clubs small clubs or at home
you<00:00:42.090> know<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.210> kind<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.570> thing<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.230> you

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
you know that kind of thing so that you

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.440 
you know that kind of thing so that you
don't<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.850> wife<00:00:45.000> running<00:00:45.239> for

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
don't have to have the wife running for

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.020 
don't have to have the wife running for
cover<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.809> kids<00:00:45.980> and<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.190> get<00:00:47.280> recording

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
cover the kids and you get recording

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.299 
cover the kids and you get recording
obviously<00:00:48.510> there's<00:00:48.960> lines<00:00:49.440> out<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.070> have

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
obviously there's lines out so you have

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.709 
obviously there's lines out so you have
an<00:00:50.370> effects<00:00:50.610> loop<00:00:50.670> on<00:00:50.910> out<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.120> also<00:00:51.239> can<00:00:51.570> run

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
an effects loop on out you also can run

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.380 
an effects loop on out you also can run
a<00:00:52.050> separate<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.710> 12<00:00:52.980> or<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.370> 12<00:00:53.610> or<00:00:53.730> 112<00:00:54.030> cab<00:00:54.239> if

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
a separate for 12 or to 12 or 112 cab if

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.360 
a separate for 12 or to 12 or 112 cab if
you<00:00:54.510> want<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.590> can<00:00:55.620> actually<00:00:55.800> unplug<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
you want and you can actually unplug the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.650 
you want and you can actually unplug the
internal<00:00:56.670> speaker<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.149> use<00:00:57.239> up<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.510> two

internal speaker and use up to two
separate<00:00:58.020> cabinets<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.680> want<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.460> we

actually<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.590> upper<00:01:16.799> mids<00:01:16.979> which<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> lot

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
actually the upper mids which is a lot

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.130 
actually the upper mids which is a lot
more<00:01:17.549> bright<00:01:17.880> little<00:01:18.180> more<00:01:18.270> jangly<00:01:18.750> as<00:01:18.840> people

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
more bright little more jangly as people

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.320 
more bright little more jangly as people
you<00:01:19.530> know<00:01:19.619> tend<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.950> call<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.340> little<00:01:20.790> chiming

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
you know tend to call it little chiming

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.230 
you know tend to call it little chiming
yeah<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.930> usual<00:01:22.400> suspects<00:01:23.400> rather<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:24.030> what

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
yeah the usual suspects rather to what

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.249 
yeah the usual suspects rather to what
oh<00:01:24.590> yeah<00:01:25.619> actually<00:01:25.979> 10<00:01:26.159> watt<00:01:26.340> again<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.659> 12<00:01:28.140> ax7

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
oh yeah actually 10 watt again to 12 ax7

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.950 
oh yeah actually 10 watt again to 12 ax7
is<00:01:28.770> pretty<00:01:29.070> standard<00:01:29.340> we<00:01:29.820> have<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.970> six<00:01:30.240> v6<00:01:30.750> of

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
is pretty standard we have a six v6 of

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.810 
is pretty standard we have a six v6 of
single<00:01:31.259> six<00:01:31.470> v6<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.189> then<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:32.369> have<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> five

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
single six v6 and then we have a five

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.910 
single six v6 and then we have a five
air<00:01:33.030> four<00:01:33.240> rectifier<00:01:33.689> tube<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.740> little

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
air four rectifier tube we have a little

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.140 
air four rectifier tube we have a little
boost<00:01:35.040> switch<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.520> gives<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> little

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
boost switch that gives you a little

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.490 
boost switch that gives you a little
difference<00:01:36.509> between<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.869> little<00:01:37.049> more<00:01:37.229> edge<00:01:37.470> a

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
difference between a little more edge a

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.789 
difference between a little more edge a
little<00:01:37.890> more<00:01:38.009> versus<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> little<00:01:38.970> more
