the value of the technique what produces

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.520 
the value of the technique what produces
is<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.250> identify<00:00:08.490> which<00:00:09.030> use<00:00:09.360> have<00:00:09.809> failed<00:00:10.380> to

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
is to identify which use have failed to

you don't need to do an additional
mustering<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.300> yards<00:00:24.689> if<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.080> do<00:00:25.230> it

mustering to the yards if you do it

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.120

the Lambs away from the use while you do

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.260 
the Lambs away from the use while you do
the<00:00:31.560> lamb<00:00:31.740> marking<00:00:32.219> then<00:00:32.640> come<00:00:32.910> back<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
the lamb marking then come back to the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.510 
the lamb marking then come back to the
ewes<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.989> others<00:00:34.290> will<00:00:34.410> be<00:00:34.530> full<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:35.040> milk<00:00:35.309> and

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
ewes the others will be full in milk and

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.850 
ewes the others will be full in milk and
easier<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.030> determine<00:00:36.809> if<00:00:36.899> they<00:00:37.020> are<00:00:37.050> rearing

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
easier to determine if they are rearing

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.889 
easier to determine if they are rearing
lambs<00:00:38.040> at<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.370> point<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:38.700> time<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.719> very

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
lambs at that point in time it's a very

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.450 
lambs at that point in time it's a very
simple<00:00:40.140> technique<00:00:42.739> so<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.040> see<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.309> this

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
simple technique so what we see on this

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.139 
simple technique so what we see on this
view<00:00:44.640> here<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.780> bit<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.079> residual<00:00:46.469> stain

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
view here is a bit of residual stain

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.880 
view here is a bit of residual stain
from<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> birth<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> bit<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.710> bird

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
from the birth this is a bit of bird

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.760 
from the birth this is a bit of bird
stain<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.460> color<00:00:50.700> here<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.120> discoloration

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
stain this color here this discoloration

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.080 
stain this color here this discoloration
so<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.890> tells<00:00:53.190> me<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> presence<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.969> this

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
so this tells me the presence of this

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.200 
so this tells me the presence of this
stain<00:00:54.360> tells<00:00:54.780> me<00:00:55.050> she's<00:00:55.800> given<00:00:56.489> birth<00:00:56.520> now<00:00:57.149> I

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
stain tells me she's given birth now I

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.729 
stain tells me she's given birth now I
know<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.690> she's<00:00:57.809> rearing<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.260> land<00:00:58.469> otter

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
know that she's rearing a land otter

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.369 
know that she's rearing a land otter
tells<00:00:59.190> me<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.550> but<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.750> had<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> year<00:01:01.260> that

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
but I also noticed on this year

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.410 
but I also noticed on this year
this<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.590> using<00:02:34.920> much<00:02:35.519> greater<00:02:35.849> condition

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
this is using much greater condition

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.649 
this is using much greater condition
he's<00:02:37.049> gonna<00:02:37.200> be<00:02:37.379> a<00:02:37.409> fat<00:02:37.650> school<00:02:37.950> fall<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.659> a

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
he's gonna be a fat school fall and a

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.300 
he's gonna be a fat school fall and a
condition<00:02:40.079> score<00:02:40.200> three<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.739> a<00:02:40.769> half<00:02:40.980> so

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
condition score three and a half so

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.369 
condition score three and a half so
she's<00:02:41.519> heavier<00:02:42.329> in<00:02:42.480> condition<00:02:42.900> compared<00:02:43.290> to

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
she's heavier in condition compared to

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:44.420 
she's heavier in condition compared to
the<00:02:43.500> other<00:02:43.620> users<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.069> have<00:02:44.129> come<00:02:44.400> through

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
the other users that have come through

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.369 
the other users that have come through
which<00:02:45.269> tells<00:02:45.540> me<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.780> she's<00:02:45.959> using<00:02:46.200> her

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
which tells me that she's using her

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.710 
which tells me that she's using her
pasture<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.310> put<00:02:47.459> on<00:02:47.579> body<00:02:47.760> reserve<00:02:48.209> because

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
pasture to put on body reserve because

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.830 
pasture to put on body reserve because
she's<00:02:49.049> not<00:02:49.230> putting<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.099> into<00:02:50.220> milk<00:02:50.690> so<00:02:51.690> this

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
she's not putting it into milk so this

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.190 
she's not putting it into milk so this
year<00:02:52.049> is<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:53.040> land<00:02:53.579> and<00:02:53.760> lost<00:02:53.940> again<00:02:54.720> he's<00:02:54.989> lost

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
year is a land and lost again he's lost

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.110 
year is a land and lost again he's lost
very<00:02:55.440> early<00:02:55.769> in<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:55.950> period<00:02:56.430> she<00:02:56.849> doesn't

very early in the period she doesn't

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.149 
very early in the period she doesn't

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
have very much other development at all

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.789 
have very much other development at all
now<00:02:59.459> so<00:02:59.700> she's<00:02:59.970> taken<00:03:00.299> up<00:03:00.390> all<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.780> milk<00:03:01.019> if

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
now so she's taken up all of the milk if

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.280 
now so she's taken up all of the milk if
I<00:03:01.950> identify<00:03:02.489> this<00:03:02.549> you<00:03:02.940> with<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.209> tag<00:03:03.510> or<00:03:03.900> or<00:03:04.230> a

I identify this you with a tag or or a
notch<00:03:04.620> in<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.099> ear<00:03:05.310> I'll<00:03:05.970> give<00:03:06.239> it<00:03:06.359> one<00:03:06.390> more

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
notch in the ear I'll give it one more

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.080 
notch in the ear I'll give it one more
chance<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.440> she<00:03:07.620> fails<00:03:07.950> again<00:03:08.370> in<00:03:08.670> her<00:03:08.879> life

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
chance and she fails again in her life

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.890 
chance and she fails again in her life
she's<00:03:09.690> a<00:03:09.720> coal<00:03:10.049> and<00:03:10.579> making<00:03:11.579> that<00:03:12.269> decision<00:03:12.599> to

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
she's a coal and making that decision to

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.140 
she's a coal and making that decision to
give<00:03:13.049> her<00:03:13.139> one<00:03:13.349> more<00:03:13.530> chance<00:03:14.030> increases<00:03:15.030> the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
give her one more chance increases the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.729 
give her one more chance increases the
accuracy<00:03:15.480> of<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.900> selection<00:03:16.349> decision

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
accuracy of the selection decision

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.960 
accuracy of the selection decision
itself<00:03:17.180> land<00:03:18.180> mortality<00:03:18.780> is<00:03:18.870> largely

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
itself land mortality is largely

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.879 
itself land mortality is largely
environmental<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.480> it's<00:03:21.630> in<00:03:22.260> its<00:03:22.440> origins

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.119 
environmental and it's in its origins
and<00:03:23.069> so<00:03:23.900> sometimes<00:03:24.900> it's<00:03:25.079> a<00:03:25.139> bit<00:03:25.290> of<00:03:25.379> chance<00:03:25.650> so

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
and so sometimes it's a bit of chance so

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.379 
and so sometimes it's a bit of chance so
you<00:03:26.220> need<00:03:26.340> to<00:03:26.400> give<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.700> you<00:03:26.849> the<00:03:27.030> equal

you need to give the you the equal

you need to give the you the equal
chance<00:03:27.660> she<00:03:28.319> fails<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.739> gain<00:03:28.919> in<00:03:28.950> her<00:03:29.190> life<00:03:29.459> I'll

chance she fails a gain in her life I'll
make<00:03:30.329> an<00:03:30.480> accurate<00:03:30.720> decision<00:03:31.169> and<00:03:31.290> call<00:03:31.500> her

here<00:03:57.950> this<00:03:58.670> tells<00:03:58.939> me<00:03:59.060> that<00:03:59.180> this<00:03:59.329> year<00:03:59.659> was

she's rearing a limb but those teats are
really<00:05:58.580> large

00:05:59.940 --> 00:05:59.950 
really large

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.980 
really large
so<00:06:00.220> there's<00:06:00.610> a<00:06:00.670> structural<00:06:01.150> failure<00:06:01.630> here<00:06:01.840> and

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
so there's a structural failure here and

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.770 
so there's a structural failure here and
they're<00:06:02.080> filling<00:06:02.410> up<00:06:02.500> like<00:06:02.710> a<00:06:02.740> balloon<00:06:03.780> which

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
they're filling up like a balloon which

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.280 
they're filling up like a balloon which
means<00:06:05.050> next<00:06:05.830> year<00:06:06.070> her<00:06:06.910> newborn<00:06:07.330> lambs<00:06:07.600> are

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
means next year her newborn lambs are

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.290 
means next year her newborn lambs are
gonna<00:06:08.500> have<00:06:08.770> a<00:06:09.010> great<00:06:09.370> challenge<00:06:09.700> trying<00:06:10.210> to

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
gonna have a great challenge trying to

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.180 
gonna have a great challenge trying to
get<00:06:10.420> over<00:06:10.510> that<00:06:10.720> tape<00:06:11.020> and<00:06:11.230> it<00:06:11.590> represents<00:06:12.130> a

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
get over that tape and it represents a

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.980 
get over that tape and it represents a
risk<00:06:12.460> and<00:06:13.060> I<00:06:13.180> would<00:06:13.360> call<00:06:13.510> that<00:06:13.540> a<00:06:13.690> cult

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
risk and I would call that a cult

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.710 
risk and I would call that a cult
account<00:06:14.760> based<00:06:15.760> on<00:06:15.910> a<00:06:15.970> structural<00:06:16.390> fault

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
account based on a structural fault

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.430 
account based on a structural fault
she's<00:06:17.410> too<00:06:17.560> risky<00:06:17.980> to<00:06:18.100> run<00:06:18.540> so<00:06:19.540> she<00:06:20.200> might<00:06:20.350> have

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
she's too risky to run so she might have

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.720 
she's too risky to run so she might have
a<00:06:20.530> good<00:06:20.650> fleece<00:06:20.920> you<00:06:21.100> want<00:06:21.250> to<00:06:21.310> run<00:06:21.430> her<00:06:21.550> as<00:06:21.700> a

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:21.730 
a good fleece you want to run her as a

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.800 
a good fleece you want to run her as a
weather<00:06:22.450> but<00:06:23.140> not<00:06:23.200> as<00:06:23.470> a<00:06:23.500> breeder
