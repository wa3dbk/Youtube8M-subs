00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
say the epicness and put too much

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.509 
say the epicness and put too much
cinematic<00:03:07.630> into<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.049> which<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.950> did<00:03:09.190> enjoy<00:03:09.489> that

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
cinematic into it which I did enjoy that

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.850 
cinematic into it which I did enjoy that

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860

very<00:05:45.350> good<00:05:45.620> dlc<00:05:46.220> I<00:05:46.460> feel<00:05:46.880> like<00:05:46.970> they<00:05:47.120> could

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
very good dlc I feel like they could

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.930 
very good dlc I feel like they could
have<00:05:47.390> done<00:05:47.540> better<00:05:47.720> and<00:05:48.020> with<00:05:48.980> ponyo<00:05:49.520> they

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
have done better and with ponyo they

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.040 
have done better and with ponyo they
could<00:05:50.120> have<00:05:50.210> put<00:05:50.330> somebody<00:05:50.630> else<00:05:50.750> because<00:05:51.020> I

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
could have put somebody else because I

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.750 
could have put somebody else because I
don't<00:05:51.200> think<00:05:51.350> anybody<00:05:51.500> requested<00:05:52.160> Tania<00:05:52.610> and

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
don't think anybody requested Tania and

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.930 
don't think anybody requested Tania and
there<00:05:53.360> were<00:05:53.480> so<00:05:53.750> many<00:05:53.930> requests<00:05:54.530> for<00:05:54.770> rain<00:05:55.010> and

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
there were so many requests for rain and

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.760 
there were so many requests for rain and
I<00:05:56.120> can<00:05:56.330> see<00:05:56.720> why<00:05:56.870> they<00:05:56.960> put<00:05:57.110> tremor<00:05:57.410> in<00:05:57.620> there

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
I can see why they put tremor in there

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.510 
I can see why they put tremor in there
was<00:05:57.860> a<00:05:57.890> lot<00:05:58.130> of<00:05:59.080> like<00:06:00.080> people<00:06:00.710> wanting<00:06:01.190> him<00:06:01.370> in

made<00:06:21.290> sense<00:06:21.350> if<00:06:21.650> they<00:06:21.710> were<00:06:21.770> to<00:06:21.920> asked<00:06:22.280> us<00:06:22.400> and

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
made sense if they were to asked us and

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.910 
made sense if they were to asked us and
they<00:06:23.060> were<00:06:23.120> taken<00:06:23.420> like<00:06:23.570> a<00:06:23.600> poll<00:06:23.870> on<00:06:23.900> it<00:06:24.290> but

they were taken like a poll on it but
they<00:06:25.100> didn't<00:06:25.340> really<00:06:25.490> so<00:06:25.700> it<00:06:25.790> was<00:06:26.000> like<00:06:26.210> it

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930
