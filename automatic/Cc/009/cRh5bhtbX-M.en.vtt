00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
jeans for the lace bun I ended up doing

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.560 
jeans for the lace bun I ended up doing
two<00:03:23.100> different<00:03:23.610> pieces<00:03:23.760> of<00:03:23.940> leaf<00:03:24.180> because<00:03:24.510> it

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
two different pieces of leaf because it

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.990 
two different pieces of leaf because it
was<00:03:24.660> too<00:03:24.900> thin<00:03:25.320> just<00:03:25.800> for<00:03:25.980> one<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.460> then<00:03:26.910> they

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
was too thin just for one and then they

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.490 
was too thin just for one and then they
both<00:03:27.180> have<00:03:27.360> different<00:03:27.480> closures<00:03:28.020> and<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.320> think

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
both have different closures and I think

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.050
