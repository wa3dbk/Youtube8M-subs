00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
afterwards I say just search for it so

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.789 
afterwards I say just search for it so
like<00:00:59.399> five<00:01:00.739> four<00:01:01.969> five<00:01:02.969> one<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.690> there<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.739> is

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
like five four five one and there it is

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.770 
like five four five one and there it is
and<00:01:05.250> then<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.519> want<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.790> write<00:01:06.030> right<00:01:06.450> click

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
and then you want to write right click

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.410 
and then you want to write right click
replace<00:01:08.299> and<00:01:09.299> then<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:10.369> look<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:12.030> to

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
replace and then just look for it on to

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.200 
replace and then just look for it on to
on<00:01:12.720> here<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:14.330> here<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:16.020> open<00:01:17.000> now<00:01:18.000> it

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
on here and here it is and open now it

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.630 
on here and here it is and open now it
is<00:01:18.420> replaced<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.229> now<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.439> save<00:01:19.979> rehashing

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
is replaced so now you save rehashing

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.270 
is replaced so now you save rehashing
your<00:01:20.759> time<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.500> it<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.650> done

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
your time and it is done

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.789 
your time and it is done
so<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:24.060> minimize<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.869> then<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.320> open

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
so just minimize this and then you open

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.640 
so just minimize this and then you open
back<00:01:26.220> up<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:27.290> where<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.320> got<00:01:28.590> your
