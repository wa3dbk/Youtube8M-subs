00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
with fathers that really weren't that

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.170 
with fathers that really weren't that
present<00:03:35.920> and<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:37.260> we<00:03:38.260> both<00:03:38.470> understand<00:03:39.180> the

because I think God allows you to go

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.290 
because I think God allows you to go
through<00:03:47.080> certain<00:03:47.319> experiences<00:03:48.069> to<00:03:48.340> to<00:03:49.150> be

able to minister to other people who go
through<00:03:50.980> those<00:03:51.430> things<00:03:51.730> but<00:03:52.090> that's<00:03:52.810> really

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
through those things but that's really

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.880 
through those things but that's really
where<00:03:54.040> we<00:03:54.160> found<00:03:54.400> our<00:03:54.610> common<00:03:54.970> ground<00:03:55.269> is<00:03:55.540> that
