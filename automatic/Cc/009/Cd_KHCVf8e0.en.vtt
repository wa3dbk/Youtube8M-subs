00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.860
 the loss of a tooth can generate a series of problems in our mouth 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.299
 that over time will be aggravated in greater to a lesser extent 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.939
 during chewing there is an impact of food against 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:25.710
 anxiety that 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.480
 of damaging the tic generate discomfort 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.399
 this makes this function difficult and uncomfortable, so we tend to chew 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.219
 only on the other side causing greater wear of the latter 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.530
 the absence of contacts caused a mobilization of the adjacent teeth 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.750
 to the empty space looking for contact with the lost lynx bowing and 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.480
 closing the space 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.740
 in the same way the opposite tooth erupts looking for contact 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.820
 correspondent 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.830
 this generalized mobilization can trigger other problems as well 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.130
 interdental contacts become irregular even open facilitating 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.680
 thus the retention of food between the teeth and therefore the appearance of 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.980
 cavities 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.270
 In addition, the new position of the teeth hinders hygiene and generates 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.010
 spaces in which tartar can easily be formed favoring the 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.870
 occurrence of periodontitis 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.210
 this is especially serious in the case of the opposite tooth of that 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.990
 excessive eruption decreases the portion of the country that remains inside 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.990
 of the bone can even present mobility 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.010
 the alteration of the position of the teeth generates numerous contacts 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.730
 undue during chewing by forcing load on them and 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.880
 causing them that is premature 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.180
 the chewing overload causes in turn a worsening of the state 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.350
 periodontal of the tooth generating more mobility and pain reaching even 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.350
 jeopardize its continuity in the mouth 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.810
 To correct this situation we should not only replace the missing tooth if 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.150
 not also restore the bite relationship to your digital point by forcing us 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.040
 in many cases to perform complex treatments in which we can even 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.080
 need to perform on two maidens of the teeth that has moved the most 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:26.519
 For all this it is very important that before the loss of a tooth does not restore the 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.009
 mosh as soon as possible avoiding as much as possible 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:31.849
 all the problems that can cause
