00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:08.690
 that's a bike path and as so often 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.500
 there are many cracks and humps and 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.490
 although the ground actually 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.900
 Rock hard is mostly the cracks are there 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.900
 where trees are 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.770
 and let's take a closer look 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.619
 He always examines how to look 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.300
 it looks in such a crack on it scratches 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.829
 a little earth and fill that 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.680
 finger down is something hard and that 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.930
 Hard leads to the tree right here 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.879
 this hard thing many could do 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.660
 namely the root of these big ones 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:46.140
 tree , it was no wonder of the huge 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.730
 determines a lot of power enough power 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.610
 to tear up roads 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.430
 only where do theirs actually hunt? 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.760
 power even for small plants 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.449
 is that so we have one 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.850
 timelapse camera filmed caution there 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.009
 sways the stone of the host 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.869
 pushed up by one 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:12.710
 tiny little plant she is watching 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.710
 even from the earth out 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:24.100
 but next time we have the power of 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.100
 germinating peas on the sample 

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:32.890
 satisfy dried peas until whole 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:36.590
 in a glass jar at the top 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.090
 then water comes to the knowledge 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:43.950
 we all plant need water 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.950
 and now this stone is on it 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.460
 but everything finished and timelapse film 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.220
 the peas gradually lift the stone 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.810
 the water in the glass is always high 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.179
 less so much is known if 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.670
 Peas have plenty of water to develop 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.769
 she has enough strength for a heavy stone 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.190
 to raise 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:16.500
 and how come it works for everyone 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.110
 Plant same with peas as well as 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.130
 for example, beans and exactly 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.640
 That's why we'll take a few 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.970
 beans 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:28.230
 because they are a bit bigger ground 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.989
 on the plate water to all beans 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:36.209
 have to be under water and go 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:38.760
 go the beans are getting fatter 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:44.130
 and bigger the water is coming 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.660
 somehow in the beans rice and also 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.239
 if we get the beans out of the water 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.980
 the water stays in the beans 3 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.579
 what is still in the bean times 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.579
 cut open 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.200
 in the bean it looks like that 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:04.209
 Shining comes from the water that has water 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.329
 meanwhile connected with the white 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.980
 here the white is the energy supply of 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:14.769
 bean and consists for the most part of 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:18.310
 a sugar so the bean fills up 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:20.200
 more and more with water without that 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.349
 water runs out again and how 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.639
 does it work 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.260
 We just fill up a lot 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.150
 brown sugar in a glass with water 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:34.439
 and stir until completely 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:37.359
 is dissolved and now comes the dirt 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:39.099
 we use a special hose of the 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.599
 is actually used in medicine 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.450
 to people with diabetes 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.760
 Help it consists of a thin foil 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:51.069
 the water does not let sugar through 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:55.230
 as well as the envelope of plant cells in 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.230
 this hose comes the sugar water 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:03.010
 then have to do just that but nothing 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:07.000
 so now to make and then to 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.979
 water with it as with our plants 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.970
 we put a small stone here too 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:19.010
 on it and now timelapse off 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.980
 the hose fills up slowly and becomes 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.560
 thicker and thicker so that wanders 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.310
 water really into the sugar water of the 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.780
 stone is pushed up 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:34.040
 how it works we show with 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:36.340
 these balls the big ball is to 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.680
 So a sugar molecule is one 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.389
 tiny little piece of sugar and the 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.200
 small blue ball that should be 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:47.150
 be water molecule is still missing the 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.570
 Special hose should be this 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.740
 lattice is a big sugar molecule 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:58.010
 does not fit because it stays hanging 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:02.240
 but the smaller water molecules the 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:03.919
 go through without problems in ours 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.470
 model should be on the right the sugar water 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:09.350
 and the grid is the skin of the special 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.970
 hose and now come the blue ones 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.970
 balls therefore also the water molecules 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:20.300
 some water molecules migrate through the 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.850
 Dare they spread all over 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.130
 evenly between the sugar 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.750
 Sugar molecules would actually work 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.630
 but also distribute but do not fit 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.270
 through the lattice skin through the press 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.039
 just like that 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:35.150
 and that's why the special hose will be used 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.340
 always fuller 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.310
 because water comes in but not again 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.970
 out it is held by the sugar and 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.520
 stay in it 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.570
 the pressure is getting bigger and that 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:49.850
 osmosis is the term used in the technical language 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:51.640
 This osmosis helps plants 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.440
 to grow 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.760
 So sugar water and the special 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.700
 High plant cells are the secret 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:03.620
 that is why a plant can grow 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:06.500
 That's why a tree even has the 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.730
 power with its roots on the tar 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.730
 to break the street
