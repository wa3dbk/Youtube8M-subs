00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.759
 hi friends from youtube i am masai and today 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.370
 I bring you this tutorial so 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.639
 next I've already made several videos myself 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.280
 on how to install ubuntu how to install 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.410
 windows too and then always they 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.300
 I say that how to configure the virus of the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.760
 computer to boot from the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.160
 good disc then let's see how 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.750
 let's configure what we're going to see in a 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.280
 moment and that I have a computer that 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.280
 I'm fixing and we'll see it come out 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.970
 good is the computer as you will see I have 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.190
 that armor is uncovered there they are 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.530
 the layers on this computer in the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.720
 tragedy that did cleaning and right now 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.550
 I'm in that but it occurred to me to do the 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.020
 video because before I did not have a 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.540
 computer with samples I brought it not 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.400
 for good but you what the first one 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.620
 we have to do is have our 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.239
 computer our keyboard sorry for 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.470
 the keyboard that is the oldest that I have 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.470
 but good 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.500
 let's start when we turn on our 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.320
 computer for example we have a 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.460
 unit to divide or decide well what 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.860
 first thing we have to do is 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.690
 turn on our computer because they already 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.910
 show here on the keyboard first there is 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.890
 different types of videos videos 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.230
 so you can enter the bios there 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.920
 several options excuse the cochinero 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.590
 there are several options one is to enter with the 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.120
 another skype key with the key 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.440
 effects that are these keys here and 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.110
 It is from here 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.990
 Well, those are the ones that 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.119
 some works for us 12 to 12 says 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.080
 what is this here and the other is 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.820
 suppress the train train delete yes 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.229
 good when you have suppress then what 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.990
 what we are going to do is turn on our 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.110
 machine we go here we understand our 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.060
 machine is going to start here and we press 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.610
 the delete key 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.350
 the pressure or several times until 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.000
 turn on as I am pressing the 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.760
 key to suppress stadiums like this 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.190
 configure as you see the letters entered 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.590
 the truth 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.230
 to see if you can see good there is 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.220
 and now yes it looks good this is the bios 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.540
 as you see above it says views this useful and 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.150
 good what we have to do is 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.450
 navigate down here tells us with that 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.160
 we can navigate or here on this side 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.830
 selections with the keys on one side at 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.290
 another because these are these keys 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.860
 address and we go to where it says 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.870
 wood here exactly where wood says 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.610
 this is a plane there are others that say 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.010
 wood somewhere else, nothing else 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.100
 look for them and check with this good 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.470
 to enter we only give you here 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.330
 we go down here says bus configuration 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.710
 but that does not interest us we're going to 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.320
 put skype to return them 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.300
 skaters until it's here good 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.610
 So what we have to see is that 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.150
 is sailor as you see here is first 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.210
 the hard drive if you see the hard drive is the 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.750
 which is first says first multi vice 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:04.020
 that is the first device this for 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.000
 mark that would be there the hard drive is 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.200
 good and what we are going to do is give you a 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.820
 enter with this from here an integer with 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.190
 only he will look like this and 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.130
 here we select what is our 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.920
 device if there is something other than nothing 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.170
 more we have to press some f5 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.660
 forward efe 6 backwards and 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.210
 they begin to climb the numerical these yes 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.700
 there are some good there already we have to 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.100
 first started with our hard drive what 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.440
 I say with our civilian then with our 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.850
 with another hard drive and then with the 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.260
 network but good 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.270
 and here it tells us that it is what are the 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.250
 devices that we have from hard drives 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.610
 here I have the hard drives as you see 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.799
 I have this and I have this one 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.560
 and here we have the ibis that nothing else 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.079
 we have a civis unit that is this 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.299
 that is good here then since what 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.829
 we have saved not like this back 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.140
 this does not matter anymore that can be split 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.299
 since we have our 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.810
 device in cid and already only 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.030
 we search here where you say save and exit and 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.690
 we give him f10 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:14.600
 in happy says pressures of 10 to 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:19.609
 Save and exit if / not for this 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:23.130
 those that are to load the this ones 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:26.910
 as it was before as by default it 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.460
 load and f1 for for help to the 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.139
 questions if he serves and skype to get out 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.139
 if we go it is that nothing is saved 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:36.330
 then you have to press f10 there 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:40.680
 you arrive in your life is which of 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:43.140
 which tells you that which pg 10 is 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.250
 matched if we then look for each other there 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.460
 is going to tell us 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:51.090
 efe 5 hs and I do not know any type of f in 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.190
 mine is f10 there by this one suddenly it 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.270
 it returns a half crazy but good we leave 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.910
 with efe 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.920
 efe 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.690
 it will not be with efe days is what 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.120
 he told us we press measures in the 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:06.860
 bases and configuration clients 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:09.620
 and day ccit this we put him ok and he goes 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.569
 to turn off the machine and it's going to start 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.729
 and ready 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.729
 and now we can enter from the civil 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.100
 but here the civil will not enter so 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.729
 following 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.490
 because here 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.469
 I do not have a civilian to start right now 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.889
 I have here the cid and directed to where 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:29.889
 it starts 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.169
 well well I have the disc I did not find 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.780
 one of an amount because all the 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.120
 seconds the bounce of the usb all the 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.669
 I put in the usb then I do not have discs 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.200
 and I found this windows 7 that is already a 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:50.840
 little striped but it's good 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:54.440
 and what we are going to do is put it in the 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.990
 compu insert it in a tray already 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.760
 we have previously configured so that 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.330
 start from the disk as we have already 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:05.030
 done from the computer and we're going 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.920
 let's turn on the computer 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.620
 good 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:12.660
 I explain a legend will come out 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.560
 they say the following they are not going to 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.670

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.140
 not long ago they threw the jce 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.169
 function of any deficiency from the 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.770
 disc press any key 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:31.440
 these will start from the disk and 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:34.400
 enlisted will start and will follow the steps 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.400
