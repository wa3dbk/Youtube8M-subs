00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.959
 very well let's start 

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:05.200
 the sugar this enemy number one 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.950
 I know what you're thinking, wait, just tell me that I've been here. 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.259
 to be different 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.859
 however here we are not going to talk about the chocolate application 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:17.210
 yes all that is bad for you 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.250
 but there are many foods disguised as healthy foods 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.710
 that repeatedly become sugar in your body 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.939
 guess what 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.539
 the Orange juice 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.529
 Whole wheat bread 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.240
 healthy serials beloved things like low fat like rolls 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.030
 and salad dressings 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.330
 are just some of the foods that are causing you to gain weight 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.070
 I'm telling you the truth 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.960
 when those foods enter your system they become sugar 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.100
 many foods known as healthy do the same 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.830
 they are foods that are preventing you from losing gaza 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.520
 let me dream I have a small graph that he uses to explain to him that 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.760
 there are people 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.990
 - with a left shovel 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.050
 said column represents your blood sugar level and sugar in the 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.810
 blood is not something that only diabetics should worry about 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.980
 Anyone who is trying to eliminate that foolish fat from their body is so 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.100
 regulate your blood sugar level this is the reason 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.790
 If your level of your house in the blood is high 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.860
 and how much do I want to say anything above the area of ​​100 120 during 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.570
 a constant period of time 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.250
 your body has no other choice but to release a hormone called 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.570
 insulin 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.090
 insulin sends signals to your body to store fat those 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.120
 accept what you do not want 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.310
 however have a high blood sugar level for a period 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.700
 consistent of time is very dangerous for your body 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.730
 so insulin goes into action to save the day 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.340
 unfortunately that makes you store a lot of fat 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.920
 I have a much worse news 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.920
 I know it could not get any worse 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.829
 when deliberate insulin causes your blood sugar level to go from 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.909
 high is not yet extremely low 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.799
 and you know what happens when your blood sugar level is low 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.659
 tehran 20 and my cravings and you feel extremely fatigued 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.010
 is what you felt when you followed other diet programs 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.939
 perhaps that does not make it practically impossible to follow your plan 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:27.619
 to burn fat 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:31.459
 I'm here to tell you that all of us do not need a certain 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.969
 amount of insulin in that bloodstream 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.969
 if we did not have it, we would all be diabetics 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:42.469
 however what I'm saying is that a lot of people are releasing too much 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.769
 insulin and for that reason it is practically impossible 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.499
 lose some weight 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:51.130
 the answer you need for this problem 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.189
 He knows exactly what foods to eat 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.449
 which will not cause this mountaineers in the insulin sugar levels in your 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:59.399
 blood 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:03.739
 They allow you to explain how to recognize those foods right now
