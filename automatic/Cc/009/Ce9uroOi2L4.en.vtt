00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
hard you know to keep up with it and and

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.650 
hard you know to keep up with it and and
I<00:01:56.369> was<00:01:56.550> a<00:01:56.610> bit<00:01:56.759> spooked<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.270> morning<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.630> was

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
I was a bit spooked this morning I was

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.999 
I was a bit spooked this morning I was
even<00:01:57.869> looking<00:01:57.990> at<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.229> right<00:01:58.500> down<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> beach

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
even looking at the right down the beach

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.130 
even looking at the right down the beach
that<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.910> had<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> few<00:02:00.270> ramps<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.990> was

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
that that had a few ramps so I was

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.260 
that that had a few ramps so I was
thinking<00:02:01.290> maybe<00:02:01.590> I'd<00:02:01.770> attack<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:03.150> to

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
thinking maybe I'd attack that just to

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.540 
thinking maybe I'd attack that just to
UM<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:04.290> punt<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.590> couple<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.130> know<00:02:05.190> to

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
UM just a punt a couple and you know to

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.980 
UM just a punt a couple and you know to
try<00:02:05.760> and<00:02:05.850> get<00:02:05.940> some<00:02:06.090> scores<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.570> board<00:02:06.659> but

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
try and get some scores on the board but

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.020 
try and get some scores on the board but
but<00:02:07.920> then<00:02:08.040> I<00:02:08.130> thought<00:02:08.160> no<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.580> want<00:02:08.850> to<00:02:08.910> leave

him there for half an hour on his own

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.130 
him there for half an hour on his own
