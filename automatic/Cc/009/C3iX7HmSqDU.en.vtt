00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.720
 good staff is where you already know me is 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.019
 from YouTube 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.450
 on the motorcycle sample footage of 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.460
 creating my my name is Luiz Antônio is 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.060
 I want to show you 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:22.769
 the prosecutor that I have developed 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:26.010
 in fact its very old creation of the 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.830
 1t known he has already died luisão 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.099
 he created for the amazon antilles 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.800
 but I developed the system better 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.370
 I would like to introduce you to how 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:43.079
 the triangulation system works 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:46.110
 we have here a box set is 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.899
 half of the carton is cut and mounted with the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.800
 and I want to show you 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:56.640
 how it goes but note here it is 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.550
 this position is the neutral position 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.300
 note that as I move in the 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.619
 triangle to pain changing the position of the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.320
 disco 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.210
 so we have here first gear 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.479
 the point of first march back point 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:31.619
 dead 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:33.079
 2nd 3rd 4th march with jô 3rd 2nd 2nd 1st point 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.270
 dead 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:39.210
 Now I want to show you in the box. 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.220
 how it works 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.220
 so I'll show you now how 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.220
 works on the inside of the carton. 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.960
 we have here now 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.170
 in this position 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:57.180
 we have the position of neutral can 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.570
 to observe here gear is half 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.600
 term between 1st and 2nd 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.210
 and this gear between third and 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.899
 fourth is the dead box of the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.509
 march 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.869
 I will spend the first watch 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.869
 of the gear 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:23.920
 As you can see, 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:29.079
 first gear and return to neutral and 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.989
 now second only to the passing of the 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:35.890
 third gear to note that this 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:48.069
 disengaged second gear and this 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:52.389
 gear engages the third you 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:55.560
 then we have here aa 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:58.510
 gear midway between 1st and 2nd 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.450
 disengaged are in neutral and the 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.170
 the third gear engaged and note that it is 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.889
 because the fit went well 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:13.540
 done 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:16.180
 Let's go through fourth gear on Wednesday 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.930
 notice march that passed gear 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.910
 all there is also with the setting 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.870
 Perfectly meshing the 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.480
 fourth gear 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.310
 I'll go back, I'll go several times to 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.970
 that you see the inner workings 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.970
 of the fee 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.099
 and neutral 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:04:00.260
 good people will do the demonstration 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:04:02.989
 here is the box for you to work 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.049
 passing the marches to do a lot of 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:09.109
 noise is a help for you to see 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:13.540
 If the box works remember that 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:16.370
 there is no grease on the worker and 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.039
 works without any grace worked on the 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.320
 triangle the pain but it leaves without gears 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.130
 here are completely empty and oil 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.009
 none 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.130
 ok it 's just for a demonstration of 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.130
 operation 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.879
 I went there 

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:14.119
 sorry for the seats for the noise there 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:16.699
 but as you come to give all the 

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:20.869
 still all the hands marches 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:24.050
 it's logical that the right time is missing 

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:26.360
 producing data of the marches but ta phut 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:30.520
 is working perfectly that it is 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.520
 Thank you all a big hug there
