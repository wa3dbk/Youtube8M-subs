00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.860
 look 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.450
 [Music] 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.799
 hello how about youtube friends I hope 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.360
 that is very good and good here we are in 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.459
 a new video in this case we are going to 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.259
 perform the analysis of these speakers 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.930
 these speakers for our device 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:21.599
 Android ios or any phone that 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.880
 let's have and it's also compatible 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.559
 for compatible tablets also for 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.660
 the laptop is good is 

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:30.820
 Pretty cool, it's also with a microphone 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.940
 The duration of the load between 8 and 10 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.649
 hours is the 2003 model has us 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.390
 provided the company although there is a 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.430
 company has already provided ago 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.290
 a lot of time a lot of things so good 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.940
 has a very premium man a very design 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.920
 nice so let's see the box of the 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.380
 content that what it brings here is let's 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.640
 to open it although it is always characterized 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:55.010
 the box back always gives a 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.470
 One is the garments in very good no 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.680
 here we have the jack cable which is the 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.600
 auxiliary cable that is going to be 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.190
 computers or any phone too 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.990
 it is compatible by bluetooth here we have 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.540
 the cable to charge what is the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.130
 the little bug here we have as a kind 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.990
 that according to we are going to withdraw it also 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.979
 let's find here we have the logo 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.840
 ok we have it in a tone 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.250
 brilliant that we have it here we have to 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.930
 every part of the speaker we are going to do it 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.399
 here next we are going to analyze 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.710
 so that we see it tiny but it 's 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.030
 quite powerful here we only have 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.509
 and to a fundita that the fruit comes to us 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.240
 green and therefore a manual that we have here 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.340
 whoever melts it green to load it 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.940
 what is the device and what to enter 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.730
 that you have a streak 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.470
 and we put it with its roll and such the 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.350
 price was at thirty euros we are 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.570
 Currently there are 17 euros worked and 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.250
 good so let's analyze what we're going 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.250
 to listen to see how it works 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.270
 good that we already have what is the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.740
 device then we have in the part 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.689
 front we already have here what is the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.369
 part of the grid the part where more 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.439
 serious sound on top 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.299
 we have this kind of brightness very 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.340
 nice that gives a premium touch to 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.930
 device with the av key logo on the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.700
 back then we find here a 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.039
 where we are going to see if we peek 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.690
 well we see how it is there in what it is 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.910
 the shared part of the subwoofer and what 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.380
 that is the all properly we do not have 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.180
 the back the on button and not 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.910
 to turn on the auxiliary button 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.790
 we want to allow with the 3.5 card 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.840
 millimeters connect it to a device or 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.269
 also to what is the part of the 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.160
 computer we have here the 65 volt 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.950
 which is the load and here, a little 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.780
 that tells us that it goes from even in the 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.549
 part of bottom we have two as it is for 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.170
 the grip to keep it from slipping 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.630
 where we put the device so 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.890
 well let's move on regarding 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.170
 Connects features through 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.390
 bluetooth to any device that 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.799
 have it has 3 real watts is a 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.470
 power than for a small device 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.450
 it's pretty good pretty good 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.069
 it reduces by testing on I really liked a 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.960
 pretty high dream we can answer 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.290
 telephone calls 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.600
 we can put movies and we have the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.160
 side part a pause and play button and 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.320
 also to answer and hang calls 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.780
 and a volume up button go down 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.610
 good volume we're going to proceed to 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.580
 connect it then let's turn on here 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.830
 now let's put in what is the 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.940
 here the small device is an editor 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.300
 and it 's here we have the buttons 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.070
 volume 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.090
 let's go then to each part of the 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.250
 bluetooth we will synchronize 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.970
 directly with the phone we are going to 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.970
 activate this here 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.110
 but it automatically tells you connected 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.970
 and not multimedia 20013 because I already have it 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.130
 connected the first time since it is already 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.170
 simply connect in everything to put a 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.300
 song you can see the crazy and 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.350
 we were going to youtube 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.350
 let's play 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.510
 and there it is 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.329
 well now here is a test 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.519
 to see the range of what the 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:15.810
 decibel intensity for this 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:18.090
 we are normal the quiet ones 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.459
 about thirty forty and well in this 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.109
 application put good two songs 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.660
 here on the computer was connected by the 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.770
 half ordered here by the assistant who 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.630
 I have the microphone 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.950
 they are and what good record well we go a 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.480
 little removed was located in a 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.130
 little bit of volume then so that 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.840
 see the intensity that is quite high 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.730
 let's go put the song 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.050
 to lower the volume too and let's go 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.050
 Seeing how it is changing 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.640
 ready ex power to the gods 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.490
 in my block we are victims 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.639
 good 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:21.050
 well this is the test so good what 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.050
 his is to tell the truth while being here 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.669
 already normally basically microphone the 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.560
 sound yes it's quite true it's a 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.180
 pretty good sound that's all very 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.260
 nice so I hope I can 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.850
 like it but you can also 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.410
