 big leaf 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:21.530

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.530

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.310
 star tools and is that magnifying glass 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.700
 then I will tell you a little more about 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.700
 she 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:49.030
 ramÃ³n and let's see now his 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.030
 phillips screwdriver 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.240

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.630
 bottles with flat screwdriver and shell 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.630
 cables 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:08.630
 let's go to the other side and we would see the 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.630
 can opener with small screwdriver 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.640
 we went to the back of the knife 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.640
 and we would have like not the corkscrew 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.520
 multi-purpose hook 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.290
 and the climber punch with eye 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.050
 And finally we would see the stick of 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.050
 teeth 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.860
 the tweezers 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.319
 and the ring, well, let's talk 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.310
 now of the star tool of this 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.739
 explorer and is none other than the most famous 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.590
 there you have it and I'll tell you a 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.870
 little bit more about her tell you that the 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.430
 first time that victorinox introduced the 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.040
 magnifying glass in one of his models was in the year 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.100
 1973 had a glass lens 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.099
 8X and a plastic housing 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.670
 gray is that magnifying glass that I am 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.680
 speaking the truth is that for me it was 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.560
 a tiny magnifying glass you see that it does not have 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.850
 a lot of diameter and having so many or so many 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.040
 increases I had 8 I did it a little bit 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.750
 difficult to use voucher did not look very good 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.470
 through it 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:40.190
 victorinox realized this detail 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.319
 and in 2004 he changed that magnifying glass 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.549
 this one that I'm going to teach you right now 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:49.700
 for this magnifying glass this magnifying glass I repeat the change 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:52.190
 victorinox in 2004 and it's whole 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.150
 Made of plastic has a diameter 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.129
 larger 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.489
 so it makes it look much better 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:02.629
 things through it and has a 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:07.159
 5 x bone magnification extends 5 x 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:08.780
 this one had 8 these 5 but I think it 's 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:13.280
 much better because it's more 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.409
 big and having those 5 x is just the 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.079
 increase that is needed to read a 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:20.989
 text or to see some small thing 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:24.440
 I repeat I stay with this tell you too 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:27.560
 that you know that all the knives that 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.870
 they carry magnifying glass they carry the other side they carry 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.400
 star screwdriver and I'm going to 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.570
 teach now because there is also a 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:41.110
 small difference let's take this out and 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:44.320
 let's take this one out as you can see 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.840
 there the loupes are smaller and these 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.630
 bigger and also it varies the 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.420
 screwdriver and there you can see that 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.970
 This screwdriver is bigger by 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.400
 have the small magnifying glass and this 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.320
 screwdriver that is the modern this 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.750
 it would be a modern explorer this 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:06.190
 screwdriver is smaller and has 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:08.790
 a bigger magnifying glass good as well 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.200
 Finally, tell you that if you find 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.150
 this explorer if you want to buy are 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.370
 explorer if you find an explorer with 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.700
 this magnifying glass buy them because as I already 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.800
 I am saying since 2004 2005 already 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.170
 they do not exist, you will have time to 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.350
 buy them at any time but 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.960
 if you find an explorer or a 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.120
 chan suite with this magnifying glass let's not hesitate 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.880
 in compraros the say and finally 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.550
 that the explorer can find it in 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.650
 version plus what is the difference then 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.860
 I'll tell you right now the normal 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.920
 As I said, you have 16 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.529
 tools and yet the plus has 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.629
 19 this in particular is the plus 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.819
 I think the easiest way to 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:54.069
 differentiate them is by the handles the 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:56.349
 Normal come red grips and the plus in 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:58.979
 What are these three 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:01.629
 good da plus differences would lead 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:04.629
 apart from all that I have already taught you 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:07.539
 would carry a pin would carry the mini 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:10.449
 screwdriver and would also carry pen 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:14.150
 I repeat that is the difference between a 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:17.980
 normal explorer and a plus 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:22.250
 and I leave it to you so you can see it there 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:23.960
 those victorinox explorer I repeat is a 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.360
 Remarkable knife within the world of 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.610
 victorinox and even if it's not the best 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.650
 model to carry in your pocket I think 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:34.730
 that is a model that every collector 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:36.650
 must have in his in his closet in his 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.740
 showcase in your box where you want to have it 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:42.830
 but the explorer is part of the 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.050
 victorinox story I hope that you 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.770

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:51.260
