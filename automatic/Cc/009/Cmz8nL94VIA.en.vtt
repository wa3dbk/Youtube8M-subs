saw on my normal compete well my old

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.290 
saw on my normal compete well my old
screen<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.210> this<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.570> new<00:00:24.750> screen<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.830> is

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
screen and this is the new screen it is

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.480 
screen and this is the new screen it is
immense<00:00:27.300> i<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:28.050> ramp<00:00:28.260> down<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.500> resolution

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
immense i can ramp down the resolution

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.370 
immense i can ramp down the resolution
I<00:00:29.519> mean<00:00:29.789> ramped<00:00:30.029> up<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.420> resolution<00:00:30.689> so

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
I mean ramped up the resolution so

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.190 
I mean ramped up the resolution so
because<00:00:32.040> it's<00:00:32.219> what<00:00:33.149> makes<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.450> icon<00:00:33.809> small

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
because it's what makes the icon small

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.400 
because it's what makes the icon small
but<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.100> HD<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.850> stuff<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:37.079> kind<00:00:37.320> of

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
but it's in HD and stuff so it kind of

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.430 
but it's in HD and stuff so it kind of
makes<00:00:38.280> up<00:00:38.520> for<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.989> there's<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.050> standby

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
makes up for that there's a standby

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.290 
makes up for that there's a standby

so<00:03:00.970> you've<00:03:01.090> got<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.269> brightness<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.170> the

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
so you've got the brightness and the

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.500 
so you've got the brightness and the
problem<00:03:02.769> with<00:03:02.920> this<00:03:03.069> is<00:03:03.370> if<00:03:03.639> I<00:03:03.880> would<00:03:04.000> like<00:03:04.329> it

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
problem with this is if I would like it

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.700 
problem with this is if I would like it
a<00:03:04.569> little<00:03:04.750> bit<00:03:04.989> more<00:03:05.139> bright

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.960 

before<00:03:09.710> tea<00:03:09.860> I<00:03:09.920> tried<00:03:10.130> to<00:03:10.280> ramp<00:03:10.520> down<00:03:10.670> the

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
before tea I tried to ramp down the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.030 
before tea I tried to ramp down the
brightness<00:03:11.150> here<00:03:11.660> so<00:03:12.080> you<00:03:12.140> couldn't<00:03:12.560> guys<00:03:12.740> can

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
brightness here so you couldn't guys can

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.980 
brightness here so you couldn't guys can
see<00:03:13.250> but<00:03:13.940> it<00:03:14.090> didn't<00:03:14.420> actually<00:03:14.510> go<00:03:14.780> through

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
see but it didn't actually go through

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.990 
see but it didn't actually go through
the<00:03:15.170> video<00:03:16.330> so<00:03:17.500> there<00:03:18.500> was<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.650> notice<00:03:19.070> notable

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
the video so there was a notice notable

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.420 
the video so there was a notice notable
difference<00:03:20.950> actually<00:03:21.950> in<00:03:22.220> real<00:03:22.400> life<00:03:24.220> so<00:03:25.220> that

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
difference actually in real life so that

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.060 
difference actually in real life so that
really<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:26.000> bright<00:03:26.690> I<00:03:26.840> would<00:03:27.020> like<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.320> a<00:03:27.770> lot

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
really the bright I would like to a lot

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.990 
really the bright I would like to a lot

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
brighter so blinded my eyes saying I

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.440 
brighter so blinded my eyes saying I
would<00:03:32.630> have<00:03:32.750> preferred<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.440> Hat<00:03:33.620> actually

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
would have preferred the Hat actually

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
this one's quite weird because it's got

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.810 
this one's quite weird because it's got
Internet<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:04.460> demo<00:04:04.900> it's<00:04:06.250> kind<00:04:07.250> of<00:04:07.400> you<00:04:07.670> can

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
Internet and demo it's kind of you can

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.390 
Internet and demo it's kind of you can
switch<00:04:08.090> it<00:04:08.240> to<00:04:08.270> you<00:04:08.480> these<00:04:08.630> modes<00:04:08.990> which<00:04:09.620> kind

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
switch it to you these modes which kind

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.670 
switch it to you these modes which kind
of<00:04:10.580> changes<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.240> contrast<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:12.380> whatever

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
of changes the contrast to whatever

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.460 
of changes the contrast to whatever
you're<00:04:12.920> on<00:04:13.600> seeking<00:04:14.600> when<00:04:15.020> I'm<00:04:15.170> on<00:04:15.350> the

Internet
I<00:04:16.160> don't<00:04:16.940> know<00:04:17.000> why<00:04:17.180> they<00:04:17.359> got<00:04:17.480> internet<00:04:17.930> here

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
I don't know why they got internet here

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.700 
I don't know why they got internet here
movies<00:04:18.830> that<00:04:19.730> doesn't<00:04:20.090> really<00:04:20.210> make<00:04:20.560> you<00:04:21.560> do

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.710 
movies that doesn't really make you do

movies that doesn't really make you do
get<00:04:21.950> kind<00:04:22.310> of<00:04:22.430> a<00:04:22.520> preview<00:04:22.850> you<00:04:23.570> can<00:04:23.600> see<00:04:23.900> a<00:04:23.930> line

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
get kind of a preview you can see a line

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.610 
get kind of a preview you can see a line
which<00:04:25.100> I<00:04:25.340> don't<00:04:25.580> think<00:04:25.820> you<00:04:25.940> can<00:04:26.150> see<00:04:26.450> as<00:04:26.690> much

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:38.350 

don't<00:04:30.620> think<00:04:30.830> you<00:04:30.950> can<00:04:31.130> see<00:04:31.400> it<00:04:33.520> think<00:04:37.360> it's

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
don't think you can see it think it's

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.470 
don't think you can see it think it's
barely<00:04:38.750> noticeable<00:04:39.530> I<00:04:39.680> think<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:41.150> if<00:04:41.270> you

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
barely noticeable I think and if you

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.460 
barely noticeable I think and if you
guys<00:04:41.690> can<00:04:41.930> see<00:04:42.110> it<00:04:43.390> then<00:04:44.390> if<00:04:44.540> I<00:04:44.690> pointed<00:04:45.290> it<00:04:45.410> out

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
guys can see it then if I pointed it out

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:54.100 
guys can see it then if I pointed it out
to<00:04:48.520> pointed<00:04:49.520> it<00:04:49.610> out<00:04:49.760> but<00:04:49.820> anyway<00:04:50.830> so

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.830 

the<00:04:54.170> connections<00:04:54.740> on<00:04:54.920> the<00:04:55.390> PC<00:04:56.390> monitor<00:04:56.750> to<00:04:56.810> the

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
the connections on the PC monitor to the

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.300 
the connections on the PC monitor to the
back<00:04:57.050> so<00:04:58.010> this<00:04:58.160> is<00:04:58.310> really<00:04:58.550> quite<00:04:58.730> cool

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
back so this is really quite cool

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.720 
back so this is really quite cool
because<00:05:01.310> you've<00:05:01.520> got<00:05:01.640> the<00:05:01.820> DVI<00:05:02.390> HDI

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
because you've got the DVI HDI

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
it's a real bonus as well and you've got

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.260 
it's a real bonus as well and you've got
different<00:06:13.130> inputs<00:06:13.900> which<00:06:15.490> you<00:06:16.490> can<00:06:16.700> switch<00:06:17.000> to

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
different inputs which you can switch to

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:25.210 
different inputs which you can switch to
HDMI<00:06:19.690> or<00:06:20.690> VGA<00:06:21.160> it<00:06:22.160> varies<00:06:22.700> somewhat<00:06:24.220> because

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
HDMI or VGA it varies somewhat because

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.160 
HDMI or VGA it varies somewhat because
it<00:06:25.430> ought<00:06:25.700> to<00:06:25.730> detects<00:06:26.240> it<00:06:26.420> as<00:06:26.540> well<00:06:26.780> so<00:06:26.810> that's

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.170 
it ought to detects it as well so that's

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.130 
it ought to detects it as well so that's
actually<00:06:27.950> fine<00:06:28.370> as<00:06:28.580> well

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
actually fine as well

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.540 
actually fine as well
okay<00:06:30.140> that<00:06:30.350> pretty<00:06:30.590> much<00:06:30.770> wraps<00:06:31.070> it<00:06:31.340> up<00:06:31.490> for

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
okay that pretty much wraps it up for

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.400 
okay that pretty much wraps it up for
now

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
now

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:38.560 
now
so<00:06:35.710> overall<00:06:36.710> idea<00:06:37.190> this<00:06:37.520> is<00:06:37.730> a<00:06:37.760> very<00:06:38.300> good

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:38.570 
so overall idea this is a very good

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.900 
so overall idea this is a very good
