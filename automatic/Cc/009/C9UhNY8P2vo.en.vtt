to remind you about those possibilities
in<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:57.180> countries<00:00:57.800> that<00:00:58.800> are<00:00:58.920> trying<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
in in countries that are trying to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.439 
in in countries that are trying to
acquire<00:00:59.789> nuclear<00:01:00.120> weapons<00:01:01.940> we<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:02.969> enough

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
acquire nuclear weapons we have enough

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.630 
acquire nuclear weapons we have enough
and<00:01:03.660> we've<00:01:04.080> had<00:01:04.260> enough<00:01:04.589> nuclear<00:01:04.920> weapons<00:01:05.129> to

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
and we've had enough nuclear weapons to

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:18.980 
and we've had enough nuclear weapons to
destroy<00:01:05.939> every<00:01:06.810> living<00:01:06.960> thing<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.750> risk

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
destroy every living thing and that risk

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.740 
destroy every living thing and that risk
is<00:01:19.259> getting<00:01:19.560> worse<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.270> do<00:01:21.450> believe<00:01:21.930> that

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
is getting worse so I do believe that

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.210 
is getting worse so I do believe that
and<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.840> think<00:01:24.900> they<00:01:25.200> aren't<00:01:25.350> extraterrestrial

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
and I think they aren't extraterrestrial

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.760 
and I think they aren't extraterrestrial
and<00:01:26.460> this<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.850> my<00:01:27.000> opinion<00:01:27.590> that<00:01:28.590> they

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
and this is just my opinion that they

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.690 
and this is just my opinion that they
are<00:01:29.040> here<00:01:29.659> to<00:01:30.659> at<00:01:31.590> least<00:01:31.770> point<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.430> fact

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
are here to at least point to the fact

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.140 
are here to at least point to the fact
that<00:01:33.560> we<00:01:34.560> are<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.040> verge<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.579> annihilation

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
that we are on the verge of annihilation

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.609 
that we are on the verge of annihilation
of<00:01:37.670> suicide<00:01:38.670> if<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.060> will<00:01:39.439> our<00:01:40.439> own

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
of suicide if you will our own

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.480 
of suicide if you will our own
civilization<00:01:41.240> and<00:01:42.860> they<00:01:43.860> would<00:01:44.009> like<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.280> see

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
civilization and they would like to see

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.679 
civilization and they would like to see

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
incident that's my own conclusion that

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.679 
incident that's my own conclusion that
this<00:01:54.750> was<00:01:54.960> strictly<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.380> message<00:01:56.509> get<00:01:57.509> rid<00:01:57.659> of

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
weapons they are not weapons of war by

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.200 
weapons they are not weapons of war by
the<00:02:01.979> way<00:02:02.219> they're<00:02:02.430> weapons<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:03.000> mass

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
the way they're weapons of mass

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.560 
the way they're weapons of mass
destruction<00:02:03.810> right<00:02:05.119> they<00:02:06.119> would<00:02:06.270> never<00:02:06.450> be

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.280 
is part of those phenomena and the
abductions<00:05:38.120> that<00:05:38.210> are<00:05:38.450> going<00:05:38.600> on<00:05:38.840> another

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
abductions that are going on another

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.340 
abductions that are going on another
part<00:05:39.590> of<00:05:39.650> this<00:05:39.770> phenomena<00:05:41.020> this<00:05:42.020> is<00:05:42.170> such<00:05:42.320> a

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
part of this phenomena this is such a

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.250 
part of this phenomena this is such a
complex<00:05:43.040> thing<00:05:43.370> that<00:05:43.730> these<00:05:44.450> secrets<00:05:44.810> are<00:05:45.050> so

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
complex thing that these secrets are so

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.160 
complex thing that these secrets are so
powerful<00:05:45.620> that<00:05:46.250> the<00:05:47.000> bend<00:05:47.420> controlling<00:05:48.020> this

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
powerful that the bend controlling this

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.170 
powerful that the bend controlling this
minute<00:05:48.530> control<00:05:49.490> of<00:05:49.610> this

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
minute control of this

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.970 
minute control of this
I<00:05:50.680> think<00:05:51.680> main<00:05:51.950> motivation<00:05:52.550> is<00:05:52.640> power
