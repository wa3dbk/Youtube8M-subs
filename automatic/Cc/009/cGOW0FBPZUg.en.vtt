00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.240
 they want to inform me today because the beer brewing meter Paul informs me 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.750
 have a high profile guest invited photo Tobias Fogt women children from 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:12.599
 Stefan 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.259
 good day Volker Tobias can you maybe clarify what I need 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.109
 when I come for a beer myself at home 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.900
 yes to brew beer at home, of course, the right device is very important 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:25.899
 All the big vessels i have the brown rot here 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.319
 with 324 in the middle 40 in front 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:31.829
 a 25 liter people vessel 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.210
 and one animal fits 30 liters capacity 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.600
 with the club with 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.110
 and the apple hose 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.370
 We can then have our finished beer April 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.960
 Community representative final LAC 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.000
 maybe some technical details we have here under the hood 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.970
 a controller 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.930
 we have a pump and a water heater and the samples gets 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.899
 now the contents of the stock exchange 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.679
 always through the water heater through and back to the apartment too 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:00.280
 carry 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.480
 the water heater heats up during the whole process 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.480
 my for my fluid with two kilowatts 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.070
 Of course the rehearsals start by keeping the whole thing in a circle 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.800
 prompt 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.370
 Prince ideas serve the content of the relation of the rotation and that one calls the 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.560
 so called the back round effect now that's important 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.920
 our spice Thommy and the controller 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.920
 For this I turn the woman on, he admitted 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.490
 you can see on the display Stadtreinigung I can go on 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.140
 to the breakaway pilot 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.390
 the nice thing about the device is that it shows every step you take 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.270
 one could not do that either 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.170
 Brewmaster brewing a good beer I think with such a device everyone can 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.330
 YAEZ is on display Washington 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.090
 is explained Otto Kick 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.090
 so I have ever filled that Manz 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.560
 yes it is only possible 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.050
 that provides 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.800
 so I have people shut up now 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.800
 you can go one step further 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.970
 that is very elegant that the temperature over steam 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.970
 controlled so nothing can burn at all 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.019
 from the strength in Mainz 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.519
 Wheat sugar 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.499
 which she passes for sugarcane in the first 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.920
 at 64 degrees and in the second part at 73 degrees 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:24.019
 that we are ready for deposition 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.019
 the machine gets us that by peeping yards 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:31.989
 Year sailors race is often a delicate process especially when building a house 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.749
 you want to help yourself with cloth diapers but I know Volker you have 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:39.189
 for a better solution ready yes I can see with these 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:41.719
 Pressure could be very good for me as well 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:45.640
 made of stainless steel, just like the big breweries and us 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.290
 Then we can go over the hose to the temple in the soft 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:50.379
 used 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.379
 drain the wort 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:57.599
 what's going on here takes you calls 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.870
 So we can stop with the Obleuten, namely simply spices 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.719
 tube 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:04.039
 from far 

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:07.329
 and we are done with the step of expire now we have the 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.309
 Season the wort with the hops 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:13.309
 Now we can start cooking 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:20.149
 The cooking is over now after about a day we see how out of the kindergarten 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:22.849
 Glock he bubbles up 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.680
 After about a week, the bubble will stop buying in the gecko 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.380
 climb 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.560
 now it's time for us to bottle the beer 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:43.359
 Now we have bottled the beer 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:46.119
 now all we have to do is wait for the night's tribute 

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:48.789
 look at a website www 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:50.929
 Brauer Oehle dÃ©i 

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:54.130
 There they also find the women in their vicinity 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.970
 In the evening and maybe but can buy I thank you again right 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.389
 warmly by Dr. Tobias Vogt 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:01.589
 Weihenstephan 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:06.109
 and of course also with them dear viewers and think that now everyone from 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:07.720
 at least approximately white to them 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.580
 brewing this beer works at home
