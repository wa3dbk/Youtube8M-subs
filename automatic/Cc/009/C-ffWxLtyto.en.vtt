wheels<00:00:07.920> we<00:00:08.370> have<00:00:08.580> three<00:00:08.820> Foose<00:00:09.030> wheels<00:00:09.060> here

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
wheels we have three Foose wheels here

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.810 
wheels we have three Foose wheels here
today<00:00:09.660> we<00:00:10.080> have<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.320> injector<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:11.309> cornet

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
today we have the injector the cornet

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.549 
today we have the injector the cornet
and<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.030> night<00:00:12.210> right<00:00:12.960> here<00:00:13.139> we<00:00:13.290> have<00:00:13.440> the

aluminum<00:00:16.260> wheel<00:00:16.410> with<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.680> billet<00:00:17.160> Center<00:00:17.460> and

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
aluminum wheel with a billet Center and

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.310 
aluminum wheel with a billet Center and
what<00:00:18.210> billet<00:00:18.510> means<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:18.900> what<00:00:19.019> they<00:00:19.109> do<00:00:19.170> is

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
what billet means is what they do is

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.080 
what billet means is what they do is
they<00:00:19.380> take<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.529> big<00:00:19.769> block<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.160> aluminum<00:00:20.730> they

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
they take a big block of aluminum they

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.050 
they take a big block of aluminum they
put<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.390> on<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.539> CNC<00:00:21.869> machine<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.880> they<00:00:23.880> load

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
put it on the CNC machine and they load

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.080 
put it on the CNC machine and they load
a<00:00:24.090> computer<00:00:24.660> or<00:00:25.619> in<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.220> design<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:26.970> the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
wheel called these salt flats special

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.520 
wheel called these salt flats special
through<00:01:59.850> American<00:02:00.180> Racing<00:02:00.510> and<00:02:00.720> they<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:01.440> a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
through American Racing and they just a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.810 
through American Racing and they just a
really<00:02:01.710> nice<00:02:01.860> job<00:02:02.070> again<00:02:02.340> with<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> billet

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
really nice job again with a billet

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.870 
really nice job again with a billet
design<00:02:03.090> you're<00:02:03.660> able<00:02:03.870> to<00:02:03.900> get<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.200> 3d<00:02:04.590> cut<00:02:04.890> it

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
design you're able to get that 3d cut it

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.550 
design you're able to get that 3d cut it
just<00:02:05.940> they<00:02:06.330> just<00:02:06.360> really<00:02:06.810> did<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> nice<00:02:07.170> job<00:02:07.230> and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
just they just really did a nice job and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.869 
just they just really did a nice job and
especially<00:02:07.740> with<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.009> rolled<00:02:08.220> lift<00:02:08.489> versus

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
especially with the rolled lift versus

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.850 
especially with the rolled lift versus
the<00:02:08.970> old<00:02:09.119> standard<00:02:09.629> step-down<00:02:10.440> look<00:02:10.679> that's

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the old standard step-down look that's

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.310 
the old standard step-down look that's
another<00:02:11.160> nice<00:02:11.490> advantage<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.930> Foose

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
another nice advantage this is the Foose

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.880 
another nice advantage this is the Foose

this<00:02:16.160> is<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.400> first<00:02:16.640> design<00:02:16.760> night<00:02:17.150> wheel

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
this is the first design night wheel

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.690 
this is the first design night wheel
this<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:18.020> a<00:02:18.050> two-piece<00:02:18.530> wheel<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:19.220> Bell<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.670> a

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
this is a two-piece wheel the Bell is a

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.000 
this is a two-piece wheel the Bell is a
rolled<00:02:19.970> aluminum<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.780> center<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.260> a<00:02:21.290> billet

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
rolled aluminum the center is a billet

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.710 
rolled aluminum the center is a billet
design<00:02:22.310> this<00:02:23.000> actually<00:02:23.330> gives<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:23.540> that

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
design this actually gives you that

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.960 
design this actually gives you that
three-piece<00:02:24.290> look<00:02:24.530> looks<00:02:25.130> like<00:02:25.280> those<00:02:25.670> but

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
three-piece look looks like those but

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.699 
three-piece look looks like those but
they're<00:02:26.120> really<00:02:26.209> not<00:02:26.390> they<00:02:27.110> do<00:02:27.170> such<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.500> nice

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
they're really not they do such a nice

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.340 
they're really not they do such a nice
job<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:28.490> way<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.910> outer<00:02:29.300> meets<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.050> barrel

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
job the way the outer meets the barrel

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.170 
job the way the outer meets the barrel
it<00:02:30.500> just<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:30.860> almost<00:02:31.250> looks<00:02:31.490> I<00:02:31.790> mean<00:02:31.970> there's<00:02:32.120> a

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
it just it almost looks I mean there's a

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.300 
it just it almost looks I mean there's a
little<00:02:32.390> seam<00:02:32.600> here<00:02:32.810> but<00:02:32.989> it<00:02:33.080> looks<00:02:33.440> very<00:02:33.590> very

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
little seam here but it looks very very

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.500 
little seam here but it looks very very

wheel<00:02:44.600> only<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.830> offsets<00:02:46.340> are<00:02:46.550> is<00:02:47.120> a

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
wheel only and the offsets are is a

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.790 
wheel only and the offsets are is a
custom<00:02:47.600> made<00:02:47.720> wheel<00:02:47.870> so<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.050> offsets<00:02:48.470> are<00:02:48.590> a

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
custom made wheel so the offsets are a

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.190 
custom made wheel so the offsets are a
pretty<00:02:49.489> relaxed<00:02:50.450> on<00:02:50.540> top<00:02:50.630> so<00:02:50.780> then<00:02:50.900> you<00:02:51.050> can

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
pretty relaxed on top so then you can

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.199 
pretty relaxed on top so then you can
really<00:02:51.320> get<00:02:51.530> some<00:02:51.590> really<00:02:52.040> crazy<00:02:52.280> stuff<00:02:52.610> being

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
really get some really crazy stuff being

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.410 
really get some really crazy stuff being
that<00:02:53.510> it<00:02:53.750> offers<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.440> 15<00:02:54.890> inch<00:02:55.040> wide<00:02:55.250> wheel<00:02:55.489> you

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
that it offers a 15 inch wide wheel you

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.970 
that it offers a 15 inch wide wheel you
can<00:02:56.450> really<00:02:56.900> do<00:02:57.050> some<00:02:57.290> nice<00:02:57.440> staggered

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
can really do some nice staggered

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.490 
can really do some nice staggered
fitment<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:59.780> wheel<00:02:59.959> is<00:03:00.080> gonna<00:03:00.230> fit
