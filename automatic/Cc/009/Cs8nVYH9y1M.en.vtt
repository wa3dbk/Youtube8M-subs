00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.990
 hello everyone I 'm bricia and the day of 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.430
 Today I am going to present a trick that is 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.500
 to have the appearance of eyelashes 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.940
 longer naturals this is going to 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.070
 serve so that our look can be seen 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.360
 more awake and especially for those 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.009
 days when we do not want to take 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.440
 eyeliner or what we want to highlight 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:22.039
 of the face be the mouth let's see the 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.039
 process 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:30.390
 The first step is to apply a mask on 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.390
 tabs and if necessary revise them 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.160
 now the trick comes I will use a 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.650
 part of other tabs that are from 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.300
 big ponies and separated because if 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.010
 I want to give that natural effect some 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.590
 very perfect eyelashes are not going to 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.290
 serve the glue is applied by the 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.300
 part of above on the line we wait 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.090
 a few seconds so it does not get so liquid 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.430
 the glue and place them underneath 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.300
 of our natural eyelashes first 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.579
 one corner and after the rest 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.780
 I'm helping with a pair of tweezers 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.780
 accommodate genetics 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.760
 and 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.190
 Y 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.020
 then I'm gently passing it on 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.620
 finger to make sure all are left 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.350
 well attached 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.390
 and it is necessary to mention that the 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.910
 false eyelashes are applied in the 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.210
 natural eyelashes not on the line of 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.210
 Water 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.400
 well this is optional I wanted 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.400
 delineate a little 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.980
 and then we apply mask so that 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.510
 the eyelashes are well mixed 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.570
 natural and false 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.570
 i 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.660
 and ready 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.110
 we already have longer eyelashes and 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.110
 mirror 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.140
 Well, there we have it, now a 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.690
 of my recommendations would be that 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.450
 use contact lenses at the moment 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.780
 of trying to stick to the 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.880
 tabs below and other things 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.770
 It would also be that they do not use much 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.800
 glue because then they're going to 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.770
 put in the eye 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.730
 and finally is that they have patience us 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.730
 we see the next video
