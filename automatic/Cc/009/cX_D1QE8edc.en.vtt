00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.990
 hello to all of you will give 13 and today I 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.910
 I want to announce a new rubric on my 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.400
 working channel 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.900
 interesting moments in this category I will 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.360
 show some non-standard 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.400
 tactics on cards funny case 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.860
 occurring in random and the like 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.960
 as you already understood it will be short 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.349
 video replay which is full 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.780
 overview 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.060
 does not pull but still contains interesting 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.130
 information yet I do not know whether 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.170
 videos from this section go out constantly 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.870
 or will it end on the first release 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.329
 everything as always depends on your reaction 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.730
 if you like this video and heading 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.829
 In general, make sure you like it 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.989
 if you don't like dizlike 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.730
 the ratio of likes and dislikes I will 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.850
 decide to keep releasing videos from 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.920
 this column or not in general, everything depends 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.190
 from you well and now let's move on to 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.530
 fragment of the battle and so today fragment 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.660
 more linked to tactics is the robin card 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.960
 i play erect we spin on and 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.590
 skirmishes ninth level I'm on t-54 a1 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.300
 t-54 e1 if we look at the composition 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.920
 the enemy team will see that there 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.260
 there are a lot of fast tanks that 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.430
 can take a slide so on the slide we 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.200
 didn't go we went to c5 square for 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.940
 there to highlight someone 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.950
 and maybe for someone to shoot 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.800
 but honestly there was very boring 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.310
 already five minutes of battle have passed and I 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.920
 wondered what i could do 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.060
 interesting and I decided to apply for myself 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.220
 new tactics of course I already very often 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.150
 seen in random but on my own skin so 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.250
 say did not check 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.320
 The tactic is as follows 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.930
 drive up to the square one more here 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.020
 gently on the edge of the road to skip 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.570
 and to the enemy base and come here 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.250
 here in the lowland necessarily well not 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.050
 surely probably it is desirable that 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.030
 you were allies that could have you 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.270
 cover in general this tactic I am very 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.459
 often seen when 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.410
 crawling from this base, that is, I 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.989
 rose under the barn and the enemy 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.000
 c-shka flew neatly and filed here 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.930
 made from us then it is highlighted and 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.270
 my allies who tried to get there 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.480
 barn and pick up and st-shku on the way 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.760
 merged as their 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.540
 shot from this base now I 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.549
 I will depict 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.890
 something like that is i'm neat 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.200
 rolling out highlighting enemies and even 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.260
 I will try on them carefully 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.750
 shoot tactics here I think everyone 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.739
 Well known but now I once again 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.260
 made sure she really works 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.660
 the score is already 61 as we see ours after all 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.530
 occupied the hill they squeezed out a lot there 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.569
 Esther chic and now begins just 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.150
 that piece when on me 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.610
 enemy forces are coming here comes to me 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.260
 out of 8 I give him to the hotel yes and to 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.480
 caterpillar cumulative course without 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.920
 damage but okay the main thing is that 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.799
 I will immobilize him 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.140
 Now I give again to the rink E100 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.180
 Eventually, I think that now is found on 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.109
 iso 8 and a shoot at it 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.209
 yes, it remains with isa 8 256 kb 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:19.239
 and I just have to finish him 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.700
 I make my shot and is-8 dead here 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.510
 such bodies as I said while he is up to me 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.030
 drove 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.040
 he was shot and of course desirable 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.310
 here put your enemies on the caterpillar 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.139
 then I stayed there even 3 batchat I see 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.079
 that butt sort of goes to me now 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:38.370
 it will pass neatly along the edge of the map and 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:40.690
 in the end will fall to me in the lowland I rent 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.450
 back of course I understand all this 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.690
 fine turn on bb shells bochata 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:50.079
 I in any trial and the same I have 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.819
 I notice that IS-3 also wanted me 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.489
 roll out 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.500
 naturally, is-3 is also dangerous for me but 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.919
 I must punch Bachatu 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.200
 already killed put on caterpillar tank 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:04.269
 By the way, your tower is desirable 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.480
 go here on those tanks which 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.410
 Strong tower neatly put on 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.790
 skating rink e100 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:14.950
 great help thank you very much 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:18.039
 I wanted to plant on the rink with 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.380
 freak however fails maneuvering 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:22.449
 back and forth and is-3 misses as a result 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.240
 E100 finishes Isa the third 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:27.370
 that's all in principle prolimit over 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.849
 Now I will go under the candle remaining 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.900
 e100 he stands under the barn am try 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.050
 dedicate it and 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.790
 a few more times on it and shoot at 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.699
 In general, today everything is such 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.580
 Fragment tactics can be applied and even 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:44.229
 you need and with you it will give 13 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.000
 be sure to put your finger up under it 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.650
