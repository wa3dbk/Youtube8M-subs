00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.570
 welcome to the hamburgers of the coup against the questions we and I should ask 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.729
 have a birth and play fast in Zurich ESI time 

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:12.729
 Hessels 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:18.300
 so get that and beaus I tried 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.819
 Once it goes to explain steps, and indeed the tone step 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:27.229
 he owns two long steps on six points and still far 

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:29.779
 advanced 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.829
 Dieter always started with the right foot for a long time 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.750
 he often chooses to recognize a long step 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.300
 rolls-royce ghost rolls-royce ghost 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.830
 to change 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.170
 just before 2 o'clock 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.130
 Horst Buchholz 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.700
 Once Upon a time 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.750
 the direction 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.559
 Excellence short process in short, despite 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.360
 the army 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.240
 Freud's 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.590
 first three 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.660
 steps 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.290
 the short steps 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.550
 So two long steps because 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.550
 the three short steps the TG cross when you get 2 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.080
 No, that was too fast now 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.080
 and in the end it's the oldest 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.680
 Volbeat the army has the burden on the left foot so he 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.510
 the right leg is free again 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.120
 to start a new and instead of long 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.240
 yes the permanent one 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.160
 long long 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.620
 short Trips 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.430
 space 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.190

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.660
 Dr STA 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.640
 that was beautifully performed 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.140
 that sometimes 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.060
 long
