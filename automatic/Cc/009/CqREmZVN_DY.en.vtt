that<00:00:19.369> has<00:00:20.369> brought<00:00:20.760> up<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.150> idea<00:00:21.180> of

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
that has brought up the idea of

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.160 
that has brought up the idea of
creativity<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.289> mean<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:23.840> well<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.869> guess<00:00:25.050> I

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
creativity I mean it is well I guess I

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.200 
creativity I mean it is well I guess I
should<00:00:25.350> say<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.740> sensed<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.430> sensed<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.060> your

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210

question<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.750> there<00:00:27.869> was<00:00:27.990> more<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.529> then

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
question that there was more to it then

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.690 
question that there was more to it then
then<00:00:30.420> what<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.289> felt<00:00:31.560> other<00:00:31.890> people<00:00:32.279> perceived

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
spread where he's building the ship and

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.310 
spread where he's building the ship and
in<00:01:44.640> his<00:01:44.790> mind<00:01:45.090> he's<00:01:45.329> picturing<00:01:45.780> this<00:01:45.990> boy

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
in his mind he's picturing this boy

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.200

that's winning all these awards and he's
thinking<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.630> himself

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
thinking to himself

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.929 
thinking to himself
well<00:01:49.530> maybe<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.950> kid<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.340> just<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.670> busy

being<00:01:51.270> awesome<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.079> he<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:52.590> hasn't<00:01:52.740> had

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
being awesome that he just hasn't had

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.520 
being awesome that he just hasn't had
time<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.369> imagine<00:01:53.670> me<00:01:54.030> yet<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.540> know<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:56.840> as<00:01:57.840> a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
time to imagine me yet you know and as a

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.940 
time to imagine me yet you know and as a
story<00:01:58.979> goes<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.490> I<00:02:00.350> really<00:02:01.350> played<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.829> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
story goes on I really played on the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.390 
story goes on I really played on the
idea<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
idea of the

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.510 
idea of the
function<00:02:04.030> of<00:02:04.330> an<00:02:04.630> imaginary<00:02:05.110> friend<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:05.860> so

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
function of an imaginary friend and so

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.670 
function of an imaginary friend and so
part<00:02:06.850> of<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:07.000> reason<00:02:07.270> why<00:02:07.390> beagles<00:02:07.870> why<00:02:08.110> is

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 
part of the reason why beagles why is

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.620 
part of the reason why beagles why is
because<00:02:09.430> he<00:02:09.610> was<00:02:09.700> supposed<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.090> represent<00:02:10.300> a

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
because he was supposed to represent a

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.300 
because he was supposed to represent a
blank<00:02:10.930> sheet<00:02:11.200> of<00:02:11.230> paper<00:02:11.380> he<00:02:11.890> was<00:02:11.920> supposed<00:02:12.220> to

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
blank sheet of paper he was supposed to

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.310 
blank sheet of paper he was supposed to
be<00:02:12.490> like<00:02:12.940> if<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.180> go<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.750> entire<00:02:14.020> book

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
be like if you go to the entire book

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.960 
be like if you go to the entire book
he's<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.740> only<00:02:14.980> thing<00:02:15.100> in<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.490> book<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.850> is

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
he's the only thing in the book that is

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.630 
he's the only thing in the book that is
purely<00:02:16.450> white<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.960> it's<00:02:17.920> just<00:02:18.130> kind<00:02:18.400> of<00:02:18.490> this

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
purely white and it's just kind of this

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.640 
purely white and it's just kind of this
I<00:02:19.240> don't<00:02:19.600> know<00:02:19.690> it's<00:02:19.870> it's<00:02:19.990> a<00:02:20.110> representative

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
I don't know it's it's a representative

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.830 
I don't know it's it's a representative
of<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.220> know<00:02:21.340> like<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.790> possibility<00:02:22.630> of

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
of you know like the possibility of

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.450 
of you know like the possibility of

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
creation you know like what do you do

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.570 
creation you know like what do you do
with<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.670> blank<00:02:24.910> sheet<00:02:24.970> of<00:02:25.120> paper<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:26.580> then

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
with the blank sheet of paper and then

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.170 
with the blank sheet of paper and then
you<00:02:28.120> know<00:02:28.960> as<00:02:29.230> as<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.980> story<00:02:30.250> goes<00:02:30.490> on<00:02:30.760> I

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
you know as as the story goes on I

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.750 
you know as as the story goes on I
didn't<00:02:31.840> want<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.470> didn't<00:02:32.890> want<00:02:32.920> be<00:02:33.310> equal<00:02:33.490> to<00:02:33.610> be

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
didn't want I didn't want be equal to be

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.680 
didn't want I didn't want be equal to be
too<00:02:34.120> obvious<00:02:34.420> in<00:02:35.050> his<00:02:35.560> design<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.250> when<00:02:36.490> he<00:02:36.730> was

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
too obvious in his design so when he was

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.930 
too obvious in his design so when he was
originally<00:02:38.260> drawn<00:02:38.560> he<00:02:38.890> he<00:02:39.250> did<00:02:39.520> look<00:02:39.760> like<00:02:39.790> a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
originally drawn he he did look like a

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.640 
originally drawn he he did look like a
piece<00:02:40.180> of<00:02:40.209> paper<00:02:40.570> but<00:02:40.900> I<00:02:40.959> didn't<00:02:41.230> want<00:02:41.470> it<00:02:41.590> to

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
piece of paper but I didn't want it to

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.390 
piece of paper but I didn't want it to
be<00:02:41.860> obvious<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:43.050> and<00:02:44.050> so<00:02:44.709> you<00:02:44.740> know<00:02:44.920> I<00:02:45.010> kind<00:02:45.250> of

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
be obvious and and so you know I kind of

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.010 
be obvious and and so you know I kind of
gave<00:02:45.550> him<00:02:45.670> this<00:02:45.820> blobby<00:02:46.330> little<00:02:46.810> feature<00:02:47.140> and

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
gave him this blobby little feature and

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.870 
gave him this blobby little feature and
now<00:02:50.020> the<00:02:50.080> other<00:02:50.380> metaphors<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.220> other<00:02:51.400> ideas

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
now the other metaphors the other ideas

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.470 
now the other metaphors the other ideas
