00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
further delay let's get right into this

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.520 
further delay let's get right into this
video<00:00:08.420> I'm<00:00:09.420> great<00:00:09.690> so<00:00:09.840> these<00:00:09.960> are<00:00:10.170> basically

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
video I'm great so these are basically

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.410 
video I'm great so these are basically
the<00:00:10.740> three<00:00:10.920> classes<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:11.820> I'll<00:00:12.000> just<00:00:12.179> go<00:00:12.389> over

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
the three classes so I'll just go over

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.470 
the three classes so I'll just go over
all<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.110> them<00:00:13.380> so<00:00:13.590> first<00:00:14.240> obviously<00:00:15.240> got<00:00:15.450> a

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
all of them so first obviously got a

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.269 
all of them so first obviously got a
honey<00:00:15.690> badger<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.949> it's<00:00:17.100> got<00:00:17.160> a

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
honey badger with and it's got a

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.900 
honey badger with and it's got a
foregrip<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.119> armor-piercing<00:00:19.020> round<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:20.070> for

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
foregrip and armor-piercing round so for

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.400 
foregrip and armor-piercing round so for
grip<00:00:21.150> basically<00:00:21.570> just<00:00:21.779> reduces<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.350> recoil

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
grip basically just reduces the recoil

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.410 
grip basically just reduces the recoil
that<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.100> helps<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.430> lot<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.910> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
that it helps a lot and the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.880 
that it helps a lot and the
armor-piercing<00:00:24.990> round<00:00:25.140> really<00:00:25.380> helps<00:00:25.800> to

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
armor-piercing round really helps to

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.490 
armor-piercing round really helps to
does<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> little<00:00:26.670> more<00:00:26.880> damage<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.570> that's

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
does a little more damage so that's

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.500 
does a little more damage so that's
really<00:00:28.859> great<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.490> for<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.939> perks<00:00:30.179> we<00:00:30.359> got

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
really great and for the perks we got

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.930 
really great and for the perks we got

your<00:01:27.270> footsteps<00:01:27.420> amplify<00:01:28.670> that's<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.880> good

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
your footsteps amplify that's a good

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.850 
your footsteps amplify that's a good
perk<00:01:30.600> for<00:01:30.840> me<00:01:30.930> because<00:01:31.290> if<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:31.829> a

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.999 
perk for me because if you have a
headset<00:01:32.070> emphasizing<00:01:32.759> perk<00:01:34.009> fully-loaded

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
headset emphasizing perk fully-loaded

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.580 
headset emphasizing perk fully-loaded
helps<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.490> lot<00:01:35.640> because<00:01:36.170> you<00:01:37.170> start<00:01:37.409> out<00:01:37.560> with

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
helps a lot because you start out with

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.520 
helps a lot because you start out with
your<00:01:37.770> maximum<00:01:38.490> ammo<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.259> also<00:01:40.259> if<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.439> have

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
your maximum ammo so also if you have

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.740 
your maximum ammo so also if you have
extended<00:01:41.130> mags<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.729> start<00:01:42.540> out<00:01:42.630> with

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
extended mags you start out with

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.139 
extended mags you start out with
basically<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.290> like<00:01:43.920> almost<00:01:44.310> double<00:01:47.149> next

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
basically a like almost double next

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.819 
basically a like almost double next
classes<00:01:48.570> if<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.810> don't<00:01:48.990> really<00:01:49.110> like<00:01:49.380> being

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829
