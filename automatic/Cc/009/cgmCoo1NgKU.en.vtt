00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:36.149 
second turn yet to stitch speed up time

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:45.710 
second turn yet to stitch speed up time
around<00:01:36.780> then<00:01:37.229> oh<00:01:40.159> yes<00:01:41.159> there<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:44.720> pretty

oh wait it popped out see it pops out
from<00:02:15.269> underneath<00:02:15.510> there<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.319> Springs<00:02:16.769> not

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
from underneath there and it Springs not

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.080 
from underneath there and it Springs not
working<00:02:17.610> then<00:02:18.079> it<00:02:19.079> will<00:02:19.349> do<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.819> now<00:02:21.060> that

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
working then it will do that so now that

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.940 
working then it will do that so now that
I<00:02:21.329> got<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.540> gone<00:02:21.810> under<00:02:22.140> there<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.650> that's

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
I got it gone under there and that's

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.009 
I got it gone under there and that's
spring<00:02:23.370> which<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.819> see<00:02:24.060> if<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.360> fixed<00:02:24.810> it

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.629 

Springs<00:02:31.019> working<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.799> just<00:02:31.829> you<00:02:32.220> train

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:32.639 
Springs working and I just you train

Springs working and I just you train
goes<00:02:32.850> back<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.329> forth<00:02:35.060> let's<00:02:36.060> see<00:02:36.299> if<00:02:36.389> it

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
goes back and forth let's see if it

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:42.930 
goes back and forth let's see if it
fixed<00:02:37.019> it<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:39.510> didn't

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940

I<00:02:43.440> am<00:02:44.440> within<00:02:45.340> this<00:02:45.640> thread<00:02:46.090> tensioner<00:02:46.810> then

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
I am within this thread tensioner then

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.070 
I am within this thread tensioner then
see<00:02:48.970> when<00:02:49.150> that's<00:02:49.330> not<00:02:49.510> working<00:02:50.200> I<00:02:51.180> know<00:02:52.180> might

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
see when that's not working I know might

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.170 
see when that's not working I know might
just<00:02:53.290> not<00:02:53.500> be<00:02:53.530> tightened<00:02:54.070> up<00:02:54.100> enough<00:02:54.460> but<00:02:54.640> it

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
just not be tightened up enough but it

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.100 
just not be tightened up enough but it
is<00:02:55.240> sewing<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:56.080> it's<00:02:56.290> just<00:02:56.440> adjustment
