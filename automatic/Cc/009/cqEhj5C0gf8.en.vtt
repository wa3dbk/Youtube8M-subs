with some bad back issues and the first
part<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.220> problem<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.060> very<00:01:15.119> easily

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
part of this problem is very easily

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.109 
part of this problem is very easily
solved<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.260> is<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.710> music<00:01:17.340> stand<00:01:17.580> right

one thing that I would recommend is

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.960

a<00:06:40.740> few<00:06:41.010> classes<00:06:41.250> on<00:06:41.610> it<00:06:41.730> but<00:06:41.880> they<00:06:42.570> explained

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
and I think it's a three leaders I think

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.270 
and I think it's a three leaders I think
of<00:06:48.690> water<00:06:48.990> is<00:06:49.319> the<00:06:49.470> equivalent<00:06:49.500> if<00:06:49.979> you<00:06:50.069> pick

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:50.280 
of water is the equivalent if you pick

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.740 
of water is the equivalent if you pick
that<00:06:50.310> up<00:06:50.460> that's<00:06:50.789> how<00:06:50.970> kind<00:06:51.360> of<00:06:51.419> how<00:06:51.509> heavy

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
that up that's how kind of how heavy

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.260 
that up that's how kind of how heavy
your<00:06:51.960> head<00:06:52.080> is<00:06:52.229> and<00:06:52.910> you<00:06:53.910> know<00:06:54.030> when<00:06:54.180> you
