00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.839
 you can see, let's start with your 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:21.679
 basic characteristics that are his for 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:25.910
 connect the headphones here I have the 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:28.159
 headphones is 3.5 mm for 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.119
 connect this has the camera 3 

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:35.180
 megapixels the truth I think the camera 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.600
 were less worried 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.149
 truth is very safe very good 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.780
 of very good technology and I think that in the 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.539
 camera went down a little bit good there's the 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.579
 3 megapixel camera has here the 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.600
 loudspeaker speaker to listen in 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:57.260
 loud voice our music and here in here 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:01.090
 down the cell phone has to connect 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:06.130
 our charger also 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:09.870
 is the model in white and blue with 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:14.200
 the edges with the silver edges or 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.960
 plated or try as good here 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.720
 have it will take when you call for 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.060
 power to be able to listen and 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.270
 down here I do not know if it will look good 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.130
 there you have the microphone for when 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:33.650
 we are calling for is heard 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:35.600
 our voice now let's start with 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.470
 the main thing that would be the buttons of 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.830
 here that would be this would be the home button 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.080
 optional and back this also serves to 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:50.560
 remove to see the applications that 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.560
 they are and has the 4 inch screen 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.620
 and Brazil 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:01.500
 and mobile company for very fast sailing 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:05.460
 Sail the internet remember it if 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.590
 is in your country for good sailing 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.160
 I told him this application is again 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.440
 Very soft discharge for the candle or 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.420
 know recharge for the bank candle was the 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.660
 Belgian love square which is a boyacÃ¡ 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.600
 Chile and here it has de soy 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.520
 and good has google chrome the last 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.820
 that has come out that I think is very good 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.300
 something that they get because they have less 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.810
 less virus is already google chrome like 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.810
 you can see it 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:42.329
 let's see the technical aspects has 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:46.349
 one hertz giga 512 ram processor 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:49.709
 which is the ram the ram is the speed 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.359
 as when they are not or not speed 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.400
 of the internet but what speed when 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.579
 are playing because the 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.200
 Dutch game well can play what 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:05.069
 perfect without any interruption already 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.600
 well let's start here with the 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:11.760
 to settings 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:16.260
 this team has 4.1.2 divine android 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:20.220
 not updatable or because the last 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:24.300
 that came out was 4.3 and that cappa is 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.820
 about to leave the 4.5 kitkat good here 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.530
 let's see the administrator 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.160
 Applications 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.240
 the view 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:37.070
 the applications minister here has 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.780
 device memory has 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:44.760
 approximately 2 gb and a half well now 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.730
 here in ram memory 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.319
 can not see 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:55.280
 has 512 yo in this case I have 285 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:58.190
 megabytes used and 178 megabytes 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.629
 free this is relative or is going down 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.769
 and going insane from deprivation 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:06.890
 that they have running well now in 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:11.150
 all device memory are also 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:14.730
 approximately 2 gb and a half well 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:18.450
 and now let's see so they see the 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:24.830
 Android about the device version 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:30.310
 from android 4.1.2 let's go to this 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:33.180
 and this living 4.1.2 as they decide 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.130
 or de gaulle was the truth 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.910
 the very complete truth this assure me 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:41.130
 I understand very well the cell phone very very very 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.410
 of quality and the good thing is that 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.190
 stagnant already because they have qualities of 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.860
 a medium-high- end cell phone 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.420
 well let's see the speed of 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:57.740
 cellular but in games 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:05:01.640
 let's see here this can be here the 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.490
 applications and let's go to the temple room 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.240
 two 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.330
 everything is like that 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.610
 let's see how the game goes ' because 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.099
 there the truth I played with this same 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:18.650
 secure and he walked very very very very 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:23.520
 fluid well let's see how it goes 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:26.070
 when it falls and play 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:32.120
 well there we would be 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:32.120
 we are running and we jump 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.720
 and we fell them thanks we fell 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.480
 all right 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:44.040
 there we are going to play a little more to 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.040
 let them see how he walks 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.990
 there I was running running we jumped 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.169
 as they were the walk it flowed zanola walked 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.169
 wrong 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:06:00.099
 and it's not good for him to see what's going on 

00:05:57.489 --> 00:06:02.169
 well we do not start and then if not 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:04.559
 we want to have open we only know the 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.559
 eyelash 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:11.930
 there was already vector this is a game that 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.880
 true but really yes that the video is 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:19.160
 one of the most asked for rare and weighs 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:22.690
 around 50 megabytes and this cell 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.690
 does not have 2 gb 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:29.270
 so that they are adjusting with these good 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.270
 let's see here 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.050
 with you 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:43.229
 let's play the first one because the 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:46.919
 I'm truly a beginner and memory 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:49.549
 is expandable up to 32 gigabytes very 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.549
 good the cell phone 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.160
 the team 

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.770
 already 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.570
 that is under all this that I am 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.910
 saying I looked for it to say well what 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.270
 that brings the cell phone already there we are 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.270
 judging 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.510
 we come after the living gold 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:15.800
 the truth does not have 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.800
 so it will be fine years 

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.250
 and of course we fell 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:30.260
 and good the games go well 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:33.490
 but that would be two guys for today and if 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:36.680
 ilias women if they liked 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:39.800
 They looked like like here below comments if 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:46.310
 have any questions and subscribe because 

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:49.720
 we're really going to see some of the 88 

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.720
 youtube friends take care
