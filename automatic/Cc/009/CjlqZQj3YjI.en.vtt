00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
in the very center of the board and work

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.840 
in the very center of the board and work
the<00:00:42.690> way<00:00:42.810> out<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.950> then<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.190> work<00:00:44.370> from<00:00:44.610> one

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
the way out and then you work from one

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.910 
the way out and then you work from one
side<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.930> other<00:00:46.050> getting<00:00:46.620> all<00:00:46.770> the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.570 

now<00:01:17.720> a<00:01:17.750> little<00:01:18.140> trick<00:01:18.409> is<00:01:18.650> bottom<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:19.490> I

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
now a little trick is bottom and I

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.969 
now a little trick is bottom and I
learned<00:01:19.790> a<00:01:19.880> long<00:01:19.970> time<00:01:20.030> ago<00:01:20.270> is<00:01:20.830> around<00:01:21.830> the

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
learned a long time ago is around the

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.390 
learned a long time ago is around the
corners<00:01:22.400> it's<00:01:22.760> a<00:01:22.880> little<00:01:23.120> harder<00:01:23.479> to<00:01:24.140> cut<00:01:25.130> so

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
corners it's a little harder to cut so

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.630 
corners it's a little harder to cut so
you<00:01:25.490> want<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:25.729> cut<00:01:25.909> a<00:01:25.940> sliver<00:01:26.330> into<00:01:26.750> it<00:01:30.640> you

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
you want to cut a sliver into it you

00:01:31.640 --> 00:02:00.940 
you want to cut a sliver into it you
want<00:01:31.850> to<00:01:31.970> do<00:01:32.060> that<00:01:32.150> all<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:32.570> corners<00:01:59.950> scraping

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
want to do that all the corners scraping

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.710 
want to do that all the corners scraping
it<00:02:01.070> does<00:02:01.220> two<00:02:01.490> different<00:02:01.850> things<00:02:02.000> on<00:02:02.330> the

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
it does two different things on the

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.660 
it does two different things on the
first<00:02:02.929> thing<00:02:03.050> it<00:02:03.170> does<00:02:03.200> is<00:02:03.350> it<00:02:03.530> seals<00:02:04.039> it<00:02:04.220> onto

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
first thing it does is it seals it onto

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.190 
first thing it does is it seals it onto
the<00:02:04.700> skateboard<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:05.479> it<00:02:05.600> won't<00:02:05.780> peel<00:02:06.020> off

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
the skateboard so it won't peel off

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.469 
the skateboard so it won't peel off
another<00:02:07.190> day<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.820> other<00:02:07.970> thing<00:02:08.179> it<00:02:08.300> does<00:02:08.330> is

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
another day the other thing it does is

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.990 
another day the other thing it does is
here<00:02:09.289> it<00:02:09.590> makes<00:02:09.800> it<00:02:09.950> easier<00:02:10.280> you<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.729> do<00:02:10.850> the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
here it makes it easier you to do the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.190 
here it makes it easier you to do the
final<00:02:11.269> cut<00:02:11.660> all<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.350> way<00:02:12.440> around<00:02:12.560> it<00:02:14.019> ok<00:02:15.019> the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
final cut all the way around it ok the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.680 
final cut all the way around it ok the
next<00:02:15.230> step<00:02:15.800> is<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.070> take<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.760> excess<00:02:17.209> drip

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
next step is to take the excess drip

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.690 
next step is to take the excess drip
tape<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.230> cut<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:18.590> off<00:02:18.709> you<00:02:19.340> just<00:02:19.519> need<00:02:19.670> a

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
tape and cut it off you just need a

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.630 
tape and cut it off you just need a
razor<00:02:19.970> blade<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.360> do<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.590> just<00:02:22.430> follow

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
razor blade to do that and just follow

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.759 
razor blade to do that and just follow
that<00:02:23.000> line<00:02:23.269> that<00:02:23.630> you've<00:02:23.959> already<00:02:24.350> cut<00:02:26.769> hard

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
that line that you've already cut hard

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.160 
that line that you've already cut hard
to<00:02:27.890> get<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.130> started<00:02:28.340> sometimes<00:02:29.000> once<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:30.049> get

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
to get it started sometimes once you get

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.750 
to get it started sometimes once you get
the<00:02:30.320> first<00:02:30.500> lever<00:02:30.829> you<00:02:31.070> want<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.310> do<00:02:31.430> a<00:02:31.459> very

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
the first lever you want to do a very

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.509 
the first lever you want to do a very
smooth<00:02:32.239> putt<00:02:33.100> because<00:02:34.100> it's<00:02:34.310> going<00:02:34.459> to

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
smooth putt because it's going to

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.490 
smooth putt because it's going to
dictate<00:02:35.090> how<00:02:35.510> your<00:02:35.630> skateboard<00:02:36.140> looks<00:02:36.320> when

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.630 
tape on the board it's time to put the
trucks<00:03:29.750> on<00:03:30.250> before<00:03:31.250> we<00:03:31.310> do<00:03:31.460> that<00:03:31.490> though

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
trucks on before we do that though

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.760 
trucks on before we do that though
something<00:03:32.060> I'd<00:03:32.240> recommend<00:03:32.570> is<00:03:33.350> actually

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
something I'd recommend is actually

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.000 
something I'd recommend is actually
standing<00:03:34.220> on<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.460> skateboard<00:03:34.960> just<00:03:35.960> to<00:03:36.140> press

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
standing on the skateboard just to press

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.180 
standing on the skateboard just to press
it<00:03:37.220> one<00:03:37.430> more<00:03:37.670> good<00:03:37.880> time<00:03:38.150> before<00:03:38.510> you<00:03:39.100> put<00:03:40.100> the

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
it one more good time before you put the

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.120 
it one more good time before you put the
trucks<00:03:40.430> on<00:03:40.610> all<00:03:40.820> right<00:03:41.320> if<00:03:42.320> you<00:03:42.470> have<00:03:42.620> a<00:03:42.650> small

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
trucks on all right if you have a small

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.060 
trucks on all right if you have a small
screwdriver<00:03:44.020> you<00:03:45.020> have<00:03:45.170> to<00:03:45.290> pop<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.650> holes<00:03:45.830> I

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
screwdriver you have to pop the holes I

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.980 
screwdriver you have to pop the holes I
don't<00:03:46.250> have<00:03:46.340> a<00:03:46.400> smaller<00:03:46.700> enough<00:03:46.940> one<00:03:47.150> that's

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
don't have a smaller enough one that's

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.990 
don't have a smaller enough one that's
okay<00:03:48.260> whenever<00:03:48.470> you<00:03:48.650> come<00:03:48.800> across<00:03:49.040> that<00:03:49.340> you

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
okay whenever you come across that you

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.330 
okay whenever you come across that you
can<00:03:50.120> actually<00:03:50.270> use<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.750> hardware<00:03:51.140> just<00:03:51.350> place

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
can actually use the hardware just place

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.860 
can actually use the hardware just place
the<00:03:52.490> hardware<00:03:52.790> in<00:03:52.850> the<00:03:52.940> hole<00:03:53.120> you<00:03:53.480> want<00:03:53.630> to<00:03:53.720> pop

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
the hardware in the hole you want to pop

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.300 
the hardware in the hole you want to pop
it<00:03:54.050> really<00:03:54.320> quick<00:03:54.500> or<00:03:54.680> you're<00:03:54.740> just<00:03:54.830> peel<00:03:55.190> the

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
it really quick or you're just peel the

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:09.400 
it really quick or you're just peel the
grip<00:03:55.490> tape<00:03:55.670> back<00:03:55.850> off<00:04:07.990> then<00:04:08.990> you<00:04:09.140> have<00:04:09.290> the

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
grip tape back off then you have the

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.390 
grip tape back off then you have the
holes<00:04:09.650> in<00:04:09.830> the<00:04:09.920> top<00:04:10.070> of<00:04:10.130> it

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
holes in the top of it

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.429 
holes in the top of it
go<00:04:13.180> ahead<00:04:13.420> and<00:04:13.450> place<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.930> hardware<00:04:14.290> on<00:04:14.409> the

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 
go ahead and place the hardware on the

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:24.090 
go ahead and place the hardware on the
board

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.160 

then<00:04:24.640> you<00:04:24.730> can<00:04:24.880> with<00:04:25.480> new<00:04:25.630> grip<00:04:25.840> tape<00:04:26.020> they

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
then you can with new grip tape they

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.870 
then you can with new grip tape they
usually<00:04:26.530> actually<00:04:26.830> don't<00:04:27.040> fall<00:04:27.220> out<00:04:27.250> but<00:04:27.760> you

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
usually actually don't fall out but you

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.030 
usually actually don't fall out but you
can<00:04:28.090> hold<00:04:28.540> them<00:04:28.750> with<00:04:28.870> your<00:04:28.960> hand<00:04:29.230> tip<00:04:29.920> it

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
can hold them with your hand tip it

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.490 
can hold them with your hand tip it
upside<00:04:30.190> down<00:04:30.400> and<00:04:31.300> set<00:04:31.750> your<00:04:31.900> skateboard

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
upside down and set your skateboard

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.090 
upside down and set your skateboard
truck<00:04:32.740> on<00:04:32.920> it<00:04:34.170> make<00:04:35.170> sure<00:04:35.200> the<00:04:35.530> bush<00:04:35.710> in<00:04:35.950> is

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
truck on it make sure the bush in is

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.190 
truck on it make sure the bush in is
facing<00:04:36.550> inside<00:04:36.760> because<00:04:37.660> it's<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:37.900> proper

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
facing inside because it's the proper

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.110 
facing inside because it's the proper
way<00:04:38.290> to<00:04:38.320> flip<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:38.740> truck<00:04:38.950> and<00:04:39.640> if<00:04:39.820> you<00:04:39.940> don't

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
way to flip the truck and if you don't

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.460 
way to flip the truck and if you don't
put<00:04:40.240> it<00:04:40.330> on<00:04:40.390> the<00:04:40.540> right<00:04:40.690> way<00:04:40.810> you'll<00:04:40.990> find<00:04:41.320> out

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
put it on the right way you'll find out

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.810 
put it on the right way you'll find out
right<00:04:41.770> away<00:04:41.950> because<00:04:42.220> you're<00:04:42.400> getting<00:04:42.580> speed

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
right away because you're getting speed

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.050 
right away because you're getting speed
wobble<00:04:43.180> and<00:04:43.330> you'll<00:04:43.450> pull<00:04:43.630> off<00:04:43.780> your<00:04:43.810> board

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
wobble and you'll pull off your board

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:54.310 
wobble and you'll pull off your board
then<00:04:46.060> go<00:04:46.720> ahead<00:04:46.810> and<00:04:46.930> hand<00:04:47.200> tighten<00:04:47.350> them<00:04:47.620> all
