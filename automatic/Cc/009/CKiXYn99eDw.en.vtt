00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:13.180
 hello today 1 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:17.680
 for the sake of such a programmer for 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.680
 memory chips bells 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:26.699
 well, maybe 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:29.970
 program has achieved what probably 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:39.239
 the chips are generally the simplest 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:43.579
 space programmer for support game 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.579
 passed microchips 25 sphere 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.399
 quite often not so peace walls 8 feet in 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:55.429
 enclosure ip stand on motherboards 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:01:02.280
 modern are more common in laptops 

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:04.910
 there are soldered by those who scheme mom in 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.320
 housing for smd installation when needed 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:14.130
 dropped out and through the transition 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:17.670
 can i make homemade ships for 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.179
 manufacturing that us the connector housing itself 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.909
 pt connector 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:26.640
 battery bed along with 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.460
 battery removed with defective maternal 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.649
 pay 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:38.090
 single chip socket 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:41.700
 4 resistors and one capacitor 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.600
 shooting now 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.600
 eggs on the screen 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:58.719
 Well, now I'll show you how to produce 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:12.860
 stitching I go to my computer about 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:16.300
 which I am experimenting on 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.300
 it is installed windows xp 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:25.909
 net practically system served asleep 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:34.209
 any old specific program 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:34.209
 work well west command line 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.360
 write 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.240
 run the program with pike 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.910
 launched 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:09.070
 The firmware will not be sewn up soon 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:11.880
 put documents meet dealer for 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.880
 Essentially Kira 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:22.180
 downloaded from the internet 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.180
 yes format and love 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:37.630
 we start the program a knitting needle and it happens 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:41.060
 determining our memory type 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:45.710
 25 series here we have kilobytes of cat data 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:50.510
 raised produce unlock here 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:04:02.270
 record with all flash drive 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:04:06.020
 unlocked read modes. 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:09.880
 shield achievement key d holder write 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.880
 a name that is appreciated by couples 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.109
 Sedum 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:37.550
 read 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:39.910
 let's spoon with our sotrom 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.910
 Where 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.920
 let's write now 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:59.340
 he firmware previously thought 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:05:01.040
 and write suffered our name 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.040
 Roma 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.040
 write 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:23.099
 recorded term 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:26.599
 Well again consider them another 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:29.579
 t2 for example. 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:33.089
 why do we need to do it now 

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:34.699
 We read the contents of the flash drive and compare it with 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:38.409
 reference source file 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:41.789
 they found a match 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:46.800
 If coincided night kick problems arose 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.800
 in the process of firmware necessary to alter 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:07.330
 read release dad team do 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.330
 compare after eating my wife 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:22.440
 the file we called type2 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:31.790
 these files are the same what firmware you 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.790
 well 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:40.630
 all a reference to download the program and 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:45.880
 you are here with the tight I will leave under the video 

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.880
 who needs to download and use 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:55.270
 all the while subscribe to the channel 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:55.270
 likes to meet again
