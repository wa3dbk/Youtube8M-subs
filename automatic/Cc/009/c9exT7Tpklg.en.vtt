him he has a tick right there on I and

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.300 
him he has a tick right there on I and
then<00:00:14.730> he<00:00:14.880> has<00:00:14.969> one<00:00:15.179> in<00:00:15.299> his<00:00:15.420> ear<00:00:16.100> and<00:00:17.100> then<00:00:17.220> he

then he has one in his ear and then he

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.439 
then he has one in his ear and then he
also<00:00:17.490> has<00:00:17.880> another<00:00:18.270> one<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:18.840> between<00:00:19.080> his<00:00:19.350> paws

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
also has another one in between his paws

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.200 
also has another one in between his paws
I'll<00:00:21.449> get<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.810> but<00:00:22.640> as<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.820> could<00:00:24.029> see

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
I'll get to that but as you could see

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.870 
I'll get to that but as you could see
this<00:00:24.390> big<00:00:24.660> this<00:00:24.960> tick<00:00:25.199> here<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.619> big<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.640> he's

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
this big this tick here is big and he's

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.029 
this big this tick here is big and he's
full<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:28.199> other<00:00:28.320> one<00:00:28.500> by<00:00:28.619> his<00:00:28.800> eye<00:00:28.980> is

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
full and the other one by his eye is

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:37.370 
full and the other one by his eye is
empty<00:00:30.050> or<00:00:31.050> young<00:00:31.520> or<00:00:32.520> new<00:00:34.399> so<00:00:36.170> you<00:00:37.170> could

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
empty or young or new so you could

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.880 
empty or young or new so you could
actually<00:00:37.590> see<00:00:38.420> here<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.440> can't<00:00:40.680> really

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
actually see here that you can't really

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.130 
actually see here that you can't really
put<00:00:41.100> any<00:00:41.309> solution<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.239> tick<00:00:42.660> because

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
put any solution on this tick because

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.000 
put any solution on this tick because
it's<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:43.440> close<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.739> his<00:00:44.040> eye<00:00:44.450> I<00:00:45.590> would<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.860> to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
it's so close to his eye I would have to

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.670 
it's so close to his eye I would have to
just<00:00:47.390> take<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.570> tweezers<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.260> pluck<00:00:49.469> it

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
just take the tweezers and pluck it

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.260 
just take the tweezers and pluck it
right<00:00:49.890> out<00:00:51.140> unfortunately

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.440 

and<00:00:58.270> oh<00:00:59.050> here's<00:00:59.590> the<00:00:59.860> tick<00:01:00.340> on<00:01:00.460> between<00:01:01.150> his

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
and oh here's the tick on between his

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:14.890 
and oh here's the tick on between his
fingers<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:05.260> his<00:01:05.500> paw<00:01:05.770> whatever<00:01:06.310> okay<00:01:07.180> so

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.960 

I<00:01:14.990> guess<00:01:15.710> that's<00:01:15.950> just<00:01:16.040> another<00:01:16.310> close-up<00:01:16.820> on

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
I guess that's just another close-up on

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.390 
I guess that's just another close-up on
the<00:01:20.890> alright<00:01:21.890> here<00:01:22.040> we<00:01:22.070> go

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
the alright here we go

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.020 
the alright here we go
since<00:01:23.120> this<00:01:23.330> tick<00:01:23.570> is<00:01:23.840> is<00:01:24.250> full<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:25.490> it's<00:01:25.790> old

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
since this tick is is full and it's old

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.620 
since this tick is is full and it's old
and<00:01:26.590> large<00:01:27.590> or<00:01:27.830> whatever<00:01:28.270> they<00:01:29.270> released

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
and large or whatever they released

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.810 
and large or whatever they released
pretty<00:01:29.870> easily<00:01:30.230> so<00:01:31.040> what<00:01:31.250> I<00:01:31.280> did<00:01:31.400> was<00:01:31.610> I<00:01:31.760> gave

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
pretty easily so what I did was I gave

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.780 
pretty easily so what I did was I gave
him<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.150> drop<00:01:32.360> of<00:01:32.390> solution<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.200> then<00:01:33.670> just<00:01:34.670> a

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
him a drop of solution and then just a

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.910 
him a drop of solution and then just a
small<00:01:35.180> tiny<00:01:35.510> drop<00:01:35.870> and<00:01:36.530> now<00:01:36.560> I'm<00:01:36.800> just

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
small tiny drop and now I'm just

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.180 
small tiny drop and now I'm just
applying<00:01:37.070> some<00:01:37.840> some<00:01:38.840> pressure<00:01:39.170> or<00:01:39.560> agitation

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
applying some some pressure or agitation

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.140 
applying some some pressure or agitation
pulling<00:01:40.790> him<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.500> he<00:01:42.500> released<00:01:42.740> it<00:01:43.010> you<00:01:44.000> could

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
pulling him and he released it you could

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.760 
pulling him and he released it you could
tell<00:01:44.300> he<00:01:44.540> released<00:01:44.840> it<00:01:45.050> you<00:01:45.290> can<00:01:45.470> tell<00:01:45.620> him

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
tell he released it you can tell him

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.280 
tell he released it you can tell him
he's<00:01:46.300> you<00:01:47.300> could<00:01:47.450> tell<00:01:47.600> you<00:01:47.720> that<00:01:47.900> he<00:01:47.990> released

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
he's you could tell you that he released

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.910 
he's you could tell you that he released
it<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:49.660> there's<00:01:50.660> nothing<00:01:50.990> left<00:01:51.200> inside<00:01:51.650> of

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
it and there's nothing left inside of

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.520 
it and there's nothing left inside of
the<00:01:52.130> ear<00:01:52.340> by<00:01:53.330> inspecting<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.990> tick<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:54.470> I

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
the ear by inspecting the tick and I

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.260 
the ear by inspecting the tick and I
looked<00:01:54.770> closely<00:01:55.160> at<00:01:55.460> this<00:01:55.550> tick<00:01:55.820> and<00:01:56.090> I

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
looked closely at this tick and I

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.070 
looked closely at this tick and I
noticed<00:01:56.660> all<00:01:56.930> of<00:01:57.290> his<00:01:58.450> mouth<00:01:59.450> parts<00:01:59.869> were

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
noticed all of his mouth parts were

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.219 
noticed all of his mouth parts were
still<00:02:00.380> intact<00:02:01.340> so<00:02:01.670> I<00:02:02.270> disposed<00:02:02.780> of<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:03.020> tick

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
still intact so I disposed of the tick

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.090 
still intact so I disposed of the tick
and<00:02:03.530> I<00:02:04.420> continued<00:02:05.420> onward<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:06.470> I<00:02:06.830> look<00:02:06.979> at

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
and I continued onward and I look at

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.790 
and I continued onward and I look at
this<00:02:07.280> one<00:02:07.520> here<00:02:08.140> since<00:02:09.140> it's<00:02:09.290> close<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.530> his

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
this one here since it's close to his

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.880 
this one here since it's close to his
eye<00:02:10.040> I<00:02:10.600> couldn't<00:02:11.600> put<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:11.870> drop<00:02:12.110> of<00:02:12.140> solution<00:02:12.740> on

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
eye I couldn't put a drop of solution on

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.590 
eye I couldn't put a drop of solution on
that<00:02:12.920> one<00:02:14.890> but<00:02:15.970> fortunately<00:02:16.970> it<00:02:17.209> was<00:02:17.360> able<00:02:17.480> to

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
that one but fortunately it was able to

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.680 
that one but fortunately it was able to
come<00:02:17.900> come<00:02:18.320> off<00:02:18.700> wasn't<00:02:19.700> too<00:02:19.850> bad<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.330> come<00:02:20.480> off

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
come come off wasn't too bad to come off

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.600 
come come off wasn't too bad to come off
very<00:02:23.470> gently<00:02:24.470> don't<00:02:25.160> you<00:02:25.250> don't<00:02:25.400> want<00:02:25.519> to

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
very gently don't you don't want to

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.080 
very gently don't you don't want to
scare<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.060> creature<00:02:26.300> you<00:02:27.880> want<00:02:28.880> to<00:02:28.970> be<00:02:29.060> very

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
scare the creature you want to be very

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.350 
scare the creature you want to be very
gentle<00:02:29.540> with<00:02:29.810> him<00:02:30.610> okay<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:31.670> here's<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.180> one

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
gentle with him okay so here's the one

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.140 
gentle with him okay so here's the one
between<00:02:32.600> his<00:02:32.810> paws<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:34.640> I<00:02:34.790> think<00:02:35.000> I<00:02:35.030> actually

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
between his paws and I think I actually

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.199 
between his paws and I think I actually
put<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.720> lot<00:02:36.019> of<00:02:36.170> solution<00:02:36.560> on<00:02:36.650> this<00:02:36.800> one<00:02:40.209> here

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
put a lot of solution on this one here

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.760 
put a lot of solution on this one here
we<00:02:41.300> go

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.080 

okay<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:47.140> put<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.560> solution<00:02:47.920> on<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.280> then<00:02:48.370> try

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
okay so put the solution on and then try

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.500 
okay so put the solution on and then try
and<00:02:49.120> agitate<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:51.700> tick<00:02:51.910> will<00:02:52.090> start<00:02:52.360> to

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
and agitate it the tick will start to

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.620 
and agitate it the tick will start to
release<00:02:53.340> there's<00:02:54.340> no<00:02:54.700> way<00:02:55.090> I<00:02:55.120> can<00:02:55.270> capture

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
release there's no way I can capture

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.340 
release there's no way I can capture
this<00:02:55.870> on<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.200> camera<00:02:56.590> but<00:02:56.860> I<00:02:57.100> saw<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:57.940> tick

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
this on the camera but I saw the tick

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.160 
this on the camera but I saw the tick
usually<00:02:59.350> they<00:03:00.180> grasp<00:03:01.180> on<00:03:01.450> with<00:03:01.780> all<00:03:01.990> their

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.370 
usually they grasp on with all their

bit tugging I applied I started with

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.730 
bit tugging I applied I started with
very<00:03:16.030> very<00:03:16.360> gentle<00:03:16.810> tugs<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:17.500> then<00:03:18.100> I<00:03:19.620> gave<00:03:20.620> it
