00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
competitive people so there are rules to

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.670 
competitive people so there are rules to
cover<00:01:53.909> what<00:01:54.750> happens<00:01:55.110> with<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> game<00:01:55.649> that

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680

doesn't complete and when you look at
these<00:01:58.140> rules<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.829> gets<00:01:59.130> quite<00:01:59.430> interesting<00:02:00.229> so

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229

looks like it's pretty complicated in
fact<00:02:30.150> it's<00:02:30.599> not<00:02:30.750> really<00:02:31.139> but<00:02:32.040> if<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.609> don't

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
fact it's not really but if you don't

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.839 
fact it's not really but if you don't
finish<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.329> game<00:02:33.560> these<00:02:34.560> are<00:02:34.889> how<00:02:35.099> you<00:02:35.159> score

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
finish the game these are how you score

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.479 
finish the game these are how you score
points<00:02:36.709> now<00:02:37.709> what's<00:02:37.920> going<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.099> happen<00:02:38.159> is

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
points now what's going to happen is

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.509 
points now what's going to happen is
you're<00:02:38.670> going<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.849> be<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.209> charge<00:02:39.239> of<00:02:40.519> Nobles

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
you're going to be in charge of Nobles

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.780 
you're going to be in charge of Nobles
who<00:02:42.120> will<00:02:42.810> have<00:02:43.019> troops<00:02:43.319> assigned<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:43.950> them<00:02:44.099> so

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
who will have troops assigned to them so

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.580 
who will have troops assigned to them so
for<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.239> total<00:02:45.659> number<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:45.959> troops<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.409> you

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
for the total number of troops that you

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.920 
for the total number of troops that you
have<00:02:46.739> at<00:02:46.859> the<00:02:46.950> end<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.189> the<00:02:47.250> game<00:02:47.689> you<00:02:48.689> add<00:02:48.810> all

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
have at the end of the game you add all

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.729 
have at the end of the game you add all
those<00:02:49.109> troops<00:02:49.439> up<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.629> probably<00:02:52.530> I

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
those troops up and that is probably I

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.890 
those troops up and that is probably I
would<00:02:52.889> suggest<00:02:53.069> usually<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.180> main<00:02:54.389> part<00:02:54.750> of

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
would suggest usually the main part of

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.140 
would suggest usually the main part of
your<00:02:54.959> score<00:02:55.470> then<00:02:56.459> if<00:02:56.579> you<00:02:56.669> actually<00:02:56.790> have<00:02:57.120> a

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
your score then if you actually have a

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.659 
your score then if you actually have a
role<00:02:57.419> piece<00:02:57.750> in<00:02:58.500> your<00:02:58.709> hands<00:02:59.219> you'll<00:02:59.489> get<00:02:59.639> a

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
role piece in your hands you'll get a

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.330 
role piece in your hands you'll get a
hundred<00:02:59.939> bonus<00:03:00.510> he's<00:03:00.840> crowned<00:03:01.260> king<00:03:02.099> or<00:03:02.219> queen

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
hundred bonus he's crowned king or queen

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.509 
hundred bonus he's crowned king or queen
another<00:03:02.730> hundred<00:03:02.969> if<00:03:03.870> he's<00:03:04.349> first<00:03:05.340> in

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
another hundred if he's first in

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.530 
another hundred if he's first in
succession<00:03:05.969> 75<00:03:06.750> 50<00:03:07.379> 25<00:03:08.120> then<00:03:09.120> this<00:03:09.269> is<00:03:09.419> the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
succession 75 50 25 then this is the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.479 
succession 75 50 25 then this is the
interesting<00:03:10.109> thing<00:03:10.319> here<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.889> this<00:03:11.099> is<00:03:11.280> what

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
interesting thing here and this is what

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.750 
interesting thing here and this is what
actually<00:03:11.700> makes<00:03:12.180> it<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.799> more<00:03:13.799> tactical<00:03:14.340> game

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
actually makes it a more tactical game

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.530 
actually makes it a more tactical game
than<00:03:15.329> perhaps<00:03:16.260> those<00:03:17.129> of<00:03:17.340> us<00:03:17.459> who've<00:03:17.760> played

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
than perhaps those of us who've played

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.089 
than perhaps those of us who've played
games<00:03:18.840> for<00:03:19.079> a<00:03:19.109> while<00:03:19.229> now<00:03:19.500> can<00:03:19.799> remember

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
games for a while now can remember

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.750 
games for a while now can remember
because<00:03:20.909> I<00:03:21.209> know<00:03:21.840> when<00:03:22.109> I<00:03:22.229> was<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.709> team<00:03:23.220> playing

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
because I know when I was a team playing

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.210 
because I know when I was a team playing
this<00:03:23.909> for<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.209> first<00:03:24.329> time<00:03:24.889> we<00:03:25.889> played<00:03:26.099> it

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
this for the first time we played it

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.069 
this for the first time we played it
many<00:03:26.340> many<00:03:26.519> times<00:03:26.669> and<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.269> was<00:03:27.329> always<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.840> try

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
many many times and it was always to try

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.259 
many many times and it was always to try
and<00:03:28.229> reach<00:03:28.409> the<00:03:28.440> end<00:03:28.769> which<00:03:29.189> is<00:03:29.400> have<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.090> last

and reach the end which is have the last
local<00:03:30.959> piece<00:03:31.139> well<00:03:31.739> if<00:03:31.829> you<00:03:31.919> don't<00:03:32.129> finish<00:03:32.400> and

local piece well if you don't finish and

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.539 
local piece well if you don't finish and

towns notice how many points that's

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.699 
towns notice how many points that's
worth<00:03:38.129> so<00:03:39.090> now<00:03:39.329> I'll<00:03:39.780> come<00:03:39.989> back<00:03:40.139> to<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.379> rest

will see that there's actually quite a

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.729 
will see that there's actually quite a
few<00:03:59.639> of<00:03:59.699> these<00:04:01.370> capable<00:04:02.370> store<00:04:02.849> mobile
