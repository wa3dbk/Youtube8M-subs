00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.840
 what is the volunteer fireman for all 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.360
 those who believe that being a firefighter is 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.610
 how to go to the club to go fishing 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.759
 play soccer for those who watch us 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.130
 with a smile like saying there's 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.650
 be fart to be a firefighter for 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.169
 that they did not try to start for the 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.840
 they say let you notice when they 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:32.419
 you offer to become a member for 5 pesos per 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.790
 month even if I saved the house or 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.090
 for the one who told me 'he did not give me 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.280
 liked silver and had a new car 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.530
 in the yard for those who say that 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.269
 we are always late for those who 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.030
 think that only the firefighters of the 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:50.059
 movies or the big cities are what 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.219
 that really endanger your life and 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.499
 They do not know that several times a year we 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.690
 we face situations where the 

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:59.210
 people do not know what to do and calls us to 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.829
 we who often call us 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.260
 for tasks their functions that do not 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.930
 they correspond and get angry when everything 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.780
 What we can do is give them a 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.370
 phone number but do not know that 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.950
 we face jugs about to explode 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.860
 carbon monoxide smoke 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.719
 at high temperatures steam accidents 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.429
 with vehicles that transport products 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:23.679
 explosive toxic carcinogenic chemicals 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:25.820
 radioactive or waste that 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:27.710
 continuously enter our 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.590
 lungs raising the possibility of 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.210
 cancer that we enter but you are in places 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.659
 where the common people try to 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.890
 get out as fast as possible 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.140
 unfortunately we have to see the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.810
 worst of the misfortunes and put the 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.880
 better face and give you a solution that does not 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.280
 We measure giving to reach the end that 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.950
 we want but we often eat 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.039
 we are angry and we feel frustrated because 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.020
 all our efforts reach that 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.060
 many times we have fears but the 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.539
 we face and overcome to continue 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.390
 forward I intend to reflect how bad 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.209
 It has not happened we always do 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.819
 time to relax and even get out 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:11.540
 one way but we leave families 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:14.000
 pronovias friends children a job and 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.069
 much more to save an alien good that 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.580
 is burning or someone's life 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.100
 caught between 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.770
 that we lose most of the purposes of 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.080
 week of our best age in courses 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.140
 of training while the majority of 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.840
 people peace rests with family 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.110
 that we do not charge a single peso for it 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.690
 but if we often need one 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.330
 that when the siren sounds many times 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.720
 at night or at dawn we shit 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.510
 cold heat of hunger of thirst of fear 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.180
 of anger and every thousand people is born a 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.120
 crazy that becomes a fireman if those crazy 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.490
 Why would not exist society 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.710
 who would you call if you catch fire 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.840
 house or who are you calling 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.750
 if you hit a pineapple with the car and 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.270
 people were trapped whom you call if 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.209
 Some relative falls into a well and if 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.700
 there is a suicide in a tower that no longer 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.580
 we are more firefighters put out fire than today 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.950
 in day our training comprises of 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.350
 the true professionals and that I do not 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.239
 it matters to lose humility by saying that 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.600
 the only thing that we need to be 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.459
 professionals is a salary receipt 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.560
 people before criticizing a fireman 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.750
 volunteer I went through the barracks that 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.150
 while we take some mates I explain 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.420
 what it really is and what it feels like to be 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.049
 it was always easy to criticize a work and 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.049
 try to improve 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.760
 do not
