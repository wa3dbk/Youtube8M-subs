00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
see that I do like that I do like the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.600 
see that I do like that I do like the
hardware<00:02:03.509> on<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.770> this<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.979> another<00:02:05.250> problem

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
hardware on it this is another problem

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.819 
hardware on it this is another problem
that<00:02:06.030> there<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.390> with<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.869> don't<00:02:07.350> know<00:02:07.560> where

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.469 
that there is with it I don't know where
the<00:02:08.009> logic<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.550> in<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:08.879> like<00:02:09.060> what<00:02:09.300> are<00:02:09.390> we

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
the logic is in this like what are we

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.059 
the logic is in this like what are we

something that I would like but it might

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.629 
something that I would like but it might
just<00:05:08.419> be<00:05:08.509> the<00:05:08.689> things<00:05:08.900> that<00:05:09.050> I<00:05:09.110> chose<00:05:09.439> I<00:05:09.800> don't

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
know it but I mean the thing is is when

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.709 
know it but I mean the thing is is when
you<00:05:12.919> when<00:05:13.129> you<00:05:13.250> go<00:05:13.789> on<00:05:13.939> a<00:05:13.969> site<00:05:14.240> like<00:05:14.449> this
