but<00:01:27.720> with<00:01:27.870> this<00:01:28.020> phone<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.380> little<00:01:28.560> bit

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
but with this phone is a little bit

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.840 
but with this phone is a little bit
different<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.070> show<00:01:29.160> how<00:01:29.250> fast<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:29.640> take

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
different to show how fast you can take

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.960 
different to show how fast you can take
pictures<00:01:30.060> with<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:32.090> look<00:01:33.090> at<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:34.970> can

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
pictures with this look at that you can

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.750 
pictures with this look at that you can
really<00:01:36.210> take<00:01:36.510> fast<00:01:36.930> pictures<00:01:37.580> with<00:01:38.580> this

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
really take fast pictures with this

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.310 
really take fast pictures with this
phone<00:01:38.970> that's<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:39.330> how<00:01:39.420> quick<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:41.960> ed<00:01:42.960> and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
phone that's just how quick it is ed and

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.110 
phone that's just how quick it is ed and
I<00:01:43.500> think<00:01:44.130> it's<00:01:44.340> because<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
I think it's because of the the

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.270 
I think it's because of the the
processor<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.080> the<00:01:46.170> phone<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.620> because<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:46.980> how

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
processor of the phone is because of how

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.550 
processor of the phone is because of how
fast<00:01:47.550> the<00:01:47.730> processor<00:01:47.910> is<00:01:48.300> with<00:01:49.200> any<00:01:49.380> other

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
fast the processor is with any other

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.590 
fast the processor is with any other
phone<00:01:49.830> you<00:01:50.100> really<00:01:50.310> can't<00:01:50.520> take<00:01:50.760> fast

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
phone you really can't take fast

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.890 
phone you really can't take fast
