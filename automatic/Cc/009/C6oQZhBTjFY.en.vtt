00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.060 
change it up just a little bit it's not
necessarily<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.150> bad<00:02:16.390> boy<00:02:17.370> it's<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.940> CX<00:02:19.690> line

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
necessarily a bad boy it's the CX line

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.220 
necessarily a bad boy it's the CX line
but<00:02:21.070> we<00:02:21.250> like<00:02:21.490> it<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.730> little<00:02:21.910> more<00:02:23.310> because

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
but we like it a little more because

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.470 
but we like it a little more because
it's<00:02:26.250> $70<00:02:27.250> price<00:02:27.430> point

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
it's $70 price point

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.509 
it's $70 price point
so<00:02:29.480> at<00:02:29.780> several<00:02:30.260> hours<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.680> makes<00:02:30.890> it<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.220> little

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
so at several hours it makes it a little

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.729 
so at several hours it makes it a little
more<00:02:31.819> inexpensive<00:02:32.750> than<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.989> bass<00:02:33.200> bad<00:02:33.500> boy

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
more inexpensive than the bass bad boy

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.210 
more inexpensive than the bass bad boy
but<00:02:34.700> this<00:02:35.510> bike<00:02:35.810> has<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.290> little<00:02:36.650> gloss<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:37.190> the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
but this bike has a little gloss to the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.940 
but this bike has a little gloss to the
color<00:02:37.519> shiny<00:02:38.390> with<00:02:38.930> red<00:02:39.140> accents<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:39.739> red

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
color shiny with red accents and red

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.710 
color shiny with red accents and red
highway<00:02:40.310> nipples<00:02:40.730> which<00:02:41.239> give<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.480> a<00:02:41.599> little

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
highway nipples which give it a little

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.720 
highway nipples which give it a little
bit<00:02:41.870> of<00:02:41.989> a<00:02:42.050> twist<00:02:42.349> I'm<00:02:43.129> still<00:02:43.519> with<00:02:43.640> the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
bit of a twist I'm still with the

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.869 
bit of a twist I'm still with the
Shimano<00:02:44.060> drivetrain<00:02:44.660> filled<00:02:45.500> up<00:02:45.830> it's<00:02:46.370> not<00:02:46.610> as

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
Shimano drivetrain filled up it's not as

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.930 
Shimano drivetrain filled up it's not as
aggressive<00:02:47.420> as<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.500> bad<00:02:48.650> boy<00:02:48.680> but<00:02:49.489> flip<00:02:49.790> the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
aggressive as the bad boy but flip the

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.400 
aggressive as the bad boy but flip the
stem<00:02:50.180> down<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:50.690> you<00:02:50.810> will<00:02:50.930> bring<00:02:51.110> your<00:02:51.230> body

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
stem down and you will bring your body

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.990 
stem down and you will bring your body
push<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.769> down<00:02:51.950> so<00:02:52.190> there's<00:02:52.489> a<00:02:52.549> way<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:52.700> little

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
push it down so there's a way a little

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.089 
push it down so there's a way a little
tweaks<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:53.569> turns<00:02:53.870> here<00:02:54.140> in<00:02:54.290> there<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.920> you

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
tweaks and turns here in there and you

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.369 
tweaks and turns here in there and you
can<00:02:55.250> get<00:02:55.370> yourself<00:02:55.459> into<00:02:55.849> that<00:02:56.239> body<00:02:57.230> style

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:57.379 
can get yourself into that body style

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.890 
can get yourself into that body style
but<00:02:58.069> just<00:02:58.099> not<00:02:58.730> as<00:02:58.910> much<00:02:59.150> is<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.510> little<00:02:59.720> more

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
but just not as much is it a little more

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.960 
but just not as much is it a little more
a<00:02:59.959> little<00:03:00.110> more<00:03:00.290> upright<00:03:00.590> but<00:03:01.400> we<00:03:01.790> are

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970
