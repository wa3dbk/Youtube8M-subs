00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.990
 greet them and pm and this time they 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.510
 We will present the first part of 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.059
 stranger natural phenomena and 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.759
 amazing from the world to help me 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.670
 I present to my new assistant his 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:19.279
 name is in the cagua guinea pig 1 I am the 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.840
 new andy assistant start with the 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:26.150
 natural phenomena 1 aurora one 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.609
 polar angled flower occurs when 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.439
 a mass injection or collides with 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.980
 the north and south poles of the magnetosphere 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.260
 terrestrial reducing a diffuse light but 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.030
 predominantly projected in which the 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.570
 ground braking 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.670
 occur when charged particles 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.070
 buttons and electrons are guided by the 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.309
 magnetic field of the earth and they strike 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.079
 in the atmosphere near the poles 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.149
 when its particles collide with 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.280
 atoms and oxygen molecules and 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.769
 nitrogen that constitute the 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.870
 most abundant components of the air 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.420
 part of the collision energy 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.670
 there are those atoms at energy levels 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.619
 such that when you were exciting 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.820
 keep that energy in the form of light 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:13.369
 visible two luminous pillars the 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.649
 luminous or light pillars appear as 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.920
 light columns in vertical position 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.560
 to 10 sky these pillars are visible 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.690
 when the light is reflected directly 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.819
 towards ice crystals either by the 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.090
 sunlight or artificial sources 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:31.369
 as it is from the street or parks despite 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.950
 from its appearance of solid light columns 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.909
 the visual effect is created by our 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.880
 relative point of view 3 the stones 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.969
 that move alone in the well-known valley 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.750
 of death in the USA there is a phenomenon 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:47.090
 singular 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.670
 it's about stones that seem to float 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.270
 over a wasteland desert that in some 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.760
 moment was the mud for decades the 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.220
 scientists have theorized explanations 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.350
 plausible about this anomaly where a 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.869
 stone of several kilos of weight to is 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.110
 able to move several hundred 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:09.110
 meters alone many believe that this 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.630
 movement is due to the strong wind but 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.670
 that does not explain that stones of different 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.970
 size and weight move at a rate 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.550
 parallel and in different directions 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.250
 besides the physical calculations either 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.959
 support this theory since for that 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.270
 some stones move 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.700
 they would need speed winds 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.459
 greater than hundreds of kilometers 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.130
 hour the wind can move stones 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:38.660
 small but how do you move some of 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:41.420
 several tens of kilos 4 cataracts of the 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.640
 Niagara frozen waterfalls 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.100
 Niagara tend to suffer from cold winters 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.470
 but they are not as far north as I could 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.150
 think about seeing the photographs of the 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.400
 freeze of 2010 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.579
 the main cataract is in the same 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.040
 latitude than the North American city 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.140
 however lacks the street of 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.390
 influence of the Gulf Stream and 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.790
 their winters are colder than those of 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.040
 Western Europe but not as much as the 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:11.900
 of this year that is really being 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.450
 genre 5 the blood eye is 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.819
 structure in richard on the continent 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.879
 African is visible from space 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.549
 thanks to its almost 50 kilometers of 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:25.790
 diameter attracts attention its curious 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.700
 concentric rings your bridge the 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.400
 Sahara desert Mauritania to a 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:38.329
 height of 400 meters above the level of 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:41.450
 sea is believed to be the product of 6 this 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:44.030
 cuate sky mode earthquake of heaven is 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.250
 an explosion in the sky whose sound is 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.109
 generated by a particular movement of 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.230
 gases that does not have a 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:53.480
 concrete scientific explanation the 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.430
 phenomenon has been identified in places 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.120
 from the USA as florida 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.650
 Pennsylvania but also in Australia 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.930
 many times it is believed that there may be 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.969
 been an airplane that broke the barrier of 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.069
 sound ' although according to pages of 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:08.900
 meteorology that studies phenomena 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.420
 strange it is believed that the noise of 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.579
 explosion arises when a layer of air 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.739
 it gets hotter than the rest and when it hits 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:21.289
 against the coldest air there arises a 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:24.259
 kind of explosion 79 times back and 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:26.509
 however real this has happened in 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:28.849
 occasions throughout history 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.710
 from biblical times to the 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:33.259
 recent history 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.270
 meteorologists are still not sure of 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:38.360
 the cause but it is believed that the waterspouts 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.610
 marine tornadoes in the sea collect the 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.849
 sea fish at a lot of height and then 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.310
 they fall in the form of rain the rain of 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.500
 as a fish is in Honduras 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:53.330
 present between the months of May in 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.849
 July since 1998 there is a festival 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.240
 called festival of the rain of texts 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.740
 there are eight rainbow fire 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.560
 probabilities 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.860
 one of these very peculiar rainbows are 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.080
 extremely low are produced by a 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.360
 Rare convergence of the sun's rays 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.330
 in some clouds that must have a 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.000
 Specific position when reflecting light 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.039
 of the sun the ice crystals of these 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.500
 clouds produce visible rays of 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:24.349
 different spectra as is 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.599
 extremely unusual to see photographs 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.880
 of this phenomenon is not very popular and 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:34.220
 being able to take a snapshot is a great 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:37.220
 luck you did not ever ask yourself 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.099
 about the truth of others these clouds 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:43.099
 they are stationary and they are formed to large 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:46.729
 altitudes in long mountainous areas of 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:48.560
 other clouds between the heaps passes 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:50.840
 these clouds are considered as 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.449
 storm omen 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.550
 the glider pilots continuously 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:57.590
 they look for this type of clouds because the 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.780
 atmospheric system that forms them 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.659
 involves large vertical movements 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.460
 air and precise location 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:06.409
 find the rising air is very 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.920
 easy to predict has observed the 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:10.220
 Oriental 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:15.700
 of the cloud the world record improves 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:20.720
 the distance 3000 km altitude 14 thousand 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:22.880
 938 m had it with this type of clouds 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.100
 the pilgrims of RodrÃ­guez are already avoiding 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.480
 due to the turbulence created in the 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:31.880
 rotor systems 10 ice waves the 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.980
 also called ice wave is a 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:37.100
 natural phenomenon that occurs in climates 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.380
 cold the phenomenon occurs when on the 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.540
 sea ââa layer of ice is created that the 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:44.630
 same sea pushes towards the coast creating 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:47.510
 a kind of ice wave some what 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.580
 have described as an ice tsunami the 

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.550
 phenomenon is rare and quite 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.200
 strange some scientists believe that it is 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:56.690
 a phenomenon caused by the 

00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:00.140
 global warming 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:03.680
 after that was the first part very soon 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:07.200
 we will release the next video you see 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.270
 21 subscribe to be aware of 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.830
 more videos and give me I like if you 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.090
 it seemed some of these phenomena 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.090
 those friends
