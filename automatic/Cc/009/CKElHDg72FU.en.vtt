00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
a watery texture wasn't too impressed

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.560 
a watery texture wasn't too impressed
with<00:04:16.440> but<00:04:16.560> anyways<00:04:16.890> um<00:04:17.450> when<00:04:18.450> I<00:04:18.480> first

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
with but anyways um when I first

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.200 
with but anyways um when I first
received<00:04:18.959> it<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.530> was<00:04:19.650> white<00:04:19.919> like<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.820> liquid

was white
and<00:04:22.330> then<00:04:22.539> I<00:04:22.930> made<00:04:23.889> the<00:04:24.160> huge<00:04:24.550> mistake<00:04:24.610> of

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
and then I made the huge mistake of

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.510 
and then I made the huge mistake of
leaving<00:04:25.599> the<00:04:26.110> bottle<00:04:26.440> open<00:04:26.800> I<00:04:26.889> used<00:04:27.130> it<00:04:27.340> and<00:04:27.430> I

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
leaving the bottle open I used it and I

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.930 
leaving the bottle open I used it and I
left<00:04:27.759> it<00:04:28.000> like<00:04:28.150> this<00:04:28.180> and<00:04:29.190> when<00:04:30.190> I<00:04:30.220> went<00:04:30.699> again

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
left it like this and when I went again

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.730 
left it like this and when I went again
to<00:04:30.970> use<00:04:31.270> it<00:04:31.389> the<00:04:31.479> next<00:04:31.690> day<00:04:31.870> and<00:04:32.050> had<00:04:32.470> turned

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
to use it the next day and had turned

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.219 
to use it the next day and had turned
yellow<00:04:33.250> and<00:04:34.080> then<00:04:35.080> now<00:04:36.690> it's<00:04:37.690> turned<00:04:38.080> this

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
yellow and then now it's turned this

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.879 
yellow and then now it's turned this
like<00:04:38.440> really<00:04:38.740> dark<00:04:39.310> amber<00:04:40.150> color<00:04:40.449> I<00:04:40.889> don't

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
like really dark amber color I don't

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.320 
like really dark amber color I don't
know<00:04:42.009> the<00:04:42.280> I<00:04:42.430> don't<00:04:42.610> think<00:04:42.759> the<00:04:42.849> computer<00:04:43.270> is

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
know the I don't think the computer is

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.909 
know the I don't think the computer is
taking<00:04:43.509> of<00:04:43.780> it<00:04:43.900> so<00:04:44.080> it's<00:04:44.199> really<00:04:44.349> dark<00:04:44.650> I<00:04:44.860> think

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
taking of it so it's really dark I think

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.890 
taking of it so it's really dark I think
it<00:04:45.160> looks<00:04:45.310> more<00:04:45.520> yellowish<00:04:45.849> on<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:46.449> computer

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
it looks more yellowish on the computer

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.110 
it looks more yellowish on the computer
screen<00:04:47.050> but<00:04:47.770> it's<00:04:47.919> really<00:04:48.280> it's<00:04:48.699> a<00:04:48.880> really

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
screen but it's really it's a really

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.790 
screen but it's really it's a really
dark<00:04:49.360> amber<00:04:49.870> color<00:04:50.110> and<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:53.080> the<00:04:53.289> bottle<00:04:53.620> here

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
dark amber color and the the bottle here

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.740 
dark amber color and the the bottle here
says<00:04:54.039> that<00:04:54.220> when<00:04:54.340> it<00:04:54.460> turns<00:04:54.759> that<00:04:54.970> dark<00:04:55.300> amber

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
says that when it turns that dark amber

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.420 
says that when it turns that dark amber
you<00:04:55.900> have<00:04:56.050> to<00:04:56.199> discard<00:04:56.560> it<00:04:56.710> you<00:04:56.860> can't<00:04:57.099> use<00:04:57.250> it

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
you have to discard it you can't use it

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.350 
you have to discard it you can't use it
anymore<00:04:58.050> so<00:04:59.050> I<00:04:59.800> thought<00:05:00.639> that<00:05:01.000> was<00:05:01.150> really

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
anymore so I thought that was really

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.860 
anymore so I thought that was really
cool<00:05:01.659> because<00:05:01.900> I<00:05:02.610> I<00:05:03.610> was<00:05:04.270> kind<00:05:04.509> of<00:05:04.539> worried

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
cool because I I was kind of worried

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.210 
cool because I I was kind of worried
about<00:05:05.169> whether<00:05:05.380> the<00:05:05.530> product<00:05:05.770> was<00:05:06.039> really

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
about whether the product was really

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.670 
about whether the product was really
made<00:05:06.550> fresh<00:05:06.849> to<00:05:06.880> order<00:05:07.150> it<00:05:07.599> but<00:05:08.080> I<00:05:08.110> think<00:05:08.229> it<00:05:08.530> is

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
made fresh to order it but I think it is

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.249 
made fresh to order it but I think it is
because<00:05:09.009> when<00:05:09.159> I<00:05:09.190> got<00:05:09.430> it<00:05:09.639> it<00:05:09.789> was<00:05:10.259> completely

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
because when I got it it was completely

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.920 
because when I got it it was completely
completely<00:05:11.530> clear<00:05:12.490> it<00:05:13.030> wasn't<00:05:13.330> until<00:05:13.780> I<00:05:13.810> left

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
completely clear it wasn't until I left

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.649 
completely clear it wasn't until I left
it<00:05:14.349> open<00:05:14.530> that<00:05:15.280> it<00:05:15.430> started<00:05:15.880> to<00:05:16.030> change<00:05:16.060> color

00:05:16.649 --> 00:05:16.659 
it open that it started to change color

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:19.589 
it open that it started to change color
and<00:05:16.930> then<00:05:17.470> eventually<00:05:17.770> it<00:05:18.190> just<00:05:18.220> became<00:05:18.610> bad<00:05:19.569> I

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
and then eventually it just became bad I

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:22.279 
and then eventually it just became bad I
guess<00:05:20.050> because<00:05:20.620> I<00:05:20.949> left<00:05:21.130> it<00:05:21.280> open<00:05:21.400> like<00:05:21.849> twice

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
guess because I left it open like twice

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.800 
guess because I left it open like twice
I<00:05:23.289> don't<00:05:23.860> know<00:05:23.919> what<00:05:24.039> I<00:05:24.099> was<00:05:24.190> thinking<00:05:24.810> but

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810
