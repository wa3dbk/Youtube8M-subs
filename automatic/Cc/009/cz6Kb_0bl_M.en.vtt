about<00:02:43.170> five<00:02:43.620> billion<00:02:44.010> more<00:02:44.370> years<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.940> go<00:02:45.799> the

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
about five billion more years to go the

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.979 
about five billion more years to go the
nuclear<00:02:47.220> energy<00:02:47.459> that<00:02:47.880> powers<00:02:47.910> every<00:02:48.450> star

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
nuclear energy that powers every star

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.770 
nuclear energy that powers every star
seems<00:02:49.440> almost<00:02:49.769> inexhaustible<00:02:50.549> and<00:02:51.030> for<00:02:51.690> that

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
seems almost inexhaustible and for that

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.839 
seems almost inexhaustible and for that
reason<00:02:51.860> scientists<00:02:52.860> would<00:02:53.190> like<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.489> find<00:02:53.700> a

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
reason scientists would like to find a

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.390 
reason scientists would like to find a
way<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.060> generate<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.780> on<00:02:54.959> earth

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
way to generate it on earth

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.360 
way to generate it on earth
but<00:02:56.730> that's<00:02:56.939> a<00:02:57.090> tall<00:02:57.390> order<00:02:57.629> it<00:02:58.470> requires<00:02:59.069> them

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
but that's a tall order it requires them

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.250 
but that's a tall order it requires them
to<00:02:59.400> duplicate<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.299> control<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:01.019> same
