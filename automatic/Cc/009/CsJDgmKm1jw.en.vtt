00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello because my last world relationship 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.759
 video is already a while ago and 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.490
 me in the meantime still some 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.940
 things have now followed 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:16.049
 Part 2 on the subject of education and also the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.699
 Young and upbringing something with me 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.369
 young and possessors and worlds owners 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.470
 I notice very often that I call it 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.000
 sometimes a missing intervention 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.869
 maybe you also know the situation 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.019
 that the young reason respectively 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.340
 A proprietor's world does what he wants 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.170
 means he sniffs he plays 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.000
 maybe with other dogs and then 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.399
 comes this one moment where the owner 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.290
 just want to go and the game 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.290
 wants to stop under wrenching 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.120
 what does he do he calls his dog what does 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.390
 he and he does not come 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.289
 what does the holder call again? 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.300
 once again 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.700
 and here I really quite often see 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.370
 not just once, not just twice 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.690
 no it is called topics 20 times and 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.789
 the dog does not react 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.350
 if at the wolves and because your 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.930
 Boys and the case should be 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.850
 means after I say twice 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.309
 Call does not react and does not come 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.260
 then a consequence must be just 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.810
 and here you have two options 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.390
 the first is just to turn around 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.130
 and not to go straight away 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.840
 not to turn around yet to call the dog 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.790
 just go away 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.409
 The aim of the whole thing should be that 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.780
 euro and you notice it away 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.070
 under course, he got a couple 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.259
 not find you again and you 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.979
 then backhanded if 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.560
 he does that 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.150
 immediately dug and reward and if he 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.890
 notice that your dog is just on 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.680
 device burns to you then you can too 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.420
 like again the command to come 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.190
 call it be income or its name 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.530
 or whatever you establish for it 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.000
 is the fast way to go from yours 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.460
 Of course, you can only do a dog in 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.290
 a safe environment that is it 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.610
 are no roads in the area or 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.460
 Other dangers 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.530
 if your did not get under it because 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.170
 it did not notice or what I did 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.150
 think that makes a lot of fun should the 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.760
 or yet it go I do not care 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.400
 then you have to pick yours up and 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.960
 picking up this is also the second 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.550
 variant which he can choose that is 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.770
 if you are not above all and 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.690
 can or do not want to remove 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.550
 then you can just accept it 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.270
 that means he just goes without a comment 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.970
 expensive world museum and in bonds and 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.800
 Leaving the scene avoids it 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.360
 really call your dog umpteen times 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.950
 really brings absolutely nothing 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.870
 characterized it does not also strengthens the 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.510
 Command should exploit that and that 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.250
 only thing down with learns is that he 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.610
 can do what he wants and it follows 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.080
 absolutely no consequence of that 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.780
 consequence, either you go and let 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.220
 your mother alone or you pick him up 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.500
 and take him with a very important one 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.390
 point is also that you decide with 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.160
 which reason your dog plays and we 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.630
 to welcome are allowed to throw 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.790
 of course totally stormy and 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.250
 unbiased and want every reason 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.470
 go see her greet and say hello 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.120
 and that's how it was with ikarus 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.150
 if he starts on his own when do you have the 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.489
 Dog was immediately gone and had to 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.590
 to welcome as serene at all the 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.470
 opportunity to have and show hey 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.750
 to greet the us and not have to 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.130
 The dog, of course, within reach 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.110
 and was a hassle 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.880
 and there are two for this 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.860
 options either running around 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.260
 Generally as a puppy always on a leash 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.210
 or you have to be very attentive though 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.340
 yours is not on a leash and others 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.200
 round already see him and see them 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.760
 Then immediately take the leash 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.530
 There is also a third 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.540
 possibility and the rate i above all 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.520
 with young customers and that's the one 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.320
 use a towline with it 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.990
 her a bigger radius with her 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.670
 have access to your dog so and if 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.200
 then your dog is on the leash and he 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.180
 sees the other dog and is back in 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.230
 this behavior hey I want to go there 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.750
 I want to greet you 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.480
 I do not really care about you 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.200
 Now want to do what I want then 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.850
 just wait here 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.660
 and here is really the sticking point 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.330
 that you have this one moment 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.460
 in the same one must wait for you 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.630
 attention gives meaning he 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.100
 take a quick look 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.660
 That must be chosen at the beginning 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.510
 really not be long the super 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.510
 It is also totally okay, but it is excited 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.520
 should look at you briefly and then could 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.220
 him with a command with us is that 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.230
 send an okay also other dog and 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.090
 greet them when you have the dog 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.770
 does not want to do it by itself and 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.250
 the welcome to be held on a leash 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:20.080
 should 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.330
 then you have to be careful that you 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.240
 your dog does not like this other dog 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.610
 you pull the dog to the other one 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.650
 and which methods you use 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.170
 can you lead the dog and not 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.030
 I'm pulling you and somewhere 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.400
 already in my leash video 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.260
 presented and there are a lot of method 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.330
 definitely want to be presented 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.760
 for you is the video has 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.260
 I linked you in the infobox and how 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.090
 said at the beginning I was really there 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.980
 little eye contact and then the 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.440
 dog really play what he yes 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.900
 also should be necessarily 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.600
 make social contacts and the world 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.140
 research the same thing by the way for 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.070
 By the way, other dogs are also valid for 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.960
 key points or other things the 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.670
 of and very very exciting place, let 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.400
 you really never fundamentally from the 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.860
 somewhere always tries that 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.960
 you lead the dog there he can yes 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.330
 like to sniff there and there but he 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.770
 should go there with you together that 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.940
 can be really very long in the beginning 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.650
 take the dog halfway 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.130
 calms down and he leads you from you 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.260
 leaves 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.470
 but that is a super super important 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.870
 Lesson for your dog and also for you 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.330
 easy life with you later 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.770
 your dog immensely 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.990
 just what the thing with strange dogs 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.910
 Welcome if you like that very much 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.800
 often and extensively trained later 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.360
 then be that yours and 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.400
 of course not anymore at the 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.650
 but he will lead 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.630
 another museums and I know okay 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.610
 the holder decides that will be yours 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.910
 then take a look and then you can 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:50.300
 decide is okay go or we 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.300
 go on 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.720
 maybe a short mistake you 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:58.320
 maybe if it's the first dog 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.540
 is and we take the dog 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.750
 is afraid of something and afraid 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.760
 Apparitions that is where my god he is 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.980
 I do not want to go further or oh my 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.990
 God the bag that is there totally 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.910
 dangerous then please do not do that 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.740
 error and calm your dog in that 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.480
 you talk to him and caress him 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.810
 does not encourage the dog in something like that 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.669
 just call him going ahead shows 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.080
 this object he is afraid of 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:24.930
 at least for example a bag 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.700
 davos at the other place large garbage bags the 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.200
 must be super dangerous who knows 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.580
 what brings out there if next to it 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.490
 Did you touch her? 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.230
 cuddled and then came ikarus too 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.970
 and has a bit of courage and courage 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.620
 smelled it and found okay 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.940
 that nothing bad and if so far 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.530
 you pass the topic "Wundertüte" 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.830
 are gone and this procedure 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.510
 Completed then learned and just fine 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.470
 Bags are probably not very special 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.330
 dangerous 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.310
 and that's the way it is with everyone 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.290
 other things she touches 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:54.880
 Maybe a bit more power with it 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.560
 the dog calms down and to you 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.870
 come and then it can be too 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.460
 I hope this was still on 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.630
 few helpful tips for you that is 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.610
 me in the course of the last weeks 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.800
 I think of it and I really think so 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:07.690
 very important up here I link you 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.190
 again my first wm educational video 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.100
 It's about everything here 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.690
 what rules must set up and what 

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.000
 give the dog everything in the first open 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.070
 should show and if you feel like it
