00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.069
 U 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.510
 U 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.770
 the p 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.340
 I apologize once asked me how to pick another cup to drink once sperm 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:33.210
 I miss you 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.210
 We 're talking to that Korean barista champion. 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.070
 The leftover coffee is brought so that it can be leveled exactly . 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:55.820
 There is no way I can tell whether coffee is coming or not. 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:01:03.250
 Bolting it stem is not this schedule very little tongs as water level falls 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.250
 Oh , my goodness. I need you to make it a little more uniform now. 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:12.650
 The fact that the stem is now starting to shake means that the packed coffee 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.770
 The ingredients inside are said to add more than 80 percent. 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.770
 What 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.190
 Oh, what's wrong with this three is very intense. 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.240
 I now really like the new kimchi 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.690
 I'm called a sour taste of coffee over it during the civil war makes sense that 3 3 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:35.970
 This is so intense because it's crazy . 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:39.750
 Drips usually come out pretty well, but this is just a mouthful 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.840
 But I think he's a rich guy. 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.979
 If the coffee is used now , 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:52.380
 Colombia and Ethiopia are adjacent to each other and so dp 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:54.420
 Oh, and the masses is three times a float feeling and control light now as keurombi 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.150
 I think most of them. 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:05.040
 I have 3 days which was a bit of a bit of an upturn , but now I write 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:09.390
 Colombian or something which is also very positive kid Colom common scenario in 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:15.150
 Bright and make a little differently treat jjokkeum have some fruitful three-Mail 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:20.220
 So what I'm looking at notes of taste by two branding 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:23.510
 Part 3 of the beauty and fruit management and we now approach 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:29.329
 Sort of rich and ah 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:32.719
 You can see it as branding that maximizes the feeling of jog light. 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:37.400
 When you recommend it, you set the vertical source. 4 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:41.629
 What radeunga radeunga various temperatures as the pressure of time normally 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:47.060
 Do you use it continuously or change it according to the blend? 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:51.829
 If the blending changes, this setting is very close to the fluidity. 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:57.650
 It's basically like having to hold those parts. 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:03:02.120
 If it's just the same old beans, if I drink normally, 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:06.290
 Something has changed in the words. 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.269
 Until you are aware of it and keep it almost consistent , 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.859
 If changed 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:17.239
 Of course, two sets of values ​​will change . 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:22.129
 First of all, I think it is the process of finding the setting value that matches the size 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:25.459
 So hurry we will have the right to have twice the sensitive areas kid part 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:29.870
 I think this is what I'm dealing with. 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:33.889
 Indeed a certain percent of our taste perception about the big guests coming Peel 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.389
 Locate and then try to come to know this is not possessed real customers Oda 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:40.159
 The head that came to taste 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:42.480
 I am looking for some # 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:46.080
 Basically its 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:52.590
 5 The structure that can be bought seems to have a different tendency. 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:58.019
 The fact that you come to see an individual seems to be a lot more percents. 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:01.080
 And now, the rest of what they came to drink Suppose now gone 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:04.230
 Uh, nothing special. 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:08.099
 I really like to drink coffee. 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:14.220
 When I came to total demand 1 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:18.900
 70 professional degree that one is due to know or find the end part you 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:23.639
 After seeing him , he was on a continuous visit. 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:29.100
 We look forward to seeing you when we go to Italy to enjoy drinking coffee range 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:34.169
 For such a mood, feeling like drinking nations like the coffee taste properly Finland 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:37.680
 It is a culture that requires a certain amount of time to catch located just hang about in '30 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:41.039
 I think that 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:46.710
 Oh, get up at this point right now. 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:53.250
 Consumers Coffee makers come out with a lot of appetite. 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:56.010
 But what I have insisted on in that period is the fact that consciousness rescues a lot 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:05:00.000
 It's different because it's different. 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:04.110
 I am deliberately enjoying this taste. 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:09.780
 In fact, it 's natural for me to get past the intentions. 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:13.889
 I've seen it in time, which was about i , 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:18.030
 We drink and enjoy it properly so that we can act again and again makeup 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:22.169
 It is a happy and is taken itdaneungeo just so we gotta lower happiness index Country 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.010
 The Koreans raise the happiness you have taken over the role of a good so far 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:28.080
 It's good for you 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:34.139
 For that money coming anyway, huh wonder taste and properly enjoy enjoyment 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:36.360
 I will work again in a slightly different patterns and this time his self-extracting mentioned 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:40.410
 I'll see the evil spirits. 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.430
 You can taste it and see if there are any differences. 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.430
 More to be expected this time 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.320
 4 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:06.310
 I got a little more body, 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:11.260
 The three people have a bitter taste with strong oil field 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:16.210
 Earlier that this is the first time I have broken even decent to me. 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:21.480
 I like to listen to my favorite thoughts because I'm Korean. 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.480
 It was a bit like that we did, so I liked him. 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:30.120
 I still like this sword with this extracted sword right now 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:33.480
 Yes, I had more coffee than I had about 0.5g . 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:37.380
 Now that you've got the time to say, 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:43.260
 He is now shortened from 19 seconds to 1 second 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:48.180
 So did the extracted coffee over time, for example, compared with some earlier bolting appearance 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:53.370
 When you look at it, the rate at which this coffee drops will definitely be different. 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:58.170
 4 So it will look great coffee chanting about the amount of the fine 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:07:02.340
 And one village aneunge but the fact is that the amount that can not be really separated 

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:07.350
 Now bask in the taste of the area to be part of that we can be comfortable 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:12.750
 They did a lot of difference to me, so for example, the role of the Paris Star I 

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:15.710
 You can play a very important role when you look at it. 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:20.920
 Then I'm down. 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.920
 91 Yes Yes Comparison is slightly different
