00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
a deeper depth of field means that more

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
image is in focus this means that a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.810 
image is in focus this means that a
scene<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.980> be<00:01:02.070> photographed<00:01:02.579> with<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
scene can be photographed with the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.460 
scene can be photographed with the
foreground<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.420> background<00:01:03.480> blurred<00:01:04.199> out

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
foreground and background blurred out

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.260 
foreground and background blurred out
which<00:01:04.860> allows<00:01:05.129> for<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.400> main<00:01:05.549> subject<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
which allows for the main subject of the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.240 
which allows for the main subject of the
photograph<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:07.049> stand<00:01:07.320> out<00:01:07.470> more<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:08.040> looks

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
photograph to stand out more it looks

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.160 
photograph to stand out more it looks
really<00:01:08.490> good<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:08.909> when<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.600> widen<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
really good but when you widen the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.109 
really good but when you widen the
aperture<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.650> picture<00:01:11.189> also<00:01:11.369> gets<00:01:11.760> brighter

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
aperture the picture also gets brighter

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.609 
aperture the picture also gets brighter
so<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.900> compensate<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:13.500> that

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
so you have to compensate for that

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.920 
so you have to compensate for that
overexposure<00:01:14.310> by<00:01:14.820> adjusting<00:01:15.240> other<00:01:15.479> camera

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
overexposure by adjusting other camera

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.260 
overexposure by adjusting other camera
settings<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.409> ISO<00:01:16.890> or<00:01:17.130> shutter<00:01:17.340> speed<00:01:17.640> some

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
settings like ISO or shutter speed some

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.359 
settings like ISO or shutter speed some
cameras<00:01:18.689> like<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> DSLR<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.740> automatically

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
cameras like a DSLR can automatically

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.010 
cameras like a DSLR can automatically
adjust<00:01:20.400> these<00:01:20.790> settings<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.570> when<00:01:21.810> put

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
adjust these settings for you when put

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.560 
adjust these settings for you when put
in<00:01:22.110> aperture<00:01:22.470> priority<00:01:22.650> mode<00:01:23.400> since<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.330> blurry

in aperture priority mode since a blurry

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.210 
in aperture priority mode since a blurry
background<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.290> look<00:01:25.439> really<00:01:25.590> good<00:01:25.920> if<00:01:26.070> done

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
background can look really good if done

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.980 
background can look really good if done
correctly<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.909> used<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.360> always<00:01:27.509> take<00:01:27.810> pictures

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
correctly I used to always take pictures

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.600 
correctly I used to always take pictures
with<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> aperture<00:01:28.710> set<00:01:29.040> as<00:01:29.159> wide<00:01:29.430> as

with the aperture set as wide as

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.819 
with the aperture set as wide as
possible<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.479> low<00:01:30.720> f-stop<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.500> give<00:01:31.650> myself

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
possible so a low f-stop to give myself

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.710
