00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.650
 You can look further and you can do it 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.650

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:08.780

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.130

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:30.090

 does yandex people work in all 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:39.180
 very simple 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.540

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.850
 Unfortunately, he found me only for some reason 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.070
 VKontakte Facebook and other networks do not 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.110
 I found but according to what I said 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.140
 At the beginning of the video, you need to set up a profile and 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.740
 and everything will be fine now you know how 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:59.340

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:02.670
 find and most importantly do not lose 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:06.260
