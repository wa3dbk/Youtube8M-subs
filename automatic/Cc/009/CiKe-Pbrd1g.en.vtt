00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
that aren't quite as old as I am you

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.800 
that aren't quite as old as I am you
know<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.280> might<00:01:17.610> think<00:01:17.790> about<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.210> Huxtables

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
know you might think about the Huxtables

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and those people on the Brady Bunch well

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.120 
and those people on the Brady Bunch well
I<00:01:21.840> guess<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.080> would<00:01:22.290> make<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.619> kind<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.950> old

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
I guess that would make you kind of old

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.510 
I guess that would make you kind of old
too<00:01:23.510> but<00:01:24.510> the<00:01:24.630> idea<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.170> families<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:25.950> are

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
too but the idea of families that are

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.270 
too but the idea of families that are
portrayed<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.030> television<00:01:27.510> and<00:01:28.260> what<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.710> knew

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
portrayed on television and what I knew

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.830 
portrayed on television and what I knew
as<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.700> child<00:01:30.320> was<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.650> somehow<00:01:32.060> my<00:01:33.060> family

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
as a child was that somehow my family

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.550 
as a child was that somehow my family
didn't<00:01:34.830> look<00:01:35.280> like<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.690> my<00:01:36.690> family<00:01:37.230> didn't

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
didn't look like that my family didn't

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.390 
didn't look like that my family didn't
fit<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:39.020> began<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.260> feel<00:01:40.290> at<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.980> very

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
fit that and I began to feel at a very

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.970 
fit that and I began to feel at a very
early<00:01:41.670> age<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.870> sense<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.950> shame<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.850> secrecy

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
early age a sense of shame and secrecy

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.580 
early age a sense of shame and secrecy
because<00:01:46.980> I<00:01:47.250> had<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:48.060> little<00:01:48.360> knowing<00:01:48.990> that

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
because I had that little knowing that

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.280 
because I had that little knowing that
there<00:01:49.830> was<00:01:50.010> something<00:01:50.340> different<00:01:50.580> about<00:01:51.360> my

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
there was something different about my

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.550 
there was something different about my
family<00:01:52.650> and<00:01:53.100> my<00:01:53.430> sense<00:01:53.760> was<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.360> what<00:01:55.350> was

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
family and my sense was that what was

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.710 
family and my sense was that what was
different<00:01:55.800> about<00:01:56.040> my<00:01:56.370> family<00:01:56.670> didn't<00:01:57.270> exist

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
different about my family didn't exist

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.360 
different about my family didn't exist
in<00:01:57.960> other<00:01:58.140> families<00:01:58.770> around<00:01:59.100> our

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
in other families around our

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.630 
in other families around our
neighborhood<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:02.070> thing<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.340> was

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
neighborhood and the thing that was

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.850 
neighborhood and the thing that was
different<00:02:02.940> in<00:02:03.330> my<00:02:03.570> family<00:02:04.110> or<00:02:04.229> at<00:02:04.380> least<00:02:04.590> what

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
different in my family or at least what

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.219 
different in my family or at least what
I<00:02:04.890> thought<00:02:05.250> was<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:05.760> different<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.420> my<00:02:06.690> family

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
I thought was so different in my family

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.600 
I thought was so different in my family
was<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.340> fact<00:02:08.549> that<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.509> my<00:02:10.110> family<00:02:10.709> my<00:02:11.340> father

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
was the fact that in my family my father

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.680 
was the fact that in my family my father
was<00:02:12.180> an<00:02:12.540> alcoholic<00:02:13.019> and<00:02:14.000> I<00:02:15.000> may<00:02:15.299> not<00:02:15.540> have

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
was an alcoholic and I may not have

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.839 
was an alcoholic and I may not have
always<00:02:16.049> understood<00:02:16.080> exactly<00:02:16.890> what<00:02:17.430> that

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
always understood exactly what that

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.479 
always understood exactly what that
meant<00:02:18.180> but<00:02:18.510> what<00:02:19.110> I<00:02:19.140> did<00:02:19.500> understand<00:02:20.159> it<00:02:20.340> an

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
meant but what I did understand it an

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.059 
meant but what I did understand it an
early<00:02:20.670> age<00:02:21.030> was<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.959> created<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.830> sense

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
early age was that that created a sense

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.559 
early age was that that created a sense
of<00:02:23.599> secrecy<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:25.080> shame<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.909> tonight<00:02:27.150> what

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569
