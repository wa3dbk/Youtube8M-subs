00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.580
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.080
 pharmacist 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.760
 Today I want to show you the one 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.650
 professional unicycle speed sensor 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.960
 I have support for this 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.850
 invited the constantin from the motor corp 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.800
 hello together i actually work 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.059
 as an editor moderator and am today 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.239
 I, as a helicopter here screw private 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.430
 and I often go for instructions and tips 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.830
 tricks asked today we show you in 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.300
 a video a defective abs sensor 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.580
 was always through the indicator light 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.320
 the abs system displays which 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.230
 really broken shows us only that 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.519
 reading the error memory with the 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.140
 multimeter can not do the effect 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.000
 determine because that is not exactly 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.799
 but this can only read out signal 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.449
 we have read through the 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.489
 error memory found that the 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.930
 radar sensor front left is defective and 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.909
 will show you now how to get it 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.320
 change the part also in one 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.960
 piece out, that would be all right now 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.520
 still trigger with triggers that 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.430
 cover the ceiling a bit and we have 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.479
 easy game 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.610
 some sensors are special 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.270
 persistent tip from the engine community 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.180
 we also play something trigger a cloth 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.310
 Wrap it around the sensor and leave it 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.820
 the night on the 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.820
 last post 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.650
 when disassembling us is the 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.030
 radar sensor head canceled what us 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.710
 benefit we had a better one 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.290
 starting situation and with the pliers 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:49.210
 attack and pull the rest out 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.250
 in the worst case, the sensor breaks 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.479
 flush with the recording from then you have 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.940
 of course no attack surface for the 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.159
 Water pump pliers in the case advises line 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.120
 engine community with a wood screw 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.400
 in the sense 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.540
 to turn and then the new one 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.180
 attack surface with a 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.560
 Pull water pump pliers out of it 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.050
 makko autotechnik has a wide 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.990
 assortment of different ones 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.760
 electronic components from engine management 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.920
 driving dynamics driving safety all the way to 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.950
 Write what pump that is 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.850
 air mass meter valves klopp 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.310
 sensors and laser sensors all of these 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.880
 As always, you can find components at www 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.680
 make de - auto parts punkt.de in the next 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.410
 I remove the cable 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.000
 from the guidelines target the hydrogen 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.290
 foster body and solve the 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.290
 plug connections to the control unit 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.260
 before the newer speed sensor 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.610
 of course, the must be mounted 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.740
 to be cleaned 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.710
 in our case, it is enough with something 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.720
 Brake cleaner and a cloth if it is 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.390
 should be heavily rusted please take 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.080
 a piece of sandpaper and cleans the 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:17.130
 Recordings take care that they 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.130
 do not remove any material 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.970
 in the next step we move 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.770
 the cable 98 thereby that the cable without 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.260
 to turn it into the right one 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.940
 it is important that this is important 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.500
 cable does not dissolve somehow in the council 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.500
 gets caught or gets into the landing gear 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.820
 in some vehicles, it is so 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.190
 the abs lamp after the next start 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.570
 often she lets herself be certain 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.700
 has exceeded the speed 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.230
 For example , you have to vw 40 models 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.260
 I would like to drive km / h 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.670
 error independently in the error memory 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.680
 We work with the speed sensor 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.370
 careful hammer blows back in 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.770
 his version 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.270
 important is that you in the rubber hammer 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.210
 used because otherwise the sender 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.410
 can be damaged 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.750
 Renew speed sensor is mounted 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.730
 in our numbers the speed is only 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.620
 stuck with many vehicle types 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.940
 the position by a set screw 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.750
 or fixed screwdriver 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.880
 set 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.680
 if it should be that the abs 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.230
 indicator light in the combination instrument not 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.630
 The advice must go out where something rotates 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.300
 be readjusted 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.680
 that's it, we see that raab so firmly 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.640
 if the wheel is off you can of course 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.960
 all brakes suspension parts 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.250
 to undergo a test and they 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.250
 if necessary change with 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.490
 the error memory clears it 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.850
 no further errors are displayed 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.930
 the abs system works fine 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.630
 And so we do our repair 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.520
 successful that was a change of one 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.169
 state speed sensors you see too 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.000
 that there is no unsolvable task 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.560
 Nevertheless, I recommend you as always 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.020
 accepted by a skilled professional 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.940
 Help the radar sensor and the abs system 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.199
 are among the most important components 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.000
 driving safety 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.229
 yes and if you have more questions like 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.090
 you change a part or what you do with it 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.919
 should note write us in the 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.169
 comments and we will try that 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.490
 in the next video to deal bye 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.410
 and as always good ride at all 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.759
 wish you your wrenches and wheels 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.759
