about this actually you know to boost it

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.149 
about this actually you know to boost it
up<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.840> eight<00:01:07.020> gig<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.560> can<00:01:07.830> rip<00:01:08.130> through

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159

up to eight gig so I can rip through
those<00:01:08.960> memory<00:01:09.960> processing<00:01:10.880> especially<00:01:11.880> like

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
those memory processing especially like

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.570 
those memory processing especially like
I<00:01:12.150> use<00:01:12.720> adobe<00:01:13.200> premiere<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.770> Photoshop<00:01:14.250> those

I use adobe premiere in Photoshop those
tend<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.180> use<00:01:15.330> up<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.600> lot<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.869> memory<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:17.159> you

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
tend to use up a lot of memory so you

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.460 
tend to use up a lot of memory so you
know<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.880> bought<00:01:18.299> these<00:01:18.509> for<00:01:18.810> about<00:01:18.869> fifty<00:01:19.350> nine
