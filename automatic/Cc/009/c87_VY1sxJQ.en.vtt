00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello youtube and i know that i mean mine 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.370
 first video on youtube i hope so 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.889
 will have fallen you looked showed 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:18.869
 which multiply their raw materials lankas 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:27.619
 can and then shows she just goes 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:27.619
 in a world of eve and send 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.519
 so that I can shake 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:56.820
 Then we have diamonds 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:01:00.149
 Well , I 've got that way, I 've got it here 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.050
 only a diamond thus still human 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.790
 no critic 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:09.240
 I do not have a single motto at first 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.220
 Do you have your diamond away so it 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.710
 does not work on multiple singleplayer 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.900
 even if you have 20 diamonds now 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.990
 then you can do that too 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.020
 20 each gantenberg then later 40 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.210
 So now this is on the way 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.460
 saves minecraft again 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.140
 one would have suppressed the diamonds to then 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.369
 her old and f4 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.200
 But if I now so can proudly 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.890
 that's why we see on my fraps 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.740
 us again 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.210
 So then minecraft crashed but 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.680
 do not be afraid you have yours somebody 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.450
 still then you will immediately something 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.960
 are really cool because you cook it 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.250
 not saved is yes and here are 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.380
 We too, I want it now 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.560
 that you can show off with it 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.560
 his 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.159
 and now you see you are in the man 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.439
 have thrown away because it vigorously 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.090
 saved was stored on 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.960
 the collected diamonds to minecraft 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.300
 crash 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.860
 it was not saved 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.619
 but you still have the diamond in 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.870
 your inventory so no idea why 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.160
 we still the topic but that became now 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.770
 not saved so i could do that 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.240
 just stop and why the 2 that 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.980
 is actually quite easy, that works 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.380
 with a raw material in the head 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.820
 with a block of everything in it 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.280
 So minecraft gives when you to 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.300
 for example, paint the end you want 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.480
 an end eye 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.350
 then you can throw that away 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.870
 made crashes save stones 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.970
 cancel crashing go in there and 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.490
 then you have two and two again 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.820
 out of the 24 make 48 or if now 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.760
 come 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.070
 diamond is found in quick time 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.400
 with the diamonds at the beginning just do it 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.330
 I like to do the trick on walls and have 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.460
 you 're already growing there because of the 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.870
 Japanese sword make quite fast 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.880
 goes with blocks of diamond blocks 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.300
 iron plates had for example times 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:12.980
 a diamond made right two goes 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:15.570
 with iron coal market roses meat 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.110
 still goes with everything my head is 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.420
 except I know I only happens 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.340
 the grass that tastes like it gives 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.700
 I have not tried it with 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.600
 snow agree but otherwise 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.160
 everything works but I think so then 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.640
 First of all, I'll see you driving again 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.530
 hope you liked it 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.510
 thumbs high live and maybe too 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:47.000
 one more abo then I would say 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:47.000
 see you in the export then
