today's video I've got my iphone 6
predictions<00:00:06.000> so<00:00:06.529> first<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:07.620> all<00:00:07.680> I'm<00:00:07.770> going<00:00:07.859> to

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
predictions so first of all I'm going to

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.560 
predictions so first of all I'm going to
start<00:00:08.099> out<00:00:08.250> with<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.849> basics<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.420> the

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
start out with the basics and the

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.080 
start out with the basics and the
obvious<00:00:10.050> pneus<00:00:10.320> it's<00:00:11.309> going<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.519> be<00:00:11.610> faster

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
obvious pneus it's going to be faster

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.030 
obvious pneus it's going to be faster
Apple<00:00:12.660> likes<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.990> do<00:00:13.110> that<00:00:13.290> that's<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.740> thing

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
Apple likes to do that that's the thing

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.039 
Apple likes to do that that's the thing
it's<00:00:14.219> going<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.370> be<00:00:14.460> faster<00:00:14.940> with<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.839> new

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
it's going to be faster with a new

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.320 
it's going to be faster with a new
processor<00:00:16.710> probably<00:00:17.070> called<00:00:17.250> like<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.520> a7<00:00:18.210> or

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
processor probably called like the a7 or

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.960 
processor probably called like the a7 or
something<00:00:18.600> cool<00:00:18.779> like<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:19.039> and<00:00:20.039> maybe<00:00:20.760> even

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
something cool like that and maybe even

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.929 
something cool like that and maybe even
more<00:00:21.240> RAM<00:00:21.470> just<00:00:22.470> that's<00:00:22.830> what<00:00:22.949> they<00:00:23.039> do<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.789> as

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
more RAM just that's what they do so as

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.089 
more RAM just that's what they do so as
far<00:00:24.180> as<00:00:24.240> naming<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.170> dang<00:00:25.350> thing<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.949> think

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
far as naming the dang thing I think

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.620 
far as naming the dang thing I think
that<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:26.580> pretty<00:00:26.760> possible<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.510> will

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
that it's pretty possible that we will

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.349 
that it's pretty possible that we will
see<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.080> iphone<00:00:28.500> 5s<00:00:28.890> or<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.340> iphone<00:00:29.640> 6<00:00:30.000> really

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
see the iphone 5s or the iphone 6 really

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.150 
see the iphone 5s or the iphone 6 really
depending<00:00:30.689> on<00:00:30.810> how<00:00:31.019> big<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.289> an<00:00:31.529> upgrade<00:00:31.800> this

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
depending on how big of an upgrade this

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.370 
depending on how big of an upgrade this
is<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.700> if<00:00:33.120> it's<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.360> big<00:00:33.540> upgrade<00:00:33.750> it's<00:00:34.230> going

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
is so if it's a big upgrade it's going

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.049 
is so if it's a big upgrade it's going
to<00:00:34.410> be<00:00:34.500> tight<00:00:34.590> point<00:00:34.950> 6<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.489> then<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:36.030> course

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
to be tight point 6 and then of course

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.030 
to be tight point 6 and then of course
if<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.630> little<00:00:36.899> small<00:00:37.500> little<00:00:37.710> tiny

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
if it's a little small little tiny

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.920 
if it's a little small little tiny
update<00:00:38.399> then<00:00:38.670> maybe<00:00:39.180> they'll<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.480> iphone

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
update then maybe they'll be the iphone

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.500 
update then maybe they'll be the iphone
5s<00:00:40.290> we'll<00:00:41.219> see<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.670> just<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> sake<00:00:42.480> of

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
5s we'll see so just for the sake of

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.850 
5s we'll see so just for the sake of
this<00:00:42.660> video<00:00:42.870> I'm<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.320> something<00:00:43.559> called<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
this video I'm you something called the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.069 
this video I'm you something called the
iphone<00:00:44.190> 6<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.760> you're<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.690> gonna<00:00:45.809> have<00:00:45.960> to

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
iphone 6 and you're just gonna have to

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.170 
iphone 6 and you're just gonna have to
deal<00:00:46.110> with<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.530> sorry<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.579> as<00:00:47.670> far<00:00:47.850> as<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
deal with it sorry so as far as the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.369 
deal with it sorry so as far as the
design<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.690> don't<00:00:48.899> think<00:00:48.960> we're<00:00:49.170> going<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.350> see

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
design I don't think we're going to see

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.610 
design I don't think we're going to see
a<00:00:49.559> huge<00:00:50.010> design<00:00:50.520> reboot<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.420> think<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.260> Apple

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
a huge design reboot I think that Apple

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.229 
a huge design reboot I think that Apple
really<00:00:52.890> likes<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.219> current<00:00:53.550> design<00:00:53.879> model

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
really likes the current design model

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.619 
really likes the current design model
and<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.840> whole<00:00:55.020> aesthetic<00:00:55.340> look<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.640> but<00:00:57.390> i

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
and the whole aesthetic look of it but i

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.450 
and the whole aesthetic look of it but i
do<00:00:57.840> think<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.410> they<00:00:58.559> change<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.949> at<00:00:59.190> all

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
do think if they change it at all

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.610 
do think if they change it at all
they'll<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.510> change<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.500> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
they'll just change it so that the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.429 
they'll just change it so that the
iphone<00:01:02.129> 6<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:03.090> little<00:01:03.539> bit<00:01:03.690> lighter<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.379> as

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
iphone 6 is a little bit lighter so as

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.080 
iphone 6 is a little bit lighter so as
far<00:01:04.589> as<00:01:04.650> screen<00:01:05.040> size<00:01:05.220> i<00:01:05.430> think<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.729> apple<00:01:06.060> is

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
far as screen size i think that apple is

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.690 
far as screen size i think that apple is
going<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.330> stay<00:01:07.020> at<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:07.799> 4-inch<00:01:08.430> display

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
going to stay at this 4-inch display

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.850 
going to stay at this 4-inch display
they<00:01:09.330> seem<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> little<00:01:09.810> bit<00:01:10.049> stubborn<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
they seem a little bit stubborn on the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.060 
they seem a little bit stubborn on the
issue<00:01:11.070> basically<00:01:11.939> saying<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.750> 3.5<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.860> 4

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
issue basically saying that 3.5 to 4

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.310 
issue basically saying that 3.5 to 4
inches<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.520> perfect<00:01:15.000> for<00:01:15.210> an<00:01:15.299> vote<00:01:15.960> for<00:01:16.290> a

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
inches is perfect for an vote for a

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.070 
inches is perfect for an vote for a
phone<00:01:16.560> screen<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.280> these<00:01:18.000> huge<00:01:18.479> android

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
phone screen and these huge android

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.590 
phone screen and these huge android
phones<00:01:19.259> are<00:01:19.439> just<00:01:19.590> too<00:01:20.009> much<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.610> really<00:01:21.150> this

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
phones are just too much and really this

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.630 
phones are just too much and really this
is<00:01:21.900> where<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.380> need<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.770> at<00:01:23.159> like<00:01:23.610> a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
is where you need to be at like a

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.730 
is where you need to be at like a
four-inch<00:01:24.090> vote<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.630> i<00:01:24.840> think<00:01:25.259> apple<00:01:25.710> is

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
four-inch vote so i think apple is

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.140 
four-inch vote so i think apple is
definitely<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.280> stay<00:01:26.430> at<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.880> screen

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
definitely going to stay at the screen

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.700 
definitely going to stay at the screen
size<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:27.960> at<00:01:28.020> least<00:01:28.140> another<00:01:28.350> few

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
size for at least another few

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.109 
size for at least another few
generations<00:01:29.070> all<00:01:29.640> right<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:29.850> one<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
generations all right so one of the

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.850 
generations all right so one of the
things<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.390> wanted<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.659> see<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.170> iphone<00:01:31.500> 5

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
things I wanted to see the iphone 5

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.030 
things I wanted to see the iphone 5
actually<00:01:32.400> was<00:01:32.880> NFC<00:01:33.450> support<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:34.049> passbook

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
actually was NFC support a passbook

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.910

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
me thought that it'd be cool if you put

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.859 
me thought that it'd be cool if you put
NFC<00:02:01.649> into<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.310> iphone<00:02:02.579> with<00:02:03.299> pests<00:02:03.630> book

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
NFC into the iphone with pests book

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.180 
NFC into the iphone with pests book
because<00:02:04.200> now<00:02:06.200> yeah<00:02:07.200> cuz<00:02:07.469> now<00:02:07.680> it's<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.129> just

works<00:02:08.640> together<00:02:08.819> passbook<00:02:09.239> NFC<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.989> sounds

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
works together passbook NFC it sounds

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.110 
works together passbook NFC it sounds
like<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.410> really<00:02:10.619> good<00:02:10.800> idea<00:02:10.860> right<00:02:11.400> well<00:02:12.330> okay

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
like a really good idea right well okay

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.759 
like a really good idea right well okay
yes<00:02:13.209> nut<00:02:13.480> because<00:02:13.690> apple<00:02:14.230> didn't<00:02:14.470> put<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:14.709> the

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
yes nut because apple didn't put in the

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.160 
yes nut because apple didn't put in the
iphone<00:02:15.069> 5<00:02:15.340> but<00:02:15.549> then<00:02:15.909> us<00:02:16.360> smart<00:02:16.870> people

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
iphone 5 but then us smart people

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.530 
iphone 5 but then us smart people
thought<00:02:17.379> to<00:02:17.590> thinking<00:02:18.010> again<00:02:18.489> while<00:02:19.060> he<00:02:19.090> cited

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
thought to thinking again while he cited

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.410 
thought to thinking again while he cited
and<00:02:19.900> I<00:02:20.080> thought<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.590> myself<00:02:20.620> well<00:02:21.220> may<00:02:22.180> they're

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
and I thought to myself well may they're

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.539 
and I thought to myself well may they're
doing<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:22.840> kind<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.230> like<00:02:23.379> how<00:02:23.590> they<00:02:23.739> did<00:02:23.950> LTE

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
doing it kind of like how they did LTE

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.630 
doing it kind of like how they did LTE
where<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.090> lot<00:02:25.299> of<00:02:25.330> phones<00:02:25.629> are<00:02:25.810> getting<00:02:26.140> LTE

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
where a lot of phones are getting LTE

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.399 
where a lot of phones are getting LTE
but<00:02:27.640> apple<00:02:28.030> says<00:02:28.209> know<00:02:28.540> what<00:02:29.049> we're<00:02:29.170> going<00:02:29.260> to

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
but apple says know what we're going to

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.850 
but apple says know what we're going to
do<00:02:29.470> is<00:02:29.680> going<00:02:29.769> to<00:02:29.920> wait<00:02:30.159> until<00:02:30.569> LTE<00:02:31.569> is<00:02:31.959> pretty

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
do is going to wait until LTE is pretty

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.610 
do is going to wait until LTE is pretty
much<00:02:32.950> perfect<00:02:33.090> for<00:02:34.090> us<00:02:34.269> I<00:02:34.569> think<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.379> Apple

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
much perfect for us I think the Apple

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.770 
much perfect for us I think the Apple
might<00:02:35.739> be<00:02:35.860> doing<00:02:36.129> that<00:02:36.250> with<00:02:36.489> NFC<00:02:37.060> so<00:02:37.390> whenever

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
might be doing that with NFC so whenever

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.110 
might be doing that with NFC so whenever
Apple<00:02:38.110> decides<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:38.829> is<00:02:39.129> ready<00:02:39.459> or<00:02:39.670> something

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
Apple decides it is ready or something

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.149 
Apple decides it is ready or something
similar<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.599> it<00:02:40.810> is<00:02:41.049> ready<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.500> definitely

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
similar to it is ready I definitely

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.210 
similar to it is ready I definitely
think<00:02:42.459> that<00:02:42.579> apple<00:02:43.120> would<00:02:44.019> like<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.530> spot<00:02:45.010> in

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
think that apple would like that spot in

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.569 
think that apple would like that spot in
your<00:02:45.400> pocket<00:02:45.879> or<00:02:45.910> at<00:02:46.120> least<00:02:46.590> it's<00:02:47.590> with<00:02:48.280> more

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
your pocket or at least it's with more

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.280 
your pocket or at least it's with more
direct<00:02:48.970> access<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.629> your<00:02:49.720> bank<00:02:49.780> account

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
direct access to your bank account

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.220 
direct access to your bank account
because<00:02:50.620> having<00:02:50.890> your<00:02:50.980> credit<00:02:51.099> card<00:02:51.810> on<00:02:52.810> file

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
because having your credit card on file

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.110 
because having your credit card on file
it<00:02:53.440> just<00:02:53.620> isn't<00:02:54.250> quite<00:02:54.340> enough<00:02:54.519> for<00:02:54.819> apple

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
it just isn't quite enough for apple

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.030 
it just isn't quite enough for apple
