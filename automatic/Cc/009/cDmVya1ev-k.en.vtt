00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.280
 Apple managed to trace the mapu representing the return of the laptop 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.059
 thinnest and thinnest in the world 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.849
 We are going to make the boxing and show what we are going to find 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.179
 more out of the box 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:21.050
 although we also have a model of 13 with 3 inches in particular in this 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.630
 video is we show the model of ponce with six that surprises nothing more 

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:27.600
 hold it of vido its lightness and its small size 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.940
 so that's an idea its thickest part 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.770
 has only one with seven centimeters and its thinnest part with 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.480
 some amazing ones I counted it centimeters 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.450
 as usual in the mac maxi sopo charger is more 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.109
 critical 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:43.440
 with this we avoid accidental falls 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.090
 and also in the package we also find a true and the connector 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.400
 45 watt charger 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.250
 one of the great news we found something stark its installation disks and 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.170
 is that in the new one more read apple ap extended from the dvd is including in 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.630
 a memory vc b the operating system mac os 10 for future rista nations 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.870
 of course the new multimedia package there the ifc 11 already pre-installed in the 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.040
 team 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.170
 its housing is made entirely in aluminum with a full keyboard like 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.950
 the one of the current macbook pro 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.460
 aesthetically it differs from its older brothers for the silver frame 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.090
 which will include a small rubber line 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.740
 that does not rub in the house that caught fire 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.829
 we found the multitouch cataco more elongated but equally comfortable for 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.970
 operate the system through gestures with up to four fingers 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.370
 As you can see in the comparative images, the 11-inch model is 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.120
 little bigger and bulky than an ipad despite its small size mounted 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.130
 Two ports vcb output mini displayport to connect it to an external display 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.340
 audio and microphone output and also the 13-inch model integrates a 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.770
 slot for sd memory cards 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.890
 the sensations when we have it in the hand surprise by olympic what is 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:52.469
 feel 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.799
 in barely could with 0 6 kilos the model of 11 and one with 32 kilos l 13 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.939
 We have a complete computer with mac os 10 and all its programs for 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.920
 work and enjoy anywhere to be so portable obviously you need 

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:08.800
 a good autonomy and has it since they are five hours for the ponce model 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.170
 inches and seven hours for the 13 with incredible 30 days 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.109
 at rest for both models 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:18.540
 We have done tests on one or more power to check your ergonomics and 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:19.349
 performance 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.400
 the initial concern that it was not like describing due to its size is 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.769
 visited nothing else put your hands on keyboard 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.159
 and is that it is written as comfortably as we could for example in 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.849
 a 13-inch hammer 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.450
 mounts a flash memory so the minutia of reading and writing in the 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.530
 disc is very fast I this is clearly shown in its off in 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:42.590
 barely three seconds and also how not in a boot in fact only fifteen 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.590
 seconds 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.579
 similarly its intel core 2 duo processor 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.670
 the 2 gigas of ram graphic floor geforce 320m life work with applications 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:05.900
 at full capacity loading the programs very fast and I can work with them 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.169
 without noticing that we are in front of a computer as small as it is most 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:10.919
 pure 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.690
 heavy programs like those of the new multimedia package allais 11 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.320
 they move with ease and of course the options for it to do these 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.750
 safe by law of the operating system itself 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.919
 they respond very fast 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.549
 also if we combine this icy zone, the possibility of working in telefact is 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:27.960
 coffeemaker pictures 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.630
 with the works of expansion and endowment that already offer us multidark cacti 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.390
 experience in front of the noma heal leaves any computer far behind 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.529
 ultraportable 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.529
 of the competition 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:05.689
 the odm to provide you can already find in almost a point like trades I thought 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:08.739
 surprise as we do for its lightness size performance 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.040
 do not miss the chance 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.320
 to go through one of our stores to check it
