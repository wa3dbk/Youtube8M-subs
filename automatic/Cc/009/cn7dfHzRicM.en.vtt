that<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.020> functional<00:01:31.409> it's<00:01:31.770> not<00:01:31.920> just<00:01:32.189> for

that is functional it's not just for
looks<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:33.240> increases<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.750> handling<00:01:34.259> at

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
looks it increases the handling at

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.649 
looks it increases the handling at

something<00:01:43.979> really<00:01:44.340> neat<00:01:44.490> about<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.940> exhaust

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
something really neat about the exhaust

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.900 
something really neat about the exhaust
on<00:01:45.479> these<00:01:45.659> as<00:01:45.870> they've<00:01:46.020> actually<00:01:46.760> designed<00:01:47.760> it

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
on these as they've actually designed it

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.760 
on these as they've actually designed it
so<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.090> some<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.510> the<00:01:48.600> exhaust<00:01:48.960> sound<00:01:49.380> is

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
so that some of the exhaust sound is

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.740 
so that some of the exhaust sound is
played<00:01:50.580> right<00:01:50.820> into<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.270> cabin<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.720> the
