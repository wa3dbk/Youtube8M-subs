00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
instrumental part let me explain a

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.290 
instrumental part let me explain a
little<00:01:33.940> bit<00:01:34.210> of<00:01:34.270> what<00:01:34.450> happened<00:01:34.570> up<00:01:34.900> to<00:01:35.050> there

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
little bit of what happened up to there

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.940 
little bit of what happened up to there
basically<00:01:37.300> when<00:01:37.510> it<00:01:37.660> sounded<00:01:38.560> like<00:01:38.620> the<00:01:38.770> full

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
basically when it sounded like the full

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.760 
basically when it sounded like the full
band<00:01:39.160> kicked<00:01:39.580> in<00:01:39.880> is<00:01:40.480> when<00:01:40.750> I<00:01:40.780> went<00:01:41.050> into<00:01:41.200> using

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
band kicked in is when I went into using

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.830 
band kicked in is when I went into using
three<00:01:42.070> notes<00:01:42.280> my<00:01:42.520> left<00:01:42.730> hand<00:01:43.000> is<00:01:43.210> still<00:01:43.510> not

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
three notes my left hand is still not

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.340 
three notes my left hand is still not
doing<00:01:44.230> anything<00:01:44.560> except<00:01:45.430> for<00:01:46.200> throwing<00:01:47.200> the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
doing anything except for throwing the

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.100 
doing anything except for throwing the
the<00:01:48.180> Leslie<00:01:49.890> controller<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:52.110> wheel

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
the Leslie controller the the wheel

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.320 
the Leslie controller the the wheel
that's<00:01:53.350> controlling<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:53.800> Leslie<00:01:54.160> effect<00:01:54.550> up

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
that's controlling the Leslie effect up

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.870 
that's controlling the Leslie effect up
and<00:01:55.630> down<00:01:56.290> and<00:01:56.620> if<00:01:57.280> you're<00:01:57.430> really<00:01:57.700> paying

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
and down and if you're really paying

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.600 
and down and if you're really paying
attention<00:01:58.360> it's<00:01:58.840> not<00:01:59.050> quite<00:01:59.590> two<00:02:00.160> measures

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
attention it's not quite two measures

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.820 
attention it's not quite two measures
but<00:02:00.970> it's<00:02:01.210> it's<00:02:01.510> it's<00:02:01.930> again<00:02:02.350> I'm<00:02:02.620> kind<00:02:02.740> of

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
but it's it's it's again I'm kind of

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.360 
but it's it's it's again I'm kind of
doing<00:02:02.979> as<00:02:03.070> a<00:02:03.160> feel<00:02:03.460> thing<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.710> it's<00:02:05.890> quite

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
doing as a feel thing but it's quite

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.040 
doing as a feel thing but it's quite
like<00:02:06.520> a<00:02:06.550> measure<00:02:06.820> in<00:02:07.000> half<00:02:07.270> sometimes<00:02:07.660> I'm

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
like a measure in half sometimes I'm

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.850 
like a measure in half sometimes I'm
letting<00:02:08.260> it<00:02:08.290> go<00:02:08.350> with<00:02:08.530> longer<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:10.680> he<00:02:11.680> also

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
letting it go with longer and he also

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.670 
letting it go with longer and he also
knows<00:02:12.130> that<00:02:12.190> sometimes<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.300> moved<00:02:13.570> around<00:02:13.870> and

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
knows that sometimes I moved around and

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.310 
knows that sometimes I moved around and
that's<00:02:15.400> okay<00:02:15.820> but<00:02:16.420> just<00:02:16.480> keep<00:02:16.810> in<00:02:16.960> mind<00:02:16.990> that

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
that's okay but just keep in mind that

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.100 
that's okay but just keep in mind that
when<00:02:17.440> you<00:02:17.530> move<00:02:17.710> around<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.580> tone<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.930> rock

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
when you move around the tone of a rock

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.320 
when you move around the tone of a rock
organ<00:02:20.410> is<00:02:20.800> very<00:02:21.340> linear

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
organ is very linear

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.540 
organ is very linear
at<00:02:22.930> least<00:02:23.170> this<00:02:23.410> particular<00:02:23.590> patch<00:02:24.100> is<00:02:24.430> we're

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
at least this particular patch is we're

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.790 
at least this particular patch is we're
not<00:02:24.610> using<00:02:24.820> any<00:02:25.080> percussion<00:02:26.080> type<00:02:26.350> stuff<00:02:26.590> with

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
not using any percussion type stuff with

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.130 
not using any percussion type stuff with
it<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.970> basically<00:02:29.820> keep<00:02:30.820> it<00:02:31.000> linear<00:02:31.420> when<00:02:32.020> you

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
it so basically keep it linear when you

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.830 
it so basically keep it linear when you
move<00:02:32.430> try<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.489> keep<00:02:34.030> it<00:02:34.209> like<00:02:34.390> you're<00:02:34.690> playing

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
move try to keep it like you're playing

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.150 
move try to keep it like you're playing
a<00:02:34.989> real<00:02:35.140> organ<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.709> you<00:02:35.739> didn't<00:02:36.010> have<00:02:36.130> a

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
a real organ and you didn't have a

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.220 
a real organ and you didn't have a
sustain<00:02:36.640> pedal<00:02:38.640> let<00:02:39.640> me<00:02:39.760> give<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.060> an<00:02:40.120> example

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
sustain pedal let me give you an example

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.199 
sustain pedal let me give you an example
talking<00:02:41.230> about<00:02:41.470> so<00:02:41.770> if<00:02:41.890> you're<00:02:42.070> playing<00:02:42.790> a<00:02:42.940> C

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
talking about so if you're playing a C

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.580 
talking about so if you're playing a C
chord<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.840> you're<00:02:44.410> going<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.709> an<00:02:44.980> F<00:02:45.130> chord

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
chord and you're going to an F chord

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.170 
chord and you're going to an F chord
probably<00:02:47.590> do<00:02:47.680> something<00:02:47.920> like<00:02:48.070> this<00:02:48.519> here's<00:02:49.090> a

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
probably do something like this here's a

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:57.660 
probably do something like this here's a
C<00:02:49.510> major<00:02:54.120> there's<00:02:55.120> very<00:02:55.480> little<00:02:56.220> dead<00:02:57.220> time<00:02:57.489> it

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
C major there's very little dead time it

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.750 
C major there's very little dead time it
wasn't<00:02:57.880> like<00:02:58.150> this

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.370 

don't<00:03:02.760> want<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:02.970> do<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.630> you<00:03:03.990> also<00:03:04.140> don't

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
don't want to do that and you also don't

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.520 
don't want to do that and you also don't
want<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.740> I<00:03:05.400> mean<00:03:05.819> you<00:03:06.090> can<00:03:06.660> hold<00:03:06.930> down<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.319> C

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
want to I mean you can hold down the C

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.620 
want to I mean you can hold down the C
the<00:03:07.680> entire<00:03:07.920> time<00:03:08.190> as<00:03:08.340> you're<00:03:08.520> moving<00:03:11.569> but<00:03:12.569> you

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
the entire time as you're moving but you

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.180 
the entire time as you're moving but you
don't<00:03:12.780> even<00:03:12.930> want<00:03:13.170> that<00:03:13.260> break<00:03:13.709> try<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.010> make

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
don't even want that break try to make

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.840 
don't even want that break try to make
it<00:03:14.340> as<00:03:14.490> as<00:03:14.790> quick<00:03:15.300> as<00:03:15.569> possible<00:03:15.750> or<00:03:16.230> even<00:03:16.290> use

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
it as as quick as possible or even use

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.250 
it as as quick as possible or even use
your<00:03:17.850> third<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.180> fifth<00:03:18.570> finger<00:03:18.959> here<00:03:19.140> when

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
your third and fifth finger here when

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:28.040 
your third and fifth finger here when
you<00:03:19.350> do<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:25.940> that<00:03:26.940> helps<00:03:27.239> keep<00:03:27.600> it<00:03:27.780> very

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
you do that that helps keep it very

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.080 
you do that that helps keep it very
fluid<00:03:28.500> as<00:03:28.650> we're<00:03:28.800> going<00:03:28.920> now<00:03:29.190> when<00:03:29.820> we<00:03:29.910> get

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
fluid as we're going now when we get

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.110 
fluid as we're going now when we get
into<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.690> instrumental<00:03:31.290> section<00:03:32.090> what<00:03:33.090> I

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
into the instrumental section what I

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:48.320 
into the instrumental section what I
would<00:03:33.330> recommend<00:03:35.690> is<00:03:36.690> that<00:03:43.610> you<00:03:46.220> come<00:03:47.220> up<00:03:47.340> even

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
would recommend is that you come up even
