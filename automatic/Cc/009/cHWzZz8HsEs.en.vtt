00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
Church we use the traditional piano and

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.810 
Church we use the traditional piano and
organ<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.050> our<00:00:10.110> services<00:00:10.590> but<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:11.460> could<00:00:11.700> be

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
organ and our services but this could be

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.610 
organ and our services but this could be
used<00:00:12.059> maybe<00:00:12.509> on<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.750> camping<00:00:13.230> trip<00:00:13.259> or

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
used maybe on a camping trip or

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.110 
used maybe on a camping trip or
somewhere<00:00:13.920> like<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.099> where<00:00:14.460> guitar<00:00:14.820> will<00:00:15.030> be

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
somewhere like that where guitar will be

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.320 
somewhere like that where guitar will be
a<00:00:15.150> little<00:00:15.389> more<00:00:15.480> appropriate<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:17.330> basically

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
a little more appropriate and basically

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.820 
a little more appropriate and basically
the<00:00:18.449> reason<00:00:18.630> why<00:00:18.900> playing<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.380> hymns<00:00:19.590> on<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
the reason why playing the hymns on the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.710 
the reason why playing the hymns on the
guitar<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.369> easy<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:21.000> because<00:00:21.359> almost

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
guitar is so easy is because almost

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.920 
guitar is so easy is because almost
every<00:00:22.109> hymn<00:00:22.289> consists<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:22.980> three<00:00:23.279> chords<00:00:23.730> and

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
every hymn consists of three chords and

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.839 
every hymn consists of three chords and
it's<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.080> easy<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.410> transpose<00:00:26.039> on<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.519> guitar

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
it's so easy to transpose on the guitar

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.330 
it's so easy to transpose on the guitar
into<00:00:27.180> whatever<00:00:27.990> key<00:00:28.289> you'd<00:00:28.529> like<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.890> sing

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
into whatever key you'd like to sing

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.980 
into whatever key you'd like to sing
so<00:00:29.670> for<00:00:29.970> example<00:00:30.060> if<00:00:30.420> we're<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.660> take<00:00:30.840> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
so for example if we're to take the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.749 
so for example if we're to take the
easiest<00:00:31.320> key<00:00:31.650> probably<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.189> play<00:00:32.340> guitar<00:00:32.730> in

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
easiest key probably to play guitar in

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.520 
easiest key probably to play guitar in
just<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> key<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.360> C<00:00:33.600> they're<00:00:34.260> going<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.440> be

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
just the key of C they're going to be

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.200 
just the key of C they're going to be
three<00:00:34.829> basic<00:00:35.250> chords<00:00:35.430> first<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.180> course

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
three basic chords first is of course

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.910 
three basic chords first is of course
the<00:00:36.630> C<00:00:36.870> chord<00:00:37.200> which<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.860> like<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:39.920> then

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
the C chord which is like this and then

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.880 
the C chord which is like this and then
there's<00:00:41.129> going<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.520> F<00:00:41.640> chord<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.890> then

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
there's going to be the F chord and then

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
there's going to be the F chord and then
a<00:00:43.920> g7<00:00:45.200> now<00:00:46.200> personally<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.980> like<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.489> play<00:00:47.670> just

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
a g7 now personally I like to play just

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.180 
a g7 now personally I like to play just
a<00:00:48.030> G<00:00:48.300> instead<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> g7<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.950> get<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
a G instead of the g7 and you get the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.740 
a G instead of the g7 and you get the
same<00:00:50.399> effect<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.969> just<00:00:51.180> think<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.420> sounds<00:00:51.690> a

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
same effect I just think it sounds a

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.930 
same effect I just think it sounds a
little<00:00:51.809> bit<00:00:51.960> more<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.160> richer<00:00:53.460> chord<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.910> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
little bit more of a richer chord on the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.330 
little bit more of a richer chord on the
guitar<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.739> play<00:00:55.890> any<00:00:56.219> song

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
guitar and so you can play any song

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.040 
guitar and so you can play any song
