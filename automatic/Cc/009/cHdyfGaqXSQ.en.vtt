00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.270
 hey shows everything if we're back 

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.740
 with a new video of gta 5 and how 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.419
 You see today will tunear 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.150
 new vehicle that this vehicle what 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:11.800
 you get through the first holdup is 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.510
 say you have to finish it and they will give you 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.310
 the kuruma calin in this case 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.320
 this is the armor there are two types one 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.940
 which is the normal and another that is the one 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.460
 is shielded and in this case as we 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.350
 to tuning the armored the truth I do not know that 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.270
 it's going to be able to put you I have enough 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.619
 eager to know that we will be able to 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.990
 put because the wise has all the 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.060
 crystals well armored and the truth that 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.559
 the vehicle is very cool, let's see 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.179
 that can be put at the moment we are going to 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.579
 put all the improvements as the 

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:38.579
 brakes to see here bumpers 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.039
 front with color voucher voucher 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.760
 I think he's going to put the carbon one 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:50.440
 because I do not know, I would love the black car 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.570
 I think it looks good black to be like that and 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.370
 tuned and also for the robberies I 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.280
 I think the color can be pretty 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.060
 black voucher we buy that of escape you 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.720
 we put this next in none 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:07.230
 causing little light and yes but I think not 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.210
 I'm going to put is that neon I think I do not know 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.240
 it would be very good if it were 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.430
 it would look good one even white 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.100
 let's leave it white and if not then I 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.270
 like at any time little 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.979
 to leave the target 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.409
 this is already put will be going to put 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:27.140
 is black and then the painting we are going to 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.659
 see what the chrome is left 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.970
 well what happens is that is what 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.430
 I say the color black yes I love how 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.970
 he is left with this car and most likely 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.850
 is that they put it black although we could 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.760
 do one thing let's try to see what 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.850
 color follow here 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.030
 we are going to put the metallic metal 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.780
 in black 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.880
 an educated 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.890
 I think black coal is better because 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:59.909
 so that's how very dull and pearly yes 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:04.110
 but we are going to put it white like it is 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.030
 good or equal with carbon black so I 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.039
 I think it looks good like that without putting the 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.700
 of pearly then the secondary color 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.630
 I think we're going to put it 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.000
 metal 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.430
 although I would put it so that it 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.930
 difference a little 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.879
 well something like that 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.770
 I think that it would remain but also the 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.430
 we can try in mate 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:31.770
 that if we put it is not but I like 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:35.280
 his ties and blank his change but not 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.230
 I'm between that and it's really that 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.959
 they are practically the same 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.250
 We could also put it graphite 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.560
 let's put in carbon black too 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.420
 we are going to put the two colors the same 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.030
 and let's see if I can put something else 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:53.739
 the laces is going ready we're just going to put 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:57.330
 of carbon are this and this value what 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:00.420
 let's put this is not 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.480
 I'm not going to leave him even if he's 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.940
 friendship no but it just ends this me 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.350
 I liked 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:13.380
 valerÃ³n that we are going to put this is like 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.810
 very much cello these do not need 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.530
 great, actually I do not like it that way 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.560
 that I think we're going to put this one 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.420
 I think this west can be this 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.400
 I believe that even 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.980
 better I like this we are going to put the 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.010
 suspension let's put on top then the 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.239
 transmission the same the turbo also 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.970
 the wheels type of luxury wheels 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.640
 so he 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.050
 those that I already like but that see the 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.850
 chrome wheels to warm up let's go 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.460
 put a chrome 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.319
 to see if any similar is this 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.069
 like 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.069
 that 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.280
 I think I do think that I'm going to put this one 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.410
 here to see if he's going to put that and 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.610
 now we are going to put the color of 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.430
 you really do not want 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:07.840
 put none and then loose 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:11.410
 accessories to put this and the smoke goes 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.450
 to be in white plan white is here 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.510
 above concludes this selection thus is 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.680
 selected to the black windows 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:23.280
 whole so he's back 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.139
 it seems a car of these in plan how 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.229
 you're from the future because it's all 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:31.110
 shielded the truth that no pretty cool 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.840
 you see exactly nothing of what there is 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.400
 inside so I like it a lot so 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.930
 nothing guys the truth that I like 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.990
 very much this car especially because 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.539
 it's a totally new car we're going to 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.639
 see it inside to see how and what 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:47.220
 it's really cool as I say 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.229
 because it is fully armored and that 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.240
 We had not seen it at the moment 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.220
 a gta 5 a car that was like this and the 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.539
 true that this one is quite go like this 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.430
 that nothing I hope you liked 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:00.320
 leave your crisis also informed this 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.320
 edit is next until later
