we I thought I thought we did this

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.960 
we I thought I thought we did this
glitch<00:00:26.400> before<00:00:26.849> but<00:00:28.160> it<00:00:29.160> wasn't<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.939> show

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
glitch before but it wasn't on the show

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.210 
glitch before but it wasn't on the show
so<00:00:30.689> i'm<00:00:30.750> going<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.990> show<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.470> need<00:00:32.189> to

so i'm going to show you you need to

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.710 
so i'm going to show you you need to
type<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.699> stage<00:00:33.629> select<00:00:35.089> debug<00:00:36.089> mode<00:00:36.330> and

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
type in stage select debug mode and

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.430 
type in stage select debug mode and
supersonic<00:00:37.440> codes<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.280> alright<00:00:39.440> so

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
supersonic codes to do this alright so

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.689 
supersonic codes to do this alright so
I'm<00:00:40.710> first<00:00:41.159> thing<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.579> need<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.820> do<00:00:43.489> is<00:00:44.489> lay

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
out lay out a bunch of rings like a

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.470 
out lay out a bunch of rings like a
whole<00:00:48.989> bunch<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.680> them<00:00:49.829> until<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.550> have<00:00:50.730> like

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
whole bunch of them until you have like

whole bunch of them until you have like
over<00:00:51.660> 100<00:00:51.960> rings<00:00:52.350> total<00:00:53.750> alright<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:54.899> I'm<00:00:55.109> just

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
over 100 rings total alright so I'm just

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.130 
over 100 rings total alright so I'm just
going<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.469> like<00:00:56.309> do<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.809> cuz<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.989> need

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
going to like do that cuz you need

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.830 
going to like do that cuz you need
because<00:00:58.590> um<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.730> need<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.390> certain

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
because um you need to have certain

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.330 
because um you need to have certain
amount<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.140> rings<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.440> be<00:01:01.530> supersonic<00:01:01.920> but

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
amount of rings to be supersonic but

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.749 
amount of rings to be supersonic but
also<00:01:02.989> if<00:01:03.989> you're<00:01:04.170> out<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.470> rings<00:01:05.009> then<00:01:05.580> you'll

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
also if you're out of rings then you'll

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.900 
also if you're out of rings then you'll
turn<00:01:05.940> back<00:01:06.090> into<00:01:06.210> regular<00:01:06.390> sonic<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.910> you

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
turn back into regular sonic and and you

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.950 
turn back into regular sonic and and you
don't<00:01:09.060> want<00:01:09.179> that<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.450> happen<00:01:09.479> if<00:01:09.840> you're

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
don't want that to happen if you're

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.840 
don't want that to happen if you're
doing<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.229> glitch<00:01:10.880> okay<00:01:12.800> so<00:01:13.800> I'll<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:14.580> get

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
doing this glitch okay so I'll just get

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:27.139 
doing this glitch okay so I'll just get
a<00:01:14.910> few<00:01:15.060> more<00:01:19.970> okay<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:25.530> yeah<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:26.789> jump<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
a few more okay so so yeah it's jump to

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.699 
a few more okay so so yeah it's jump to
become<00:01:27.539> supersonic<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:30.530> bunch<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.649> you

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:31.709 
become supersonic and on bunch of you

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:32.960 
become supersonic and on bunch of you
people<00:01:31.890> probably<00:01:32.160> know<00:01:32.310> what's<00:01:32.520> glitch<00:01:32.759> we're

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:57.629 
boss here such a supersonic will be

00:01:57.629 --> 00:02:14.920 
boss here such a supersonic will be
invincible

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.259
