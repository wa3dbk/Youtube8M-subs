00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
show you there's two types the first one

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.610 
show you there's two types the first one
is<00:00:51.649> drop<00:00:52.039> gold<00:00:52.429> gems<00:00:52.789> and<00:00:53.179> these<00:00:54.140> give<00:00:54.440> you

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
is drop gold gems and these give you

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.520 
is drop gold gems and these give you
more<00:00:55.039> chance<00:00:55.429> of<00:00:55.730> getting<00:00:55.850> gold<00:00:56.569> from<00:00:56.899> chests

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
more chance of getting gold from chests

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.380 
more chance of getting gold from chests
when<00:00:57.890> you<00:00:58.069> equip<00:00:58.399> them<00:00:58.670> and<00:00:59.050> they<00:01:00.050> cap<00:01:00.319> at<00:01:00.589> 400%

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
when you equip them and they cap at 400%

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.320 
when you equip them and they cap at 400%
so<00:01:02.390> you<00:01:02.809> can<00:01:03.019> fuse<00:01:03.409> the<00:01:03.739> three<00:01:04.159> lower<00:01:04.460> ones<00:01:04.820> to

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
so you can fuse the three lower ones to

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.500 
so you can fuse the three lower ones to
reach<00:01:05.570> their<00:01:05.960> cap<00:01:06.260> and<00:01:06.560> they<00:01:07.370> stack<00:01:07.729> so<00:01:08.240> use

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
reach their cap and they stack so use

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.930 
reach their cap and they stack so use
two<00:01:08.900> or<00:01:09.080> three<00:01:09.110> of<00:01:09.560> them<00:01:09.770> preferably<00:01:10.460> at

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
two or three of them preferably at

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.039 
two or three of them preferably at
capped<00:01:11.330> value<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:13.580> other<00:01:13.729> gem<00:01:14.540> for<00:01:14.780> gold

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
capped value and the other gem for gold

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.219 
capped value and the other gem for gold
is<00:01:15.350> bonus<00:01:15.950> gold<00:01:16.219> and<00:01:16.610> these<00:01:17.210> increase<00:01:17.899> the

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
is bonus gold and these increase the

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.469 
is bonus gold and these increase the
amount<00:01:18.590> of<00:01:18.770> gold<00:01:19.070> that<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:19.399> get<00:01:19.640> from<00:01:19.850> chests

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
and you can stack them up to 11 if you

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.310 
and you can stack them up to 11 if you
also<00:01:23.780> have<00:01:24.229> to<00:01:24.619> drop<00:01:24.950> gold<00:01:25.250> equipped<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.320> here

through<00:02:26.460> all<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.210> acts<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.750> quests<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.350> show

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
through all the acts and quests and show

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.040 
through all the acts and quests and show
you<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.250> meatiest<00:02:29.730> comes<00:02:30.090> out<00:02:30.300> on<00:02:30.480> top
