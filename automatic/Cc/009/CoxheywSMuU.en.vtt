the<00:02:09.090> ball<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.600> if<00:02:09.690> he's<00:02:09.840> going<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.200> power

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
the ball and if he's going to a power

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.940 
the ball and if he's going to a power
shot<00:02:10.740> the<00:02:10.890> accuracy<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:13.230> good<00:02:13.260> they

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
shot the accuracy is so so good they

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.620 
shot the accuracy is so so good they

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
could find the corner of the net all the

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.630 
could find the corner of the net all the
time<00:02:15.870> he's<00:02:16.530> got<00:02:16.710> that<00:02:16.800> ability<00:02:16.920> because<00:02:17.400> he's

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
time he's got that ability because he's

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.880 
time he's got that ability because he's
strong<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:17.970> can<00:02:18.120> push<00:02:18.300> people<00:02:18.720> off<00:02:18.840> like<00:02:19.110> this

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.070 
strong you can push people off like this
push<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.310> gets<00:02:20.880> pushed<00:02:21.120> off<00:02:21.300> still<00:02:21.540> carries<00:02:21.900> on
