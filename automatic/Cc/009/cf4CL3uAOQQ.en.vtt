00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
from what I've understood and it's going

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.930

to<00:00:54.390> be<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.629> black<00:00:54.899> mist<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.789> edition<00:00:56.789> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
to be the black mist a edition and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.490 
to be the black mist a edition and
they're<00:00:57.270> calling<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.780> developer<00:00:58.379> edition

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.610 
they're calling it the developer edition
and<00:00:59.239> I<00:01:00.239> think<00:01:00.480> it's<00:01:00.750> pretty<00:01:00.960> awesome<00:01:01.140> i'm<00:01:01.559> not

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
and I think it's pretty awesome i'm not

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.560 
and I think it's pretty awesome i'm not
sure<00:01:01.680> if<00:01:01.890> i<00:01:01.949> will<00:01:02.010> pick<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.340> pick<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.789> up<00:01:02.969> but
