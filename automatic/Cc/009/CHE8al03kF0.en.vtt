00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.400

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.630
 organic skin care products 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.580
 face and body 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.980
 You often asked me questions 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.680
 comments what i use so here 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.779
 the time has come to tell me about it at the same time 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.619
 I want to recommend you a girl with a nickname 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.449
 miss massively 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.789
 which is just like me keen 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.500
 natural cosmetics and on her channel you 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.599
 find a lot of very detailed 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.080
 reviews of such cosmetics and not only 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.719
 Well, now about what I use, I'll start 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.680
 with cleansing for these purposes I use 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.829
 natural soap 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.410
 snowy from nature Siberian buy it 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.100
 already repeatedly she provides very 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.350
 delicate care and smell you would know how 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.670
 it smells sweet the camera can't 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.670
 convey this fragrance 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.260
 eye makeup i remove olive 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.420
 Oil carefully transferred to the factory bottle 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.820
 except olive oil is beautiful 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.040
 she also removes eye makeup 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.110
 provides nourishment and hydration very 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.840
 thin and sensitive skin around the eyes 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.720
 so it turns out the means two in one 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.910
 and no special cream for you 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.060
 There is a special daytime face cream 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.340
 and nightlife from the series of ecobyuty from oriflame 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.180
 they have a rather gentle grassy 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.950
 Organic Shea Butter Aroma 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.259
 day face cream have a lighter 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.930
 texture than night but both of them 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.940
 amazingly quickly absorbed such i 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.340
 not observed with any cream that 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.229
 used before surprisingly quickly 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.810
 no stickiness is absorbed 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.869
 This is one of the reasons why I also 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.540
 I repeatedly buy these hand creams from 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.890
 I also have a separate cream 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.930
 only summer my hands don't need 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.119
 in extra moisturizing therefore 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.580
 in the summer this organic cream waits 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.320
 the coming of autumn love him for what he 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.300
 also well absorbed and not 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.420
 leaves behind white stains 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.550
 it has a neutral smell 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.369
 brushing your teeth then for myself I decided not to 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.020
 use posts content sls not 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.660
 really want to swallow this 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.490
 disgusting so how do i order 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.890
 toothpaste from the offer site 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.470
 The last posts I ordered and 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.170
 She was very pleased with this gel paste 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.580
 ksel white as a natural 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.250
 I also use deodorant 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.110
 site products 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.060
 roller deodorant spring fresh with 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.510
 very gentle unobtrusive smell 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.430
 This design does not contain aluminum I want 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.090
 also note that all of the above 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.440
 products not tested on animals 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.480
 further I will introduce you to natural 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.880
 funds that can be mixed between 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.450
 yourself getting various funds by 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.270
 care 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.750
 these are again olive oil 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.330
 as well as salt and coffee also in this set 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.130
 You can add honey which is most bright 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.220
 exert its beneficial effect on 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.650
 skin when going to the bath or sauna and so 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.470
 mixing olive oil and coffee or 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.450
 olive oil and salt get the most 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.120
 natural useful body scrub 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.349
 varying the degree of grinding and the amount of salt 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.750
 can change 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.610
 the abrasiveness of these means besides 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.290
 after peeling procedure due to 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.870
 olive oil top layer of skin 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.180
 will instantly be hydrated and energized 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.430
 Such a procedure is indispensable if you 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.950
 Want to get a smooth and beautiful tan 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.810
 by the way olive oil can also 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.090
 use for sun protection 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.870
 although the level of protection is not so high 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.400
 as well as a tan accelerator 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.150
 so if you go to the beach 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.530
 take the olive oil with salt 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.349
 I have a sea 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.170
 and without any additional funds 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.800
 unless dilute a little water well 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.230
 use for scalp peeling 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.230
 although a softer scrub can be obtained and 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.630
 harder to grind coffee plus when 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.970
 using salt as scrubs 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.550
 is that you wash it off without difficulty 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.430
 water and all you do not know dissolve 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.500
 I myself all hope so 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.700
 interested to know about the care products on 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.400
 which i use 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.060
 all good mood and have a nice day 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.060
 bye Bye 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.460

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.110
