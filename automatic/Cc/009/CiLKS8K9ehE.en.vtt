00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.900
 hi friends today we are going to learn to play 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.219
 day tripper a classic of the beatles and 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.980
 in this video I'm going to teach you to play 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.699
 the guitar riff the chords and the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.699
 just that he's wearing 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.460
 if you like the idea of ​​learning it already 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.460
 you know stay and let's go to it 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:42.790
 this song starts with a very rhythm 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:45.280
 known that sounds like that and to touch it 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:50.010
 let's start by giving sixth string to 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:55.030
 air then press on fret 3 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.699
 4 while you 2 of the fifth string 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.860
 now press on fret 2 of the fourth 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.890
 rope and look I use the same finger 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.699
 I just twist it and now fourth 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.699
 rope to the air 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.040
 we already have the first part of the rif 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.570
 and 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.330
 after that I add second fret of 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.450
 the fifth string fourth fret of the 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:27.659
 fourth and I return second fret of the 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:31.759
 fifth quarter air fourth fret 2 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.759
 and I already have the main riff look 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.360
 well we already have what is the intro 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.250
 now we come to the stanza that is 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.170
 when he starts to sing and there I have 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:02:00.700
 good news because it is still the 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:02:01.900
 same river look and now after 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.390
 do it twice when it starts to 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:11.230
 singing happens to do the same rhythm but 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:13.300
 starting from the fifth string would be 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.950
 the same movement of fingers but can 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.580
 start in the sixth we start in the 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:25.540
 fifth now we do the riff in 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:26.380
 the sixth you have become clear is very 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.360
 simple 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.540
 we do the riff that we have learned two 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.910
 times starting from the sixth after a 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.310
 starting from the fifth and another from 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.310
 the sixth we are going to play the whole stanza 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.460
 and now we come to the chorus 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.510
 and good to touch it you can touch 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.379
 many ways but I have decided that 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.709
 let's say a dominant here of 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:21.560
 We are going to put the index in 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.890
 storage rooms of the sixth rope and the ring 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.489
 in fret four of the fourth and we're going to 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.489
 give down 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.980
 now we come back from this same position 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.990
 let's go next to this box 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.569
 and we already let on the road and 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.480
 we passed a fret 9 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.819
 and then 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.030
 72 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:57.299
 Andean everything hits down we're going to 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.299
 do what 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.750
 I'll tell you 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.420
 now 39 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:17.200
 while you feel 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:19.239
 and we start again easy, not so 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.130
 look, we already have the main topic 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.990
 Now I'm going to show you the part that 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.780
 it has different that is that of the sun 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.120
 or do the rhythm again but this time 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:35.080
 change the fingering because it starts 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:36.700
 itself and well and well if you have noticed are 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.650
 same as the previous one but has a 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.380
 different fingering and you touch another 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.500
 different way to touch it we are going to 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:49.110
 give in fret 2 of the fifth string and 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:53.360
 now on fourth string we make 0-4 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.360
 now we go to fret 4 the third 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:00.630
 and we go back t4 the fourth and now 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:03.800
 fret two of the second and fourth fret 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:15.120
 the fourth fret after the third 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:17.640
 34 of the third yes and this is the part 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:29.870
 just before only three times I think 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:29.870
 what is it like 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.380
 very easy we started fret four of the 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.380
 third rope 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:46.460
 four and now we walk a bending on 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:48.590
 fret five of second string we press 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.400
 fret five of the first time and 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.400
 we relax the bendine 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.040
 and now we 're finished it 's just coming to 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:00.990
 12th fret of the second string 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.990
 this 10 contrast 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:08.560
 we already have it good and the whole only 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.560
 it would sound like this 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.520
 i 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.450
 plus 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:32.120
 good and we already have the whole video 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:33.680
 I hope you liked what you 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.810
 I recommend that you watch the video 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.210
 show where I put into practice 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.250
 everything that I taught you in this class 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.860
 I recommend you see it touches along 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:46.330
 with me if you liked remember to give 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.330
