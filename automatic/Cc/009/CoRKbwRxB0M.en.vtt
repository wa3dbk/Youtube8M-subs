what<00:00:52.000> I<00:00:52.030> got<00:00:52.359> the<00:00:52.570> quality<00:00:52.930> I<00:00:52.960> got<00:00:53.260> um<00:00:53.530> if<00:00:54.250> you

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
what I got the quality I got um if you

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.790 
what I got the quality I got um if you
do<00:00:54.809> send<00:00:55.809> me<00:00:55.960> pictures<00:00:56.289> I<00:00:56.350> want<00:00:56.379> to<00:00:56.559> see<00:00:56.710> him

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
do send me pictures I want to see him

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.860 
do send me pictures I want to see him
but<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.870> first<00:00:59.079> thing<00:00:59.289> is<00:00:59.559> the<00:01:00.600> face<00:01:01.600> scan

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
but the first thing is the face scan

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.530 
but the first thing is the face scan
technology<00:01:02.530> maps<00:01:02.859> a<00:01:03.160> whole<00:01:04.030> bunch<00:01:04.269> of<00:01:04.390> points

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
technology maps a whole bunch of points

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.290 
technology maps a whole bunch of points
on<00:01:04.720> your<00:01:04.780> face<00:01:05.019> and<00:01:05.520> when<00:01:06.520> it's<00:01:06.700> rendering<00:01:07.090> it

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
on your face and when it's rendering it

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.990 
on your face and when it's rendering it
tells<00:01:07.510> you<00:01:07.690> how<00:01:07.900> many<00:01:08.250> how<00:01:09.250> many<00:01:09.310> points<00:01:09.700> that

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
tells you how many how many points that

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.970 
tells you how many how many points that
it's<00:01:10.120> captured<00:01:10.600> so<00:01:10.750> let's<00:01:10.900> say<00:01:10.990> like<00:01:11.140> 1000

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
it's captured so let's say like 1000

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.580 
it's captured so let's say like 1000
2000<00:01:12.520> 3000<00:01:13.090> 4000<00:01:13.690> five<00:01:13.840> or<00:01:14.200> whatever<00:01:14.290> that<00:01:14.470> is

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
2000 3000 4000 five or whatever that is

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.240 
2000 3000 4000 five or whatever that is
so<00:01:15.960> if<00:01:16.960> you<00:01:17.080> want<00:01:17.230> to<00:01:17.290> get<00:01:17.410> the<00:01:17.500> most<00:01:17.800> amount<00:01:18.040> of

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
so if you want to get the most amount of

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.210 
so if you want to get the most amount of
those<00:01:18.370> possible<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.650> highest<00:01:21.010> enough

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
those possible like the highest enough

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.020 
those possible like the highest enough
my<00:01:21.730> first<00:01:21.940> few<00:01:22.240> face<00:01:22.450> games<00:01:22.780> were<00:01:22.930> like<00:01:23.080> 1500

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
my first few face games were like 1500

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.510 
my first few face games were like 1500
1700<00:01:25.530> didn't<00:01:26.530> look<00:01:26.590> anything<00:01:26.830> like<00:01:27.010> me<00:01:27.070> all

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
1700 didn't look anything like me all

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.970 
1700 didn't look anything like me all
the<00:01:27.700> color<00:01:27.940> was<00:01:28.210> off<00:01:28.420> everything<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.950> what<00:01:32.950> I

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
the color was off everything so what I

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.470 
the color was off everything so what I
found<00:01:33.370> was<00:01:33.640> best<00:01:34.060> is

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
found was best is

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.020 
found was best is
