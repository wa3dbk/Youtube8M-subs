00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:04.249
 So you want to hear the story of trampolines penguin 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.690
 because I want to tell the work for the first time that it is not an exciting story 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.169
 where the fingernails have to buy or wet their pants 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.119
 and at night, even swimming dreams come 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.029
 I want to tell love a funny story 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.710
 because if you are a child then you certainly do not have much to laugh about and 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.319
 if you are an adult 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:25.550
 much less 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.890
 you've probably already seen penguins in the zoo 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.489
 or on TV 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:32.540
 Black and white they look 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.670
 that fits every child 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.620
 The males and females look so similar that they are not 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.100
 can correctly distinguish from each other 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.050
 and although the birds are 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.560
 they can not fly at all 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.890
 But they do not need that at the South Pole 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.030
 trees 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.940
 and when they are hungry they make a dive underwater 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.970
 open the beak and allow the fish to swim just so Rhine 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.840
 Of course, the very small penguins can not do that yet 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.060
 they are just waiting on the shore until the big ones come out of the water again 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.310
 they do not just collect the fish in the stomach 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.050
 but also in the head 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.090
 Picture it's sort of a shopping list for fish content 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.810
 if they then jump out of the water, the little ones are already there and make 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.570
 but then the big ones would all go out of their heads again and 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.050
 Chen, well 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.150
 CONTENS the little ones in the beak Rheine 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.640
 be glad that you are not a penguin otherwise your mother would do so too 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.730
 do 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.820
 Zhi year now to the number of slow time that in our history also one time 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.960
 real penguin turns up 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.340
 the best in the team a bit then they will be the same 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.860
 Penguins are just as curious as humans 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.770
 many airlines have never been Sandra Hinz to me 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.450
 No, because we do not want to believe 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.109
 That's why you have a blue BMW percent 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.129
 No 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.129
 because of a retiree act 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:17.809
 to have the changes 

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:20.609
 will have 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.609
 January experienced 

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:26.949
 the efforts were rewarded 

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:28.789
 with intelligent 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:31.789
 not even in the ducks Berlin 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:34.229
 Customers were 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:35.779
 Waiblingen 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:37.749
 we Warren Warren 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:41.209
 but really wants all the contributors 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.209
 on locally 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.269
 everywhere will the övp 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:51.149
 you participate 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:54.179
 Listen to how much oil wants now 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:56.679
 That saves time at Hertha 

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:59.679
 I, we 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:03.919
 Picture Neumann had been 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.569
 the rebels would have 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.169
 4 percent 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:15.269
 for other models whose pictures m 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.549
 ibbenbüren 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.569
 can have 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.609
 109 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.609
 No 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.239
 Have names 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:35.059
 Hagen 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:40.929
 to Abbas 

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:43.659
 one more 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.659
 unfortunately I did not get over soon by Larible 

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:52.289
 tired am Waldbröl be parallel 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:57.359
 why am I right for Paul? 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.140
 Altena Irrel 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.140
 because I demand 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:10.939
 but if that is not called the expert also gave miner 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:14.409
 we had it right 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.079
 Dr Euro after 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.289
 instead of 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.879
 there follows 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:24.879
 on 

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:30.780
 but nato-partner points 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.740
 the report puts 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.719
 prompt 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:39.159
 he is 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:40.259
 Colin Edwards 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:43.259
 if necessary, without him 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.340
 only on the axis of the penguins 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.340
 something like that does not belong anymore 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:57.120
 it finally worked 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.930
 a bachelor attacks the galactic but does not adjourn the battery cover 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.689
 I think an adult children who did not think about the way 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:05.979
 he had to go 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.979
 spares no fun 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.379
 where ERC 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:21.159
 Finally 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:23.960
 Contact Dr 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.960
 Sir 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:28.860
 also children 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.860
 I would also prefer to lecture project 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:34.979
 he'll get it soon 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.770
 the more 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.770
 unique 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.639
 he has me today too 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:48.650
 Huckarde 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.650
 Conti shared Göttingen 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.130
 after 1 no dear 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.869
 frequently 

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:04.049
 in st old enough to do the same in the future 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.490
 he fits APA 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.419
 But he does not wait any longer 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:13.129
 so can ounces 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.129
 therefore no wig can 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.930
 However, he sets no stone 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:24.669
 wa 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.029
 correct is already very curious 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:30.139
 he 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:31.490
 he 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.490
 rtr 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.610
 yes 1 No the team 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.219
 according to «picture» 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:44.219
 Abel is there for the entitlements can vary 

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:49.969
 Hochtief often does not have time anymore 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:52.149
 on the open road 

00:06:52.149 --> 00:06:56.289
 I'm afraid of no children and I'm not quite the start 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.240
 Prof 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.740
 He also 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.080
 St

 Dr 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.990
 but can believe 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.719
 This is 

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:20.719
 the authorized officer is a bit of a guide 

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:24.020
 Kurth 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.460
 Ing 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.869
 he has a tactical approach 

00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:30.129
 verily 

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:32.930
 that is not boring 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.309
 He is really wanting 

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:38.729
 everyone is interested 

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:40.550
 not and if so 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:41.550
 Mühlacker 

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:48.169
 not red and beige Book of Duty No no other posters 

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.569
 he also rtr head 

00:07:53.569 --> 00:07:56.569
 packed up 

00:07:58.189 --> 00:08:00.860
 I do not care 

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.860
 No No I do not know a majority 

00:08:05.599 --> 00:08:08.809
 that the guys have all gears FDP and Greens 

00:08:09.809 --> 00:08:11.169
 he is because of 

00:08:11.169 --> 00:08:14.030
 Astra 3b and could not succeed too well 

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.050
 and I still am so far 

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:16.960
 give no
