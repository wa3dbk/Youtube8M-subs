00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.560
 hello friends this is my first video I 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.779
 I encouraged him to do it since he had a fish 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.820
 Sick of fins and ran me 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.559
 treatment so excellent that only 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.590
 I had to do a treatment of three 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.480
 days so that my fish will recover good 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.490
 First of all I explain to you that there 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.010
 different ways by which a fish 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.189
 can be sick of fins two 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.810
 examples can be these for the quality 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.730
 of aquarium water since it can 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.830
 develop a type disease 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.379
 bacterial that causes the rot of 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.109
 the fins can also be for 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.389
 bites from other fish so I get married 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:40.030
 that a convict almost killed a fish or 

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:42.339
 Oscar and he ate all the fins on 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.739
 first step is to note that case 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.839
 try either for the quality of the water or 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.600
 that another inhabitant of the aquarium is the 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.729
 I will explain them to you with my 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.589
 experience how to heal bites and not 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.019
 I'll get more involved in the water issue 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.510
 that can be too complicated 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.220
 the first thing to do is see what fish 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.200
 is the one that bothers the other and separate them 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.180
 to treat the sick fish you have to 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.790
 prepare a separate container 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.070
 it can be in your quarantine aquarium I 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.560
 I do not have a quarantine aquarium, so 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.140
 occupy a tupper and it's easier that way 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.130
 you put the tupper inside the aquarium and 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.100
 You put 50% of aquarium water and 50% of 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.870
 new water without chlorine leaves a few minutes 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.030
 Take the same temperature 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.850
 aquarium and we proceed to medicate the water 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.190
 of the tupper the container that I occupy 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.560
 grab an approximate one gallon so 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.680
 I put half a spoonful of salt not of the 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.869
 fine but one that is thicker 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.690
 also add 5 ml of natural extract 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.910
 of aloe or aloe is the same plant but 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.610
 in my country we say aloe finally 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.040
 we keep adding 3 drops of blue 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.420
 methylene you mix it well to that 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.970
 dissolve everything in the water and 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.640
 carefully you pass the sick fish to the 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.610
 tupper and leave it there for about 15 or 20 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.710
 minutes and return it to the aquarium repeats 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.320
 this treatment three days in a row and 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.750
 you will see the results if your fish does not have 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.970
 improvement after three days awaits the fourth 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.340
 day without medication and start over 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.790
 treatment on the fifth day and it's safe 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.700
 that the fish will improve notes be careful 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.770
 the fish do not jump the container 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.810
 amount of medication may vary 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.660
 according to the criteria of the water list but 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.910
 it worked for me, thank you very much for 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.910
