00:00:00.511 --> 00:00:05.511
 It is how to make the part to be attached to the top of the ceiling thread 

00:00:06.641 --> 00:00:15.641
 Fold the PE in half and tie the figure eight. 

00:00:29.164 --> 00:00:38.164
 Then mark the wool in the manner of imprecise. 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.300
 Pull the PE line and send the knot to the mark side. 

00:01:08.847 --> 00:01:17.847
 I make a round knot to prevent the mark from moving. 

00:01:25.938 --> 00:01:30.938
 I will tighten it slowly. 

00:01:36.247 --> 00:01:41.247
 I will cut off the remaining mark. 

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:53.559
 Cut the extra PE line and bake the end with a lighter. 

00:02:06.618 --> 00:02:15.618
 Unfixed turn the PE line twice on the ear and stop. 

00:02:19.204 --> 00:02:28.204
 When removing it, you can easily remove it by pulling the mark.
