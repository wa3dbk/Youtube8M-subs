hydro I want to answer a quick question

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.910 
hydro I want to answer a quick question
about<00:00:15.299> different<00:00:16.049> temperatures<00:00:16.529> than<00:00:16.800> this

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
about different temperatures than this

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.720 
about different temperatures than this
maker<00:00:17.190> can<00:00:17.460> run<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.660> got<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> email<00:00:20.039> from<00:00:20.609> a

maker can run in I got a email from a

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.109 
maker can run in I got a email from a
sculptor<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.330> California<00:00:22.080> he's<00:00:22.260> asking<00:00:23.119> what

temperatures in this maker can run at
hello<00:00:26.220> how<00:00:26.580> high<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.420> if<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.439> fog<00:00:28.980> will<00:00:29.400> climb

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
hello how high and if the fog will climb

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.049 
hello how high and if the fog will climb
out<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.900> twelve<00:00:31.439> by<00:00:31.710> twelve<00:00:31.740> by<00:00:32.460> twelve<00:00:32.489> inch

box<00:00:33.620> to<00:00:34.620> answer<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.010> question<00:00:35.190> yeah<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.239> will

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
box to answer that question yeah it will

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.139 
box to answer that question yeah it will
the<00:00:38.360> mild<00:00:39.360> boil<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.170> water<00:00:40.730> will<00:00:41.730> create

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
the mild boil of the water will create

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.900 
the mild boil of the water will create
enough<00:00:42.629> turbulence<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.440> air<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:44.010> push<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
enough turbulence in the air to push the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.270 
enough turbulence in the air to push the
fog<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.719> lift<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.200> up<00:00:46.379> out<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.800> box<00:00:47.010> that

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
fog and lift it up out of a box that

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.610 
fog and lift it up out of a box that
size<00:00:47.690> it<00:00:48.690> will<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.870> much<00:00:49.050> heavier<00:00:49.410> at<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
size it will be much heavier at the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.310 
size it will be much heavier at the
bottom<00:00:50.039> thinner<00:00:51.030> at<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.239> top<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:51.690> it'll<00:00:51.960> loft

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
bottom thinner at the top but it'll loft

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.650 
bottom thinner at the top but it'll loft
over<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.890> top<00:00:53.100> when<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.910> runs<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:57.239> water

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
over the top when it runs so the water

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.060 
over the top when it runs so the water
temperatures<00:00:58.199> they<00:00:58.469> go<00:00:58.680> from<00:01:00.170> 22<00:01:01.170> degrees

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
temperatures they go from 22 degrees

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.460 
temperatures they go from 22 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.699> believe<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.870> hundred<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
Fahrenheit I believe to a hundred and

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.530 
Fahrenheit I believe to a hundred and
forty<00:01:04.890> some<00:01:05.100> degrees<00:01:05.580> Fahrenheit<00:01:06.090> you'll<00:01:06.360> see

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
forty some degrees Fahrenheit you'll see

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.289 
forty some degrees Fahrenheit you'll see
in<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> video<00:01:07.549> what<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.580> found<00:01:08.850> though<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.510> that

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
in the video what I found though is that

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.719 
in the video what I found though is that
the<00:01:12.299> mist<00:01:12.540> output<00:01:13.020> at<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> low<00:01:13.830> temperature<00:01:13.860> is

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
the mist output at a low temperature is

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.770 
the mist output at a low temperature is
greatly<00:01:15.920> diminished<00:01:16.920> versus<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.850> higher

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
greatly diminished versus the the higher

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.490 
greatly diminished versus the the higher
water<00:01:19.080> temperatures<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:20.509> my<00:01:21.509> personal<00:01:22.049> opinion

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
water temperatures I my personal opinion

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.910 
water temperatures I my personal opinion
is<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:25.439> denser

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
is that this is because the the denser

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.670 
is that this is because the the denser
water<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.119> molecules<00:01:27.600> molecules<00:01:28.140> are

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
water that the molecules molecules are

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.560 
water that the molecules molecules are
tighter<00:01:28.920> together<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.880> harder<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
tighter together and it's harder for the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.420 
tighter together and it's harder for the
ultrasonic<00:01:31.409> vibrations<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.780> blow<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
ultrasonic vibrations to blow the

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.630 
ultrasonic vibrations to blow the
molecules<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.670> water<00:01:35.880> off<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.210> surface

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
molecules of the water off the surface

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.850 
molecules of the water off the surface
with<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.820> with<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.299> hotter<00:01:39.479> water<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
with the with the hotter water and the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.560 
with the with the hotter water and the
molecules<00:01:41.310> are<00:01:41.460> much<00:01:41.579> more<00:01:41.820> expanded<00:01:42.210> that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
molecules are much more expanded that

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.800 
molecules are much more expanded that
the<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:43.409> waters<00:01:43.850> softer<00:01:44.850> lighter<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.600> say

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the the waters softer lighter to say

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.609 
the the waters softer lighter to say
less<00:01:46.110> dense<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.520> lot<00:01:47.670> easier<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.619> blow

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
less dense and it's a lot easier to blow

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.819 
less dense and it's a lot easier to blow
those<00:01:50.210> those<00:01:51.210> mist<00:01:51.750> particles<00:01:52.409> off<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
those those mist particles off the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.289 
those those mist particles off the
surface<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.430> water<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.909> think<00:01:53.970> that's

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
surface of the water and I think that's

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.240 
surface of the water and I think that's
why<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.720> more<00:01:54.930> aggressive<00:01:55.229> boil<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.219> a

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
why it's a more aggressive boil and a

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.359 
why it's a more aggressive boil and a
louder<00:01:57.180> boil<00:01:57.649> it<00:01:58.649> just<00:01:58.829> breaks<00:01:59.100> through<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
louder boil it just breaks through the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.480 
louder boil it just breaks through the
surface<00:01:59.520> easier<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.380> puts<00:02:01.619> out<00:02:01.770> probably<00:02:02.219> two

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
surface easier and puts out probably two

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.149 
surface easier and puts out probably two
three<00:02:02.850> times<00:02:03.149> as<00:02:03.450> much<00:02:03.600> fog<00:02:03.960> as<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
three times as much fog as the the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.340 
three times as much fog as the the
colder<00:02:05.490> temperatures<00:02:06.000> do<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:07.229> anyway<00:02:07.649> enjoy

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
colder temperatures do so anyway enjoy

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.890 
colder temperatures do so anyway enjoy

hydro<00:02:11.290> calm<00:02:13.890> alright<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.100> now<00:02:15.220> let's<00:02:15.250> check

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
hydro calm alright so now let's check

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.090 
hydro calm alright so now let's check
out<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.820> cold<00:02:16.180> water

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
out the cold water

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.590 
out the cold water
we've<00:02:18.100> got<00:02:18.310> about<00:02:19.180> 46<00:02:19.990> 47<00:02:20.530> degrees<00:02:21.180> which<00:02:22.180> I'm

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
we've got about 46 47 degrees which I'm

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.810 
we've got about 46 47 degrees which I'm
going<00:02:22.750> to<00:02:22.840> call<00:02:23.020> close<00:02:23.320> enough<00:02:23.620> to<00:02:23.800> 41<00:02:24.400> it's

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
going to call close enough to 41 it's

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:37.050 
going to call close enough to 41 it's
the<00:02:25.000> low<00:02:25.150> end<00:02:33.270> so<00:02:34.270> you<00:02:34.330> can<00:02:34.420> see<00:02:35.220> it's<00:02:36.220> greatly

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
the low end so you can see it's greatly

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.290 
the low end so you can see it's greatly
reduced<00:02:37.540> fog<00:02:37.810> output<00:02:38.550> with<00:02:39.550> colder<00:02:40.030> water<00:02:40.300> and

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
reduced fog output with colder water and

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.880 
reduced fog output with colder water and
I'm<00:02:43.300> going<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.510> say<00:02:43.720> it's<00:02:43.930> probably<00:02:44.350> because

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
I'm going to say it's probably because

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.250 
I'm going to say it's probably because
of<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.480> density<00:02:46.480> of<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.720> water<00:02:46.900> when<00:02:47.170> the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
of the density of the water when the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.710 
of the density of the water when the
water<00:02:47.290> is<00:02:47.590> colder<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.300> molecules<00:02:49.300> are<00:02:49.510> closer

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
water is colder the molecules are closer

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.800 
water is colder the molecules are closer
together<00:02:49.960> and<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:50.380> have<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.560> much<00:02:50.800> denser

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
together and you have a much denser

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.730 
together and you have a much denser
liquid<00:02:52.810> than<00:02:53.410> you<00:02:53.560> would<00:02:53.740> with<00:02:53.860> hot<00:02:54.100> water<00:02:55.740> so

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
liquid than you would with hot water so

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.150 
liquid than you would with hot water so
my<00:02:57.250> guess<00:02:57.520> is<00:02:58.140> when<00:02:59.140> we<00:02:59.290> switch<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.710> hot<00:02:59.890> water

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
my guess is when we switch the hot water

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.200 
my guess is when we switch the hot water
here<00:03:02.250> we're<00:03:03.250> going<00:03:03.370> to<00:03:03.460> end<00:03:03.580> up<00:03:03.640> having<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.060> much

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
here we're going to end up having a much

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.920 
here we're going to end up having a much
heavier<00:03:04.690> reaction

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.750 

all<00:03:08.469> right<00:03:08.650> so<00:03:08.859> we're<00:03:09.040> at<00:03:09.700> about<00:03:10.049> 120<00:03:11.049> for<00:03:11.760> 126

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
all right so we're at about 120 for 126

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.149 
all right so we're at about 120 for 126
somewhere<00:03:13.359> in<00:03:13.480> there<00:03:13.689> which<00:03:14.469> is<00:03:14.650> pretty<00:03:14.859> close

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
somewhere in there which is pretty close

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.729 
somewhere in there which is pretty close
to<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.849> top<00:03:16.390> end<00:03:16.629> of<00:03:16.840> our<00:03:17.219> range<00:03:19.590> let's<00:03:20.590> see

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
to the top end of our range let's see

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:29.050 
to the top end of our range let's see
what<00:03:20.890> happens

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.490 

so<00:03:29.660> it<00:03:29.780> actually<00:03:30.200> has<00:03:30.440> a<00:03:30.670> much<00:03:31.670> louder<00:03:32.060> and

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
so it actually has a much louder and

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.610 
so it actually has a much louder and
more<00:03:33.500> aggressive<00:03:34.130> boil<00:03:35.120> than<00:03:36.020> with<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.380> cold

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
more aggressive boil than with the cold

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.530 
more aggressive boil than with the cold
water<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.300> it's<00:03:38.300> producing<00:03:38.900> probably<00:03:40.540> twice

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
water and it's producing probably twice

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:53.530 
water and it's producing probably twice
as<00:03:41.810> much<00:03:42.050> fog<00:03:42.910> if<00:03:43.910> not<00:03:44.270> three<00:03:44.569> times<00:03:52.270> so<00:03:53.270> that's

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
as much fog if not three times so that's

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.440 
as much fog if not three times so that's
it<00:03:53.750> that's<00:03:53.930> what<00:03:54.080> happens<00:03:55.090> hot<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.239> cold

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
it that's what happens hot and cold

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.140 
it that's what happens hot and cold
