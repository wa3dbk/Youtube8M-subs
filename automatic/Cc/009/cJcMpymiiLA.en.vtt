but it has some issues so I'll talk

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.920 
but it has some issues so I'll talk
about<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:20.000> first<00:00:21.000> when<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.330> take<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.539> look<00:00:21.720> at

about it first when you take a look at

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.840 
about it first when you take a look at
it<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.199> notice<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.920> build<00:00:23.160> quality<00:00:23.310> is

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
it you notice that the build quality is

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.200 
it you notice that the build quality is
really<00:00:24.539> high<00:00:24.949> it<00:00:25.949> looks<00:00:26.250> good<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.180> feels

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
really high it looks good and it feels

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.340 
really high it looks good and it feels
good<00:00:28.189> it's<00:00:29.189> very<00:00:29.730> thin<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.279> reasonably<00:00:32.279> light

good it's very thin and reasonably light

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.280 
good it's very thin and reasonably light
and<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.680> side<00:00:34.950> we've<00:00:35.219> got<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:36.149> card<00:00:36.960> reader

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
and on this side we've got a card reader

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.520 
and on this side we've got a card reader
two<00:00:38.250> USBs<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.270> power<00:00:39.660> supply<00:00:40.020> connector

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
and over here we've got ethernet

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.580

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
also over here there is a quick recovery

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.760 
also over here there is a quick recovery
button<00:00:55.760> so<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.149> build<00:00:57.360> quality<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:58.020> really

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
button so the build quality is really

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.330 
button so the build quality is really
good<00:00:59.480> inside<00:01:00.480> there's<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.809> fourth<00:01:01.140> gen<00:01:01.350> core<00:01:01.829> i5

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
good inside there's a fourth gen core i5

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.260 
good inside there's a fourth gen core i5

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
you want to upgrade you need to open up

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.679 
you want to upgrade you need to open up
the<00:01:13.020> whole<00:01:13.140> laptop<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.150> this<00:01:15.150> may<00:01:15.360> void<00:01:15.659> your

the whole laptop so this may void your
warranty<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:17.130> want<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.369> pay

warranty so you you want to pay

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.390 
warranty so you you want to pay
attention<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.290> anyway<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.470> think<00:01:19.860> most

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
attention to that anyway I think most

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.340 
attention to that anyway I think most
people<00:01:20.610> will<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.030> perfectly<00:01:21.630> fine<00:01:21.869> with<00:01:22.110> four

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
people will be perfectly fine with four

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.600 
people will be perfectly fine with four
gigs<00:01:22.590> um<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:24.299> comes<00:01:24.540> with<00:01:24.979> Windows<00:01:25.979> 8<00:01:27.680> as<00:01:28.680> you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
gigs um it comes with Windows 8 as you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.490 
gigs um it comes with Windows 8 as you
can<00:01:29.790> see<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.000> installed<00:01:30.540> Linux<00:01:30.689> because<00:01:31.290> I

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
can see I installed Linux because I

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.469 
can see I installed Linux because I
didn't<00:01:31.920> really<00:01:32.070> like<00:01:32.220> Windows<00:01:32.640> 8<00:01:32.850> I'm<00:01:33.150> still

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
didn't really like Windows 8 I'm still

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.420 
didn't really like Windows 8 I'm still
keeping<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:34.020> on<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> laptop<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:34.950> I'm<00:01:35.130> mostly

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
keeping it on the laptop but I'm mostly

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.190 
keeping it on the laptop but I'm mostly
using<00:01:35.790> Linux<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:36.450> that's<00:01:36.689> why<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.869> uninstalled

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
using Linux so that's why I uninstalled

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.889 
using Linux so that's why I uninstalled
it<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:40.409> screen<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.220> screen<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.670> nice

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
it and and the screen the screen is nice

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.899 
it and and the screen the screen is nice
it's<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.710> glossy<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.460> you'll<00:01:44.700> see<00:01:44.880> some

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
it's it's glossy so you'll see some

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.460 
it's it's glossy so you'll see some
reflection<00:01:45.600> especially<00:01:46.170> when<00:01:46.320> you're

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
reflection especially when you're

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.080 
reflection especially when you're
working<00:01:46.590> outside<00:01:47.329> but<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.570> resolution<00:01:48.899> is

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
working outside but the resolution is

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.179 
working outside but the resolution is
1440<00:01:51.090> by<00:01:51.119> 900<00:01:51.540> pixels<00:01:51.869> which<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.619> pretty<00:01:52.979> good

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
1440 by 900 pixels which is pretty good

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.300 
1440 by 900 pixels which is pretty good
and<00:01:53.600> also<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> touch<00:01:55.290> screen<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.890> can

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
and also it is a touch screen so you can

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:04.760 
and also it is a touch screen so you can
control<00:01:57.890> control<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> laptop<00:01:59.369> by<00:01:59.490> touch<00:02:03.560> so

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
control control a laptop by touch so

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.219 
control control a laptop by touch so
this<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.520> really<00:02:05.729> nice<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.240> as<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.810> was<00:02:06.990> playing

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
this is really nice but as I was playing

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.990 
this is really nice but as I was playing
with<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.710> kind<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.039> came<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.369> conclusion

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
with it I kind of came to the conclusion

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.639 
with it I kind of came to the conclusion
that<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.179> will<00:02:09.420> not<00:02:09.599> use<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.810> much<00:02:10.110> because

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
that I will not use it much because

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.430 
that I will not use it much because
touching<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.489> screen<00:02:11.819> these<00:02:12.569> fingerprints

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
touching the screen these fingerprints

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.790 
touching the screen these fingerprints
and<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:13.890> just<00:02:14.160> really<00:02:14.400> hate<00:02:14.580> cleaning<00:02:14.940> screens

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
and I just really hate cleaning screens

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.369 
and I just really hate cleaning screens
and<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.790> guess<00:02:18.090> Apple<00:02:18.540> had<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:18.720> good<00:02:19.050> reason

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
and so I guess Apple had a good reason

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.770 
and so I guess Apple had a good reason
for<00:02:19.410> not<00:02:19.920> putting<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.760> touchscreens<00:02:21.450> into

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
for not putting the touchscreens into

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.920 
for not putting the touchscreens into
their<00:02:21.930> laptops<00:02:23.299> so<00:02:24.299> max<00:02:24.510> there's<00:02:24.750> the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
their laptops so max there's the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.800 
their laptops so max there's the
keyboard<00:02:25.549> the<00:02:26.549> keyboard<00:02:26.760> feels<00:02:27.209> pretty<00:02:27.569> good

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
keyboard the keyboard feels pretty good

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.449 
keyboard the keyboard feels pretty good
it's<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:29.060> it's<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.360> bit<00:02:30.540> shallow<00:02:30.870> but<00:02:31.260> it's<00:02:32.220> just

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
it's a it's a bit shallow but it's just

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.570 
it's a it's a bit shallow but it's just
a<00:02:32.640> matter<00:02:32.849> of<00:02:32.970> time<00:02:33.239> until<00:02:33.269> I<00:02:33.599> get<00:02:33.810> used<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.140> it

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
a matter of time until I get used to it

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.339 
a matter of time until I get used to it
also<00:02:35.580> I<00:02:35.610> like<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.090> lay<00:02:36.569> out<00:02:36.720> on<00:02:36.959> my<00:02:37.110> previous

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
also I like to lay out on my previous

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.199 
also I like to lay out on my previous
left<00:02:37.769> of<00:02:37.980> better<00:02:38.220> but<00:02:38.519> again<00:02:38.760> that's

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
left of better but again that's

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.280 
left of better but again that's
something<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.840> can<00:02:40.049> get<00:02:40.170> used<00:02:40.349> to<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.930> the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
something I can get used to the the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.500 
something I can get used to the the
touch<00:02:43.590> bed<00:02:43.829> is<00:02:44.010> very<00:02:44.069> nice<00:02:44.400> it's<00:02:45.060> really<00:02:45.299> big

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
touch bed is very nice it's really big

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.880 
touch bed is very nice it's really big
so<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:45.810> like<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.590> like<00:02:46.799> that<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:48.590> even<00:02:49.590> though<00:02:49.739> in

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
so I like I like that and even though in

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.130 
so I like I like that and even though in
Linux<00:02:50.160> it's<00:02:50.370> kind<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.670> harder<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.209> use<00:02:51.599> it<00:02:51.959> done

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
Linux it's kind of harder to use it done

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.809 
Linux it's kind of harder to use it done
in<00:02:52.319> compared<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:52.980> Windows<00:02:53.280> because<00:02:53.549> in

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
in compared to Windows because in

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.270 
in compared to Windows because in
Windows<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.299> virus<00:02:54.690> is<00:02:55.200> much<00:02:55.440> better<00:02:55.680> and

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
Windows that virus is much better and

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.250 
Windows that virus is much better and
Windows<00:02:56.610> you<00:02:56.849> can<00:02:56.940> do<00:02:57.209> multi<00:02:57.660> temps<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.110> all

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
Windows you can do multi temps and all

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.400 
Windows you can do multi temps and all
kinds<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.680> other<00:02:58.860> things<00:02:59.630> so<00:03:00.630> far<00:03:00.900> this<00:03:01.110> is<00:03:01.170> not

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
kinds of other things so far this is not

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.170 
kinds of other things so far this is not
supported<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.099> Linux<00:03:02.690> mmm<00:03:05.000> also<00:03:06.000> what<00:03:06.150> I

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
supported in Linux mmm also what I

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.119 
supported in Linux mmm also what I
forget<00:03:06.540> to<00:03:06.720> say<00:03:06.959> is<00:03:07.140> that<00:03:07.349> the<00:03:07.440> keyboard<00:03:07.950> is

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
forget to say is that the keyboard is

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.170 
forget to say is that the keyboard is
backlit<00:03:08.610> which<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.720> always<00:03:09.930> nice<00:03:10.700> the<00:03:11.700> problem

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
backlit which is always nice the problem

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.569 
backlit which is always nice the problem
with<00:03:12.269> this<00:03:12.450> laptop<00:03:12.690> is<00:03:13.139> the<00:03:13.319> Wi-Fi<00:03:14.069> because

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
with this laptop is the Wi-Fi because

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.699 
with this laptop is the Wi-Fi because
the<00:03:15.090> wireless<00:03:15.420> performance<00:03:15.630> is<00:03:16.200> just<00:03:16.410> really

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
the wireless performance is just really

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.300 
the wireless performance is just really
really<00:03:16.859> poor<00:03:18.380> when<00:03:19.380> I'm<00:03:19.500> close<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:20.069> router

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
really poor when I'm close to the router

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.940 
really poor when I'm close to the router
it<00:03:20.639> works<00:03:20.880> fine<00:03:21.239> but<00:03:21.750> once<00:03:22.049> I<00:03:22.200> get<00:03:22.350> far<00:03:22.590> away

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
it works fine but once I get far away

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.039 
it works fine but once I get far away
the<00:03:23.280> quality<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.299> signal<00:03:24.480> goes<00:03:24.810> down

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
the quality of the signal goes down

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.180 
the quality of the signal goes down
quickly<00:03:25.319> and<00:03:25.769> I<00:03:27.109> compared<00:03:28.109> it<00:03:28.290> with<00:03:28.799> multiple

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
quickly and I compared it with multiple

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.550 
quickly and I compared it with multiple
devices<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.359> it<00:03:30.569> turns<00:03:30.810> out<00:03:31.019> that<00:03:31.170> even<00:03:31.380> my

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
devices and it turns out that even my

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.400 
devices and it turns out that even my
Android<00:03:32.010> phone<00:03:32.310> has<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:32.970> better<00:03:33.870> wireless

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
Android phone has a better wireless

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.620 
Android phone has a better wireless
performance<00:03:34.620> than<00:03:35.190> its<00:03:35.400> laptops<00:03:35.849> so<00:03:36.209> clearly

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
performance than its laptops so clearly

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.289 
performance than its laptops so clearly
there's<00:03:37.109> something<00:03:37.560> wrong<00:03:37.739> and<00:03:38.220> it's<00:03:39.000> not

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
there's something wrong and it's not

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.180 
there's something wrong and it's not
about<00:03:39.480> the<00:03:39.720> operating<00:03:40.109> system<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.739> works<00:03:40.889> as

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
about the operating system it works as

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.199 
about the operating system it works as
bad<00:03:41.489> in<00:03:41.670> Linux<00:03:41.970> as<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.299> works<00:03:42.569> in<00:03:42.840> Windows<00:03:43.819> so<00:03:44.819> I

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
bad in Linux as it works in Windows so I

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.449 
bad in Linux as it works in Windows so I
kind<00:03:45.959> of<00:03:46.079> think<00:03:46.319> that<00:03:46.440> there<00:03:46.650> is<00:03:46.769> a<00:03:46.799> hardware

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
kind of think that there is a hardware

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.420 
kind of think that there is a hardware
problem<00:03:47.519> with<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.299> Wi-Fi<00:03:48.780> adapter<00:03:49.260> but<00:03:49.919> it's

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
problem with the Wi-Fi adapter but it's

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.240 
problem with the Wi-Fi adapter but it's
hard<00:03:50.819> to<00:03:50.880> say<00:03:51.470> one<00:03:52.470> thing<00:03:52.500> I<00:03:52.859> know<00:03:52.919> for<00:03:53.190> sure

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
hard to say one thing I know for sure

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.960 
hard to say one thing I know for sure
the<00:03:54.120> Wi-Fi<00:03:54.739> quality<00:03:55.739> the<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.609> Wi-Fi

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
the Wi-Fi quality the the Wi-Fi

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.690 
the Wi-Fi quality the the Wi-Fi
performance<00:03:57.150> is<00:03:57.630> just<00:03:57.840> bad<00:03:58.019> so<00:03:58.650> for<00:03:59.519> this

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
performance is just bad so for this

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.330 
performance is just bad so for this
reason<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.389> would<00:04:00.599> not<00:04:01.049> recommend<00:04:01.470> buying<00:04:02.069> this

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
reason I would not recommend buying this

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.819 
reason I would not recommend buying this
laptop<00:04:02.579> at<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.000> moment<00:04:03.510> so<00:04:03.810> that's<00:04:04.349> it<00:04:04.530> thanks

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
laptop at the moment so that's it thanks
