it simulates football not just with

it simulates football not just with
numbers<00:03:01.010> but<00:03:01.640> also<00:03:01.910> how<00:03:02.330> it<00:03:02.570> articulates<00:03:03.260> it

that<00:03:29.510> NBA<00:03:29.810> 2k<00:03:30.290> gets<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.650> handle<00:03:31.070> on<00:03:31.220> that<00:03:31.400> it's

that NBA 2k gets a handle on that it's

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.720 
that NBA 2k gets a handle on that it's
still<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.030> great<00:03:32.330> game<00:03:32.630> of<00:03:32.900> course<00:03:33.380> but<00:03:34.130> as<00:03:34.340> you

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
still a great game of course but as you

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.030 
still a great game of course but as you
look<00:03:34.760> at<00:03:35.209> just<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:35.720> animation<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:36.709> this<00:03:36.860> is

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
look at just the animation and this is

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.880 
look at just the animation and this is
just<00:03:37.190> one<00:03:37.510> very<00:03:38.510> small<00:03:38.690> snippet<00:03:39.590> of<00:03:39.709> an

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
just one very small snippet of an

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.430 
just one very small snippet of an
animation<00:03:40.310> let<00:03:40.970> alone<00:03:41.209> a<00:03:41.270> very<00:03:41.600> small<00:03:41.959> snippet

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
animation let alone a very small snippet

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.220 
animation let alone a very small snippet
of<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.950> overall<00:03:43.400> game<00:03:43.910> I<00:03:44.270> mean<00:03:44.660> Joe<00:03:44.900> Montana

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
of the overall game I mean Joe Montana

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.690 
of the overall game I mean Joe Montana
16<00:03:46.040> it's<00:03:46.520> just<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.120> test<00:03:47.480> in<00:03:47.780> just<00:03:48.530> one<00:03:48.830> mo<00:03:49.400> cap

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
16 it's just a test in just one mo cap

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.020 
16 it's just a test in just one mo cap
session<00:03:50.150> it<00:03:50.270> really<00:03:50.600> depends<00:03:51.350> on<00:03:51.500> how<00:03:51.650> they

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
session it really depends on how they

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.030 
session it really depends on how they
transition<00:03:53.030> animations<00:03:53.810> it<00:03:54.110> really<00:03:54.650> depends

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
transition animations it really depends

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.250 
transition animations it really depends
if<00:03:55.220> they<00:03:55.340> have<00:03:55.520> real-time<00:03:56.060> physics<00:03:56.780> or<00:03:56.900> not<00:03:57.080> it

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
if they have real-time physics or not it

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.430 
if they have real-time physics or not it
depends<00:03:58.190> on<00:03:58.340> how<00:03:58.550> the<00:03:58.610> gameplay<00:03:59.420> is<00:03:59.750> but<00:04:00.260> we're

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
depends on how the gameplay is but we're

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.740 
depends on how the gameplay is but we're
just<00:04:00.680> looking<00:04:00.950> at<00:04:01.070> this<00:04:01.220> one<00:04:01.670> small<00:04:02.239> snippet

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
just looking at this one small snippet

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.449 
just looking at this one small snippet
really<00:04:03.170> that<00:04:03.350> like<00:04:03.530> I<00:04:03.650> said<00:04:03.860> this<00:04:03.980> is<00:04:04.040> just<00:04:04.370> a

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
really that like I said this is just a

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.420 
really that like I said this is just a
pre<00:04:05.620> comparing<00:04:06.620> if<00:04:06.860> you<00:04:07.430> will<00:04:07.640> nothing<00:04:08.420> to

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
pre comparing if you will nothing to

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.030 
pre comparing if you will nothing to
substantial<00:04:10.430> here<00:04:10.730> except<00:04:11.600> for<00:04:11.630> what<00:04:12.620> could

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
substantial here except for what could

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.300 
substantial here except for what could
be<00:04:13.100> and<00:04:13.959> for<00:04:14.959> right<00:04:15.170> now<00:04:15.200> what<00:04:15.739> could<00:04:15.950> be<00:04:16.160> if

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
be and for right now what could be if

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.000 
be and for right now what could be if
you<00:04:16.430> just<00:04:16.669> look<00:04:16.850> at<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.180> animation<00:04:18.010> details

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
you just look at the animation details

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.750 
you just look at the animation details
the<00:04:19.850> small<00:04:20.269> details<00:04:20.570> of<00:04:21.260> this<00:04:21.739> new<00:04:21.979> unreal<00:04:22.460> 4

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
the small details of this new unreal 4

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.180 
the small details of this new unreal 4
engine<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:23.780> type<00:04:24.050> of<00:04:24.100> animations<00:04:25.100> that

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
engine the the type of animations that

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.290 
engine the the type of animations that
it<00:04:25.700> can<00:04:26.630> capture<00:04:27.229> is<00:04:27.910> astounding<00:04:28.910> if<00:04:29.030> you<00:04:29.120> look

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
it can capture is astounding if you look

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.909 
it can capture is astounding if you look
at<00:04:29.450> the<00:04:29.570> details<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.110> that's<00:04:30.320> why<00:04:30.470> I<00:04:30.530> put<00:04:30.800> it

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
at the details and that's why I put it

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.430 
at the details and that's why I put it
on<00:04:31.040> slow<00:04:31.640> motion<00:04:32.060> for<00:04:32.240> you<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:32.600> this<00:04:33.110> is<00:04:33.169> why

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
on slow motion for you and this is why

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.620 
on slow motion for you and this is why
I'm<00:04:33.560> really<00:04:33.800> comparing<00:04:34.310> it<00:04:34.430> to<00:04:34.610> Matt<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.479> what

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
I'm really comparing it to Matt and what

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.850 
I'm really comparing it to Matt and what
a<00:04:35.660> mad<00:04:36.320> ins<00:04:36.590> and<00:04:36.890> this<00:04:37.520> is<00:04:37.729> going<00:04:38.300> on<00:04:38.419> forever

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
a mad ins and this is going on forever

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.560 
a mad ins and this is going on forever
one<00:04:39.860> of<00:04:40.010> Madden's<00:04:40.400> hugest<00:04:41.300> issues<00:04:41.960> are

one of Madden's hugest issues are

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.480 
one of Madden's hugest issues are
animation<00:04:44.570> quantity<00:04:45.460> animation<00:04:46.460> quality<00:04:47.000> and

splicing of animations that's

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.320 
splicing of animations that's
transitional<00:04:51.350> animations<00:04:52.010> that's<00:04:52.550> just<00:04:52.880> one

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
transitional animations that's just one

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.200 
transitional animations that's just one
of<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.630> many<00:04:54.110> issues<00:04:54.680> with<00:04:55.220> madden<00:04:56.000> as<00:04:56.150> a

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
series the animations so I just wanted

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.380 
series the animations so I just wanted
just<00:05:00.320> to<00:05:00.380> show<00:05:00.590> this<00:05:00.770> real<00:05:01.040> quick<00:05:01.340> I<00:05:01.610> want<00:05:02.300> you
