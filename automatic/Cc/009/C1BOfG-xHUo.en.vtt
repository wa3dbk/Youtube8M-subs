00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.110
 all the digital germany machine live with a cable like this we just go to 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:22.480
 you now 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.210
 which is a collection cable 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.689
 She is afraid of two tips. 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.929
 one that goes in your machine 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.769
 which is always smaller 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.560
 and a larger one that is a tip or to receive 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.500
 what goes on the computer 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.070

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.460
 that are in front of your computer if he is younger 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.640
 If you're old, fine. 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.470
 but we 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.000
 nowadays the newer computers have inputs back and forth 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.770
 there you choose where you want to connect one is available to you 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.130
 make collection download usb 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.100
 then this one points that we are going to look in the machine 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.730
 which indicates lower 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.240
 not only connect the type of victim here on the machine 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:08.760
 plug it in 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.760
 it's important when you make the collection of this cable 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.610
 grandson 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.680

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.110
 the digital machine is turned off 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.180
 the digital machine try to shut down 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.230

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.370
 notebook 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.550
 but now it is connected to a 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.420
 the computer 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.520
 it is already connected to the computer 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.790
 Now we're going to connect the terminal. 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.790
 she is going to call 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.670

 reference to the memory card of the digital machine 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:10.399
 that's why she references 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:12.849
 and disagree
