this year I think Hendrick hasn't quite
hit<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.150> like<00:01:30.299> they<00:01:30.450> thought<00:01:30.630> they<00:01:30.780> would

racetrack they finished third in that
race<00:04:11.880> last<00:04:12.510> year<00:04:12.690> so<00:04:12.989> I<00:04:13.019> think<00:04:13.140> Joey<00:04:13.470> Logano

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
race last year so I think Joey Logano

race last year so I think Joey Logano
has<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.160> best<00:04:14.340> combination<00:04:14.580> of<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.090> guy<00:04:15.239> who's

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480
