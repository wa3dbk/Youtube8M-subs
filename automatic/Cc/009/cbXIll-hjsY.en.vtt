us or make us feel like a failure and

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.099 
us or make us feel like a failure and
it's<00:00:40.430> difficult<00:00:40.969> when<00:00:41.120> you<00:00:41.300> when<00:00:41.750> you<00:00:41.899> don't

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
it's difficult when you when you don't

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:43.720 
it's difficult when you when you don't
feel<00:00:42.620> like<00:00:42.769> you're<00:00:42.890> good<00:00:43.100> at<00:00:43.190> something<00:00:43.370> and

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
feel like you're good at something and

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.430 
feel like you're good at something and
then<00:00:43.879> you<00:00:44.030> don't<00:00:44.239> do<00:00:44.449> well<00:00:44.690> at<00:00:44.719> it<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:45.199> then

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
then you don't do well at it and then

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.169 
then you don't do well at it and then
you<00:00:45.469> don't<00:00:45.829> like<00:00:46.250> it<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:46.609> then<00:00:46.730> it<00:00:46.910> doesn't

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179 
you don't like it and then it doesn't

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:48.970 
you don't like it and then it doesn't
like<00:00:47.300> you<00:00:47.449> back<00:00:47.629> and<00:00:47.660> it's<00:00:47.989> this<00:00:48.170> big<00:00:48.440> cycle

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
like you back and it's this big cycle

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.910 
like you back and it's this big cycle
and<00:00:49.309> whether<00:00:50.300> it<00:00:50.449> be<00:00:50.570> math<00:00:50.870> or<00:00:51.260> anything<00:00:51.559> else

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
and whether it be math or anything else

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.009 
and whether it be math or anything else
it's<00:00:52.129> kind<00:00:52.370> of<00:00:52.429> not<00:00:52.780> something<00:00:53.780> that<00:00:53.870> comes

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
it's kind of not something that comes

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.939 
it's kind of not something that comes
naturally<00:00:54.589> to<00:00:54.620> you<00:00:55.480> it<00:00:56.480> can<00:00:56.690> be<00:00:56.719> difficult

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
naturally to you it can be difficult

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.770 
naturally to you it can be difficult
there<00:00:57.949> are<00:00:58.190> very<00:00:58.550> you<00:00:58.789> know<00:00:58.820> practical<00:00:59.600> ways

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
there are very you know practical ways

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.500 
there are very you know practical ways
to<00:00:59.809> get<00:01:00.379> better<00:01:00.649> at<00:01:00.980> math<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:01.550> they<00:01:02.239> are

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
to get better at math and they are

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.420 
to get better at math and they are
things<00:01:03.170> that<00:01:03.230> you<00:01:03.379> probably<00:01:03.829> already<00:01:04.100> know

really<00:01:27.799> cool<00:01:28.250> way<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.579> jump<00:01:29.420> into<00:01:29.570> somebody

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
really cool way to jump into somebody

to<00:01:57.500> figure<00:01:57.799> out<00:01:57.979> how<00:01:58.369> and<00:01:58.759> if<00:01:59.149> you<00:01:59.270> can<00:01:59.450> start

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
to figure out how and if you can start

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.539 
to figure out how and if you can start
to<00:01:59.990> change<00:02:00.020> some<00:02:00.649> of<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.799> negative<00:02:01.159> thinking

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
to change some of the negative thinking

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.840 
to change some of the negative thinking
and<00:02:01.729> start<00:02:02.509> in<00:02:02.719> some<00:02:03.049> small<00:02:03.350> way<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:03.979> get<00:02:04.159> to

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
and start in some small way to get to

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.999 
and start in some small way to get to
find<00:02:05.119> a<00:02:05.210> way<00:02:05.359> in<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:05.840> math<00:02:06.049> to<00:02:06.439> have<00:02:06.649> it<00:02:06.799> make

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
find a way in the math to have it make

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.249 
find a way in the math to have it make
sense<00:02:07.250> for<00:02:07.520> you<00:02:07.609> to<00:02:07.820> find<00:02:08.390> something<00:02:08.899> about<00:02:08.989> it

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
sense for you to find something about it

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.589 
sense for you to find something about it
you<00:02:09.349> like<00:02:09.530> then<00:02:10.129> you<00:02:10.280> may<00:02:10.550> be<00:02:10.910> able<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.209> kind<00:02:11.510> of
