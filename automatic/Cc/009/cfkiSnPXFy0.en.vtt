00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
you the way I set up of a simple one

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.200 
you the way I set up of a simple one
color<00:01:12.960> as<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.500> see<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.100> already<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.760> my

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
color as you can see I already have my

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.120 
color as you can see I already have my
crosshairs<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:16.049> here<00:01:16.290> I've<00:01:16.439> used<00:01:16.470> them<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.950> few

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
crosshairs on here I've used them a few

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.710 
crosshairs on here I've used them a few
times<00:01:17.310> as<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:17.759> see<00:01:18.030> I've<00:01:18.150> been<00:01:18.270> printing

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
times as you can see I've been printing

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.969 
times as you can see I've been printing
and<00:01:19.430> so<00:01:20.430> my<00:01:20.790> crosshairs<00:01:21.270> are<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.540> here<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.409> make

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
and so my crosshairs are on here I make

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.679 
and so my crosshairs are on here I make
a<00:01:23.009> few<00:01:23.280> up<00:01:23.460> here<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.850> feed<00:01:24.060> down<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.479> because

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
a few up here and feed down here because

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.510 
a few up here and feed down here because
if<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.990> have<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> long<00:01:25.439> design<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.250> use

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
if you have a long design you can use

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.330 
if you have a long design you can use
this<00:01:27.210> entire<00:01:27.630> grid<00:01:28.049> space<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.740> help<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.070> line

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
this entire grid space to help you line

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.130 
this entire grid space to help you line
line<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.180> up<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.509> make<00:01:30.630> sure<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:30.930> centered

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
line it up and make sure it's centered

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.640 
line it up and make sure it's centered
okay<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.880> very<00:01:33.060> simple<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:34.110> first<00:01:34.320> thing

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
okay so it's very simple the first thing

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.249 
okay so it's very simple the first thing
you<00:01:34.799> want<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.130> do<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:36.180> go<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.509> your<00:01:36.659> micro<00:01:37.020> reg

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
you want to do is go to your micro reg

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.530 
you want to do is go to your micro reg
and<00:01:37.560> make<00:01:37.890> sure<00:01:38.130> it's<00:01:38.280> zeroed<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.759> okay<00:01:39.509> so

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
and make sure it's zeroed out okay so

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.600 
and make sure it's zeroed out okay so
that's<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.409> first<00:01:40.619> step<00:01:40.860> right<00:01:41.100> there<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.460> go

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
that's the first step right there you go

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.420 
that's the first step right there you go
here<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.540> zeroed<00:01:42.840> out<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.890> center

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
here is it zeroed out it's in the center

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.539 
here is it zeroed out it's in the center
you<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:44.880> equal<00:01:45.780> amount<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.290> movement<00:01:47.159> both

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
you have equal amount of movement both

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.770 
you have equal amount of movement both
ways<00:01:47.850> you're<00:01:48.299> good

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
ways you're good

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.859

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
okay then with your crosshairs in your

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.980 
okay then with your crosshairs in your
rear<00:01:52.350> mount<00:01:52.710> printhead<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:54.299> quite<00:01:54.540> simple

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
enough and the gridlines are dark and

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.700 
enough and the gridlines are dark and
profitable<00:02:07.010> and<00:02:07.700> you're<00:02:08.600> emulsion<00:02:09.259> is<00:02:09.380> clean

you can see through an emulsion and
simply<00:02:15.320> line<00:02:15.590> it<00:02:15.800> up<00:02:15.890> by<00:02:15.950> eye<00:02:16.130> ball<00:02:16.780> okay<00:02:17.780> so

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
simply line it up by eye ball okay so

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.600 
simply line it up by eye ball okay so
you're<00:02:18.170> -<00:02:18.320> I'm<00:02:18.560> just<00:02:18.740> lining<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.250> up<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.490> the

you're - I'm just lining it up to the
center<00:02:19.940> mark<00:02:20.180> and<00:02:20.450> then<00:02:20.660> using<00:02:21.320> these

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
center mark and then using these

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.260 
center mark and then using these
crosshairs<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.310> make<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.910> straight<00:02:23.180> across

an<00:03:58.519> exactitude<00:03:59.120> that<00:03:59.900> it<00:04:00.620> would<00:04:00.829> be

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
an exactitude that it would be

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.460 
an exactitude that it would be
impractical<00:04:01.940> to<00:04:02.180> manufacture<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:02.989> garment

impractical to manufacture that garment

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.199 
impractical to manufacture that garment
I<00:04:03.590> think<00:04:03.860> so<00:04:04.360> with<00:04:05.360> that<00:04:05.540> being<00:04:06.049> said

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
I think so with that being said

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.319 
I think so with that being said
after<00:04:08.750> I<00:04:08.810> hit<00:04:09.140> my<00:04:09.319> knee<00:04:09.379> on<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:09.859> pallet<00:04:10.340> arm<00:04:10.519> we

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
after I hit my knee on the pallet arm we

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.599 
after I hit my knee on the pallet arm we
want<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:12.079> get<00:04:12.319> your<00:04:12.500> shirt<00:04:12.739> on<00:04:13.040> the<00:04:13.189> pallet

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
want to get your shirt on the pallet

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.840 
want to get your shirt on the pallet
okay<00:04:14.030> and<00:04:14.269> a<00:04:14.870> thing<00:04:15.680> to<00:04:15.859> notice<00:04:16.220> that<00:04:16.430> the

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
okay and a thing to notice that the

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.999 
okay and a thing to notice that the
bigger<00:04:17.120> your<00:04:17.329> pallet<00:04:17.750> is<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:18.259> easier<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:18.889> is

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:19.009 
bigger your pallet is the easier it is

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.180 
bigger your pallet is the easier it is
to<00:04:19.340> get<00:04:19.579> your<00:04:19.609> shirt<00:04:20.049> on<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.410> pallet<00:04:21.799> straight

to get your shirt on the pallet straight

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.080 
to get your shirt on the pallet straight

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
so that's also you know vice-versa sort

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.810 
so that's also you know vice-versa sort
