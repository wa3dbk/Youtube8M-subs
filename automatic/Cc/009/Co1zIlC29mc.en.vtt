in<00:00:03.659> this<00:00:04.350> lesson<00:00:04.649> we<00:00:05.069> are<00:00:05.100> going<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.670> be

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
in this lesson we are going to be

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.839 
in this lesson we are going to be
converting<00:00:06.930> from<00:00:07.109> improper<00:00:07.680> fractions<00:00:08.400> into

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
converting from improper fractions into

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.300 
converting from improper fractions into
mixed<00:00:09.180> numbers<00:00:09.630> usually<00:00:10.590> you'll<00:00:10.770> do<00:00:10.950> this<00:00:11.130> at

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:11.310 
mixed numbers usually you'll do this at

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.250 
mixed numbers usually you'll do this at
the<00:00:11.430> end<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:12.210> question<00:00:12.480> if<00:00:12.840> you<00:00:12.960> want<00:00:13.170> to

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.260 
the end of a question if you want to

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.560 
the end of a question if you want to
simplify<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:14.340> make<00:00:14.700> sure<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.210> the

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
simplify and make sure that the the

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.529 
simplify and make sure that the the
answer<00:00:16.109> kind<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.439> looks<00:00:16.619> nice<00:00:17.480> kinda<00:00:18.480> like

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
answer kind of looks nice kinda like

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.880 
answer kind of looks nice kinda like
magic<00:00:19.280> to<00:00:20.280> do<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:20.610> you<00:00:20.910> will<00:00:21.030> need<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.330> know

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
magic to do this you will need to know

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.500 
magic to do this you will need to know
the<00:00:22.890> long<00:00:23.520> division<00:00:23.760> you'll<00:00:24.180> need<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.390> know

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
the long division you'll need to know

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.120 
the long division you'll need to know
how<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.660> do<00:00:24.900> long<00:00:25.110> division<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.800> there's<00:00:25.949> a

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
how to do long division and there's a

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.300 
how to do long division and there's a
lesson<00:00:26.640> or<00:00:27.029> two<00:00:27.529> about<00:00:28.529> how<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.770> do<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.130> and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
lesson or two about how to do that and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.439 
lesson or two about how to do that and
you'll<00:00:29.460> need<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.730> know<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.970> basics<00:00:30.359> of

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
you'll need to know the basics of

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.179 
you'll need to know the basics of
fractions<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.529> if<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:31.800> haven't<00:00:31.949> watched

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
fractions so if you haven't watched

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.889 
fractions so if you haven't watched
those<00:00:32.460> ones<00:00:32.759> then<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.210> might<00:00:33.359> want<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.660> watch

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
those ones then you might want to watch

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.479 
those ones then you might want to watch
those<00:00:34.199> first<00:00:35.269> all<00:00:36.269> right<00:00:36.510> so<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.409> convert<00:00:37.920> from

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
those first all right so to convert from

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.180 
those first all right so to convert from
an<00:00:38.760> improper<00:00:39.479> or<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:40.079> convert<00:00:40.440> an<00:00:40.620> improper

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
an improper or to convert an improper

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.869 
an improper or to convert an improper
fraction<00:00:41.219> into<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.030> mixed<00:00:42.120> number<00:00:43.639> you<00:00:44.639> will

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
fraction into a mixed number you will

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.110 
fraction into a mixed number you will
use<00:00:45.449> long<00:00:45.780> division<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.620> at<00:00:47.609> the<00:00:47.789> end<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
use long division and at the end the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.090 
use long division and at the end the
whole<00:00:48.299> number<00:00:48.659> is<00:00:48.749> the<00:00:48.870> whole<00:00:49.019> number<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
whole number is the whole number and the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.189 
whole number is the whole number and the
remainder<00:00:50.519> is<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.089> part<00:00:51.299> left<00:00:51.510> over<00:00:51.809> which

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
remainder is the part left over which

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.840 
remainder is the part left over which
will<00:00:52.379> be<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.589> numerator<00:00:53.010> I'll<00:00:53.399> show<00:00:53.609> you<00:00:53.670> what

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
will be the numerator I'll show you what

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.430 
will be the numerator I'll show you what
that<00:00:53.879> means<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.499> number<00:00:55.799> 12<00:00:56.249> over<00:00:56.850> 5<00:00:57.440> what

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
that means so the number 12 over 5 what

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.869 
that means so the number 12 over 5 what
we're<00:00:58.589> going<00:00:58.799> to<00:00:58.979> do<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.309> use<00:00:59.489> long<00:00:59.850> division

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
we're going to do is use long division

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.199 
we're going to do is use long division
to<00:01:00.600> solve<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.319> how<00:01:01.799> many<00:01:02.039> times<00:01:02.280> does<00:01:02.579> 5

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:03.209 
to solve for that how many times does 5

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:04.710 
to solve for that how many times does 5
going

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
going

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.780 
going
12<00:01:05.350> 2<00:01:06.310> times<00:01:06.730> 2<00:01:07.360> times<00:01:07.540> 5<00:01:07.900> is<00:01:07.930> 10<00:01:08.530> we<00:01:09.190> subtract

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
12 2 times 2 times 5 is 10 we subtract

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.420 
12 2 times 2 times 5 is 10 we subtract
and<00:01:10.120> we<00:01:10.630> have<00:01:10.750> two<00:01:11.050> left<00:01:11.560> over<00:01:11.770> so<00:01:12.130> we<00:01:12.280> would

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
and we have two left over so we would

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.210 
and we have two left over so we would
normally<00:01:12.610> say<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:15.300> when<00:01:16.300> we're<00:01:16.510> dividing

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
normally say that when we're dividing

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.270 
normally say that when we're dividing
12/5<00:01:18.220> we<00:01:19.060> would<00:01:19.210> say<00:01:19.420> we<00:01:19.600> have<00:01:19.630> two<00:01:20.380> remainder

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
12/5 we would say we have two remainder

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.090 
12/5 we would say we have two remainder
2<00:01:21.520> well<00:01:22.450> what's<00:01:22.630> that<00:01:22.780> remainder<00:01:23.380> means<00:01:23.680> in

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
2 well what's that remainder means in

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.330 
2 well what's that remainder means in
terms<00:01:24.700> of<00:01:24.910> fractions<00:01:25.480> is<00:01:25.750> this<00:01:26.380> it<00:01:26.830> means<00:01:27.070> that

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
terms of fractions is this it means that

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.700 
terms of fractions is this it means that
we<00:01:27.460> have<00:01:27.490> to<00:01:27.730> as<00:01:28.330> a<00:01:28.390> whole<00:01:28.810> number<00:01:29.080> with<00:01:29.680> a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
we have to as a whole number with a

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.570 
we have to as a whole number with a
remainder<00:01:30.220> of<00:01:30.490> 2<00:01:30.640> over<00:01:31.060> 5<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:32.920> in<00:01:33.130> other<00:01:33.250> words

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
remainder of 2 over 5 so in other words

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.950 
remainder of 2 over 5 so in other words
the<00:01:34.060> fraction<00:01:34.750> of<00:01:34.930> 12<00:01:35.350> over<00:01:36.070> 5<00:01:36.430> is<00:01:37.000> equal<00:01:37.360> to<00:01:37.750> 2

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
the fraction of 12 over 5 is equal to 2

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.920 
the fraction of 12 over 5 is equal to 2
and<00:01:37.990> two-fifths<00:01:39.360> that's<00:01:40.360> really<00:01:40.750> all<00:01:40.900> there

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
and two-fifths that's really all there

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.830 
and two-fifths that's really all there
is<00:01:41.140> to<00:01:41.440> it<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.950> whole<00:01:42.160> number<00:01:42.550> here<00:01:42.940> is<00:01:43.270> our

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
is to it the whole number here is our

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.890 
is to it the whole number here is our
whole<00:01:44.080> number<00:01:44.440> the<00:01:44.830> remainder<00:01:45.430> is<00:01:45.610> our<00:01:46.360> in<00:01:46.600> the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
whole number the remainder is our in the

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.410 
whole number the remainder is our in the
numerator<00:01:47.410> and<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.830> denominator<00:01:48.430> remains

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
numerator and the denominator remains

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.050 
numerator and the denominator remains
the<00:01:49.600> same<00:01:50.280> let's<00:01:51.280> do<00:01:51.490> some<00:01:51.700> more<00:01:51.820> so<00:01:52.570> 9<00:01:53.050> /<00:01:53.560> 29<00:01:54.100> /

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
the same let's do some more so 9 / 29 /

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.499 
the same let's do some more so 9 / 29 /
2<00:01:55.360> will<00:01:56.259> say<00:01:56.440> how<00:01:56.590> many<00:01:56.770> times<00:01:57.009> does<00:01:57.250> to<00:01:57.610> go

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
2 will say how many times does to go

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.840 
2 will say how many times does to go
into<00:01:58.810> nine<00:01:59.500> well<00:01:59.890> it<00:01:59.979> goes<00:02:00.130> in<00:02:00.250> four<00:02:00.550> times

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
into nine well it goes in four times

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.780 
into nine well it goes in four times
four<00:02:01.570> times<00:02:01.600> two<00:02:02.080> is<00:02:02.110> eight<00:02:02.460> we're<00:02:03.460> going<00:02:03.700> to

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
four times two is eight we're going to

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.370 
four times two is eight we're going to
subtract<00:02:04.320> 9-8<00:02:05.320> is<00:02:05.710> one<00:02:06.040> so<00:02:06.970> for<00:02:07.720> with<00:02:08.350> a

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
subtract 9-8 is one so for with a

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.610 
subtract 9-8 is one so for with a
remainder<00:02:08.830> of<00:02:09.070> 1<00:02:09.310> so<00:02:10.269> that<00:02:10.450> means<00:02:10.780> that<00:02:11.350> nine

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
remainder of 1 so that means that nine

with fractions lately remember there's

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.909 
with fractions lately remember there's

no such thing as a stupid question so

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.620 
no such thing as a stupid question so
keep<00:05:06.130> asking<00:05:06.550> questions<00:05:06.580> them<00:05:07.240> unless

keep asking questions them unless
they're<00:05:07.890> really<00:05:08.890> really<00:05:09.820> stupid<00:05:10.320> alright
