00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.480
 the drum or chulengo grill was 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.120
 designed for the southern area that for its 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.560
 Very windy weather made the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.080
 simple task of making a roast 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.540
 the grill was originally made 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.340
 cutting a drum of 200 liters and 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.500
 adding a fixed iron comb 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.930
 round that rested on the part 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.640
 bottom of the drum and a 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.730
 hole in the front or side to 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.380
 adding coal to the lid was done 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.869
 adding two hinges to the part 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.869
 cut what gave him movement 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.610
 the system seemed to work 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.560
 but we discover that sometimes the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.570
 wind suddenly closed the lid 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.270
 causing some accidents to 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.670
 unsuspecting grills 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.410
 we thought then that we could 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.390
 improve the original model 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.170
 and asking our customers 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.230
 we come to the model that we offer today 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.050
 we planted that annoying stage of opening 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.909
 for a practical sliding lid 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.280
 we add refractory bricks that if 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:08.500
 well they are replaceable they are placed 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.240
 in such a way that they do not move 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.549
 move the grill or during its use 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.970
 add a side brazier with floor 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.860
 refractory bricks 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.950
 and we did it also removable for 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:25.340
 reduce the space by saving it in 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.950
 garages baulas or balconies 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.659
 also carries a side table 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.280
 removable for cutting meat 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.689
 that can be saved along with the 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.689
 brazier inside the grill 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.010
 in two of its legs we put wheels for 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.900
 move it 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.550
 we only put him in two because of 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.530
 adding four forces us to work 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.420
 the wheels so that when roasting is not 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.810
 we move the grill what 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.520
 it is very uncomfortable 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.030
 Our grill is designed to 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.770
 provide the best cost-benefit, not what 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.340
 hesitate when buying a good 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.289
 grill think of us 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.590
 see the comments of people that she 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.750
