00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
view but you're somewhat familiar with

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.010

some<00:00:58.649> word<00:00:58.860> processing<00:00:59.160> programs<00:00:59.940> then<00:01:00.540> some

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
some word processing programs then some

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.090 
some word processing programs then some
of<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.380> going<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.590> look<00:01:01.680> pretty<00:01:01.920> familiar

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100

going to go ahead and try to tackle as
much<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.270> as<00:01:06.330> possible<00:01:06.899> just<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.140> make

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
much of this as possible just to make

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.380 
much of this as possible just to make

a later point where we discuss the
publishing<00:01:15.149> aspect<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:16.020> composer<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:17.340> and

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
publishing aspect of composer this and

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.670 
publishing aspect of composer this and
this<00:01:18.090> character<00:01:18.570> right<00:01:18.780> here<00:01:18.810> they<00:01:19.380> pretty

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
this character right here they pretty

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
this character right here they pretty
much<00:01:19.830> go<00:01:20.009> hand-in-hand

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
much go hand-in-hand

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.080 
much go hand-in-hand
now<00:01:21.420> then<00:01:21.800> on<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:23.070> right<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.970> our

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
now then on the right this is our

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.390 
now then on the right this is our
composition<00:01:24.780> area<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.159> basically

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
composition area and this is basically

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.530 
composition area and this is basically
where<00:01:26.610> all<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.850> work<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.270> be<00:01:27.360> done

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
where all the work is going to be done

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.590 
where all the work is going to be done
and<00:01:28.070> down<00:01:29.070> at<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.250> bottom<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.729> these<00:01:29.940> tabs<00:01:30.270> we

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
and down at the bottom on these tabs we

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.359 
and down at the bottom on these tabs we
have<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> various<00:01:31.290> types<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.770> views<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
have the various types of views the

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.250 
have the various types of views the
normal<00:01:32.790> view<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.690> tag<00:01:34.530> view<00:01:35.030> the<00:01:36.030> source<00:01:36.780> view

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
normal view the tag view the source view

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.390 
normal view the tag view the source view
and<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.369> preview<00:01:39.110> so<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.470> here<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.890> supposed

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
and the preview so this here is supposed

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.490 
and the preview so this here is supposed
to<00:01:41.610> be<00:01:41.790> what<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.150> looks<00:01:42.180> like<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:43.110> typical

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
to be what it looks like on a typical

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.469 
to be what it looks like on a typical
browser<00:01:43.979> once<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.670> been<00:01:44.790> uploaded<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.299> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
browser once it's been uploaded to the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.260 
browser once it's been uploaded to the
Internet<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:46.439> basically<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.280> preview<00:01:47.729> will

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
Internet but basically the preview will

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.999 
Internet but basically the preview will
give<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> better<00:01:49.020> idea<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.680> what<00:01:49.890> it's

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
give you a better idea as to what it's

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.350 
give you a better idea as to what it's
actually<00:01:50.220> going<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.610> look<00:01:50.729> like<00:01:50.909> once<00:01:51.210> it's

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
actually going to look like once it's

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.560 
actually going to look like once it's
been<00:01:51.450> published<00:01:51.900> and<00:01:52.110> then<00:01:53.040> moving<00:01:53.520> along<00:01:53.729> up

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
been published and then moving along up

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.109
