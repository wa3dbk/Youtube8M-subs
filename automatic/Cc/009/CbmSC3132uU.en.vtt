I'm basically on mining scrap metal out
of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.610> attic<00:01:24.030> right<00:01:24.479> upstairs<00:01:25.259> there's<00:01:25.560> a

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
of the attic right upstairs there's a

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.550 
of the attic right upstairs there's a
monstrous<00:01:26.549> air<00:01:26.790> conditioning<00:01:27.450> system<00:01:27.900> it's

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
monstrous air conditioning system it's

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.840 
monstrous air conditioning system it's
about<00:01:28.829> 50<00:01:29.310> years<00:01:29.520> old

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
about 50 years old

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.700 
about 50 years old
it<00:01:29.939> was<00:01:30.240> probably<00:01:30.720> installed<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> late

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
it was probably installed in the late

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.020 
it was probably installed in the late
50s<00:01:32.280> or<00:01:32.400> early<00:01:32.790> 1960s<00:01:33.799> you<00:01:34.799> know<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.220> 2014

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
50s or early 1960s you know this is 2014

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.490 
50s or early 1960s you know this is 2014
I<00:01:36.329> guess<00:01:36.960> so

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
I guess so

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.580 
I guess so
you<00:01:37.590> know<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.860> cysts<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:39.150> system<00:01:39.590> you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
you know the cysts and the system you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.830 
you know the cysts and the system you
know<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.070> house<00:01:41.310> was<00:01:41.759> uh<00:01:42.000> naw<00:01:42.540> per<00:01:42.720> a

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
know this this house was uh naw per a

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.069 
know this this house was uh naw per a
tional<00:01:43.110> for<00:01:43.290> 19<00:01:43.710> years<00:01:44.070> yes<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.509> suspect

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
tional for 19 years yes and we suspect

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.319 
tional for 19 years yes and we suspect
that<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:47.310> air<00:01:47.520> conditioned<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.180> air

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
that the air conditioned the air

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.420 
that the air conditioned the air
conditioning<00:01:48.780> system<00:01:48.960> wore<00:01:49.530> out<00:01:49.710> long<00:01:50.009> before

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
conditioning system wore out long before

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.700 
conditioning system wore out long before
then<00:01:50.670> mm-hmm<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.780> know<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:52.079> would<00:01:52.170> be<00:01:52.320> 50

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
then mm-hmm you know it would be 50

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.609 
then mm-hmm you know it would be 50
years<00:01:52.920> old<00:01:53.189> or<00:01:53.340> more<00:01:53.640> today<00:01:54.119> right<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:55.290> we're

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619
