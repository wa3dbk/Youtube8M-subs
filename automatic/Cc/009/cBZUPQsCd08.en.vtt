00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
focus on the what should we call it the

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.949 
focus on the what should we call it the
security<00:03:28.980> industrial<00:03:29.430> complex<00:03:30.180> but<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.780> vast

security industrial complex but the vast

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.199 
security industrial complex but the vast
network<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.590> industries<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.130> are<00:03:32.400> making<00:03:32.730> so

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
network of industries that are making so

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.120 
network of industries that are making so
much<00:03:33.360> money<00:03:33.540> off<00:03:33.720> these<00:03:34.050> drones<00:03:34.440> and<00:03:34.739> all<00:03:34.920> the

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
much money off these drones and all the

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.670 
much money off these drones and all the
rest<00:03:35.340> of<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.670> pallino<00:03:36.270> the<00:03:36.600> tanks<00:03:37.080> that<00:03:37.230> local

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
rest of the pallino the tanks that local

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.350 
rest of the pallino the tanks that local
cops<00:03:37.890> have<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:38.489> forth<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.090> think<00:03:39.209> we

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
cops have and so forth so I think we

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.270 
cops have and so forth so I think we
