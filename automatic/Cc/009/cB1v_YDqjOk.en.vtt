so<00:00:03.720> as<00:00:03.840> I<00:00:03.960> said<00:00:04.020> in<00:00:04.260> a<00:00:04.320> previous<00:00:04.680> clip<00:00:04.890> you<00:00:05.190> need

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
so as I said in a previous clip you need

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.130 
so as I said in a previous clip you need
to<00:00:05.520> have<00:00:05.700> an<00:00:05.880> antenna<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:06.480> covers<00:00:06.870> all<00:00:07.080> of

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
to have an antenna that covers all of

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.040 
to have an antenna that covers all of
those<00:00:07.410> bands<00:00:07.830> right<00:00:08.460> from<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.820> word<00:00:08.940> go<00:00:09.050> but

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
those bands right from the word go but

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.750 
those bands right from the word go but
the<00:00:10.200> most<00:00:10.349> interesting<00:00:10.710> thing<00:00:11.100> about<00:00:11.130> LTE

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:11.760 
the most interesting thing about LTE

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.200 
the most interesting thing about LTE
antennas<00:00:12.330> or<00:00:13.230> LTE<00:00:13.650> communications<00:00:14.460> are<00:00:14.640> that

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
antennas or LTE communications are that

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.240 
antennas or LTE communications are that
you<00:00:15.330> need<00:00:15.540> two<00:00:15.840> antennas<00:00:16.350> at<00:00:16.560> least<00:00:17.039> two

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
you need two antennas at least two

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.890 
you need two antennas at least two
antennas<00:00:17.640> lighter<00:00:18.000> systems<00:00:18.449> may<00:00:18.600> require

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
antennas lighter systems may require

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.450 
antennas lighter systems may require
more<00:00:19.140> but<00:00:19.349> at<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.560> moment<00:00:19.829> two<00:00:19.949> antennas<00:00:20.339> are

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
more but at the moment two antennas are

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.370 
more but at the moment two antennas are
required<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.999> achieve<00:00:21.119> LTE<00:00:21.749> performance

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
required to achieve LTE performance

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.529 
required to achieve LTE performance
that's<00:00:23.070> very<00:00:23.310> interesting<00:00:23.550> first<00:00:24.060> time<00:00:24.300> in

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
that's very interesting first time in

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.720 
that's very interesting first time in
the<00:00:24.659> East<00:00:24.839> Lee<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.289> radio<00:00:26.189> comms<00:00:26.429> that<00:00:26.640> you

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
the East Lee of radio comms that you

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.489 
the East Lee of radio comms that you
actually<00:00:27.179> needed<00:00:27.449> two<00:00:27.689> antennas<00:00:28.079> people<00:00:28.409> have

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:28.499 
actually needed two antennas people have

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.499 
actually needed two antennas people have
used<00:00:28.739> two<00:00:28.919> antennas<00:00:29.279> often<00:00:29.579> to<00:00:29.669> get<00:00:29.819> past<00:00:30.239> some

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
used two antennas often to get past some

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.350 
used two antennas often to get past some
obstacles<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:31.710> with<00:00:31.919> LTE<00:00:32.310> which<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.759> an<00:00:32.970> email

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360

multi-output

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.910 
multi-output
in<00:00:36.120> order<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.570> get<00:00:36.720> the<00:00:36.870> high<00:00:36.960> data<00:00:37.230> rates<00:00:37.530> you

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
in order to get the high data rates you

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.470 
in order to get the high data rates you
actually<00:00:38.250> need<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.670> have<00:00:38.700> two<00:00:39.120> antennas

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
actually need to have two antennas

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.240 
actually need to have two antennas
available<00:00:39.960> or<00:00:40.080> two<00:00:40.260> antenna<00:00:40.560> ports<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.130> those

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
available or two antenna ports and those

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.920 
available or two antenna ports and those
two<00:00:41.430> antennas<00:00:41.730> need<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.000> be<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.240> they<00:00:42.690> call<00:00:42.900> it

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
two antennas need to be as they call it

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.260 
two antennas need to be as they call it
isolated<00:00:43.740> or<00:00:43.890> uncorrelated<00:00:44.370> with<00:00:44.940> each<00:00:45.060> other

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
isolated or uncorrelated with each other

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.480 
isolated or uncorrelated with each other
now<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.260> first<00:00:46.590> way<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:46.920> get<00:00:47.220> that<00:00:47.340> is

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.490 
now the first way you can get that is

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.520 
now the first way you can get that is
you<00:00:47.580> take<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> antenna<00:00:48.780> like<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.500> a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
you take a antenna like this this is a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.710 
you take a antenna like this this is a
lock<00:00:49.710> periodic<00:00:50.160> antenna<00:00:50.490> which<00:00:51.300> covers<00:00:51.630> all

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
lock periodic antenna which covers all

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.850 
lock periodic antenna which covers all
of<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.930> bands<00:00:52.230> that's<00:00:52.380> why<00:00:52.500> it's<00:00:52.620> got<00:00:52.740> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
of the bands that's why it's got the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.980 
of the bands that's why it's got the
narrow<00:00:53.070> end<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.760> big<00:00:53.940> end<00:00:54.180> at<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> side<00:00:54.750> and

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:54.990 
narrow end and a big end at the side and

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.780 
narrow end and a big end at the side and
you<00:00:55.380> can<00:00:55.410> combine<00:00:55.680> two<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.250> them<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.550> some

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
you can combine two of them in some

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.120 
you can combine two of them in some
interesting<00:00:57.150> ways<00:00:57.540> so<00:00:57.840> if<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.080> just<00:00:58.710> take<00:00:58.950> out

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
interesting ways so if I just take out

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.330 
interesting ways so if I just take out
another<00:00:59.460> one<00:00:59.700> out<00:01:00.450> of<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.900> box<00:01:01.230> here<00:01:01.470> these

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
another one out of the box here these

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.340 
another one out of the box here these
are<00:01:02.610> just<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.270> nice<00:01:03.420> easy<00:01:03.720> one<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.079> and<00:01:04.229> all

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
are just the nice easy one to and all

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.479 
are just the nice easy one to and all
you<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.619> do<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:04.949> some<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.309> bigger

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
you can do it with some of the bigger

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.100 
you can do it with some of the bigger
antennas<00:01:05.909> like<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.210> guyline<00:01:06.570> here<00:01:06.840> but<00:01:06.990> it's

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
antennas like the guyline here but it's

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.010 
antennas like the guyline here but it's
not<00:01:07.230> easy<00:01:07.440> to<00:01:07.740> demonstrate<00:01:07.950> on<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.490> video<00:01:08.760> and

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
not easy to demonstrate on the video and

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.660 
not easy to demonstrate on the video and
we've<00:01:10.020> made<00:01:10.230> for<00:01:10.380> example<00:01:10.800> a<00:01:10.860> special<00:01:11.250> bracket

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
we've made for example a special bracket

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.180 
we've made for example a special bracket
the<00:01:12.000> bracket<00:01:12.030> sits<00:01:12.600> here<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.800> antenna

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
the bracket sits here on this antenna

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.870 
the bracket sits here on this antenna
and<00:01:15.620> with<00:01:16.620> the<00:01:16.830> same<00:01:17.040> bracket<00:01:17.370> on<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.670> guy

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
and with the same bracket on this guy

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.149 
and with the same bracket on this guy
here<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.960> mount<00:01:19.170> them<00:01:19.409> exactly<00:01:19.979> like

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
here you can mount them exactly like

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.240 
here you can mount them exactly like
this<00:01:20.550> using<00:01:21.510> one<00:01:21.750> bracket<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.409> other<00:01:22.560> words<00:01:22.770> if

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
this using one bracket in other words if

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.740 
this using one bracket in other words if
you<00:01:23.490> look<00:01:23.520> at<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.820> sideways<00:01:24.060> looks<00:01:24.450> like<00:01:24.570> this

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
you look at it sideways looks like this

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.390 
you look at it sideways looks like this
and<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.110> see<00:01:25.260> that<00:01:25.409> these<00:01:25.590> two<00:01:25.650> guys<00:01:26.040> are

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
and you can see that these two guys are

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.090 
and you can see that these two guys are
now<00:01:26.490> polarized<00:01:27.409> 90<00:01:28.409> degrees<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.830> each<00:01:28.890> other

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
now polarized 90 degrees to each other

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.920 
now polarized 90 degrees to each other
and<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.310> sitting<00:01:29.520> sort<00:01:29.760> of<00:01:29.820> plus<00:01:30.030> minus<00:01:30.270> 45

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
and I sitting sort of plus minus 45

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.899 
and I sitting sort of plus minus 45
degree<00:01:31.170> angles<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:32.159> helped<00:01:32.370> by<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.580> single

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
degree angles and I helped by a single

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.270 
degree angles and I helped by a single
bracket<00:01:33.270> bracket<00:01:33.420> was<00:01:33.780> actually<00:01:33.990> designed<00:01:34.280> so

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
bracket bracket was actually designed so

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.100 
bracket bracket was actually designed so
that<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.520> can<00:01:35.729> do<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.600> that's<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.930> one

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
that you can do that so that's the one

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.320 
that you can do that so that's the one
solution<00:01:37.620> to<00:01:37.830> using<00:01:38.370> two<00:01:38.580> antennas<00:01:39.000> where<00:01:39.210> you

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
solution to using two antennas where you

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.390 
solution to using two antennas where you
haven't<00:01:39.600> got<00:01:39.690> a<00:01:39.720> dedicated<00:01:40.500> or<00:01:40.680> integrated<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
haven't got a dedicated or integrated to

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.190 
haven't got a dedicated or integrated to
entertain<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> solution<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.720> can<00:01:42.870> of<00:01:42.990> course

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
entertain a solution you can of course

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.560 
entertain a solution you can of course
do<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.409> same<00:01:43.770> thing<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.760> for<00:01:45.090> example<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
do the same thing with for example the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.090 
do the same thing with for example the
bigger<00:01:45.840> die<00:01:46.080> here<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.740> bigger<00:01:46.950> guy

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
bigger die here and for the bigger guy

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.620 
bigger die here and for the bigger guy
here<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.460> designed<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.880> special<00:01:48.060> bracket<00:01:48.540> so

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
here we designed a special bracket so

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.210 
here we designed a special bracket so
you<00:01:48.659> can<00:01:48.840> mount<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.200> one<00:01:49.380> sort<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.740> vertically

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
you can mount the one sort of vertically

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.740 
you can mount the one sort of vertically
and<00:01:50.460> other<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:50.760> horizontally<00:01:51.360> which<00:01:51.540> they

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
and other one horizontally which they

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.560 
and other one horizontally which they
normally<00:01:52.080> always<00:01:52.290> remand<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.070> vertically

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
normally always remand it vertically

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.850 
normally always remand it vertically
then<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.720> can<00:01:54.900> also<00:01:55.080> instead<00:01:55.440> of<00:01:55.500> changing

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
then you can also instead of changing

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.640 
then you can also instead of changing
the<00:01:56.100> polarization<00:01:56.610> up<00:01:57.030> if<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.140> use<00:01:58.350> for

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
the polarization up if you use for

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.859 
the polarization up if you use for
example<00:01:58.729> omni<00:01:59.729> antenna<00:01:59.760> and<00:02:00.330> I<00:02:00.479> think<00:02:00.750> I've

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
example omni antenna and I think I've

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.870 
example omni antenna and I think I've
explained<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> antenna<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.250> some

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
explained this on the antenna and some

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.760 
explained this on the antenna and some
time<00:02:03.090> ago<00:02:03.360> all<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.840> these<00:02:04.080> Omni<00:02:04.320> antennas<00:02:04.409> are

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
time ago all of these Omni antennas are

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.859 
time ago all of these Omni antennas are
now<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.159> customized<00:02:06.150> said<00:02:06.390> they<00:02:06.479> cover<00:02:06.689> all

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
now and customized said they cover all

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.270 
now and customized said they cover all
of<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:07.080> frequency<00:02:07.439> bands<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.799> can<00:02:07.920> put<00:02:08.129> two

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
of the frequency bands you can put two

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.520 
of the frequency bands you can put two
of<00:02:08.399> these<00:02:08.519> next<00:02:08.939> to<00:02:09.030> each<00:02:09.149> other<00:02:09.299> now<00:02:10.170> people

of these next to each other now people

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.339 
of these next to each other now people
ask<00:02:10.619> me<00:02:10.830> how<00:02:10.920> far<00:02:11.190> apart<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:12.630> quick<00:02:12.900> answer<00:02:13.319> is

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
ask me how far apart the quick answer is

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.070 
ask me how far apart the quick answer is
about<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.770> meter<00:02:14.370> 2<00:02:14.640> meter<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.090> off<00:02:15.209> apart<00:02:15.599> but

about a meter 2 meter and off apart but

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.820 
about a meter 2 meter and off apart but
it<00:02:16.230> really<00:02:16.440> actual

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
it really actual

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.800 
it really actual
depend<00:02:17.100> on<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.250> amount<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.610> multipath<00:02:18.150> that

closer and if it's in an outdoors
environment<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.000> would<00:02:24.120> take<00:02:24.300> them<00:02:24.450> up<00:02:24.600> to

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
environment I would take them up to

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.840 
environment I would take them up to
three<00:02:24.990> meters<00:02:25.320> apart<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:26.160> get<00:02:26.310> sort<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.670> real

nice me male performance if you take

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.240 
nice me male performance if you take
even<00:02:30.690> indoors<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.470> can<00:02:31.530> take<00:02:31.800> two<00:02:31.950> if<00:02:32.070> there's

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
even indoors you can take two if there's

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.950 
even indoors you can take two if there's
a<00:02:32.310> little<00:02:32.520> desk<00:02:32.730> now<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.210> antennas<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.810> you

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
a little desk now that antennas and you

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.090 
a little desk now that antennas and you
can<00:02:34.110> put<00:02:34.290> them<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.650> would<00:02:34.800> put<00:02:34.980> them

can put them and I would put them
indoors<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.910> can<00:02:35.940> be<00:02:36.240> much<00:02:36.450> closer<00:02:36.780> so

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
indoors you can be much closer so

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.570 
indoors you can be much closer so
indoors<00:02:37.440> even<00:02:37.680> if<00:02:37.770> you<00:02:37.860> about<00:02:37.980> half<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.370> meter

is actually going to come out with two
antenna<00:02:49.170> ports<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.740> better<00:02:49.980> put<00:02:50.280> something

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
antenna ports you better put something

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.190 
antenna ports you better put something
on<00:02:50.790> each<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.180> those<00:02:51.300> antenna<00:02:51.720> ports<00:02:52.050> will

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
on each of those antenna ports will

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.200 
on each of those antenna ports will
still<00:02:52.440> work<00:02:52.680> with<00:02:52.920> one<00:02:53.100> antenna<00:02:53.370> but<00:02:54.090> you

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
still work with one antenna but you

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.120 
still work with one antenna but you
won't<00:02:54.450> get<00:02:54.660> nearly<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.260> type<00:02:55.470> of<00:02:55.500> speeds<00:02:55.980> that

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
won't get nearly the type of speeds that

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.390 
won't get nearly the type of speeds that
you<00:02:56.280> will<00:02:56.520> get<00:02:56.730> with<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:58.050> two<00:02:58.230> ports<00:02:58.590> we've

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
you will get with the two ports we've

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.340 
you will get with the two ports we've
seen<00:02:59.640> examples<00:03:00.150> for<00:03:00.450> example<00:03:00.510> in<00:03:00.930> Sweden

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
seen examples for example in Sweden

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.320 
seen examples for example in Sweden
where<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.680> guys<00:03:01.890> see<00:03:02.190> about<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.459> 3-4<00:03:03.090> times

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
where the guys see about a 3-4 times

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.199 
where the guys see about a 3-4 times

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
increase in the down link speed when I

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.120 
increase in the down link speed when I
put<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.690> second<00:03:07.050> antenna<00:03:07.320> on<00:03:07.530> compared<00:03:08.010> to

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
put that second antenna on compared to

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.190 
put that second antenna on compared to
the<00:03:08.250> first<00:03:08.459> antenna<00:03:08.820> but<00:03:09.390> even<00:03:09.660> for<00:03:09.780> desktop

use<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.740> take<00:03:10.920> one<00:03:11.190> year<00:03:11.490> with<00:03:11.910> one<00:03:12.150> year<00:03:12.420> and

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
use you take one year with one year and

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.180 
use you take one year with one year and
there<00:03:12.990> that<00:03:13.110> can<00:03:13.260> be<00:03:13.380> much<00:03:13.560> closer<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:14.010> would

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
there that can be much closer I would

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.370 
there that can be much closer I would

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
say even this far apart you still get

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.900 
say even this far apart you still get

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
close together and that's the way that

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.330 
close together and that's the way that

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
looking a little bit ugly so we are at

looking a little bit ugly so we are at
the<00:03:38.310> moment<00:03:38.459> starting<00:03:39.330> to<00:03:39.420> develop<00:03:39.540> at<00:03:39.870> best

the moment starting to develop at best
and<00:03:40.350> data<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.590> will<00:03:40.830> actually<00:03:40.980> have<00:03:41.190> two

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
and data that will actually have two

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.820 
and data that will actually have two
inputs<00:03:41.790> so<00:03:42.330> you<00:03:42.390> don't<00:03:42.750> have<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:43.110> put<00:03:43.320> two

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
inputs so you don't have to put two

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.070 
inputs so you don't have to put two
antennas<00:03:44.250> for<00:03:44.459> every<00:03:44.850> access<00:03:45.750> point<00:03:45.780> that

we<00:03:50.670> actually<00:03:50.880> design<00:03:51.480> two<00:03:51.780> antennas<00:03:52.170> inside

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
we actually design two antennas inside

we actually design two antennas inside
one<00:03:52.890> enclosure<00:03:53.280> this<00:03:54.060> is<00:03:54.180> our<00:03:54.330> first<00:03:54.690> version

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
one enclosure this is our first version

of such an antenna we call it Expo one
and<00:03:57.360> inside<00:03:58.320> here<00:03:58.530> they<00:03:58.680> still<00:03:58.950> fairly

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
and inside here they still fairly

and inside here they still fairly
omnidirectional<00:03:59.700> antennas<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.810> polarized

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
you can see what comes out here are two

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.810 
you can see what comes out here are two
cables<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:06.900> this<00:04:07.680> is<00:04:07.800> just<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.100> prototype<00:04:08.310> the

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
cables and this is just a prototype the

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.190 
cables and this is just a prototype the
real<00:04:08.970> one<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.330> sits<00:04:09.510> in<00:04:09.630> this<00:04:09.750> box<00:04:10.050> here

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
real one that sits in this box here

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.850 
real one that sits in this box here
comes<00:04:10.530> with<00:04:10.769> five<00:04:11.519> meters<00:04:12.090> of<00:04:12.239> cable<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:12.860> this

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
comes with five meters of cable and this

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.070 
comes with five meters of cable and this
can<00:04:14.130> go<00:04:14.250> all<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.549> way<00:04:14.580> down<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.180> connect<00:04:16.019> to

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
can go all the way down and connect to

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.599 
can go all the way down and connect to
the<00:04:16.260> modem<00:04:16.470> so<00:04:16.859> in<00:04:16.950> this<00:04:17.070> case<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:17.489> must

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
the modem so in this case you must

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.250 
the modem so in this case you must
always<00:04:17.820> look<00:04:18.120> if<00:04:18.330> you<00:04:18.479> if<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:18.930> look<00:04:19.049> at<00:04:19.200> you

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
always look if you if you look at you

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.650 
always look if you if you look at you
see<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:20.070> actual<00:04:20.430> cables<00:04:20.820> one<00:04:21.479> can

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
see to to actual cables one can

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.510 
see to to actual cables one can
sometimes<00:04:22.049> find<00:04:22.260> these<00:04:22.500> compact<00:04:22.919> cables

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
sometimes find these compact cables

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.090 
sometimes find these compact cables

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
combined next to each other and then you

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.279 
combined next to each other and then you
know<00:04:26.220> that<00:04:26.430> it's<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.729> true<00:04:26.970> LTE<00:04:27.479> Mima<00:04:27.960> antenna

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
know that it's a true LTE Mima antenna

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:29.570 
know that it's a true LTE Mima antenna
in<00:04:28.410> other<00:04:28.560> words<00:04:28.770> one<00:04:28.979> that<00:04:29.160> actually

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
in other words one that actually

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.190 
in other words one that actually
contains

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200

to<00:04:30.260> entertain<00:04:30.470> us<00:04:30.650> inside<00:04:31.010> the<00:04:31.610> box<00:04:31.850> so<00:04:32.120> those

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
to entertain us inside the box so those

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.660 
to entertain us inside the box so those
are<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.140> three<00:04:33.770> things<00:04:34.100> in<00:04:34.310> terms<00:04:34.520> of

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
are the three things in terms of

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.190 
are the three things in terms of
antennas<00:04:35.030> so<00:04:35.180> first<00:04:35.420> you<00:04:35.570> antennae<00:04:35.840> you<00:04:36.020> can

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
antennas so first you antennae you can

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.570 
antennas so first you antennae you can
use<00:04:36.350> single<00:04:36.590> at<00:04:36.740> dinner<00:04:36.950> but<00:04:37.160> then<00:04:37.280> it<00:04:37.430> must

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
use single at dinner but then it must

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.700 
use single at dinner but then it must
cover<00:04:37.730> the<00:04:37.880> frequency<00:04:38.330> band<00:04:38.540> better<00:04:39.350> to<00:04:39.560> use

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
cover the frequency band better to use

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.080 
cover the frequency band better to use
two<00:04:39.860> antennas<00:04:40.250> because<00:04:40.430> then<00:04:40.730> you<00:04:40.820> start

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
two antennas because then you start

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.520 
two antennas because then you start
getting<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.480> MIMO<00:04:41.660> performance<00:04:42.200> and<00:04:42.380> when

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
getting the MIMO performance and when

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.080 
getting the MIMO performance and when
you<00:04:42.650> haven't<00:04:42.800> got<00:04:42.950> these<00:04:43.220> antennas<00:04:43.670> yet<00:04:43.880> you

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
you haven't got these antennas yet you

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.180 
you haven't got these antennas yet you
can<00:04:44.300> use<00:04:44.480> any<00:04:44.750> of<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:44.990> old<00:04:45.140> antennas<00:04:45.590> which

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
can use any of the old antennas which

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.090 
can use any of the old antennas which
covers<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:46.670> full<00:04:46.850> band<00:04:47.090> and<00:04:47.620> using<00:04:48.620> either<00:04:48.770> 45

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
covers the full band and using either 45

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.070 
covers the full band and using either 45
degrees<00:04:49.610> to<00:04:49.820> each<00:04:49.850> other<00:04:50.090> polarization<00:04:50.900> wise

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
degrees to each other polarization wise

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.100 
degrees to each other polarization wise
or<00:04:51.710> separate<00:04:52.340> them<00:04:52.580> in<00:04:52.820> space<00:04:53.180> by<00:04:53.840> some

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
or separate them in space by some

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.390 
or separate them in space by some
distance<00:04:54.560> in<00:04:54.680> order<00:04:54.770> to<00:04:54.950> give<00:04:55.130> you<00:04:55.250> two

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
distance in order to give you two

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.790 
distance in order to give you two
antennas<00:04:55.820> and<00:04:56.000> then<00:04:56.510> lastly<00:04:56.930> you<00:04:57.560> should

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
antennas and then lastly you should

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.470 
antennas and then lastly you should
start<00:04:58.130> thinking<00:04:58.250> about<00:04:58.610> getting<00:04:59.150> hold<00:04:59.360> of

00:04:59.470 --> 00:04:59.480 
start thinking about getting hold of

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.840 
start thinking about getting hold of
these<00:04:59.690> type<00:04:59.930> of<00:04:59.960> antennas<00:05:00.500> which<00:05:01.280> integrates

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
these type of antennas which integrates

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.490 
these type of antennas which integrates
the<00:05:02.030> two<00:05:02.210> antennas<00:05:02.540> into<00:05:02.780> a<00:05:02.810> single<00:05:03.140> enclosure

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
the two antennas into a single enclosure

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.710 
the two antennas into a single enclosure
but<00:05:04.100> that's<00:05:04.280> obviously<00:05:04.820> all<00:05:04.970> and<00:05:05.330> if<00:05:05.570> you

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
but that's obviously all and if you

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.720 
but that's obviously all and if you
really<00:05:06.050> gotta<00:05:06.230> LTE<00:05:06.590> modem<00:05:06.860> in<00:05:07.160> many<00:05:07.340> cases

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
really gotta LTE modem in many cases

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.730 
really gotta LTE modem in many cases
people<00:05:07.880> are<00:05:08.120> putting<00:05:08.300> up<00:05:08.510> and<00:05:08.690> Tenace<00:05:09.410> for

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
people are putting up and Tenace for

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.310 
people are putting up and Tenace for
current<00:05:10.250> three-and-a-half<00:05:10.970> GMA<00:05:11.420> limbs<00:05:11.630> then

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
current three-and-a-half GMA limbs then

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.840 
current three-and-a-half GMA limbs then
it's<00:05:12.470> better<00:05:12.680> to<00:05:12.860> still<00:05:13.070> use<00:05:13.220> a<00:05:13.250> guy<00:05:13.490> like<00:05:13.520> this

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
it's better to still use a guy like this

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.820 
it's better to still use a guy like this
and<00:05:14.090> if<00:05:14.270> someone<00:05:14.660> later<00:05:14.840> on<00:05:15.020> connects<00:05:15.440> the<00:05:15.530> LTE

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
and if someone later on connects the LTE

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.010 
and if someone later on connects the LTE
right<00:05:16.490> into<00:05:16.790> it<00:05:16.880> it<00:05:17.000> will<00:05:17.120> still<00:05:17.360> work<00:05:17.540> but

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
right into it it will still work but

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.870 
right into it it will still work but
then<00:05:18.200> you<00:05:18.230> should<00:05:18.380> start<00:05:18.920> changing<00:05:19.430> over<00:05:19.730> to

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
then you should start changing over to

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.300 
then you should start changing over to
either<00:05:20.030> two<00:05:20.270> antennas<00:05:20.720> or<00:05:21.170> two<00:05:21.470> integrated

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
either two antennas or two integrated

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.620 
either two antennas or two integrated
dual<00:05:22.640> antenna<00:05:23.000> like<00:05:23.600> this<00:05:23.930> type<00:05:24.170> of<00:05:24.200> unit
