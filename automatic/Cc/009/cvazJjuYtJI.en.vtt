00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
see if there's something wrong with my

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.440 
see if there's something wrong with my
PVR<00:01:10.500> or<00:01:10.920> maybe<00:01:11.490> he's<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:11.729> steered<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.240> mode

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
PVR or maybe he's just steered a mode

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.240 
PVR or maybe he's just steered a mode
but<00:01:12.689> if<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.049> theater<00:01:13.260> mode<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.530> know<00:01:13.680> Infinity

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
but if it's theater mode I know Infinity

encountered a mano were 43 and to give

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.170 
encountered a mano were 43 and to give
my<00:01:22.590> little<00:01:22.860> personal<00:01:23.490> opinion<00:01:23.850> right<00:01:24.150> now

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
my little personal opinion right now

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.749 
my little personal opinion right now
furry<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.799> first<00:01:26.130> thing<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.549> gotta

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
furry and the first thing that I gotta

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.749 
furry and the first thing that I gotta
say<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.479> that<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.130> don't<00:01:29.369> know<00:01:29.490> why

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
say is that for so I don't know why

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.999 
say is that for so I don't know why
maybe<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.390> maybe<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.229> me<00:01:31.350> or<00:01:31.590> something<00:01:31.890> like

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
maybe it's maybe to me or something like

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.450 
maybe it's maybe to me or something like
that<00:01:32.130> but<00:01:32.790> i<00:01:33.000> think<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.540> spawns<00:01:34.290> are<00:01:34.470> similar

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
that but i think the spawns are similar

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.450 
that but i think the spawns are similar
to<00:01:35.700> modern<00:01:36.030> warfare<00:01:36.150> 2<00:01:36.540> because<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:37.799> i<00:01:38.070> was

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
actually made it more realistic than a

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.770 
actually made it more realistic than a
c-130<00:02:29.370> like<00:02:29.580> how<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.790> bullets<00:02:30.240> are<00:02:30.390> going<00:02:30.420> and

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
c-130 like how the bullets are going and
