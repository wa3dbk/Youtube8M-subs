beating<00:00:06.110> our<00:00:06.590> chicken<00:00:07.070> Dominick<00:00:07.460> this<00:00:08.120> is<00:00:08.210> the

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
beating our chicken Dominick this is the

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.150 
beating our chicken Dominick this is the
first<00:00:08.480> cooking<00:00:09.200> process<00:00:09.650> in<00:00:09.800> the<00:00:09.890> chicken

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
first cooking process in the chicken

I'm<00:00:10.970> right<00:00:11.120> here<00:00:11.210> the<00:00:11.390> cryovac<00:00:11.750> machine

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:11.950 
I'm right here the cryovac machine

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.140 
I'm right here the cryovac machine
basically<00:00:12.950> what<00:00:13.190> it<00:00:13.280> does<00:00:13.460> is<00:00:13.670> put<00:00:13.940> anything

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
basically what it does is put anything

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.209 
basically what it does is put anything
in<00:00:14.360> a<00:00:14.420> bag<00:00:14.660> and<00:00:14.840> it'll<00:00:14.990> immediately<00:00:15.650> change

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:16.219 
in a bag and it'll immediately change

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.390 
in a bag and it'll immediately change
the<00:00:16.309> atmospheric<00:00:16.849> pressure<00:00:17.090> in<00:00:17.239> the<00:00:17.329> bag<00:00:17.539> and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
the atmospheric pressure in the bag and

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.640 
the atmospheric pressure in the bag and
forces<00:00:19.400> whatever<00:00:19.609> you're<00:00:19.820> cooking<00:00:19.999> in<00:00:20.650> of

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
forces whatever you're cooking in of

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.929 
forces whatever you're cooking in of
course<00:00:21.829> the<00:00:21.980> marinade<00:00:22.339> the<00:00:22.429> force<00:00:22.669> itself

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
course the marinade the force itself

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.300 
course the marinade the force itself
into<00:00:23.150> whatever<00:00:23.390> meat<00:00:23.599> you're<00:00:23.720> cooking

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
into whatever meat you're cooking

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.529 
into whatever meat you're cooking
basically<00:00:25.310> this<00:00:25.399> doesn't<00:00:25.730> yield<00:00:25.819> itself<00:00:26.300> to

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
basically this doesn't yield itself to

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.800 
basically this doesn't yield itself to
cooking<00:00:27.229> and<00:00:27.529> locking<00:00:27.859> in<00:00:27.949> moisture<00:00:27.979> and

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
cooking and locking in moisture and

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.210 
cooking and locking in moisture and
freshness<00:00:29.810> and<00:00:30.289> well<00:00:30.739> as<00:00:30.829> you<00:00:30.919> cook<00:00:31.099> for

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
freshness and well as you cook for

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.109 
freshness and well as you cook for
longer<00:00:31.489> periods<00:00:31.819> of<00:00:31.880> time

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
longer periods of time

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.270 
longer periods of time
so<00:00:32.540> basically<00:00:32.780> pursue<00:00:33.110> beating<00:00:33.650> what<00:00:34.190> are

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
so basically pursue beating what are

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.940 
so basically pursue beating what are
your<00:00:34.370> necessary<00:00:34.700> and<00:00:34.820> greet<00:00:35.350> components<00:00:36.350> this

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
your necessary and greet components this

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.650 
your necessary and greet components this
bag<00:00:37.220> right<00:00:37.400> here<00:00:37.550> it's<00:00:37.700> a<00:00:37.790> tempered<00:00:38.150> plastic

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
bag right here it's a tempered plastic

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.360 
bag right here it's a tempered plastic
that's<00:00:38.840> pretty<00:00:39.410> much<00:00:39.530> heat<00:00:39.740> resistant<00:00:40.160> up<00:00:40.250> to

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
that's pretty much heat resistant up to

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.180 
that's pretty much heat resistant up to
about<00:00:40.490> 212<00:00:41.180> degrees<00:00:41.530> so<00:00:42.530> we'll<00:00:42.680> do<00:00:42.800> is<00:00:42.920> start

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
about 212 degrees so we'll do is start

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.700 
about 212 degrees so we'll do is start
off<00:00:43.720> season<00:00:44.720> our<00:00:44.810> chicken<00:00:44.840> for<00:00:45.260> the<00:00:45.320> Domenic

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.340 

last<00:01:20.620> minute<00:01:20.770> our<00:01:21.010> liquids<00:01:22.170> little<00:01:23.170> fresh

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.249 

a<00:01:28.439> little<00:01:29.070> bit<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.219> fresh<00:01:29.340> lemon<00:01:29.640> juice<00:01:30.259> want

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
a little bit of fresh lemon juice want

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.539 
a little bit of fresh lemon juice want
to<00:01:31.319> be<00:01:31.380> careful<00:01:31.619> liquids<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.249> you<00:01:32.310> put<00:01:32.460> in

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
to be careful liquids that you put in

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.160 
to be careful liquids that you put in
here<00:01:32.700> because<00:01:32.819> the<00:01:33.299> pressure<00:01:33.569> will<00:01:33.749> force<00:01:34.020> all

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
here because the pressure will force all

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.550 
here because the pressure will force all
the<00:01:34.289> liquid<00:01:34.679> into<00:01:35.399> your<00:01:35.670> meat<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.179> actually

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
the liquid into your meat so it actually

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.230 
the liquid into your meat so it actually
you<00:01:37.560> need<00:01:38.039> a<00:01:38.069> lot<00:01:38.280> less<00:01:38.310> marinating<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> lot

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
you need a lot less marinating a lot

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.969 
you need a lot less marinating a lot
less<00:01:39.420> liquid<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.109> too<00:01:40.350> much<00:01:40.469> acid<00:01:40.890> will

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
less liquid and too much acid will

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.469 
less liquid and too much acid will
actually<00:01:41.310> cure<00:01:41.609> the<00:01:41.729> chicken<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.209> you<00:01:42.270> want<00:01:42.420> to

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
actually cure the chicken so you want to

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.760 
actually cure the chicken so you want to
put<00:01:42.600> very<00:01:42.689> little<00:01:42.810> lemon<00:01:43.289> juice<00:01:43.439> in<00:01:43.590> here

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
put very little lemon juice in here

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.209 
put very little lemon juice in here
basically<00:01:45.409> pull<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> bag<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:46.979> watch

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
basically pull it the bag you can watch

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:48.679 
basically pull it the bag you can watch
what<00:01:47.429> it's<00:01:47.549> doing<00:01:47.789> it's<00:01:48.000> forcing<00:01:48.270> air<00:01:48.509> into

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
what it's doing it's forcing air into

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.870 
what it's doing it's forcing air into
the<00:01:48.929> bag<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.439> raising<00:01:50.099> atmospheric<00:01:50.640> pressure

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
the bag and raising atmospheric pressure

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.459 
the bag and raising atmospheric pressure
so<00:01:51.420> it'll<00:01:51.569> actually<00:01:51.630> look<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.229> boiling

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
so it'll actually look like it's boiling

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.190 
so it'll actually look like it's boiling
but<00:01:52.859> it's<00:01:52.979> cold<00:01:53.750> that's<00:01:54.750> all<00:01:54.929> the<00:01:55.049> air

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
but it's cold that's all the air

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.990 
but it's cold that's all the air
escaping<00:01:55.649> from<00:01:55.859> whatever<00:01:56.130> liquid<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.640> inside

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
escaping from whatever liquid is inside

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.260 
escaping from whatever liquid is inside
the<00:01:57.119> bag<00:01:58.490> and<00:01:59.490> once<00:01:59.670> it's<00:01:59.819> to<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.000> correct

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
the bag and once it's to the correct

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.569 
the bag and once it's to the correct
pressure<00:02:00.509> what<00:02:01.289> it'll<00:02:01.439> do<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.920> course<00:02:02.039> all

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
pressure what it'll do is of course all

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.520 
pressure what it'll do is of course all
the<00:02:02.729> liquid<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.149> marinade<00:02:03.509> into<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.349> meat<00:02:04.500> of

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
the liquid and marinade into the meat of

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.380 
the liquid and marinade into the meat of
the<00:02:04.649> chicken<00:02:04.879> so<00:02:05.879> it's<00:02:06.000> like<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.149> flash

ready<00:02:29.129> to<00:02:29.190> go<00:02:29.280> on<00:02:29.459> our<00:02:29.489> immersion<00:02:29.790> circulator

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
ready to go on our immersion circulator

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.849 
ready to go on our immersion circulator
so<00:02:30.900> what<00:02:31.049> we<00:02:31.140> have<00:02:31.260> here<00:02:31.470> is<00:02:31.530> our<00:02:31.620> immersion

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859 
so what we have here is our immersion

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.190 
so what we have here is our immersion
circulator<00:02:32.519> what<00:02:32.700> this<00:02:32.849> does<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.239> allows<00:02:33.510> you

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
circulator what this does is allows you

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.080 
circulator what this does is allows you
to<00:02:34.319> cook<00:02:34.500> in<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.739> liquid<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.370> keep<00:02:35.519> within<00:02:35.700> an

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
to cook in a liquid and keep within an

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.370 
to cook in a liquid and keep within an
accurate<00:02:36.420> temperature<00:02:36.599> than<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:36.959> tenth<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.290> a

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
accurate temperature than a tenth of a

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.990 
accurate temperature than a tenth of a
degree<00:02:37.470> in<00:02:37.829> this<00:02:37.950> case<00:02:38.160> we're<00:02:38.400> circulating<00:02:38.940> a

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
degree in this case we're circulating a

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.819 
degree in this case we're circulating a
water<00:02:39.180> bath<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:40.049> so<00:02:40.200> what<00:02:40.319> we'll<00:02:40.410> do<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:40.769> we

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
water bath and so what we'll do is we

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.190 
water bath and so what we'll do is we
have<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.040> sets<00:02:41.250> 140<00:02:41.910> degrees<00:02:42.209> we'll<00:02:42.989> do<00:02:43.109> is

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
have it sets 140 degrees we'll do is

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.409 
have it sets 140 degrees we'll do is
we'll<00:02:43.319> place<00:02:43.500> our<00:02:43.680> sous-vide<00:02:44.040> chicken<00:02:44.419> into

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:45.419 
we'll place our sous-vide chicken into

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.240 
we'll place our sous-vide chicken into
the<00:02:45.510> water<00:02:45.660> bath<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.109> they'll<00:02:46.829> remain<00:02:47.040> that

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
the water bath and they'll remain that

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.559 
the water bath and they'll remain that
for<00:02:47.340> about<00:02:47.430> 40<00:02:47.790> minutes<00:02:47.819> what<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:48.359> will<00:02:48.450> do

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
for about 40 minutes what that will do

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.059 
for about 40 minutes what that will do
is<00:02:48.599> little<00:02:48.810> part<00:02:49.079> cook<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.380> chicken<00:02:49.590> about

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
is little part cook the chicken about

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.030 
is little part cook the chicken about
3/4<00:02:50.639> of<00:02:50.669> the<00:02:50.790> way<00:02:50.880> allowing<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.810> we<00:02:52.709> picked<00:02:52.919> up

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
3/4 of the way allowing it we picked up

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.940 
3/4 of the way allowing it we picked up
faster<00:02:53.459> very<00:02:54.419> service<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.530> what<00:02:55.709> this<00:02:55.799> will

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
faster very service and what this will

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.949 
faster very service and what this will
do<00:02:56.069> this<00:02:56.340> this<00:02:56.760> water<00:02:57.000> bath<00:02:57.209> as<00:02:57.450> well<00:02:57.630> as<00:02:57.750> low

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
do this this water bath as well as low

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.780 
do this this water bath as well as low
temperature<00:02:58.470> or<00:02:58.620> low<00:02:58.799> locking<00:02:59.250> those<00:02:59.400> flavors

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
temperature or low locking those flavors

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.690
