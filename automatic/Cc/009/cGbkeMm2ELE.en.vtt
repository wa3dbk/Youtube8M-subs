00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.140
 who is afraid of burning the cake 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.090
 well this is the perfect recipe for 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.860

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.780

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.329
 I want to send greetings to katelyn cornejo 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.240
 from chile and a kiss to the tutorials 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.670
 there was a valence to validate and to aguilar 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.650
 jimenita ruiz who also follows me in 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.140
 facebook to jennifer come from baja 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.190
 california a kiss and thank you very much 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.530
 for writing me and let's start 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.860
 let's take a bag of flour 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.710
 prepared for vanilla flavor cake 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.180
 I told him it was going to be an easy recipe 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.370
 so let's save that step and 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.370
 so they do not have problems with that 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.350
 the quantities how much the powder for 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.960
 look and all that good let's buy 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.680
 a prepared one is also worth it and more if 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.680
 they are beginners 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.020
 here I already have everything in the flour and good 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.760
 we are simply going to follow the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.880
 instructions that our box gives us 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.530
 I have the oil I have the water and I have 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.450
 the three new ones that indicates the reverse of 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.930
 the box and I'm just going to mix it 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.930
 all 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.740
 and distribute our mixture in three parts 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.670
 same and here comes one of the parties 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.880
 funny 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.680
 let's take red dye 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.700
 let's start 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.700
 with a droplet 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.270
 here we are going to put a drop here we go 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.380
 to put two droplets and in the third 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.810
 well let's put three droplets a 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.860
 2. 3 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.480
 and with our spatula 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.480
 let's start stirring 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.660
 let's take our mold 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:42.580
 and we are going to oil very well and flour 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.920
 of this will depend on how easy or difficult 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.920
 let it be unmolding our biscuits 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.800
 for beginners I always learn in their 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.050
 oven 15 minutes before they put their 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.790
 cupcakes or their cakes their cookies 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.560
 because if it is not it will not be in the 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.020
 adequate temperature when they put them 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.850
 so that time is going to help the 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.400
 oven reach the standard temperature 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.620
 that are 180 degrees centigrade and that 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.630
 way your cookies your mobile your 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.800
 cakes are not going to go down and they're going to 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.900
 be perfect 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.630
 in this case our biscuits 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.870
 they need about 10 minutes because it's a 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.030
 very thin layer so be at 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.300
 pending so that they are not going to 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.300
 burn 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:46.050
 when they believe that this is ready, what 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:49.590
 what they're going to do is going to be getting it out and with 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.540
 a toothpick will puncture it if it already comes out 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.180
 clean the stick is that our cake 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.860
 is ready and they talk with our 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.010
 cupcakes are cooled let's ride 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:02.720
 cream to beat have to be fine 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.720
 cold to ride faster 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.990
 when it starts to take consistency 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.380
 already has a thicker consistency 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.560
 let's add two or three tablespoons of 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.560
 sugar 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.450
 and we will continue to beat until it 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.450
 finish riding 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.470
 two 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.470
 to 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.349
 delicious and what I'm going to do is going to be 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.940
 that I'm going to cut them a little bit 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:35.190
 shores 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:39.630
 I'm going to take a smaller diameter plate 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:42.570
 is all 23 and this measures 21 20 more 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.460
 or less so that's the only thing I'm going to 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.080
 cut nothing else I'm going to cut back the 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.060
 outline of each 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.229
 and I'm going to take a rita knife 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.229
 like this 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.380
 and I'm going to follow the outline with the 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.380
 knife 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.770
 once my biscuits are cut and the 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.100
 I'm going to put on the plate where they're going to 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:16.070
 this is going to be my plate and with a 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:16.070
 fork I'm going to puncture the whole cake 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.160
 and I'm going to take a broccoli and a syrup 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.410
 simple 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.050
 and we're just going to wet it 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.580
 little to make it more juicy 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.760
 inside the next thing we're going to do 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.350
 well let's get our cream for 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.310
 beat that we reserve 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.310
 of this shake 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.560
 and we are going to put a layer 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.949
 generous or with a spoon with something 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.949
 that we are going to extend 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.610
 that is more or less short 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.289
 and now let's put a layer of 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:07.500
 Business 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:10.350
 and we will continue with our other layer 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.420
 remember that we paint them in colors 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.580
 so they have to put the layer of the 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.820
 color that follows either the clearest 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.860
 the strongest or the other way around 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.860
 and we repeat the same procedure 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.970
 i 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.040
 two
