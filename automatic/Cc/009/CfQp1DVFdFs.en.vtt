00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.970
 so sick excitedly logs back to 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.960
 service I have heard me to the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.320
 which also totally hurt the topic 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.320
 our What's next 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.210
 We expect all diligently 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.199
 on it but the customer of the customer 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.880
 gt-r wanted bigger camps again 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.279
 before that the 35 degrees were inside 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.520
 now are larger load and that 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.110
 much larger turbocharger 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.750
 I did not prepare that far either 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.219
 yes it sounds funny but so is me 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.079
 have looked at differently 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:58.640
 so you can not be one i hear 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:01:01.859
 I hear modified green 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.390
 partly in any case the compressor 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.630
 that was in there before that's normal 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:12.390
 garrett gtx fabric I'll say 35 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.659
 Compressor is in good condition 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.220
 but not enough for us which is not rich 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.250
 Once the weight and compressor was 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.619
 a bit too high and the mounting position of 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.450
 It is ok but dimensions were 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.420
 and balancing was absolutely not in the frame 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.820
 so it starts the modification once 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.470
 we have one by and large 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.189
 significantly larger compressor plus us 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.799
 have 11.6 grams of loss in weight at 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.030
 our larger compressor 11 6 grams 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.750
 It's easier to do that when I come 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.890
 It looks at the pad of the mother 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.840
 it is quite nice to see them 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.720
 pad of the mother he is now 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.250
 matching the finished one gives away yes 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.540
 at the moment when you look at this 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.149
 normal because i have this big mom 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.640
 on it pops you give away, so to speak 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.159
 speck area as where the location of 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.870
 can air in to suck the engine with 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.820
 given away because a plane surface is 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.960
 because the mother but since it is the 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.500
 mother does not have to do anything great 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.080
 hold 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.150
 thus, as you can see here 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.130
 optimized surface the mother is the same 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.050
 big as the head of the compressor that 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.120
 means we have more area we have 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.970
 more power area which was really very 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.040
 good and by and large we have 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.840
 the open total area because I 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.730
 that has grown five millimeters so 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.069
 which flows out for you the lower one 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.030
 area is 5 mm larger than the 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.830
 normal gtx ag 35 degrees from but it 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.900
 Does not make the great music from the 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.760
 big difference is that the 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.920
 material quality really much much higher 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.450
 that is really the point and 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.840
 due to the better material quality 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.660
 we can do the following and 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.190
 Although you think about painters 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.720
 many people say a comment 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.540
 she always sounds good when a statement 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.489
 and indeed the wing thick vidic such a 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.110
 wing is really big if you want to 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.450
 limits want to go with even that 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.549
 interesting because that is so binner 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.170
 these wings are even more so 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.780
 we have an air column in the 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.570
 Loader rows marched all the more point 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.890
 We have space when we have the wings 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.700
 build as thin as ours 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.660
 see compressor 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.970
 yes, we are a third thinner than 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.190
 the compressor wheels full normal gay 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.480
 are already planning here 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:29.329
 We have a compressor area before 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:32.220
 of 11 5 mm and we now have 0 64 mm 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.260
 material thickness on the wing rat and the 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.329
 makes the music out because you have the 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.530
 air column rows marched he needs 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.160
 just not the compressor anymore 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.590
 lots of space 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.140
 he also consumes space we need 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.030
 almost every square millimeter point 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.299
 surface in the fan itself circulated 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.239
 to fall through the lara that was 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.320
 really shown how the music make up 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.459
 Now we have the other one if we 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.530
 take a look here 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.820
 if you look here then we see 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.380
 namely up here the surface of the 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.030
 mother is balanced and the whole 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.700
 history with 130,000 turn around 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.430
 balanced 130000 rotation is already one 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.110
 a lot of wood is still enough for us 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.260
 is by and large not what we 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.100
 In addition, this is uli 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.680
 the surface is emitted 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.329
 many think the polished surfaces 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.280
 but the efficiency is not 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.410
 this radiant her own says once 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.210
 for that the material strength of the 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.550
 If I get a little higher your vote will be 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.550
 fuck you believe so a bit 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.780
 the falls will have something 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.880
 Of course, this is rough 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.860
 surface the air breaks something 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.450
 and we have a clearer air column 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.220
 I have to think we can reach the 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.290
 sound velocity in front of the compressor 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.919
 and this air makes sense 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.840
 lahde in 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.880
 that means we have to be every efficiency 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.500
 you have to air it so almost so easily 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.290
 make it as possible to come in 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.970
 that's sort of the pour the 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.460
 favorite disco niederrhein want to go 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.830
 Of course, that does not bother you 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.750
 you know ahead of time and you see 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.330
 then this gorge put on patent shoes 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.850
 you do not bother with it at all 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.600
 you come in so it can be the plant 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.910
 also introduce 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.490
 we just make life easier 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.610
 for the lada so that everything is pure 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:12.100
 we will have virtually paint shoes 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.460
 Tightened and on the turbocharger with him 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.680
 Come in, I think I want one 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.169
 wants to stay a bit 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.700
 whole sick as well as meters 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.100
 strict 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.810
 In any case exhaust side are in the 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.890
 remained loyal to both 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:31.870
 village is not there is homemade 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.600
 Self-balanced self-production 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.070
 and I think we are really there 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.470
 got along very well 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:42.580
 the desired performance potential of 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:45.270
 colada I will not betray because of 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.270
 Customer does not want that 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.459
 so get the video out of their art 

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:53.499
 if he was just cut off from the 

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:56.469
 daniel eckert was passive comic 

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:58.929
 the camera apparently you have to 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:01.359
 Calculating smears because I'm sick 

00:05:58.929 --> 00:06:03.309
 this is video is a pity 

00:06:01.359 --> 00:06:04.959
 are all subject and I actually 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:10.659
 really like a schnitzel to be happy 

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:15.249
 but i can not scream i hear it 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:17.529
 not in any case performance potential 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:19.059
 what can pump a long I will 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:21.759
 Do not betray because the customer has me 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:22.779
 I do not want any point on that 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:24.759
 that is not said 

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:27.489
 but I can tell you through the 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:29.199
 modification of GTX gt 35x stock in 

00:06:27.489 --> 00:06:34.059
 that's what we have now that's it 

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:36.549
 a lot of wood a lot us now 

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:39.699
 The whole stuff is tinkered together 

00:06:36.549 --> 00:06:41.319
 and then the videos get more moving too 

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:48.339
 sign because then it starts 

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:50.349
 have already applauded for one 

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:55.589
 dennis that filmed me the fabian 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:55.589
 how else but the dennis on hello
