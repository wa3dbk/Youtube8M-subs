the<00:00:42.970> other<00:00:43.059> one<00:00:43.239> and<00:00:43.840> we're<00:00:43.960> constantly

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
the other one and we're constantly

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.170 
the other one and we're constantly
coating<00:00:44.890> it<00:00:45.010> with<00:00:45.129> a<00:00:45.160> citric<00:00:45.489> acid<00:00:45.760> solution

coating it with a citric acid solution

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.689 
coating it with a citric acid solution
the<00:00:46.540> intention<00:00:46.989> there<00:00:47.199> is<00:00:47.410> to<00:00:47.650> purge<00:00:48.400> the

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
the intention there is to purge the

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:49.950 
the intention there is to purge the
aggressive<00:00:49.090> chloride<00:00:49.449> salts<00:00:49.780> on<00:00:49.900> the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
aggressive chloride salts on the

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.720 
aggressive chloride salts on the
structure<00:00:50.350> and<00:00:50.589> make<00:00:50.980> it<00:00:51.100> safe<00:00:51.339> enough<00:00:51.580> for

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
structure and make it safe enough for

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:59.979 
structure and make it safe enough for
display

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.319 

there's<00:01:00.920> a<00:01:00.980> lot<00:01:01.250> of<00:01:01.550> work<00:01:01.879> being<00:01:02.120> done<00:01:02.180> on

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
there's a lot of work being done on

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.210 
there's a lot of work being done on
recovering<00:01:02.899> metal<00:01:03.320> objects<00:01:03.800> from<00:01:03.950> the<00:01:04.040> sea

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
recovering metal objects from the sea

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.310 
recovering metal objects from the sea
but<00:01:04.369> not<00:01:04.610> very<00:01:04.760> much<00:01:04.970> on<00:01:05.180> aluminium<00:01:05.900> aluminium

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
but not very much on aluminium aluminium

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.960 
but not very much on aluminium aluminium
doesn't<00:01:06.860> normally<00:01:06.950> survive<00:01:07.400> for<00:01:07.610> this<00:01:07.729> long

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
doesn't normally survive for this long

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.910 
doesn't normally survive for this long
so<00:01:08.300> they're<00:01:08.570> in<00:01:08.900> conservation<00:01:09.260> typically<00:01:09.860> is

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
so they're in conservation typically is

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.640 
so they're in conservation typically is
very<00:01:10.130> mild<00:01:10.340> acids<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.180> things<00:01:11.420> like<00:01:11.650> vinegar

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
very mild acids so things like vinegar

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.800 
very mild acids so things like vinegar
and<00:01:12.860> lemon<00:01:13.040> juice<00:01:13.190> and<00:01:13.670> carbonic<00:01:14.300> acid<00:01:14.690> all

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
and lemon juice and carbonic acid all

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.570 
and lemon juice and carbonic acid all
those<00:01:14.990> stuff<00:01:15.229> that<00:01:15.409> we<00:01:15.500> cook<00:01:15.650> they're<00:01:15.830> natural

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
those stuff that we cook they're natural

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.820 
those stuff that we cook they're natural
they're<00:01:16.610> not<00:01:16.970> very<00:01:17.150> aggressive<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:18.200> basing<00:01:18.710> it

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
they're not very aggressive so basing it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.260 
they're not very aggressive so basing it
on<00:01:18.920> one<00:01:19.190> of<00:01:19.220> those<00:01:19.340> types<00:01:19.610> of<00:01:19.700> formulations

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
on one of those types of formulations

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.060 
on one of those types of formulations
was<00:01:20.420> where<00:01:20.600> we<00:01:20.690> started

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.850 

this<00:01:25.820> is<00:01:25.970> very<00:01:26.180> much<00:01:26.300> new<00:01:26.990> science<00:01:27.470> when<00:01:27.710> we're

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
this is very much new science when we're

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.290 
this is very much new science when we're
pioneering<00:01:28.280> a<00:01:28.400> new<00:01:28.430> methodology<00:01:29.090> a<00:01:29.120> new

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
pioneering a new methodology a new

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.550 
pioneering a new methodology a new
technology<00:01:29.840> but<00:01:29.990> it's<00:01:30.110> progressing

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
technology but it's progressing

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.200 
technology but it's progressing
exceptionally<00:01:31.130> well<00:01:31.310> we've<00:01:31.850> managed<00:01:32.150> to

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
exceptionally well we've managed to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.080 
exceptionally well we've managed to
clean<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.810> fuselage<00:01:33.650> exterior<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:34.310> far<00:01:34.490> we're

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
clean the fuselage exterior so far we're

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.310 
clean the fuselage exterior so far we're
now<00:01:35.180> focusing<00:01:35.660> on<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.870> interior<00:01:36.229> the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
now focusing on the interior the

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.530 
now focusing on the interior the
fuselage<00:01:36.770> across<00:01:36.979> the<00:01:37.130> wings<00:01:37.310> but<00:01:38.090> so<00:01:38.330> far

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
fuselage across the wings but so far

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.500 
fuselage across the wings but so far
we're<00:01:38.810> very<00:01:38.990> very<00:01:39.140> encouraged

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.680 

my<00:01:42.140> role<00:01:42.350> in<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.650> project<00:01:42.680> is<00:01:43.400> to<00:01:43.690> conserve

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
my role in the project is to conserve

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.290 
my role in the project is to conserve
these<00:01:44.960> smaller<00:01:45.380> artifact<00:01:46.010> components<00:01:46.730> they

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
these smaller artifact components they

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.330 
these smaller artifact components they
come<00:01:47.510> out<00:01:47.630> of<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.960> tunnel<00:01:48.140> that<00:01:48.830> get<00:01:49.040> logged

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
come out of the tunnel that get logged

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.030 
come out of the tunnel that get logged
photographed<00:01:50.060> and<00:01:50.420> then<00:01:50.450> they<00:01:50.810> get<00:01:50.960> worked<00:01:51.230> by

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
photographed and then they get worked by

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.450 
photographed and then they get worked by
team<00:01:52.340> of<00:01:52.520> our<00:01:52.670> team<00:01:53.420> of<00:01:53.570> volunteers

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.790 

well<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.090> dawnia<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.750> obviously<00:02:01.350> an<00:02:01.440> original

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
well the dawnia is obviously an original

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.170 
well the dawnia is obviously an original
aeroplane<00:02:02.160> and<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.550> only<00:02:02.670> dawnie<00:02:03.060> that

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
aeroplane and it's the only dawnie that

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.760 
aeroplane and it's the only dawnie that
we<00:02:03.270> know<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.390> anywhere<00:02:03.690> in<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.870> world<00:02:04.050> to

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
we know of anywhere in the world to

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.290 
we know of anywhere in the world to
restore<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.340> back<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.580> pristine<00:02:06.270> condition

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
restore it back to pristine condition

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.820 
restore it back to pristine condition
like<00:02:06.900> the<00:02:07.050> aeroplane<00:02:07.230> you<00:02:07.410> see<00:02:07.530> around<00:02:07.650> you

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
like the aeroplane you see around you

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.109 
like the aeroplane you see around you
here<00:02:07.860> there's<00:02:08.280> no<00:02:08.399> point<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.670> doing<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.940> we

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
here there's no point in doing that we

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.070 
here there's no point in doing that we
wouldn't<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.420> an<00:02:09.479> original<00:02:09.660> little<00:02:09.960> plane

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
wouldn't have an original little plane

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.720 
wouldn't have an original little plane
anymore<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.590> then<00:02:10.800> versus<00:02:11.100> very<00:02:11.310> much<00:02:11.460> is<00:02:11.610> on

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
anymore so then versus very much is on

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.210
