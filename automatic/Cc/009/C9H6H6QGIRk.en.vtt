00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 Hi everyone, today I would like to show you the 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.540
 first of all, it is actually the second 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:14.790
 necklace up taxes I realized 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:19.189
 and it is this they are very sincerely 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:23.789
 proud of the result because in reality 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.590
 the idea was not was born along the way not 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.099
 I wanted to make a necklace I had 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.349
 made these two modules with 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.620
 beads as I show it so I had 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:39.180
 made these two modules so 1 and 2 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.870
 and the intention was to create 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.670
 some earrings 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:49.770
 let's say I never start from a drawing 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:53.850
 and then created things then occasionally 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:57.510
 wins the po and I have to study summaries a 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.550
 little creation 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.710
 in short, at this point I had 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.120
 these two solitary modules and me 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.769
 they looked a little big for gods 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.869
 earrings although they would actually be 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.110
 anyway I could have left them 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.750
 so because they use in large earrings 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.000
 but I was a little uncertain then I have them 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.070
 left aside for at least one 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.130
 ta week waiting for me came 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:25.110
 inspiration and then what I did 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.360
 I added this form was a 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.780
 ring that I dressed insulted if 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.799
 there is a gelding inside this crystal 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:37.530
 then surrounded him with this others 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:43.170
 da daughter of su touch and this chain of 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:47.189
 rhinestones always on the color and rosin e 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.460
 gradually or added the others the others 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:54.270
 for lines both here and this I think 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.200
 these two elements always made with the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.729
 rhinestone chain and this was born 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.860
 necklace that they originally had 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.759
 but being two earrings is a lot 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.400
 happy on my facebook page I have 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.240
 also put the photo of 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:16.040
 as it appears as worn I added 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.810
 you can see these two wires in place 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.590
 of the chain that seemed to me 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:25.490
 much more suitable and I'll show you the 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:29.810
 the back of which also I am very 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:34.010
 fair I have to tell the truth because often 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.860
 you see the backs a little terrible if 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.900
 sense that a little dried up here we say 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.280
 this is how I find it a lot 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.200
 beautiful 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.480
 I decided to dress it completely 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.910
 because I could have left free ad 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:52.340
 example these spaces here of the chains 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.180
 to show the workmanship because here 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.340
 there were no seams but I don't like it 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.360
 leave the pieces vows so I almost have 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.730
 always the ribery towards creations 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.720
 completely this is a feint 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:11.959
 alcantara leather penn call you think of 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:16.820
 yes indeed as you can see below yes 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:22.120
 They see a little white part because it does not 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:26.180
 being skin the part below is white 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.670
 in short, this is the back then moreover 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.209
 I could have also dressed her with del 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.550
 filter but I thought that on the contrary 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.930
 of the earrings the necklace we say 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.200
 almost always in contact with the skin 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.970
 then then three perfumes sweat etc. 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.150
 it could have been somehow 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.370
 dirty the filter while this is a lot 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.019
 I find it much nicer 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.239
 I'll show you the first necklace instead 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.209
 absolutely that I had made up 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.459
 taxes that I kept for myself that is this 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.590
 it is really very simple because it is 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:01.820
 the first necklace experiment I have 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:05.430
 did not want to say let's overdo it then 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:09.430
 I am a very simple type is not that 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.470
 I use too obvious and therefore jewels 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.329
 I had created this I created this 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.790
 obviously on black because I'm a little bit 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:20.380
 mortise in winter towards almost always of 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:22.590
 black and let's say it's made similar to 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.020
 this is because this is also the lanyard 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.020
 as a chain and also on the 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:33.509
 the back is covered in real leather 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:36.190
 I had a remnant of black leather and 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:38.889
 nothing I've already worn and so e 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:44.139
 as you can see it has no sign 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:47.020
 closing on human with e are a lot 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.150
 happy also with this that the necklaces 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.430
 ended up here I wanted to show then 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.729
 of the games there are some earrings that 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:05:00.580
 I created with hard stones that I am 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:03.520
 these and these little bits of how it is 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.910
 call watermark here I was not coming to 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:10.270
 term this is a couple are all 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:16.840
 unique pieces because I had few watermarks 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:24.310
 a few stones and a few nice pins this 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:26.710
 this is one of these very elegant ones 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:32.050
 stone should be agate if not me 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:34.510
 mistake is a hard stone is not plastic 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.970
 even these very beautiful and then the 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.530
 this last is a little simpler 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:46.539
 couple can also this should be 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:48.970
 agata here they are all about their why 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:52.750
 I had these figured gold and then I have them 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:54.639
 done so and nothing for the moment 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.110
 this is all a pretty video 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:00.720
 fast 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.720
 I greet you bye
