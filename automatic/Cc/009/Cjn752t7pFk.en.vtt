00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
information that no one else could have

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.700 
information that no one else could have
found<00:01:42.390> i<00:01:42.600> could<00:01:42.630> have<00:01:42.899> easily<00:01:43.020> found<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.590> I

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
found i could have easily found it I

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.560 
found i could have easily found it I
just<00:01:43.890> haven't<00:01:44.310> looked<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.700> it<00:01:45.000> like<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.360> and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
just haven't looked for it like that and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.420 
just haven't looked for it like that and
maybe<00:01:46.079> she<00:01:46.290> didn't<00:01:46.439> even<00:01:46.649> find<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.100> maybe<00:01:47.250> she

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
maybe she didn't even find it maybe she

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.590 
maybe she didn't even find it maybe she
just<00:01:47.460> looked<00:01:47.759> on<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:48.030> form<00:01:48.329> there's

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
just looked on like form there's

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.609 
just looked on like form there's
something<00:01:48.780> like<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.020> anyway<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.590> doesn't

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
something like that anyway so it doesn't

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.859 
something like that anyway so it doesn't
really<00:01:49.950> matter<00:01:50.180> it's<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.689> could<00:01:51.840> be

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
really matter it's just that it could be

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.660 
really matter it's just that it could be
you<00:01:52.170> know<00:01:52.290> found<00:01:52.590> for<00:01:52.829> anyone<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.369> still

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
you know found for anyone but I still

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.789 
you know found for anyone but I still
want<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.939> give<00:01:54.060> credit<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.720> person<00:01:55.470> who

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
want to give credit to the person who

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.459 
want to give credit to the person who
did<00:01:56.009> find<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.430> first<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.909> believe<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.469> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
did find it first I believe so the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.200 
did find it first I believe so the
things<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.130> we're<00:01:59.280> going<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.640> going<00:01:59.969> over

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
things that we're going to be going over

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.690 
things that we're going to be going over
first<00:02:00.810> is<00:02:01.079> going<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.799> be<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.009> heat<00:02:02.189> run<00:02:02.430> event

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
first is going to be the heat run event

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.670 
first is going to be the heat run event
so<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.810> first<00:02:03.990> one<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.200> going<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.500> be<00:02:04.590> of

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
so the first one is going to be of

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.530 
so the first one is going to be of
course<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.009> heater<00:02:05.280> nepean<00:02:05.549> whoa<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.149> hear

an<00:03:13.880> aerial<00:03:14.209> view<00:03:14.239> because<00:03:14.930> you<00:03:15.170> can<00:03:15.290> actually

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
an aerial view because you can actually

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.740 
an aerial view because you can actually
point<00:03:16.070> out<00:03:16.370> three<00:03:16.730> pokemon<00:03:16.970> one<00:03:17.510> of<00:03:17.630> them

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
point out three pokemon one of them

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.199 
point out three pokemon one of them
being<00:03:17.959> shandler<00:03:18.530> on<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.769> bottom<00:03:19.160> so<00:03:19.760> rock<00:03:20.000> on

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
being shandler on the bottom so rock on

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.810 
being shandler on the bottom so rock on
the<00:03:20.330> top<00:03:20.570> and<00:03:20.900> it<00:03:21.380> looks<00:03:21.590> like<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:22.190> other<00:03:22.580> one

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
the top and it looks like the other one

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.520 
the top and it looks like the other one
is<00:03:23.030> actually<00:03:24.370> pyro<00:03:25.370> is<00:03:25.730> last<00:03:26.120> one<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.600> you<00:03:27.410> can

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
is actually pyro is last one and you can

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.070 
is actually pyro is last one and you can
see<00:03:27.769> their<00:03:28.010> faces<00:03:28.360> now<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:29.420> strange<00:03:29.810> thing<00:03:30.049> is

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
see their faces now the strange thing is

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.979 
see their faces now the strange thing is
we<00:03:30.470> cannot<00:03:30.709> identify<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.730> last<00:03:32.060> one<00:03:32.360> so<00:03:32.690> maybe

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
we cannot identify the last one so maybe

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.050 
we cannot identify the last one so maybe
that<00:03:33.260> leads<00:03:33.500> up<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:33.980> volcanium<00:03:34.610> pokemon

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
that leads up to the volcanium pokemon

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.180 
that leads up to the volcanium pokemon
or<00:03:35.209> some<00:03:35.390> other<00:03:35.570> fire-type<00:03:36.140> pokemon<00:03:36.350> maybe

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
or some other fire-type pokemon maybe

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.220 
or some other fire-type pokemon maybe
it's<00:03:37.430> a<00:03:37.519> bronze<00:03:37.820> on<00:03:38.120> maybe<00:03:38.450> it's<00:03:38.660> a<00:03:38.750> prong<00:03:38.989> so

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
it's a bronze on maybe it's a prong so

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.840 
it's a bronze on maybe it's a prong so
we<00:03:39.380> simply<00:03:39.769> do<00:03:39.920> not<00:03:39.950> know<00:03:40.220> what<00:03:40.340> that<00:03:40.489> pokemon

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
we simply do not know what that pokemon

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.670 
we simply do not know what that pokemon
is<00:03:41.030> people<00:03:41.690> are<00:03:41.810> saying<00:03:42.019> if<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.320> bring<00:03:42.530> these

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
is people are saying if you bring these

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.170 
is people are saying if you bring these
for<00:03:42.739> Pokemon<00:03:43.340> though<00:03:43.489> to<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:43.760> center<00:03:44.030> though

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
for Pokemon though to the center though

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.080 
for Pokemon though to the center though
you<00:03:44.239> will<00:03:44.510> have<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.930> battle<00:03:45.799> with<00:03:45.829> or<00:03:46.370> you<00:03:46.940> will

you will have a battle with or you will

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.060 
you will have a battle with or you will
be<00:03:47.239> able<00:03:47.390> to<00:03:47.540> encounter<00:03:47.840> Zekrom<00:03:48.560> or<00:03:48.769> Russia

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
be able to encounter Zekrom or Russia

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.610 
be able to encounter Zekrom or Russia
Ram<00:03:49.420> something<00:03:50.420> like<00:03:50.570> that<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:50.989> that's

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
Ram something like that and that's

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.180 
Ram something like that and that's
really<00:03:52.250> interesting<00:03:52.579> so<00:03:53.390> who<00:03:53.780> knows<00:03:53.989> the<00:03:54.980> next

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
really interesting so who knows the next

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.259 
really interesting so who knows the next
one<00:03:55.340> I<00:03:55.370> want<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:55.610> talk<00:03:55.760> about<00:03:55.790> is<00:03:56.239> the

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
one I want to talk about is the

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.840 
one I want to talk about is the
possibility<00:03:57.049> of<00:03:57.320> there<00:03:57.950> being<00:03:57.980> a<00:03:58.310> fifth<00:03:58.549> form

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
possibility of there being a fifth form

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.330 
possibility of there being a fifth form
of<00:03:59.090> deoxys<00:03:59.750> because<00:04:00.110> think<00:04:00.799> about<00:04:00.890> it<00:04:01.190> there

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
of deoxys because think about it there

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.340 
of deoxys because think about it there
are<00:04:01.370> four<00:04:01.790> rocks<00:04:02.090> there<00:04:02.420> that<00:04:02.900> you<00:04:02.959> can<00:04:03.110> use<00:04:03.230> to

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
are four rocks there that you can use to

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.560 
are four rocks there that you can use to
change<00:04:03.380> deoxys<00:04:04.340> actually<00:04:05.120> know<00:04:05.239> there<00:04:05.450> are

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
change deoxys actually know there are

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.199 
change deoxys actually know there are
five<00:04:05.900> which<00:04:06.739> means<00:04:07.040> could<00:04:07.670> there<00:04:07.820> be<00:04:07.850> a<00:04:07.970> mega

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
five which means could there be a mega

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.670 
five which means could there be a mega
evolution<00:04:08.840> could<00:04:08.959> they<00:04:09.049> be<00:04:09.170> just<00:04:09.380> be<00:04:09.470> another

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
evolution could they be just be another

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.250 
evolution could they be just be another
form<00:04:10.160> who<00:04:10.760> really<00:04:11.090> knows<00:04:11.269> if<00:04:11.510> it<00:04:11.660> gets<00:04:11.840> a<00:04:11.959> mega

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
form who really knows if it gets a mega

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.229 
form who really knows if it gets a mega
evolution<00:04:12.890> is<00:04:13.100> going<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.370> destroy<00:04:13.670> everything

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
evolution is going to destroy everything

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.259 
evolution is going to destroy everything
in<00:04:14.390> the<00:04:14.540> entire<00:04:14.660> world<00:04:14.810> that<00:04:15.650> we<00:04:15.860> do<00:04:16.160> know<00:04:16.370> but

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
in the entire world that we do know but

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.150 
in the entire world that we do know but
there<00:04:17.540> is<00:04:17.720> five<00:04:18.049> rocks<00:04:18.350> here<00:04:18.530> instead<00:04:18.769> of<00:04:18.829> four

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
there is five rocks here instead of four

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.270 
there is five rocks here instead of four
why<00:04:19.400> would<00:04:19.640> that<00:04:19.760> be<00:04:20.020> who<00:04:21.020> knows<00:04:21.200> I'm<00:04:21.770> assuming

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
why would that be who knows I'm assuming

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.190 
why would that be who knows I'm assuming
the<00:04:22.640> Oxus<00:04:22.940> will<00:04:23.090> get<00:04:23.210> some<00:04:23.450> sort<00:04:23.690> of<00:04:23.720> new<00:04:23.900> form

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
the Oxus will get some sort of new form

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.879 
the Oxus will get some sort of new form
or

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
or

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.920 
or
it<00:04:25.129> will<00:04:25.249> just<00:04:25.430> get<00:04:25.610> a<00:04:25.879> mega<00:04:26.090> evolution<00:04:26.719> which

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
it will just get a mega evolution which

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.020 
it will just get a mega evolution which
is<00:04:27.169> technically<00:04:27.800> a<00:04:27.889> new<00:04:28.069> form<00:04:28.370> too<00:04:28.580> so<00:04:28.879> we

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
is technically a new form too so we

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.390 
is technically a new form too so we
don't<00:04:29.120> know<00:04:29.300> about<00:04:29.419> that<00:04:29.599> either<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:30.889> ice<00:04:31.189> and

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
don't know about that either the ice and

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.409 
don't know about that either the ice and
we<00:04:31.490> actually<00:04:31.610> don't<00:04:31.849> know<00:04:31.999> about<00:04:32.120> yet<00:04:32.360> is

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
we actually don't know about yet is

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.080 
we actually don't know about yet is
actually<00:04:33.080> where<00:04:33.319> is<00:04:33.529> the<00:04:33.979> news<00:04:34.490> director<00:04:34.729> or

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
actually where is the news director or

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.439 
actually where is the news director or
the<00:04:35.120> you<00:04:35.539> know<00:04:35.659> the<00:04:35.840> head<00:04:36.349> person<00:04:36.650> of<00:04:37.129> the<00:04:37.449> the

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
the you know the head person of the the

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:40.809 
the you know the head person of the the

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:43.149 
bureau and she's actually missing and
that<00:04:41.060> is<00:04:41.330> kind<00:04:42.110> of<00:04:42.259> strange<00:04:42.409> because<00:04:42.710> it

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:43.159 
that is kind of strange because it

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:45.279 
that is kind of strange because it
there's<00:04:43.819> a<00:04:43.939> memo<00:04:44.300> on<00:04:44.449> her<00:04:44.659> desk<00:04:44.900> saying<00:04:45.080> that
