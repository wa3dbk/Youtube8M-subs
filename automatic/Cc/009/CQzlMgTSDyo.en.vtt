00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:07.930
 hello everyone on all line I am 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:09.940
 cream h yo we are in -1 today we are going to 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.480
 analyze the review of a new way to 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.630
 version 1.7 point 10 and 1.7 point 2 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.700
 called go and stage mode and this mode what 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.520
 what it does is take advantage of the experience 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.039
 that in minecraft by default I did not have 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.140
 much more useful that is, I did not go beyond 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.449
 of enchantments then with this mode 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.580
 yes we can use the experience to 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.570
 do to improve the skills of 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.239
 our character 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.449
 for example this mode does not add any 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.489
 type of button to send us to another 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.309
 interface or anything here we give the 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.859
 key and yes that makes us is so that it 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.260
 create as a kind of interface and here 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:49.300
 As you can see, there are different icons 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.329
 example there are many I have not looked at them 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.690
 all this serves for every time I give 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.899
 I give nothing faster and here it puts 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:03.010
 cost 6x p this is not the six levels 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:05.140
 of xp are like six dashes of this is 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.530
 I do not know it's a bit weird I still do not 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.840
 I understand it does not end 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.659
 but you're going to need a lot 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.430
 quite experience for example 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.850
 this 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.290
 the explosions do less damage to you this 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.690
 jump is faster I'm going to try 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.770
 some for you to see them 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.470
 such the highest level is 25 in all 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.050
 this would be to go more and more to go more 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.120
 fast catch more speed this to 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.190
 fall of pen and there he says the blocks 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.490
 that you're not going to hurt yourself in three like 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.860
 we like 941 and this is going up 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.570
 to swim more and different options that 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.880
 I 'm not going to analyze all of them in this 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.250
 video if you ask me can I analyze them 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.500
 in detail in another video and by 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.680
 example to mehmet and I've put the group 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.790
 of salt run faster and jump 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:00.300
 60% more and 100 percent swim 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.270
 that is, this has to be the milk look 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.940
 As you can see, I'm going faster, the damage 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.580
 fall is what I like the least but 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.450
 Well, well, I'm going to say it should be 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.450
 time 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.959
 perfect and this would be all pretty 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.180
 It is quite useful to me now is good 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.340
 hitting a few downs of this is because 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.680
 I'm jumping so much and as you see here 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.260
 by the water you see that I go much more 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.770
 fast it seems that he has very good 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.140
 installed and all that seems so if 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.830
 I'm going, I'm going quite a lot 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.900
 fast and good guys this is this is 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.870
 all the way of pretty little thing but 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.660
 the truth that also of certain things 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.090
 that in minecraft they should be 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.280
 already by without having to add any mode 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.440
 but I hope you liked it 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.299
 like comment and share and we 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.130
 we see in the next also kids 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.720
