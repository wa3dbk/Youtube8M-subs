of a lead over mcCluggage he's shaking

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.350 
of a lead over mcCluggage he's shaking
his<00:04:33.169> head<00:04:33.410> a<00:04:33.470> bit<00:04:33.710> Victor<00:04:34.640> Sheldon<00:04:35.030> has<00:04:35.150> led

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
his head a bit Victor Sheldon has led

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.130 
his head a bit Victor Sheldon has led
from<00:04:35.480> start<00:04:35.930> and<00:04:36.490> he<00:04:37.490> hopes<00:04:37.669> to<00:04:37.910> finish<00:04:38.240> that's

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
from start and he hopes to finish that's

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.230 
from start and he hopes to finish that's
that<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.770> finish<00:04:40.100> goes<00:04:40.340> the<00:04:40.610> victor<00:04:40.970> shelf

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
that the finish goes the victor shelf

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.580 
that the finish goes the victor shelf
and<00:04:41.450> I<00:04:41.480> think<00:04:41.720> he<00:04:41.810> might<00:04:41.960> have<00:04:42.020> tried<00:04:42.290> to<00:04:42.350> do<00:04:42.560> a

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.150 
and I think he might have tried to do a
little<00:04:42.740> showboating<00:04:43.370> on<00:04:43.460> that<00:04:43.640> bunny
