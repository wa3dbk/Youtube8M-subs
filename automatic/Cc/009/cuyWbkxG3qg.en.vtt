00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.890 
that's so important in today's society
just<00:00:14.219> well<00:00:14.639> first<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.120> all<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.360> kind<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.750> think

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
just well first of all I kind of think

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.140 
just well first of all I kind of think
that<00:00:16.109> when<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.770> Bush<00:00:16.949> era<00:00:17.160> came<00:00:17.580> in<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.029> then

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
that when the Bush era came in and then

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.730 
that when the Bush era came in and then
the<00:00:18.240> second<00:00:18.570> one<00:00:18.600> came<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:19.470> know<00:00:19.500> this

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
the second one came in you know this

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.470 
the second one came in you know this
whole<00:00:19.920> notion<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.400> being<00:00:21.000> politically

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
whole notion of being politically

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.840 
whole notion of being politically
correct<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.960> really<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.410> comedy<00:00:22.769> killer<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.279> so

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
correct is really a comedy killer and so

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.509 
correct is really a comedy killer and so
I<00:00:24.210> think<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.930> some<00:00:24.960> ways<00:00:25.260> when<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.369> nation

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
I think in some ways when the nation

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.939 
I think in some ways when the nation
turns<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.240> far<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.599> right<00:00:27.630> then<00:00:28.470> believe

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
turns so far to the right then believe

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.140 
turns so far to the right then believe
it<00:00:29.010> or<00:00:29.039> not<00:00:29.099> more<00:00:29.400> people<00:00:29.699> started<00:00:29.910> coming<00:00:30.000> to

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
it or not more people started coming to

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.530 
it or not more people started coming to
