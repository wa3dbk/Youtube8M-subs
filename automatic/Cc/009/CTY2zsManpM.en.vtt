00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
method and we manipulate the feet for

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.070

literally less than a minute each clinic
visit<00:01:19.440> and<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.520> amount<00:01:20.850> of

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
visit and and that amount of

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.360 
visit and and that amount of
manipulation<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.810> then<00:01:21.990> held<00:01:22.290> with<00:01:23.010> a<00:01:23.040> long

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
manipulation is then held with a long

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.280 
manipulation is then held with a long
leg<00:01:23.760> here<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.420> casts<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.810> goes<00:01:24.930> above<00:01:25.229> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
leg here so it casts it goes above the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.160 
leg here so it casts it goes above the
knee<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.490> cast<00:01:26.790> serves<00:01:27.180> basically<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
knee and the cast serves basically is a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.710 
knee and the cast serves basically is a
24<00:01:28.680> hour<00:01:28.740> therapist<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> foot<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.570> it

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
24 hour therapist on the foot so it

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.600 
24 hour therapist on the foot so it
serves<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.229> stretch<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.680> foot<00:01:31.860> all<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.220> time

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
serves to stretch the foot all the time

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.490 
serves to stretch the foot all the time
and<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.850> can't<00:01:33.060> take<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.390> off<00:01:33.510> for<00:01:34.170> one<00:01:34.290> week

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
and you can't take it off for one week

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.649 
and you can't take it off for one week
and<00:01:34.710> they<00:01:35.369> come<00:01:35.610> back<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.119> clinic<00:01:36.299> each

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
and they come back to the clinic each

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.020 
and they come back to the clinic each
week<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.560> cast<00:01:37.830> is<00:01:38.040> removed<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> clinic

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
week the cast is removed in the clinic

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.660 
week the cast is removed in the clinic
and<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.720> foot<00:01:40.020> looks<00:01:40.320> better<00:01:40.590> each<00:01:41.100> week<00:01:41.490> is

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
and the foot looks better each week is

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.640 
and the foot looks better each week is
visibly<00:01:42.210> better<00:01:42.510> and<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.260> we're<00:01:43.380> able<00:01:43.440> to

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
visibly better and so we're able to

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.500 
visibly better and so we're able to
stretch<00:01:44.010> the<00:01:44.159> foot<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.369> little<00:01:44.729> bit<00:01:45.030> more<00:01:45.270> each

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
stretch the foot a little bit more each

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.960 
stretch the foot a little bit more each
time<00:01:45.540> they<00:01:45.930> come<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.729> average

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
time they come in and this on average

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.690 
time they come in and this on average
with<00:01:48.479> most<00:01:48.720> feet<00:01:49.020> takes<00:01:49.409> four<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.770> five<00:01:50.310> cast

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
with most feet takes four to five cast

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.120
