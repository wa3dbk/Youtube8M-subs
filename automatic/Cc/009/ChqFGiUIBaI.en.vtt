there may be buildup on the bottom of
the<00:03:53.290> case<00:03:53.530> or<00:03:53.949> even<00:03:53.980> on<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.609> walls<00:03:55.239> that<00:03:56.019> won't

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
the case or even on the walls that won't

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.280 
the case or even on the walls that won't
come<00:03:56.379> off<00:03:56.410> with<00:03:56.769> the<00:03:57.010> the<00:03:57.669> air<00:03:57.879> can<00:03:58.150> so<00:03:58.959> you<00:03:59.109> may

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
come off with the the air can so you may

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.939 
come off with the the air can so you may
want<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.560> take<00:03:59.709> a<00:04:00.000> damp<00:04:01.000> cloth<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.560> clean<00:04:02.680> that

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
off but this doesn't have any so we

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.939 
off but this doesn't have any so we
don't<00:04:05.410> need<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.730> so<00:04:07.560> that's<00:04:08.560> pretty<00:04:08.739> much<00:04:08.889> it

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
don't need to so that's pretty much it

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.830 
don't need to so that's pretty much it
once<00:04:09.310> you<00:04:09.459> don't<00:04:09.639> see<00:04:09.819> any<00:04:09.970> more<00:04:10.120> dust<00:04:10.359> and

you've checked all the corners of the pc

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:18.210 
you've checked all the corners of the pc
case<00:04:15.449> you<00:04:16.449> can<00:04:16.599> go<00:04:16.690> ahead<00:04:16.780> put<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:17.739> side<00:04:17.979> case
