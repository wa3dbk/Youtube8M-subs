00:00:00.011 --> 00:00:02.469
 Moderator: President Jimmy Carter 

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:07.404
 (applaud) 

00:00:07.404 --> 00:00:10.275
 Jimmy Carter: Thank you. Thank you 

00:00:10.937 --> 00:00:13.037
 I feel very honored to be here today. 

00:00:13.037 --> 00:00:18.249
 I remembered my favorite cartoon in The New Yorker. 

00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:21.060
 (in cartoon) a little boy looking at his father 

00:00:21.737 --> 00:00:25.404
 Said: "Dad, I want to be the former president when I grow up." 

00:00:25.404 --> 00:00:27.715
 (laughter) 

00:00:27.715 --> 00:00:30.470
 Four of us have already achieved this goal. 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.068
 One is struggling towards this goal 

00:00:32.068 --> 00:00:34.270
 Can be with other presidents 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.653
 And speaking to these great audiences is a wonderful thing. 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.103
 My speech will be short 

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:43.085
 I will only know to me personally. 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.853
 Comment on things that are important to me and George Walker Bush 

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:50.503
 Well, as some of you remember 

00:00:50.503 --> 00:00:53.111
 The controversy over the 2000 presidential election lasted for several weeks 

00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:57.570
 Finally, Bush became president. 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.620
 At the time they planned to hold an inauguration ceremony in Washington. 

00:01:01.374 --> 00:01:04.874
 I remember that my wife and I were the only two volunteers to participate. 

00:01:04.874 --> 00:01:06.469
 Democrat 

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:10.403
 Then George and Laura came over. 

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.028
 Thanks for my arrival 

00:01:12.936 --> 00:01:16.639
 Then he said: "If I can help you with anything, please let me know." 

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:19.070
 He made a mistake 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.375
 (laughter) 

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:22.541
 I said, "Mr. President, Carter has projects in 35 countries around the world. 

00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:25.736
 The most serious problem now is 

00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:29.729
 War between North Sudan and South Sudan 

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:33.137
 Thousands of people are being killed. 

00:01:33.137 --> 00:01:36.537
 I want to ask you to help us to reach a peace agreement there. 

00:01:37.168 --> 00:01:39.408
 At his most vulnerable time he said: "I will do it." 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.136
 Then I said, "When can I see your Secretary of State and the National Security Adviser?" 

00:01:44.136 --> 00:01:48.285
 He said: "I haven't chosen yet. Give us three weeks." 

00:01:48.624 --> 00:01:52.403
 Three weeks later I saw Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. 

00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:55.012
 President Bush fulfilled his promise 

00:01:55.336 --> 00:01:59.708
 He appointed John Dantfoss of Missouri, an outstanding senator 

00:01:59.708 --> 00:02:03.503
 And Kenyaâ€™s XX Commander 

00:02:03.503 --> 00:02:10.836
 In January 2005, North and South Sudan reached a peace agreement 

00:02:11.236 --> 00:02:14.236
 Ended the 21-year war 

00:02:14.236 --> 00:02:16.236
 George Walker Bush is the promoter of this matter 

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:22.503
 (applaud) 

00:02:22.503 --> 00:02:26.737
 This is his first great contribution to African countries. 

00:02:26.737 --> 00:02:29.268
 As I mentioned briefly 

00:02:29.268 --> 00:02:32.904
 He increased his development assistance to Africa 

00:02:32.904 --> 00:02:35.170
 Within his tenure 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.536
 (to increase the amount of aid) from $1.4 billion to $9 billion 

00:02:39.536 --> 00:02:43.051
 The growth rate reached 640% 

00:02:43.436 --> 00:02:45.277
 This is part of development assistance 

00:02:45.277 --> 00:02:47.668
 (applaud) 

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:49.098
 He founded PEPFAR (Presidential Assistance AIDS Program) 

00:02:49.437 --> 00:02:52.669
 When he took office, only 50,000 AIDS patients in Africa were rescued. 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:53.958
 When he left, 

00:02:54.143 --> 00:02:56.570
 (The patient who received the help is 2 million) 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.620
 Let's count the percentage of growth. 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.752
 (applaud) 

00:02:59.752 --> 00:03:01.269
 Now with this new institution 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.011
 He has a project to teach "fans", "red ribbons" 

00:03:05.104 --> 00:03:07.810
 To help sub-Saharan Africa 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.669
 Women with cervical and breast cancer 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:11.809
 This is another act that makes me feel 

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:15.571
 I know what it means for millions of African people. 

00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:20.169
 So, I want to say to the President, I am against you. 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.309
 Great contribution to people in need in the world 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:26.237
 Full of respect and gratitude 

00:03:26.237 --> 00:03:28.169
 thank you 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:29.761
 (applaud) 

00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:30.000
 George Bush: Thank you.
