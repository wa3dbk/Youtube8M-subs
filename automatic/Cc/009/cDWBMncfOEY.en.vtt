00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.590 
more real than if you were performing in
a<00:01:56.960> theatrical<00:01:57.229> live<00:01:58.159> event<00:01:58.610> because<00:01:59.420> you're

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
a theatrical live event because you're

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.050 
a theatrical live event because you're
confined<00:02:00.049> to<00:02:00.409> such<00:02:00.619> a<00:02:00.650> small<00:02:01.180> square<00:02:02.409> space

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
confined to such a small square space

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.380 
confined to such a small square space
hell<00:02:05.060> is<00:02:05.180> that

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
hell is that

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.020 
hell is that
pretty<00:02:05.780> good<00:02:05.960> Gus<00:02:06.170> so<00:02:07.100> that's<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.880> big

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
pretty good Gus so that's the big

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.050 
pretty good Gus so that's the big
difference<00:02:08.149> between<00:02:08.560> puppets<00:02:09.560> for<00:02:09.799> TV<00:02:10.670> film

and<00:02:11.329> for<00:02:12.049> theater<00:02:12.409> so<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:13.010> have<00:02:13.129> to<00:02:13.249> keep<00:02:13.400> that

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
and for theater so you have to keep that

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.280 
and for theater so you have to keep that
in<00:02:13.700> mind<00:02:13.909> when<00:02:14.150> you're<00:02:14.239> performing<00:02:14.599> in<00:02:14.900> those
