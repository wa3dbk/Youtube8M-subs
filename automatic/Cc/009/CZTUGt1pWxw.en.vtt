00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello people i am your alex of the 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.510
 hobbypiloten and i want you today 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:14.670
 the tutorial for freeway aircraft 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:17.100
 for importing fsx into import 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.359
 in the lower right corner you have 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.420
 maybe already noticed a note 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.300
 all this is written on this leaflet 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.890
 important about this tutorial on the one hand 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.949
 what we exactly in this tutorial 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.840
 on the one hand and what you want for 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.750
 you need this tutorial 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.380
 want to import planes for the fsx 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.350
 and for that you only need the fsx and 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.540
 a working internet connection 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.940
 if you fulfill these requirements 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.440
 then you can do this tutorial 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.210
 So we want to do the same 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.420
 start first here goes to one 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.520
 freeware plane side you will find 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.829
 simply by looking for the google or 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.480
 you go to the link I put you in 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.660
 the description have been there you will find 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.789
 I really go many planes so 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.000
 Just put her on the link in the 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.869
 description then just this opens 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.560
 page here 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:13.770
 then look for a nice one 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.479
 plane from what you like and me 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.310
 just have the galaxy 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.860
 took 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:23.220
 why us military and then you click 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.720
 the headline there would have to be 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.509
 then a window open the same way 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.210
 then looks it presses down load 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.509
 file and then you save this because 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.180
 somewhere from when you finished 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.509
 download then unpacked you go to 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.439
 this case and pact with the internal 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.060
 unpacked or with yourself in this 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.360
 folders are then usually far 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.340
 more folders this then there is to 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.100
 Example once the folder aircraft in 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.380
 this folder you will find everything in 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:01.140
 You have to copy a certain folder 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:03.829
 the folder in aircraft goes into the 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.250
 the directory in which he the the fsx 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:13.190
 have installed saved 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:17.260
 and go there on sim objects that finds 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:21.350
 her down in the objects goes up here 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.350
 airplanes at the top and there he copied 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:28.180
 just insert the folder into it 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:31.340
 then he goes back into the folder of 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.800
 you can usually find planes there too 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.600
 another folder that calls itself 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.190
 effects the content of this folder 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.730
 he copied back via right click 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.269
 Copy goes back to that 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.880
 directory of fsx but this time takes 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.090
 her not the folder six but the 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.739
 folder effects opens this folder 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.230
 and simply copy the files there 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.180
 there were in there 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.880
 it was already so I you 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.620
 but can demonstrate that this 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.680
 I have tutorial work now 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.590
 Once the fcx is opened there goes 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.850
 So you look for the plane 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.380
 I have this easy 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.410
 except do not be surprised that this 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.150
 the fairplay sometimes does not work 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.299
 That's normal, by the way, these are called 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.780
 little picture so now I will 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:24.140
 still a decent airfield 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.790
 I'll just take the tsh there 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.130
 is an airfield from the near 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.560
 in conclusion military airfield and snow 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.940
 still a decent one decent 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.930
 daytime so that you too what we too 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.239
 again around 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.569
 They look very briefly that comes I data 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:47.330
 see that it is now not really me 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:51.340
 will keep it but they were 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:55.510
 you see and clean 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.690
 instead of that, my tutorial was subscribed 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.690
 and 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:07.010
 in st 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.010
 that was alex of the pilots
