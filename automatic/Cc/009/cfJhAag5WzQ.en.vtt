00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
trade again and luckily we can do that

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.149 
trade again and luckily we can do that
because<00:02:00.659> your<00:02:00.869> neck<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.110> very<00:02:01.380> thick<00:02:01.860> right<00:02:02.040> in

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
because your neck is very thick right in

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.819 
because your neck is very thick right in
here<00:02:02.780> so<00:02:05.090> because<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.240> heel<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.229> neck<00:02:07.530> was

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
here so because this heel and neck was

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.589 
here so because this heel and neck was
never<00:02:08.009> really<00:02:08.399> shaped<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.879> way<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.209> should<00:02:09.450> be

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
never really shaped the way it should be

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.630 
never really shaped the way it should be
it's<00:02:09.810> far<00:02:10.470> too<00:02:10.500> thick<00:02:10.890> right<00:02:10.920> over<00:02:11.220> there<00:02:11.459> and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
it's far too thick right over there and

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
that's grafted

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.150 
that's grafted
yeah<00:02:14.820> that's<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.330> get<00:02:15.480> it<00:02:15.600> left<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.080> extra<00:02:16.650> super

thick<00:02:17.340> right<00:02:17.520> mm-hmm

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.400 

we<00:02:23.460> have<00:02:24.120> this<00:02:24.210> opportunity<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.990> make<00:02:25.140> that

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
we have this opportunity to make that

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.960 
we have this opportunity to make that
more<00:02:26.010> comfortable<00:02:26.250> that's<00:02:26.580> important

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
more comfortable that's important

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.180 
more comfortable that's important
because<00:02:27.030> when<00:02:27.570> you<00:02:27.690> go<00:02:27.720> up<00:02:27.960> ship<00:02:28.620> position<00:02:29.070> the

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
because when you go up ship position the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.160 
because when you go up ship position the
thumb<00:02:29.400> kind<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:30.030> Keys<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.480> other<00:02:30.600> fingers<00:02:30.990> in

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
thumb kind of Keys the other fingers in

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.900 
thumb kind of Keys the other fingers in
it<00:02:31.290> it's<00:02:31.590> fat<00:02:31.920> up<00:02:32.100> in<00:02:32.220> there<00:02:32.370> it's<00:02:32.580> not<00:02:32.700> really

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
it it's fat up in there it's not really

it's a really high quality board it's a
little<00:03:51.480> lumpy<00:03:51.600> I<00:03:51.959> was<00:03:52.799> thinking<00:03:53.100> about

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
little lumpy I was thinking about

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.100 
little lumpy I was thinking about
laminating<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.120> piece<00:03:54.299> on<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.600> bottom<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:54.959> so<00:03:55.080> I

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
laminating a piece on the bottom it so I

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.930 
laminating a piece on the bottom it so I
can<00:03:55.260> rework<00:03:55.560> it<00:03:55.739> I<00:03:55.980> thought<00:03:56.459> that's<00:03:56.700> what<00:03:56.880> I

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
can rework it I thought that's what I

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.460 
can rework it I thought that's what I
thought<00:03:57.209> you<00:03:57.390> were<00:03:57.510> going<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.900> do<00:03:58.019> yeah<00:03:58.200> that's

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
thought you were going to do yeah that's

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.660 
thought you were going to do yeah that's
a<00:03:58.560> whole<00:03:58.680> nother<00:03:58.890> no<00:03:59.820> well<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:00.570> can<00:04:00.780> do<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:00.989> I<00:04:01.670> can

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
a whole nother no well I can do it I can

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.120 
a whole nother no well I can do it I can
do<00:04:02.760> that<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.480> is<00:04:03.630> thin<00:04:03.900> why<00:04:04.650> don't<00:04:04.799> we<00:04:04.860> just<00:04:05.010> do

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
do that it is thin why don't we just do

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.780 
do that it is thin why don't we just do
it<00:04:05.160> and<00:04:05.310> get<00:04:05.370> it<00:04:05.489> over<00:04:05.549> with

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
it and get it over with

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.400 
it and get it over with
we<00:04:06.209> can<00:04:06.330> also<00:04:06.480> put<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:06.720> new<00:04:06.870> board<00:04:07.080> on<00:04:07.200> that's

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
we can also put a new board on that's

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.520 
we can also put a new board on that's
really<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.739> right<00:04:07.890> thing<00:04:08.070> to<00:04:08.160> do<00:04:09.200> you<00:04:10.200> have<00:04:10.350> I

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
really the right thing to do you have I

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.030 
really the right thing to do you have I
have<00:04:11.160> plenty<00:04:11.580> finger<00:04:11.910> boys<00:04:12.090> okay<00:04:12.660> dad<00:04:13.080> dead

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
have plenty finger boys okay dad dead

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.490 
have plenty finger boys okay dad dead
quality<00:04:14.430> yeah<00:04:15.150> trouble<00:04:15.870> with<00:04:16.109> all<00:04:16.320> those

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
quality yeah trouble with all those

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.310 
quality yeah trouble with all those
approaches<00:04:17.250> is<00:04:17.600> they<00:04:18.600> all<00:04:18.720> have<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.930> little<00:04:19.140> bit

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
approaches is they all have a little bit

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.810 
approaches is they all have a little bit
of<00:04:19.350> effect<00:04:19.650> on<00:04:19.739> the<00:04:19.859> tone<00:04:20.510> right

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
of effect on the tone right

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.040 
of effect on the tone right
it's<00:04:23.820> a<00:04:23.940> little<00:04:24.180> hard<00:04:24.360> for<00:04:24.419> me<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.720> predict<00:04:25.080> if

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
it's a little hard for me to predict if

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.150 
it's a little hard for me to predict if
we're<00:04:28.050> taking<00:04:28.200> some<00:04:28.500> wood<00:04:28.650> out<00:04:28.680> of<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.950> neck

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
we're taking some wood out of the neck

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.040 
we're taking some wood out of the neck
and<00:04:29.550> if<00:04:29.970> we<00:04:30.120> added<00:04:30.300> some<00:04:30.600> of<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.780> fingerboard

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
and if we added some of the fingerboard

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.480 
and if we added some of the fingerboard
maybe<00:04:31.440> that<00:04:31.620> would<00:04:31.740> balance<00:04:31.889> out<00:04:32.130> it<00:04:32.370> would

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
maybe that would balance out it would

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.060 
maybe that would balance out it would
come<00:04:32.639> out<00:04:32.900> basically<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.020> same<00:04:34.230> but<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.889> neck

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
come out basically the same but the neck

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.620 
come out basically the same but the neck
you<00:04:35.250> know<00:04:35.370> when<00:04:35.550> that<00:04:35.669> which<00:04:35.820> if<00:04:36.270> you<00:04:36.419> had<00:04:36.600> a

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
you know when that which if you had a

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.570 
you know when that which if you had a
slow<00:04:36.930> motion<00:04:37.110> video<00:04:37.530> of<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.740> neck<00:04:37.919> what's

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
slow motion video of the neck what's

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.640 
slow motion video of the neck what's
being<00:04:38.760> played<00:04:39.000> it's<00:04:39.270> doing<00:04:39.540> a<00:04:39.600> little<00:04:39.720> thing

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
being played it's doing a little thing

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.730 
being played it's doing a little thing
like<00:04:40.830> this<00:04:41.040> and<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.910> energy<00:04:42.320> that's<00:04:43.320> going

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
like this and the energy that's going

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.140 
like this and the energy that's going
into<00:04:43.889> the<00:04:44.040> neck<00:04:44.190> going<00:04:44.400> back<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:44.730> forth<00:04:44.970> that

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
into the neck going back and forth that

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.000 
into the neck going back and forth that
changes<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:45.720> modes<00:04:46.200> of<00:04:46.320> vibration<00:04:46.710> of<00:04:46.860> body

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
changes the modes of vibration of body

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.620 
changes the modes of vibration of body
if<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:47.550> neck<00:04:47.700> is<00:04:47.730> vibrating<00:04:48.300> a<00:04:48.360> different

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
if the neck is vibrating a different

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.360 
if the neck is vibrating a different
frequency

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
frequency

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.180 
frequency
you<00:04:50.370> can't<00:04:50.610> affect<00:04:50.880> the<00:04:50.970> tone
