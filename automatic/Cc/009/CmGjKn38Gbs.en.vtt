00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
basically what me and my friends used to

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.410 
basically what me and my friends used to
do<00:02:55.710> is<00:02:55.860> we<00:02:55.980> go<00:02:56.010> out<00:02:56.340> we'd<00:02:56.580> pick<00:02:56.790> teams<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.330> we'd

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
do is we go out we'd pick teams and we'd

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.910 
do is we go out we'd pick teams and we'd
go<00:02:57.450> we<00:02:57.690> just<00:02:57.900> start<00:02:58.080> throwing<00:02:58.110> snowballs<00:02:58.770> at

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
go we just start throwing snowballs at

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.770

each<00:02:59.010> other<00:02:59.250> from<00:02:59.820> like<00:03:00.030> 15<00:03:00.180> feet<00:03:00.660> away

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
each other from like 15 feet away

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.090 
each other from like 15 feet away
because<00:03:00.990> it<00:03:01.170> wasn't<00:03:01.380> that<00:03:01.470> big<00:03:01.590> of<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.800> parking

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100
