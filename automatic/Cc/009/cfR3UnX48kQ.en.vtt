eyeliners are they do they are really

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.680 
eyeliners are they do they are really
thick<00:01:39.610> so<00:01:39.820> that's<00:01:40.000> why<00:01:40.090> i<00:01:40.120> usually<00:01:40.480> use<00:01:40.510> a

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
thick so that's why i usually use a

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.680 
thick so that's why i usually use a
liquid<00:01:40.930> liner<00:01:42.060> sometimes<00:01:43.060> i<00:01:43.180> just<00:01:43.210> use<00:01:43.540> it

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
liquid liner sometimes i just use it

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.610 
liquid liner sometimes i just use it
because<00:01:43.840> i'm<00:01:44.020> used<00:01:44.230> to<00:01:44.350> using<00:01:44.530> a<00:01:44.860> black<00:01:45.820> liner

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
because i'm used to using a black liner

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.290 
because i'm used to using a black liner
pencil<00:01:47.620> one<00:01:47.920> so<00:01:48.220> same<00:01:48.910> thing<00:01:48.940> with<00:01:49.180> the<00:01:49.210> other

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.470 
and then I'm going to just do strokes
from<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.470> very<00:02:59.710> base<00:03:00.100> of<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.460> eyelash<00:03:01.000> and

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
from the very base of the eyelash and

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.350

and<00:04:09.609> I<00:04:10.060> really<00:04:10.689> don't<00:04:10.900> have<00:04:11.459> really<00:04:12.459> long

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
and I really don't have really long

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.849 
and I really don't have really long
lashes<00:04:13.049> so<00:04:14.049> I<00:04:14.349> am<00:04:14.709> a<00:04:14.950> mascara<00:04:15.630> poor<00:04:16.630> I<00:04:16.900> mean

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
lashes so I am a mascara poor I mean

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.800 
lashes so I am a mascara poor I mean
dead<00:04:18.039> serious<00:04:18.370> I'll<00:04:18.910> put<00:04:19.120> on<00:04:19.180> my<00:04:19.239> two<00:04:19.389> thousand

go<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:20.019> mascara<00:04:22.380> that's<00:04:23.380> probably<00:04:23.620> why<00:04:23.740> my

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
go to mascara that's probably why my

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.550 
go to mascara that's probably why my
eyelashes<00:04:24.340> are<00:04:24.340> not<00:04:24.690> long<00:04:25.690> and<00:04:25.990> thick<00:04:26.199> that's

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
eyelashes are not long and thick that's

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.520 
eyelashes are not long and thick that's
probably<00:04:27.100> exactly<00:04:27.220> what<00:04:27.750> so<00:04:28.750> we'll<00:04:29.199> just<00:04:29.229> do

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
probably exactly what so we'll just do

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.900 
probably exactly what so we'll just do
that

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
that

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.430 
that
one<00:04:31.660> more<00:04:31.810> time<00:04:33.900> then<00:04:34.900> I'm<00:04:34.990> going<00:04:35.140> to<00:04:35.200> let<00:04:35.320> it

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
one more time then I'm going to let it

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.490 
one more time then I'm going to let it
dry<00:04:35.470> after<00:04:35.920> I<00:04:36.130> glop<00:04:36.490> a<00:04:36.520> thousand<00:04:37.150> coats<00:04:37.930> on<00:04:38.230> I'm
