00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
check your fill pressure as you as you

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.650 
check your fill pressure as you as you
shoot<00:01:16.710> all<00:01:17.710> a<00:01:17.770> solid<00:01:18.310> unit<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.820> receiver<00:01:19.210> the

single piece machine from a single
this<00:01:27.590> gives<00:01:27.860> a<00:01:28.070> lot<00:01:28.280> of<00:01:28.340> stability<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:29.000> more

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
this gives a lot of stability to more

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.590 
this gives a lot of stability to more
than<00:01:29.750> you<00:01:29.870> had<00:01:30.020> in<00:01:30.260> the<00:01:30.410> original<00:01:31.400> air<00:01:32.000> Ranger

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
chrony see what we get in terms of shot

00:01:50.750 --> 00:03:27.970 
chrony see what we get in terms of shot
string<00:01:51.110> out<00:01:51.620> of<00:01:51.800> this

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.520
