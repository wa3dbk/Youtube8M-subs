so<00:01:31.439> we<00:01:31.500> might<00:01:31.650> get<00:01:31.860> all<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.070> silver<00:01:32.460> which<00:01:32.850> is

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
so we might get all of a silver which is

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.679 
so we might get all of a silver which is
the<00:01:33.210> minimum<00:01:33.450> let's<00:01:33.659> run<00:01:34.020> front<00:01:35.479> there<00:01:36.479> we<00:01:36.570> had

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
the minimum let's run front there we had

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.390 
the minimum let's run front there we had
a<00:01:36.720> nice<00:01:36.930> header<00:01:37.140> as<00:01:37.259> well<00:01:37.380> no<00:01:37.560> tag<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.100> Hitler

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
a nice header as well no tag it Hitler

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.130 
a nice header as well no tag it Hitler
but<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:38.850> over<00:01:39.060> silver<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.509> one<00:01:39.659> more<00:01:39.869> try

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
but we have over silver and one more try

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.069 
but we have over silver and one more try
as<00:01:40.320> well<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.759> that's<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:42.000> our<00:01:42.210> nice<00:01:42.509> there<00:01:42.990> we

left some of the more advanced maneuvers

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.420 
left some of the more advanced maneuvers
the<00:01:49.979> chip<00:01:50.340> shots<00:01:50.640> pretty<00:01:51.350> pretty<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.680> was<00:01:53.310> it

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
the chip shots pretty pretty it was it

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.520 
the chip shots pretty pretty it was it
easy<00:01:53.640> yeah<00:01:54.210> cheap<00:01:54.689> shot<00:01:54.720> was<00:01:55.020> pretty<00:01:55.259> easy<00:01:55.439> i

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
easy yeah cheap shot was pretty easy i

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.380 
easy yeah cheap shot was pretty easy i
remember<00:01:55.799> this<00:01:55.890> one<00:01:55.950> now<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.700> actually<00:01:56.820> gets<00:01:57.180> a

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
remember this one now it actually gets a

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.999 
remember this one now it actually gets a
bit<00:01:57.509> difficult<00:01:57.750> when<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.590> are<00:01:58.619> playing

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
bit difficult when you are playing

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.569 
bit difficult when you are playing
against<00:01:59.549> the<00:02:00.560> against<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.710> goalkeeper<00:02:02.399> but<00:02:02.549> i

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
against the against the goalkeeper but i

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.459 
against the against the goalkeeper but i
will<00:02:02.729> show<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.060> nice<00:02:03.299> easy<00:02:03.540> way<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.079> get

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
will show you a nice easy way to get

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.280 
will show you a nice easy way to get
past<00:02:04.680> him<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.570> might<00:02:06.570> hit<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.719> no<00:02:07.140> that

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
past him that might hit the no that

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.180 
past him that might hit the no that
one's<00:02:07.439> gone<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.649> as<00:02:07.770> well<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:07.979> we've<00:02:08.099> actually

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
one's gone in as well so we've actually

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.190 
one's gone in as well so we've actually
got<00:02:08.459> free<00:02:08.700> away<00:02:08.910> free<00:02:09.239> multi-core<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.080> them

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
got free away free multi-core and them

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.930 
got free away free multi-core and them
against<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.530> keeper<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.039> one<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.400> was

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
against the keeper so the one I was

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.880 
against the keeper so the one I was
doing<00:02:12.239> in<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.450> series<00:02:12.870> was<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.170> far

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
doing in the series was the far

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.410 
doing in the series was the far
chip<00:02:14.100> which<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.700> one<00:02:14.819> way<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.000> wouldn't<00:02:15.330> an

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
chip which is one way you wouldn't an

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.540 
chip which is one way you wouldn't an
angle<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.990> you<00:02:16.200> do<00:02:16.410> chip<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.830> into<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.340> far

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
angle and you do chip it into the far

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.580 
angle and you do chip it into the far
corner<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.360> seems<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.690> work<00:02:18.810> more<00:02:19.350> often

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
corner and it seems to work more often

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.320 
corner and it seems to work more often
not<00:02:19.980> for<00:02:20.160> me<00:02:20.280> as<00:02:20.430> you<00:02:20.760> can<00:02:20.850> see<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.150> keeper

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
not for me as you can see the keeper

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.449 
not for me as you can see the keeper
seems<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.870> get<00:02:22.080> rooted<00:02:22.500> quite<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.740> lot<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.310> we

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
seems to get rooted quite a lot and we

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.010 
seems to get rooted quite a lot and we
should<00:02:23.610> actually<00:02:23.819> get<00:02:24.120> perfect<00:02:24.600> on<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:24.840> one

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
should actually get perfect on this one

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.530 
should actually get perfect on this one
to<00:02:25.709> try<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:25.980> all<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.160> time<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:27.120> we've<00:02:27.330> done<00:02:27.450> it

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
to try it all the time and we've done it

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.030 
to try it all the time and we've done it
again<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:28.050> that's<00:02:28.170> that's<00:02:28.470> how<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.740> do<00:02:28.920> that

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
again so that's that's how you do that

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.740 
again so that's that's how you do that
one<00:02:29.190> pretty<00:02:29.400> easily<00:02:29.640> against<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.420> keepers

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
one pretty easily against the keepers

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.449 
one pretty easily against the keepers
you<00:02:30.900> run<00:02:31.050> away<00:02:31.170> an<00:02:31.440> angle<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.190> your<00:02:32.310> shoot

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
you run away an angle and your shoot

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.010 
you run away an angle and your shoot
into<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.790> far<00:02:32.970> corner<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.570> that<00:02:33.900> will

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
into the far corner and that will

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.180 
into the far corner and that will
actually<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.290> new<00:02:34.440> record<00:02:34.620> as<00:02:34.920> well<00:02:35.040> which<00:02:35.160> is

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
actually a new record as well which is

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.190 
actually a new record as well which is
pretty<00:02:35.430> nice<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.450> next<00:02:36.600> one<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:36.959> one

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
pretty nice so the next one is the one

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.230 
pretty nice so the next one is the one
to<00:02:37.380> pass<00:02:37.680> this<00:02:37.890> one<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.459> get<00:02:38.760> used<00:02:38.910> quite<00:02:39.180> a

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
to pass this one you get used quite a

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.180 
to pass this one you get used quite a
lot<00:02:39.300> in<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.540> final<00:02:39.870> stage<00:02:40.110> and<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:41.360> the

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
lot in the final stage and of the

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.430 
lot in the final stage and of the
strands<00:02:44.190> get<00:02:45.180> some<00:02:45.330> targets<00:02:45.750> as<00:02:45.870> well<00:02:45.900> this

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
strands get some targets as well this

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.470 
strands get some targets as well this
one's<00:02:46.650> in<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.370> final<00:02:47.700> third<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.120> comes<00:02:48.330> in

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
one's in the final third it comes in

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.820 
one's in the final third it comes in
very<00:02:48.660> effective<00:02:49.140> again<00:02:49.320> especially<00:02:49.500> against

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
very effective again especially against

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.770 
very effective again especially against
a<00:02:49.950> computer<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.910> can<00:02:51.060> imagine<00:02:51.270> it<00:02:51.540> coming

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
a computer and it can imagine it coming

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.440 
a computer and it can imagine it coming
off<00:02:51.930> against<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.760> human<00:02:53.760> opposition<00:02:54.180> as<00:02:54.300> well

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
off against the human opposition as well

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.090 
off against the human opposition as well
as<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.660> apple<00:02:54.989> in<00:02:55.110> defenders<00:02:55.590> out<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:55.950> way<00:02:56.070> so

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
as the apple in defenders out the way so

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.150 
as the apple in defenders out the way so
you<00:02:56.730> need<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.060> press<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.390> triangle<00:02:57.810> button

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
you need to press the triangle button

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.710 
you need to press the triangle button
exactly<00:02:59.160> when<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.730> arrives<00:03:00.120> at<00:03:00.300> your<00:03:00.330> foot<00:03:00.600> as

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
exactly when it arrives at your foot as

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.690 
exactly when it arrives at your foot as
well<00:03:00.750> otherwise<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.650> won't<00:03:01.950> count<00:03:02.280> which<00:03:02.519> is

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
well otherwise it won't count which is

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.780 
well otherwise it won't count which is
quite<00:03:02.850> annoying<00:03:03.060> as<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:04.200> lot<00:03:04.860> of<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.160> guys<00:03:05.190> and

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
quite annoying as a lot of you guys and

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.699 
quite annoying as a lot of you guys and
me<00:03:06.090> especially<00:03:06.390> do<00:03:06.720> like<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.019> take<00:03:07.200> time<00:03:07.470> with

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
me especially do like to take time with

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.830 
me especially do like to take time with
the<00:03:07.860> person<00:03:08.220> making<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.940> return<00:03:09.090> passer<00:03:09.570> as

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
the person making a return passer as

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.810 
the person making a return passer as
well<00:03:10.080> as<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.650> can<00:03:10.739> see<00:03:10.920> we're<00:03:11.130> bossing<00:03:11.610> this

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
well as you can see we're bossing this

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.690 
well as you can see we're bossing this
one<00:03:12.030> in<00:03:12.239> this<00:03:12.540> one's<00:03:12.780> actually<00:03:12.930> there<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.280> a

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
one in this one's actually there and a

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.280 
one in this one's actually there and a
finesse<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.420> actually<00:03:15.690> kneeling<00:03:16.019> this<00:03:16.140> one

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
finesse so actually kneeling this one

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.770 
finesse so actually kneeling this one
pretty<00:03:16.470> easily<00:03:16.709> as<00:03:17.040> well<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.519> we<00:03:17.820> should<00:03:18.480> get

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
pretty easily as well and we should get

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.340 
pretty easily as well and we should get
max<00:03:19.200> points<00:03:19.560> so<00:03:20.010> tap<00:03:20.489> through<00:03:20.880> nice<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.480> then

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
max points so tap through nice and then

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.710 
max points so tap through nice and then
I<00:03:22.440> furnace<00:03:22.860> in<00:03:23.070> against<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.880> target<00:03:24.360> so<00:03:24.630> we're

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
I furnace in against the target so we're

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.030 
I furnace in against the target so we're
not<00:03:24.780> actually<00:03:24.930> going<00:03:25.110> top<00:03:25.440> corner<00:03:25.769> which<00:03:25.890> is

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
not actually going top corner which is

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.620 
not actually going top corner which is
sort<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.250> i<00:03:26.340> have<00:03:26.459> noticed<00:03:26.880> in<00:03:27.060> these<00:03:27.239> training

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
sort of i have noticed in these training

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.400 
sort of i have noticed in these training
techniques<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.280> return<00:03:29.280> Vaness<00:03:30.209> go<00:03:30.840> oh<00:03:31.250> oh

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
techniques and return Vaness go oh oh

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.449 
techniques and return Vaness go oh oh
nice<00:03:34.410> little<00:03:35.280> tap<00:03:35.579> there<00:03:36.090> we<00:03:36.180> are<00:03:36.329> tied<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.870> and

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
nice little tap there we are tied it and

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.039 
nice little tap there we are tied it and
finesse<00:03:38.459> into<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.790> far<00:03:38.970> corner<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.630> that's

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
finesse into the far corner and that's

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.960 
finesse into the far corner and that's
another<00:03:40.380> goal<00:03:40.620> so<00:03:40.980> we<00:03:41.040> got<00:03:41.130> two<00:03:41.310> more<00:03:41.340> left<00:03:41.730> and

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
another goal so we got two more left and

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.860 
another goal so we got two more left and
we're<00:03:42.060> already<00:03:42.269> basically<00:03:42.690> our<00:03:43.140> failed<00:03:43.620> oh<00:03:44.870> no

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
we're already basically our failed oh no

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.270 
we're already basically our failed oh no
I<00:03:45.900> haven't<00:03:46.079> I've<00:03:46.290> managed<00:03:46.799> to<00:03:46.829> pull<00:03:47.010> that<00:03:47.130> one

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
I haven't I've managed to pull that one

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.460 
I haven't I've managed to pull that one
off<00:03:47.310> finesse<00:03:48.180> I've<00:03:48.450> missed<00:03:48.870> I've<00:03:49.170> missed

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
off finesse I've missed I've missed

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.069 
off finesse I've missed I've missed
we've<00:03:49.980> not<00:03:50.160> even<00:03:50.280> perfected<00:03:50.940> this<00:03:51.090> one<00:03:51.329> so

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
we've not even perfected this one so

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.160 
we've not even perfected this one so
let's<00:03:52.230> try<00:03:52.440> this<00:03:52.500> one<00:03:52.829> again<00:03:53.810> so<00:03:54.810> that's<00:03:54.989> why

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
let's try this one again so that's why

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.810 
let's try this one again so that's why
you<00:03:55.200> need<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.530> do<00:03:55.769> it<00:03:55.890> first<00:03:56.160> time<00:03:56.400> wise<00:03:56.700> you

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
you need to do it first time wise you

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.780 
you need to do it first time wise you
feel<00:03:57.000> so<00:03:57.209> this<00:03:57.360> one's<00:03:57.540> actually<00:03:57.690> pretty<00:03:58.290> hard

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
feel so this one's actually pretty hard

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.110 
feel so this one's actually pretty hard
that's<00:03:59.790> annoying<00:04:01.250> than<00:04:02.250> away<00:04:02.430> I've<00:04:02.549> come<00:04:02.730> I've

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
that's annoying than away I've come I've

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.400 
that's annoying than away I've come I've
done<00:04:03.269> away<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.510> can't<00:04:03.750> do<00:04:03.870> this<00:04:03.900> one<00:04:04.140> this<00:04:04.200> one's

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
done away I can't do this one this one's

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.789 
done away I can't do this one this one's
on<00:04:04.530> I<00:04:04.620> am<00:04:05.870> there<00:04:06.870> we<00:04:06.959> are<00:04:07.049> and<00:04:07.440> we've<00:04:07.680> been

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
on I am there we are and we've been

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.830 
on I am there we are and we've been
tackled<00:04:08.190> anywhere<00:04:08.489> so<00:04:08.670> times<00:04:09.269> up<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:09.720> we

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
tackled anywhere so times up and we

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.630 
tackled anywhere so times up and we
didn't<00:04:10.200> actually<00:04:10.350> complete<00:04:11.250> how<00:04:11.370> much<00:04:11.519> is

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
didn't actually complete how much is

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.849 
didn't actually complete how much is
quite<00:04:11.820> an<00:04:11.910> only<00:04:12.150> one<00:04:12.269> to<00:04:12.420> pass<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.620> next

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
quite an only one to pass and the next

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.099 
quite an only one to pass and the next
one<00:04:14.160> is<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.459> attacking<00:04:15.120> situations<00:04:15.840> this<00:04:15.930> way

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
one is the attacking situations this way

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.870 
one is the attacking situations this way
you've<00:04:16.260> got<00:04:16.440> two<00:04:16.620> and<00:04:16.829> put<00:04:17.820> into<00:04:19.669> put<00:04:20.669> into

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
you've got two and put into put into

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.550 
you've got two and put into put into
action<00:04:21.060> what<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.660> have<00:04:21.900> learned<00:04:22.200> over<00:04:22.349> the

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
action what you have learned over the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.409 
action what you have learned over the
period<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:23.160> obviously<00:04:23.430> tapping<00:04:23.820> our<00:04:24.060> want<00:04:24.270> to

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
period so obviously tapping our want to

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.480 
period so obviously tapping our want to
position<00:04:24.870> round<00:04:25.140> the<00:04:25.320> keeper<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:25.860> trying

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
position round the keeper and trying

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.710 
position round the keeper and trying
Brown<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.150> defender

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
Brown the defender

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.990 
Brown the defender
and<00:04:27.840> score<00:04:28.380> I<00:04:28.620> was<00:04:29.040> actually<00:04:29.250> good<00:04:29.760> at<00:04:29.850> this

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
and score I was actually good at this

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.580 
and score I was actually good at this
one<00:04:30.240> as<00:04:30.360> well<00:04:30.390> that<00:04:30.840> counts<00:04:30.960> in<00:04:31.140> to<00:04:31.260> do<00:04:31.350> it<00:04:31.470> now

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
one as well that counts in to do it now

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.200 
one as well that counts in to do it now
there<00:04:31.920> was<00:04:32.010> explored<00:04:32.400> get<00:04:32.580> past<00:04:32.760> that<00:04:33.030> one's

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
there was explored get past that one's

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.580 
there was explored get past that one's
actually<00:04:33.360> one<00:04:33.600> of<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.690> hardest<00:04:34.050> ones<00:04:34.230> the

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
actually one of the hardest ones the

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.350 
actually one of the hardest ones the
next<00:04:34.800> one's<00:04:34.950> pretty<00:04:35.220> easy<00:04:35.430> just<00:04:35.820> smash<00:04:36.180> that

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
next one's pretty easy just smash that

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.330 
next one's pretty easy just smash that
into<00:04:36.690> that<00:04:36.810> fing<00:04:37.320> pastor<00:04:37.710> goalkeeping<00:04:38.220> you

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
into that fing pastor goalkeeping you

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.000 
into that fing pastor goalkeeping you
get<00:04:38.460> bonus<00:04:38.670> points<00:04:38.820> on<00:04:39.240> what<00:04:39.510> not<00:04:39.840> right<00:04:40.410> tap

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
get bonus points on what not right tap

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.580 
get bonus points on what not right tap
it<00:04:41.160> across<00:04:41.430> finish<00:04:42.390> it<00:04:42.420> that's<00:04:43.020> another<00:04:43.320> girl

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
that they saw I was good at this one I

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.270 
that they saw I was good at this one I
made<00:05:15.570> me<00:05:16.080> a<00:05:16.110> lie<00:05:16.350> T<00:05:16.410> I<00:05:16.560> was<00:05:16.770> good<00:05:16.950> at<00:05:16.980> this<00:05:17.070> one

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
made me a lie T I was good at this one

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.630 
made me a lie T I was good at this one
but<00:05:17.970> I'm<00:05:18.120> failing<00:05:18.360> now<00:05:18.570> right<00:05:18.930> finesse<00:05:19.640> nice

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
but I'm failing now right finesse nice

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.700 
but I'm failing now right finesse nice
pick<00:05:20.880> up<00:05:21.000> the<00:05:21.090> ball<00:05:21.300> and<00:05:21.600> finesse<00:05:22.230> past<00:05:22.470> there

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
pick up the ball and finesse past there

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.380 
pick up the ball and finesse past there
yet<00:05:22.890> so<00:05:23.130> that's<00:05:23.250> we're<00:05:23.910> gonna<00:05:24.000> get<00:05:24.180> all<00:05:24.300> the

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
yet so that's we're gonna get all the

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.940 
yet so that's we're gonna get all the
silver<00:05:24.750> again<00:05:25.020> not<00:05:25.230> getting<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:25.590> gold<00:05:25.740> one

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
silver again not getting the gold one

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.650 
silver again not getting the gold one
this<00:05:26.100> is<00:05:26.160> the<00:05:26.280> one<00:05:26.400> to<00:05:26.790> one<00:05:27.030> which<00:05:27.210> you<00:05:27.330> did<00:05:27.450> see

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
this is the one to one which you did see

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.020 
this is the one to one which you did see
before<00:05:28.110> and<00:05:28.380> obviously<00:05:29.040> I<00:05:29.130> did<00:05:29.460> it<00:05:29.580> we're<00:05:29.760> two

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
before and obviously I did it we're two

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.990 
before and obviously I did it we're two
earlier<00:05:30.590> early<00:05:31.590> so<00:05:31.860> actually<00:05:32.580> this<00:05:32.700> is<00:05:32.850> how<00:05:32.970> I

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
earlier early so actually this is how I

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.850 
earlier early so actually this is how I
like<00:05:33.210> to<00:05:33.240> do<00:05:33.750> my<00:05:33.780> return<00:05:34.169> passes<00:05:34.530> which<00:05:34.650> take

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
like to do my return passes which take

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.800 
like to do my return passes which take
some<00:05:35.040> time<00:05:35.250> and<00:05:35.400> then<00:05:35.940> you<00:05:36.030> do<00:05:36.150> actually<00:05:36.360> get

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
some time and then you do actually get

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.250 
some time and then you do actually get
more<00:05:37.050> room<00:05:37.470> away<00:05:37.770> attacking<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:39.080> next<00:05:40.080> one's

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
more room away attacking and next one's

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.500 
more room away attacking and next one's
an<00:05:40.410> hour<00:05:40.650> one<00:05:40.950> cross<00:05:41.460> it<00:05:41.940> should<00:05:42.090> finish<00:05:42.300> out

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
an hour one cross it should finish out

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.450 
an hour one cross it should finish out
on<00:05:42.630> the<00:05:42.720> volley<00:05:42.900> which<00:05:43.110> he<00:05:43.260> hasn't<00:05:43.710> how<00:05:44.400> the

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
on the volley which he hasn't how the

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.770 
on the volley which he hasn't how the
hell's<00:05:44.760> that<00:05:44.880> happen<00:05:45.270> so<00:05:45.360> we<00:05:45.419> got<00:05:45.540> a<00:05:45.570> silver

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
hell's that happen so we got a silver

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.840 
hell's that happen so we got a silver
bronze<00:05:46.380> that's<00:05:47.040> the<00:05:47.160> first<00:05:47.370> time<00:05:47.430> we've<00:05:47.550> got<00:05:47.820> a

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
bronze that's the first time we've got a

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.460 
bronze that's the first time we've got a
bronze<00:05:48.060> and<00:05:48.300> we<00:05:48.360> do<00:05:48.479> move<00:05:48.690> on<00:05:48.840> to<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.080> hardest

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
bronze and we do move on to the hardest

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.350 
bronze and we do move on to the hardest
one<00:05:49.620> of<00:05:49.860> them<00:05:50.040> all<00:05:50.190> which<00:05:50.610> is<00:05:50.850> the<00:05:51.060> skill

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
one of them all which is the skill

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.000 
one of them all which is the skill
control<00:05:51.780> so<00:05:51.930> I<00:05:51.960> do<00:05:52.020> actually<00:05:52.440> know<00:05:52.830> the

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
control so I do actually know the

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.980 
control so I do actually know the
sequence<00:05:53.400> of<00:05:53.700> the<00:05:53.760> stallion<00:05:54.270> ones<00:05:54.450> so<00:05:54.870> you're

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
sequence of the stallion ones so you're

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.719 
sequence of the stallion ones so you're
holding<00:05:55.320> up<00:05:55.530> and<00:05:55.740> then<00:05:55.830> move<00:05:56.040> it<00:05:56.190> and<00:05:56.310> so

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
holding up and then move it and so

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.370 
holding up and then move it and so
you're<00:05:56.850> moving<00:05:56.940> up<00:05:57.150> like<00:05:57.330> that<00:05:57.510> then<00:05:57.960> drag<00:05:58.200> the

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
you're moving up like that then drag the

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.100 
you're moving up like that then drag the
ball<00:05:58.500> back<00:05:58.830> and<00:05:59.100> then<00:05:59.190> you<00:05:59.310> tap<00:05:59.610> a<00:05:59.850> free<00:06:00.479> to<00:06:00.930> do

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
ball back and then you tap a free to do

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.870 
ball back and then you tap a free to do
the<00:06:01.350> rainbow<00:06:01.860> flick<00:06:02.100> which<00:06:02.220> looks<00:06:02.430> quite<00:06:02.669> nice

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
the rainbow flick which looks quite nice

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.740 
the rainbow flick which looks quite nice
the<00:06:03.120> next<00:06:03.360> one<00:06:03.510> is<00:06:03.660> stop<00:06:04.620> stop<00:06:04.830> dude<00:06:05.040> stop<00:06:05.310> stop

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
the next one is stop stop dude stop stop

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.900 
the next one is stop stop dude stop stop
this<00:06:06.750> is<00:06:06.870> where<00:06:07.020> we<00:06:07.110> fail<00:06:07.320> so<00:06:08.040> you<00:06:08.130> do<00:06:08.250> that<00:06:08.610> and

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
this is where we fail so you do that and

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.060 
this is where we fail so you do that and
then<00:06:09.330> you<00:06:09.419> hold<00:06:09.570> down<00:06:09.840> and<00:06:10.080> this<00:06:10.410> is<00:06:10.620> this<00:06:10.919> is

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.070 
then you hold down and this is this is

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.400 
then you hold down and this is this is
where<00:06:11.220> skill<00:06:11.550> moves<00:06:11.760> this<00:06:11.940> one<00:06:12.180> solid<00:06:12.660> by<00:06:13.350> the

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
where skill moves this one solid by the

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.290 
where skill moves this one solid by the
way<00:06:13.560> this<00:06:13.770> one<00:06:13.950> is<00:06:14.010> really<00:06:14.370> hard<00:06:14.729> for<00:06:14.820> me<00:06:14.940> I<00:06:15.030> can

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
way this one is really hard for me I can

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.480 
way this one is really hard for me I can
often<00:06:15.810> it<00:06:15.960> but<00:06:16.290> I<00:06:16.350> don't<00:06:16.470> know<00:06:16.530> how<00:06:16.680> this<00:06:17.190> one

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
often it but I don't know how this one

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.460 
often it but I don't know how this one

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
still can't do it i still can't do it

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.680 
still can't do it i still can't do it
that's<00:06:25.080> annoying<00:06:26.180> that's<00:06:27.180> annoying<00:06:27.479> how<00:06:27.660> I

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690 
that's annoying that's annoying how I

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:34.889 
that's annoying that's annoying how I
can't<00:06:27.960> do<00:06:28.110> this<00:06:28.140> one<00:06:28.440> I<00:06:28.669> don't<00:06:29.669> act<00:06:29.850> oh<00:06:30.090> my<00:06:30.540> god

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:34.899 

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:37.029 

why<00:06:35.899> is<00:06:35.959> he<00:06:36.049> not<00:06:36.169> doing<00:06:36.439> it<00:06:36.589> that's<00:06:36.860> ridiculous

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 
why is he not doing it that's ridiculous

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:38.769 
why is he not doing it that's ridiculous
this<00:06:37.549> is<00:06:37.610> the<00:06:37.759> one<00:06:37.879> I<00:06:37.909> always<00:06:37.969> feel<00:06:38.360> that<00:06:38.389> and

00:06:38.769 --> 00:06:38.779 
this is the one I always feel that and

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:40.059 
this is the one I always feel that and
this<00:06:39.019> is<00:06:39.139> actually<00:06:39.259> I<00:06:39.469> think<00:06:39.649> this<00:06:39.889> is<00:06:39.979> the

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:40.069 
this is actually I think this is the

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:45.219 
this is actually I think this is the
last<00:06:40.189> one<00:06:43.029> is<00:06:44.029> not<00:06:44.299> done<00:06:44.449> it<00:06:44.569> he's<00:06:44.809> not<00:06:44.989> done<00:06:45.110> it

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:45.229 
last one is not done it he's not done it

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:46.509 
last one is not done it he's not done it
he's<00:06:45.439> not<00:06:45.559> the<00:06:45.619> nip<00:06:45.829> so<00:06:45.979> that<00:06:46.099> would<00:06:46.189> fail<00:06:46.369> that

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:46.519 
he's not the nip so that would fail that

00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:48.729 
he's not the nip so that would fail that
that<00:06:46.639> one<00:06:46.789> but<00:06:47.269> that's<00:06:47.389> how<00:06:47.629> you<00:06:47.689> do<00:06:48.019> some<00:06:48.619> of

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:48.739 
that one but that's how you do some of

00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:50.469 
that one but that's how you do some of
the<00:06:48.799> skills<00:06:49.009> anyway<00:06:49.369> we<00:06:49.759> are<00:06:49.879> we're<00:06:50.089> close<00:06:50.360> to

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 
the skills anyway we are we're close to

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:52.179 
the skills anyway we are we're close to
go<00:06:50.629> but<00:06:51.049> that<00:06:51.169> is<00:06:51.289> the<00:06:51.319> end<00:06:51.619> of<00:06:51.799> all<00:06:52.009> the

00:06:52.179 --> 00:06:52.189 
go but that is the end of all the

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:53.919 
go but that is the end of all the
training<00:06:52.519> ground<00:06:52.729> sequences<00:06:53.269> hopefully

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:53.929 
training ground sequences hopefully

00:06:53.929 --> 00:06:55.539 
training ground sequences hopefully
there<00:06:54.349> is<00:06:54.499> some<00:06:54.709> better<00:06:54.919> people<00:06:55.129> out<00:06:55.489> there

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:55.549 
there is some better people out there

00:06:55.549 --> 00:06:57.249 
there is some better people out there
doing<00:06:56.059> videos<00:06:56.389> where<00:06:56.569> they<00:06:56.659> can<00:06:56.779> explain<00:06:57.079> here

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:57.259 
doing videos where they can explain here

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:59.649 
doing videos where they can explain here
how<00:06:57.469> to<00:06:57.529> do<00:06:57.739> it<00:06:57.860> but<00:06:58.189> skills<00:06:58.639> as<00:06:58.999> something<00:06:59.479> I

00:06:59.649 --> 00:06:59.659 
how to do it but skills as something I

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:01.479 
how to do it but skills as something I
have<00:06:59.779> not<00:06:59.959> mastered<00:07:00.409> and<00:07:00.589> far<00:07:00.860> from<00:07:01.069> mastering

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:01.489 
have not mastered and far from mastering

00:07:01.489 --> 00:07:03.129 
have not mastered and far from mastering
but<00:07:01.939> hopefully<00:07:02.419> they<00:07:02.599> can<00:07:02.659> give<00:07:02.929> them<00:07:03.019> the

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:03.139 
but hopefully they can give them the

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:04.569 
but hopefully they can give them the
edge<00:07:03.259> when<00:07:03.499> moving<00:07:03.709> on<00:07:03.949> to<00:07:04.039> online<00:07:04.309> just<00:07:04.489> a

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:04.579 
edge when moving on to online just a

00:07:04.579 --> 00:07:06.639 
edge when moving on to online just a
basic<00:07:04.759> ones<00:07:05.119> anywhere<00:07:05.479> and<00:07:05.659> I<00:07:06.289> would<00:07:06.439> like

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:06.649 
basic ones anywhere and I would like

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:08.109 
basic ones anywhere and I would like
that<00:07:07.039> obviously<00:07:07.489> the<00:07:07.579> easiest<00:07:07.879> one<00:07:07.999> is<00:07:08.089> a

00:07:08.109 --> 00:07:08.119 
that obviously the easiest one is a

00:07:08.119 --> 00:07:10.779 
that obviously the easiest one is a
triple<00:07:08.539> tap<00:07:08.749> of<00:07:08.929> the<00:07:09.009> of<00:07:10.009> the<00:07:10.159> analog<00:07:10.399> stick<00:07:10.429> in

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:10.789 
triple tap of the of the analog stick in

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:12.219 
triple tap of the of the analog stick in
it<00:07:10.849> does<00:07:11.149> do<00:07:11.269> the<00:07:11.389> rain<00:07:11.539> but<00:07:11.689> you<00:07:11.959> can<00:07:12.079> score

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:12.229 
it does do the rain but you can score

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:14.049 
it does do the rain but you can score
some<00:07:12.289> very<00:07:12.559> nice<00:07:12.679> girls<00:07:12.979> off<00:07:13.159> them<00:07:13.279> as<00:07:13.429> well<00:07:13.579> so
