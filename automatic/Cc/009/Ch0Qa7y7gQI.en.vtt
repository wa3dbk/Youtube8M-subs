00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:09.079 
darker red in some places because of the

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.620 
darker red in some places because of the
texture<00:01:09.670> but<00:01:10.670> I'm<00:01:10.759> mostly<00:01:11.060> going<00:01:11.149> for<00:01:11.600> a

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
texture but I'm mostly going for a

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.510 
texture but I'm mostly going for a
uniform<00:01:12.079> appearance<00:01:13.840> so<00:01:14.920> now<00:01:15.920> I<00:01:15.950> have<00:01:16.069> all

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
uniform appearance so now I have all

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.969 
uniform appearance so now I have all
through<00:01:16.939> my<00:01:17.090> letters<00:01:17.530> colored<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:18.740> I'm<00:01:18.829> going

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
through my letters colored and I'm going

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.580 
through my letters colored and I'm going
to<00:01:19.039> spray<00:01:19.219> them<00:01:19.399> with<00:01:19.459> candy<00:01:20.060> apple<00:01:20.479> red

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
to spray them with candy apple red

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.779 
to spray them with candy apple red
glimmer<00:01:21.590> mist<00:01:21.799> and<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.189> reason<00:01:22.459> I<00:01:22.520> chose<00:01:22.729> it

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
glimmer mist and the reason I chose it

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.120 
glimmer mist and the reason I chose it
is<00:01:23.090> because<00:01:23.149> it<00:01:23.600> had<00:01:23.719> a<00:01:23.749> red<00:01:24.020> base<00:01:24.289> and<00:01:24.679> a<00:01:24.859> gold

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
is because it had a red base and a gold

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.309 
is because it had a red base and a gold
shimmer<00:01:25.509> mostly<00:01:26.509> I<00:01:26.569> wanted<00:01:26.840> a<00:01:26.929> gold<00:01:27.109> shimmer

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:27.319 
shimmer mostly I wanted a gold shimmer

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:29.709 
shimmer mostly I wanted a gold shimmer
and<00:01:27.709> I<00:01:27.920> wanted<00:01:28.159> to<00:01:28.219> intensify<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.880> red<00:01:29.119> so<00:01:29.420> any

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:29.719 
and I wanted to intensify the red so any

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:32.379 
and I wanted to intensify the red so any
red<00:01:30.679> glimmer<00:01:30.979> mist<00:01:31.249> with<00:01:31.520> a<00:01:31.549> gold<00:01:31.880> base<00:01:32.119> would

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:32.389 
red glimmer mist with a gold base would

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:35.859 
red glimmer mist with a gold base would
have<00:01:32.479> worked<00:01:32.659> just<00:01:32.810> fine<00:01:32.959> for<00:01:33.380> this<00:01:34.630> next<00:01:35.630> I'm

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
have worked just fine for this next I'm

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.169 
have worked just fine for this next I'm
taking<00:01:35.899> a<00:01:36.259> piece<00:01:36.289> of<00:01:36.529> music<00:01:37.069> sheet<00:01:37.459> paper<00:01:37.639> and

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
taking a piece of music sheet paper and

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.469 
taking a piece of music sheet paper and
this<00:01:38.539> is<00:01:38.689> actually<00:01:38.899> to<00:01:39.799> Gloria<00:01:40.490> which<00:01:41.209> I

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
this is actually to Gloria which I

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.089 
this is actually to Gloria which I
thought<00:01:41.779> worked<00:01:42.020> really<00:01:42.409> well<00:01:42.529> for<00:01:42.920> a

00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:43.099 
thought worked really well for a

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:45.789 
thought worked really well for a
background<00:01:43.639> of<00:01:43.849> a<00:01:44.359> Christmas<00:01:44.779> tag<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.319> I'm

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
background of a Christmas tag and I'm

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.429 
background of a Christmas tag and I'm
going<00:01:45.920> to<00:01:45.950> cover<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:46.399> whole<00:01:46.579> thing<00:01:46.849> with

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
going to cover the whole thing with

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.779 
going to cover the whole thing with
distress<00:01:48.439> ink<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:48.799> shabby<00:01:48.979> shudders<00:01:49.459> and

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
distress ink and shabby shudders and

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.999 
distress ink and shabby shudders and
then<00:01:50.539> so<00:01:50.719> I<00:01:50.749> can<00:01:50.959> get<00:01:51.049> a<00:01:51.109> better<00:01:51.259> idea<00:01:51.380> of<00:01:51.740> where

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
then so I can get a better idea of where

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.339 
then so I can get a better idea of where
the<00:01:52.159> edges<00:01:52.369> are<00:01:52.819> going<00:01:53.029> to<00:01:53.090> be<00:01:53.240> I'm<00:01:54.109> actually

00:01:54.339 --> 00:01:54.349 
the edges are going to be I'm actually

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:56.169 
the edges are going to be I'm actually
going<00:01:54.619> to<00:01:54.679> just<00:01:54.889> place<00:01:55.009> a<00:01:55.130> tag<00:01:55.520> over<00:01:55.909> it<00:01:55.999> and

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
going to just place a tag over it and

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:57.789 
going to just place a tag over it and
then<00:01:56.270> trim<00:01:56.509> around<00:01:56.630> it<00:01:56.929> roughly<00:01:57.499> with<00:01:57.649> my

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
then trim around it roughly with my

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.279 
then trim around it roughly with my
scissors<00:01:58.270> so<00:01:59.270> I<00:01:59.569> have<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.989> piece<00:02:00.139> of<00:02:00.169> paper

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
scissors so I have the piece of paper

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.669 
scissors so I have the piece of paper
basically<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:01.189> same<00:02:01.369> size<00:02:01.639> as<00:02:01.880> a<00:02:01.909> tag<00:02:02.499> so<00:02:03.499> now

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
basically the same size as a tag so now

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:04.629 
basically the same size as a tag so now
that<00:02:03.709> I<00:02:03.950> know<00:02:04.009> what<00:02:04.159> that's<00:02:04.279> going<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.579> look

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:04.639 
that I know what that's going to look

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:06.039

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
well what I'll do is I'll go peel and

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.219 
well what I'll do is I'll go peel and
back<00:03:54.069> up<00:03:54.280> add<00:03:54.519> more<00:03:55.150> gel<00:03:55.389> medium<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.019> tag

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:56.229 
back up add more gel medium to the tag

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:58.679 
back up add more gel medium to the tag
and<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.829> paper<00:03:57.009> and<00:03:57.430> then<00:03:57.669> go<00:03:58.030> from<00:03:58.180> there<00:03:58.269> and

00:03:58.679 --> 00:03:58.689 
and the paper and then go from there and

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.749 
and the paper and then go from there and
then<00:03:59.530> once<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.859> whole<00:04:00.040> thing<00:04:00.250> is<00:04:00.430> totally

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:00.759 
then once the whole thing is totally

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.699 
then once the whole thing is totally
stuck<00:04:01.269> down<00:04:01.509> I'm<00:04:01.750> going<00:04:01.870> to<00:04:01.959> go<00:04:02.079> over<00:04:02.109> the<00:04:02.500> top

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
stuck down I'm going to go over the top

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.210 
stuck down I'm going to go over the top
with<00:04:02.949> the<00:04:03.099> gel<00:04:03.370> medium<00:04:04.379> one<00:04:05.379> more<00:04:05.590> time<00:04:05.859> just

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
with the gel medium one more time just

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.640 
with the gel medium one more time just
to<00:04:06.370> kind<00:04:06.639> of<00:04:06.729> seal<00:04:07.060> it<00:04:07.209> all<00:04:07.329> together<00:04:07.569> and<00:04:10.650> now

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
to kind of seal it all together and now

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.110 
to kind of seal it all together and now
i'm<00:04:11.889> running<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.370> tag<00:04:12.579> through<00:04:12.970> my

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
i'm running the tag through my

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.210 
i'm running the tag through my
de-stresser<00:04:13.599> and<00:04:14.049> I'm<00:04:14.229> doing<00:04:14.530> it<00:04:14.650> several

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
de-stresser and I'm doing it several

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.870 
de-stresser and I'm doing it several
times<00:04:15.489> to<00:04:16.209> get<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.900> edges<00:04:17.229> really<00:04:17.560> rough<00:04:17.880> some

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
times to get the edges really rough some

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.990 
times to get the edges really rough some
areas<00:04:19.690> or<00:04:19.870> completely<00:04:20.320> have<00:04:20.979> torn<00:04:21.400> chunks<00:04:21.909> out

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
areas or completely have torn chunks out

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.920 
areas or completely have torn chunks out
of<00:04:22.060> them<00:04:22.270> and<00:04:23.340> that's<00:04:24.340> exactly<00:04:25.060> what<00:04:25.539> I<00:04:25.570> wanted

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
of them and that's exactly what I wanted

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.110 
of them and that's exactly what I wanted
so<00:04:26.770> I'm<00:04:26.830> going<00:04:26.889> to<00:04:27.010> highlight<00:04:27.279> the<00:04:27.669> distressed

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
so I'm going to highlight the distressed

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.510 
so I'm going to highlight the distressed
edges<00:04:28.599> with<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:29.110> vintage<00:04:29.440> photo<00:04:29.770> distress

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
and that's just going to pick up the

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.350 
and that's just going to pick up the
torn<00:04:37.360> bits<00:04:37.630> and<00:04:38.260> all<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.650> different<00:04:39.010> textures

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
torn bits and all the different textures

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.990 
torn bits and all the different textures
from<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.570> distressor<00:04:41.250> you<00:04:42.250> can<00:04:42.430> see<00:04:42.640> here<00:04:42.850> how

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
from the distressor you can see here how

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.790 
from the distressor you can see here how
you<00:04:43.060> can<00:04:43.360> really<00:04:43.600> see<00:04:43.840> how<00:04:43.960> ragged<00:04:44.380> the<00:04:44.470> edges

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
you can really see how ragged the edges

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:52.950 
you can really see how ragged the edges
are<00:04:44.920> now<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:47.940> then<00:04:48.940> what<00:04:51.540> I'm<00:04:52.540> going<00:04:52.750> to<00:04:52.810> do

hissy fit while I was working on this
part<00:05:07.810> of<00:05:07.930> it<00:05:08.050> so<00:05:08.770> that<00:05:08.800> video<00:05:09.430> didn't<00:05:09.730> record

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
part of it so that video didn't record

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.910

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.220 
with the iridescent gold glimmer mist
and<00:05:53.890> again<00:05:54.610> that<00:05:54.790> just<00:05:54.970> helps<00:05:55.230> blend

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:56.230 
and again that just helps blend

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:58.560 
and again that just helps blend
everything<00:05:56.500> together<00:05:57.100> and<00:05:57.580> this<00:05:58.270> time

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
everything together and this time

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.420 
everything together and this time
instead<00:05:58.750> of<00:05:58.960> letting<00:05:59.110> it<00:05:59.290> dry<00:05:59.530> i<00:05:59.560> will<00:06:00.010> dab<00:06:00.250> it

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.430 
instead of letting it dry i will dab it

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.700 
instead of letting it dry i will dab it
off<00:06:00.580> and<00:06:01.540> then<00:06:01.600> i'll<00:06:01.900> just<00:06:01.990> take<00:06:02.260> off<00:06:02.440> some<00:06:02.680> of

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
off and then i'll just take off some of

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.030 
off and then i'll just take off some of
the<00:06:02.800> excess<00:06:02.830> moisture<00:06:03.490> and<00:06:04.890> some<00:06:05.890> of<00:06:05.950> the

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
the excess moisture and some of the

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.890 
the excess moisture and some of the
excess<00:06:06.340> ink<00:06:06.640> as<00:06:06.820> well<00:06:08.460> so<00:06:09.460> i'm<00:06:09.640> just<00:06:09.900> dabbing

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
excess ink as well so i'm just dabbing

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.440 
excess ink as well so i'm just dabbing
it<00:06:10.990> off<00:06:11.170> there<00:06:11.530> and<00:06:11.800> so<00:06:12.790> that's<00:06:13.000> what<00:06:13.150> it<00:06:13.210> looks

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
it off there and so that's what it looks

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.590 
it off there and so that's what it looks
like<00:06:13.630> now<00:06:13.690> and<00:06:14.230> i'm<00:06:15.220> going<00:06:15.460> to<00:06:15.850> let<00:06:16.120> that<00:06:16.180> dry

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
like now and i'm going to let that dry

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.320 
like now and i'm going to let that dry
as<00:06:16.900> well<00:06:17.200> and<00:06:17.560> now<00:06:18.280> that<00:06:18.490> it's<00:06:18.640> dry<00:06:18.880> i'm<00:06:19.150> just

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
as well and now that it's dry i'm just

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.080 
as well and now that it's dry i'm just
going<00:06:19.480> to<00:06:19.540> leave<00:06:20.140> it<00:06:20.170> into<00:06:20.740> the<00:06:21.010> twine<00:06:21.340> so<00:06:21.940> it

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
going to leave it into the twine so it

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.060 
going to leave it into the twine so it
looks<00:06:22.300> like<00:06:22.390> the<00:06:22.750> twine<00:06:23.050> is<00:06:23.440> what's<00:06:23.890> holding

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.070 
looks like the twine is what's holding

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.220 
looks like the twine is what's holding
it<00:06:24.370> to<00:06:24.640> the<00:06:24.670> tag<00:06:25.120> and<00:06:25.390> I'm<00:06:25.480> being<00:06:25.870> careful<00:06:26.020> not
