efficiency<00:01:18.179> for<00:01:19.179> a<00:01:19.240> renovation<00:01:19.750> it<00:01:20.380> is<00:01:20.590> quite

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
efficiency for a renovation it is quite

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.529 
efficiency for a renovation it is quite
frankly<00:01:21.520> off<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.819> map<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:22.209> when<00:01:22.299> I<00:01:22.330> heard

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
frankly off the map and when I heard

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.510 
frankly off the map and when I heard
about<00:01:22.750> this<00:01:22.929> I<00:01:23.140> said<00:01:23.560> I<00:01:23.709> got<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:23.950> be<00:01:24.039> here<00:01:24.190> I<00:01:24.369> got

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
about this I said I got to be here I got

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.279 
about this I said I got to be here I got
to<00:01:24.610> see<00:01:24.729> it<00:01:24.819> energy<00:01:25.330> efficiency<00:01:25.420> is<00:01:25.869> rated<00:01:26.170> on

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
to see it energy efficiency is rated on

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.399 
to see it energy efficiency is rated on
a<00:01:26.319> scale<00:01:26.409> of<00:01:26.679> 1<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.280> 100<00:01:27.429> this<00:01:28.149> one<00:01:28.360> ranks<00:01:28.569> a<00:01:28.810> 94

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
a scale of 1 to 100 this one ranks a 94

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.620 
a scale of 1 to 100 this one ranks a 94
so<00:01:29.679> in<00:01:29.799> canadian<00:01:30.250> terms<00:01:30.549> there's<00:01:31.240> nothing

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
so in canadian terms there's nothing

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.410 
so in canadian terms there's nothing
better<00:01:31.810> it<00:01:32.740> starts<00:01:33.100> with<00:01:33.250> solar<00:01:33.580> panels<00:01:33.880> and<00:01:34.299> a

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
better it starts with solar panels and a

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.660 
better it starts with solar panels and a
solar<00:01:34.720> hot<00:01:35.020> water<00:01:35.080> collection<00:01:35.770> system<00:01:35.950> on<00:01:36.520> the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
roof the guts of the cost savings there

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.550 
roof the guts of the cost savings there
in<00:01:39.579> the<00:01:39.670> basement<00:01:40.180> there's<00:01:40.869> a<00:01:40.930> big<00:01:41.170> coil

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
in the basement there's a big coil

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.219 
in the basement there's a big coil
inside<00:01:42.159> that<00:01:42.549> takes<00:01:42.909> that<00:01:43.119> energy<00:01:43.359> and<00:01:43.990> then

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
inside that takes that energy and then

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.749 
inside that takes that energy and then
that<00:01:44.409> goes<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.799> domestic<00:01:45.159> hot<00:01:45.729> water
