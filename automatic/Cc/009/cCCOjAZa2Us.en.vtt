to be honest they just turned out to be

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.270 
to be honest they just turned out to be
a<00:00:49.870> lot<00:00:50.140> more<00:00:50.170> difficult<00:00:50.830> than<00:00:50.890> we<00:00:51.160> originally

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
a lot more difficult than we originally

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.870 
a lot more difficult than we originally
thought<00:00:51.670> end<00:00:52.240> quote<00:00:52.510> so<00:00:53.760> basically<00:00:54.760> we've

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
thought end quote so basically we've

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.370 
thought end quote so basically we've
been<00:00:55.030> told<00:00:55.210> for<00:00:55.420> about<00:00:55.600> a<00:00:55.630> year<00:00:55.960> now<00:00:55.990> that<00:00:56.320> we

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
been told for about a year now that we

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.920 
been told for about a year now that we
were<00:00:56.470> going<00:00:56.590> to<00:00:56.650> get<00:00:56.770> heist<00:00:57.010> and<00:00:57.690> every<00:00:58.690> time

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
were going to get heist and every time

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.960 
were going to get heist and every time
the<00:00:59.470> date<00:00:59.680> comes<00:00:59.980> to<00:01:00.310> where<00:01:00.490> it's<00:01:00.700> supposed<00:01:00.790> to

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
the date comes to where it's supposed to

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.430 
the date comes to where it's supposed to
come<00:01:01.090> out<00:01:01.300> it<00:01:01.600> doesn't<00:01:01.960> come<00:01:02.079> out<00:01:02.170> it<00:01:02.380> gets

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
come out it doesn't come out it gets

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.140 
come out it doesn't come out it gets
pushed<00:01:02.740> back<00:01:02.829> they<00:01:03.430> say<00:01:03.640> because<00:01:03.790> of<00:01:04.000> this

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
pushed back they say because of this

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.270 
pushed back they say because of this
reason<00:01:04.269> because<00:01:04.809> it's<00:01:05.320> more<00:01:05.470> complex<00:01:05.920> than<00:01:06.070> we

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
reason because it's more complex than we

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.640 
reason because it's more complex than we
think<00:01:06.549> and<00:01:06.850> basically<00:01:07.689> that<00:01:07.990> gate<00:01:08.170> wasn't<00:01:08.380> set

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
think and basically that gate wasn't set

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.830 
think and basically that gate wasn't set
up<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:08.890> way<00:01:09.040> they<00:01:09.070> wanted<00:01:09.490> it<00:01:09.609> to<00:01:09.789> and<00:01:10.179> he<00:01:10.600> says

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
up the way they wanted it to and he says

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.419 
up the way they wanted it to and he says
after<00:01:11.020> many<00:01:11.289> months<00:01:11.409> of<00:01:11.560> designing<00:01:12.009> testing

00:01:12.419 --> 00:01:12.429 
after many months of designing testing

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:14.190 
after many months of designing testing
rewriting<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:12.999> retesting<00:01:13.569> we<00:01:13.689> settled<00:01:14.020> on<00:01:14.170> a

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
rewriting and retesting we settled on a

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.349 
rewriting and retesting we settled on a
four<00:01:14.530> player<00:01:14.770> structure<00:01:15.280> that<00:01:15.369> you<00:01:15.520> will

well<00:01:45.630> doing<00:01:46.630> a<00:01:46.689> lot<00:01:46.810> of<00:01:46.869> stuff<00:01:47.139> to<00:01:47.170> make<00:01:47.350> it

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:47.499 
well doing a lot of stuff to make it

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:49.559 
well doing a lot of stuff to make it
more<00:01:47.619> complex<00:01:48.159> on<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.369> multiplayer<00:01:48.969> end<00:01:49.299> and

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
more complex on the multiplayer end and

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.719 
more complex on the multiplayer end and
basically<00:01:50.529> every<00:01:50.950> time<00:01:51.130> they<00:01:51.279> would<00:01:51.459> mess<00:01:51.700> up

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
basically every time they would mess up

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.580 
basically every time they would mess up
on<00:01:52.090> something<00:01:52.359> it<00:01:52.869> would<00:01:53.020> take<00:01:53.170> them<00:01:53.289> back<00:01:53.380> to

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
on something it would take them back to

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.069 
on something it would take them back to
square<00:01:53.859> one<00:01:54.130> so<00:01:55.029> basically<00:01:55.509> just<00:01:55.749> kind<00:01:55.929> of<00:01:55.959> my

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
square one so basically just kind of my

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.620

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
should have gotten and it was making it

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.369 
should have gotten and it was making it
a<00:02:53.280> lot<00:02:53.549> longer<00:02:53.849> delaying<00:02:54.599> it<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:54.840> lot<00:02:55.140> more<00:02:55.170> than

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
a lot longer delaying it a lot more than

the shit of and you know basically
that's<00:02:58.379> a<00:02:58.530> big<00:02:58.890> reason<00:02:59.069> why<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.489> took<00:02:59.670> so<00:02:59.730> long

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120
