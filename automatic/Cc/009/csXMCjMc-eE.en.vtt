00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.230
 older 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.570
 there are different cases 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.450
 but the statistics speak for themselves 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.500
 investment other issues

 these people saw the first block 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.159
 and for the purposes of chambers more than now 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.290
 same

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:24.449
 on contact period 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:27.449
 what can be said about lovers of the Carpathians 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.699
 these guys are lucky most are familiar with 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:33.039
 computers four six years old 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:35.009
 someone familiar since birth 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:36.499
 it's very hard for them to understand 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:38.609
 Players who have a weapon can pass 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.369
 make a single release 

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:43.379
 they are so much danish less often so eyes 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:44.909
 they don't create the first team 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.240
 prepares the computer for the first turn 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.439
 why is it 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.319
 in particular a game with beautiful graphics 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.979
 where that episode is not so important 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:55.369
 but now essentially a comparable card 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:56.459
 compact 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.609
 gifts without question superior to dad 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.299
 few people believe when tactics things lane 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.429
 protocol 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:05.529
 concept of master plan lighthouse play 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:07.550
 number of blocks card size 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.509
 and new cards 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:12.249
 but to whom heat leads trouble easily 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:14.729
 create measures will invite friends 

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:17.729
 the flow is for 12 people 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.199
 in may as the same number of days not 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.889
 limited endless folk card 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.779
 the server needs a very powerful computer 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.769
 constant and addresses open party 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.879
 according to the plot the percentage is not very good 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.019
 in both games 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.349
 as noted that no 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.090
 however, artem can be traced from 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.380
 achievement systems 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.490
 percentage of more than half the players so 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.900
 and did not get to the point that 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.269
 no NATO direction 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:44.989
 update in both games comes out 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.399
 about the same time interval 

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:48.639
 and let's notice 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.189
 what is the situation however this 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.419
 a game 

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:55.109
 I will not say exactly what 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.489
 gave stapa but because for me the game 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.649
 love the same 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:01.510
 run what are you arguing friends 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.470
 enough but 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.459
 trite because 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.069
 I hope that I have not offended anyone insulted 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.799

 application avatar as the tenth was 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.219
 excellent interesting pieces of dolls therefore
