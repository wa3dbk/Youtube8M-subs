00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.700
 sometimes you also meet people who 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.799
 I do not need a consultant I do 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.050
 all over the internet 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.790
 understandable in principle and me 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.820
 I thought I'll take a look 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.690
 do not give it a try and have a look 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.199
 car insurance on the internet 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.020
 compared 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.430
 about such comparative portals but because 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.660
 I did not want to be silly 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.960
 I thought you would take it 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.410
 but takes five so check24 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.000
 transparo verivox and six times a car 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.070
 I was fine with my car 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.600
 Just forgot that I'm not like that 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.980
 right in ghana I do not sensible 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.320
 So I got an offer 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.899
 from the customer times a car indiscriminately 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.059
 picked out and tried it 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:43.920
 theoretically you have to if you 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.500
 Here from a really fair comparison 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.450
 could speak, he would have five times the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.270
 same or at least a lot 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.070
 come out similar result 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.050
 that was not the case at all 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.850
 had five different completely 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.920
 different results out of it 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.590
 of course I have thought and me 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.100
 asked what should I do with such a 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.270
 Result now and then it is me 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.210
 also captured that in the last 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.090
 weeks and months quite often advertising 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.049
 seen by check24 from transparo 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.850
 and from verivox on tv and well 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.250
 This advertising also costs money one way 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.770
 a 30 seconds advertising spot costs at rtl 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.840
 at a normal broadcasting time between 15 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.610
 up to 65,000 euros 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.369
 that is money and must be in one 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.710
 pay and of course it is clear 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.350
 these comparative portals live from 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.350
 Commissions that pay the insurance 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.780
 where was completed next to and on 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.060
 I can describe myself as the end of the story 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.549
 Please ask me if I am anyway 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.899
 pay commission because I wanted that 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.670
 actually bypass when I'm in 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.540
 internet is what I do in my opinion 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.430
 is also legitimate 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.780
 but if I'm like this at the end of the day 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.310
 so pay commission 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.649
 then I should ask myself 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.780
 I really want to pay them then 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.149
 that any comparison portal advertising 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.890
 I can not or do not want to do that 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.290
 for my money least consultant have 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.060
 which helps me in case of falls in the 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.530
 damage and incidentally you close 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.550
 just for this one reason one 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.530
 insurance 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.680
 which then stands by my side and me 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.660
 By the way, that does not mean that is 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.970
 that we do not always look at it 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.650
 internet where do we stand with ours 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.700
 Praise if I have customers with times 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.400
 a car and I'm pretty 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.320
 Expensive before and I think you have to 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.700
 sometimes good losers are always from 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.890
 Price differences of three or four 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.600
 100 euro speaks then I think it is 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.220
 also the job of the pater simply mean 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.840
 to tell customers what makes it even there 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.120
 Go and do that, that'll be fine 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.250
 But now and then it is often like that 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.690
 we say what to the customers as well 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.910
 think about the contracts 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.310
 bundling with customer bonus we are whole 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.830
 fast cheaper than the cheapest 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.900
 internet provider and from 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.580
 different services even there 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.230
 do not even speak because I hope 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.040
 there is nobody who really believes 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.320
 that with auto insurance 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.790
 really just about liability 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.990
 partially comprehensive insurance are the 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.160
 co-participation and the rest is 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.260
 the same as there are already a few 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.150
 differences so each of you can 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.800
 to think for what you want 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.820
 I pay my commission for advertising 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.070
 or rather one 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.070
 contact person can you just think
