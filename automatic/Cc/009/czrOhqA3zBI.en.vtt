throughout the entire case I'm going to

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.070 
throughout the entire case I'm going to
turn<00:03:27.580> it<00:03:27.730> around<00:03:27.819> to<00:03:28.239> give<00:03:28.420> you<00:03:28.540> a<00:03:28.569> better<00:03:28.720> look

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
and we actually have this spine here

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.319 
and we actually have this spine here
which<00:03:33.489> is<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.700> reinforced<00:03:34.540> spine<00:03:34.930> so<00:03:35.739> they<00:03:36.640> must

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:37.329 
which is a reinforced spine so they must

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.420 
which is a reinforced spine so they must
have<00:03:37.600> put<00:03:37.900> some<00:03:38.110> sort<00:03:38.380> of<00:03:38.440> cardboard<00:03:39.040> or<00:03:39.160> hard

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
have put some sort of cardboard or hard

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.970 
have put some sort of cardboard or hard
plastic<00:03:39.970> in<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:40.450> even<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.440> shell<00:03:41.739> itself

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
plastic in it and even the shell itself

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.220 
plastic in it and even the shell itself
is<00:03:42.519> reinforced<00:03:43.329> so<00:03:43.690> it<00:03:43.810> makes<00:03:43.989> it<00:03:44.140> very

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
is reinforced so it makes it very

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.000 
is reinforced so it makes it very
durable<00:03:44.860> and<00:03:45.930> I<00:03:46.930> actually<00:03:47.140> really<00:03:47.680> like<00:03:47.860> that
