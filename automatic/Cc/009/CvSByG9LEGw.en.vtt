00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.260
 hello this is not timonov and everything is like 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.179
 animals program about who people are 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.860
 we are in croatia to take pictures 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.470
 another program from our 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.310
 adriatic cycle take off and leave 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.800
 home or to leave but very handy 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.320
 not bad here 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.779
 nice and warm well fed judge 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.099
 give water stay well I don’t know to 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.289
 rush here multiply 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.110
 become a successful invasive species go 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.910
 bad invasive species is an organism 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.879
 who came to a new place and 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.270
 settled here is not worse than his 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.270
 native 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.129
 and even better and in order to achieve in 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.730
 this success must be kept simple 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.890
 rules for those who come in the first place 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.649
 it makes sense to where everyone lives either 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.149
 too good or too bad either 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.070
 Well, how can you relax? 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.379
 Here, for example, consider the classic 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.789
 success story when australia became 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.410
 plant sugar cane 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.149
 immediately found some zuchara from 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.700
 the local who shut up holiday cottage 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.770
 very cheerfully eat up and to fight 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.900
 this pest from south america was 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.970
 brought in ja'boag 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.000
 as such a cheap working toad 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.920
 for work on the plantations aha this is such 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.900
 hefty reached thunderous jabin 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.299
 which in their homeland such beetles 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.150
 clicks like sunflower seeds but coming to 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.040
 australia yeah looked at the pigs 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.710
 said fool to know what 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.930
 Neftekamsk beetles themselves and set about 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.970
 other defenseless and the United States in no way 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.009
 the guilty insects that made up 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.350
 local insect-eating base 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.720
 waves than this most insectivorous fauna 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.820
 certainly terribly upset more 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.850
 local predators and began to hunt 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.979
 big eater in u new toad and 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.420
 traditions and I will give against whom they have 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.040
 there was absolutely no way for him 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.110
 this and in the end in some regions 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.930
 australia local fauna he literally 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.540
 crushed by toad success 4 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.939
 so pack your bags in a new place 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.979
 make sure first there 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.729
 enough resources for you 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.830
 was that there is 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.590
 and secondly there are no predators that 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.000
 will control your numbers 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.120
 otherwise it will be like my favorite stories 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.100
 about the recent invasion of the black sea on 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.110
 modern liners travels not 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.200
 only office plankton and quite myself 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.560
 present in ballast waters and such 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.090
 ballast water in the black sea skidded 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.590
 ctenophore and me me up csa very such 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.470
 beautiful looking like transparent 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.900
 rainbow flashlight she say at this time 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.470
 in the black sea have become undeservedly good 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.080
 live water got fertilizer and caused 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.360
 the outbreak of plankton is so much 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.850
 strong that the fish did not have time 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.500
 eat up and then it comes so well 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.970
 ctenophores 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.650
 very fast gluttonous them obs with and 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.730
 fireman all local plankton and in 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.140
 lack of natural enemies and 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.299
 bred so in some places 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.609
 water near the shore for what turned into 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.350
 iridescent jelly jelly and sprat remained 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.570
 without food base began to die out 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.239
 and Black Sea fishermen cursed everything on 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.600
 light and it is not clear what would have ended this 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.480
 story for sprat and black sea ​​sauces 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.310
 fishermen if the black sea is exactly the same 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.799
 accidentally brought a different view 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.239
 ctenophers of hero avo there heroes 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.640
 wonderful because it is obligate 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.359
 predator and feeds exclusively on others 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.519
 crests for centuries 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.079
 and other mushroom pickers besides maksis in 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.079
 the black sea ​​was not and therefore 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:25.079
 voracious heroes just as quickly 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.910
 for a few years we 've gotten all the extras 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.319
 them psy saw and restored 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.480
 biological balance 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.069
 Hamsa and sprats come out there 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.849
 demographic crisis fishermen 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.099
 cheered up 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.810
 environmentalists exhaled at all it's completely 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.310
 perfect situation when one 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.840
 hey introduced species completely 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.519
 controls the strength of the other and when 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.950
 This does not interfere in the internal 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:46.469
 Aboriginal affairs Well, the only thing 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.659
 due to ridges secreted by rivers of mucus 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:50.370
 transparency of the Black Sea water and 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.959
 dropped a few meters but it 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.719
 such trifles compared 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.040
 and how are things going with us 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:58.409
 here on the Adriatic 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.680
 a few years ago brought it here 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:02.760
 tropical seaweed caulerpa taxifolia 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.620
 it's so beautiful too 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.139
 bright green attack trim like 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.819
 caulerpa christmas tree lightly 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.159
 toxic therefore even in native waters and 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.199
 and no one really eats and even in the Adriatic 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.370
 and no one at all and therefore in the absence of 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:17.489
 natural enemies 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.590
 it has grown so covered here and there 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.169
 Adriatic one is solid 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.000
 bright green elegant carpet perfectly 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.490
 you are a barrier flora technique and very 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.770
 rook variable Croatian fauna 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.690
 environmentalists sounded the alarm and naturally 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.300
 started recruiting divers volunteers for 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.479
 caulerpa elimination that is weeding and 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.770
 deletion I have a horrible periodic 1 to 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.840
 create artificially vertical 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.940
 control over loose algae 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.470
 by the way is this the same principle or 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.539
 minus he her therapy what use 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.000
 the most who Maurice when the male solution 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:49.800
 water removes pathogens in large numbers from 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.550
 biocenosis of your nose allowing it 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.349
 recover 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.020
 certainly not so much fun when the game 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.940
 gardeners new also works the truth 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.979
 This trouble with caulerpa I learned in our 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.050
 last croatia and this one even 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.880
 I also planned to participate in 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.520
 weeding the adriatic 1 from hellish 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.740
 Christmas trees but what to dive and know how the new year 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.909
 I do not like but however not fate 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.099
 because because of the small 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:12.870
 climate change caulerpa in 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.820
 adriatic disappeared just as suddenly 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.500
 he appeared literally 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.020
 whale separate islets somewhere in the south 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.380
 adriatic which does not bother anyone so 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.000
 that as our caulerpa thanks, it went well 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.530
 and last in order to achieve 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.210
 success in a new place completely 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.669
 it is not necessary to go there for all well 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.440
 on the contrary, go where everyone feels bad 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:34.120
 for example 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.979
 noble crustacean artemia salina 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.380
 Artemia eggs are blown in by the wind 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:40.479
 drying up sea reservoirs and in this and 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.510
 Drian Alain brine where 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.620
 all normal sea life is bent 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.180
 artemia safely multiply and 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.729
 multiply to the joy Kulik am 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.729
 flamingos and other lovers of salty 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.919
 and life goes on so by nudge 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:56.260
 can anyone and why but 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:59.050
 there is always one common any kind 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.090
 Invaders change the place in which he 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.850
 gets and not always the best 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.470
 side so if you liked 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:07.449
 think about some place 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.570
 Is it because well, and he likes that 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:11.260
 you are still not here in general 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.229
 adriatic 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:17.010
 but we will go to the house with you, it was all like 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:17.010
 at the beasts bye 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.900
 this is kasava simmons 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.460
 Monkeys which is a sea ​​monkey 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.960
 look under the microscope 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.210
 right here she lives and natural 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.550
 conditions due to an incredible amount 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.860
 size is already very large 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:43.190
 such a very light shrimp and that's how 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.110
 once they feed local snipe and and 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.760
 there is even one kind of small 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.350
 cabin water market which 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.600
 adapted to live in such here 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.720
 inhumanly humanly beautiful 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.720
 conditions
