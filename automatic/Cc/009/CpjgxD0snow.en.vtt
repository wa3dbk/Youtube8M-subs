00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 or the recipes and recipes today we are going to 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.770
 prepare the most famous salad of 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.040
 world 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.840
 the caesar salad 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.700
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.760
 cut a garlic in half and remove its 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.440
 inner stem with this we will avoid that 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.810
 the garlic repeat 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.840
 then we are going to prepare the famous sauce 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:24.039
 Caesar in a beater glass we put the garlic 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.039
 a few spoonfuls of mayonnaise 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.380
 a little mustard 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.579
 Canned anchovy loins 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.440
 Grated parmesan cheese that could be 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.240
 perfectly replaced by your cheese 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.640
 cured favorite 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.230
 and a little milk that if I did not go 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.500
 to leave a sauce too dense 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.930
 then we beat it well 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.700
 his thing would be to do all this in a glass 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.900
 beater but here as you are the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.820
 protagonist I have done it in a 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.800
 cazuelita so you can see all the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.809
 process well 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.690
 when it is well beaten with the texture 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.430
 what you see, our Caesar sauce will be ready 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.409
 Now we prepare the rest of 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.310
 ingredients we cut a breast of 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.310
 chicken in half 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.710
 we put salt on both sides 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.420
 and we cook them on the grill with a 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.420
 oil droplet 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.030
 After about five minutes we give you the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.570
 turn around and cook the other side other 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.570
 five minutes 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.320
 and when they are already cooked the 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.320
 we remove and reserve on a plate 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.900
 then we put the pan back on 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.810
 fire we add a splash of oil 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.640
 olive and we put when the previous day 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.159
 cut into squares to fry 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.840
 When it's crisp and crisp, what 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.480
 we remove and put it on paper 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.060
 absorbent 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.940
 we only have to assemble the salad myself 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.070
 I will make an individual reaction on a plate 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.659
 we base one or two tablespoons of 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.119
 Caesar sauce 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.289
 over washed and cut romaine lettuce 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.360
 in Little pieces 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.629
 then we put the chicken cut into 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.629
 strips 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.660
 a little bit of toast that will give you a 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.030
 excellent crispy touch 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.970
 and finally sprinkle with cheese 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.220
 grated 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.650
 before eating, do not forget to give it well 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.810
 of laps and with this we will have ready 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.070
