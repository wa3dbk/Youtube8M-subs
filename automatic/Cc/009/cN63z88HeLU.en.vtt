to answer that one last the film is shot

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.960

primarily in Casablanca and regions they

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.779 
primarily in Casablanca and regions they

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.799 
March and last month they went back to
Jerusalem<00:00:31.309> primarily<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.550> do<00:00:32.669> locales<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.540> to

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
Jerusalem primarily to do locales and to

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.740 
Jerusalem primarily to do locales and to
redo<00:00:34.140> some<00:00:34.170> street<00:00:34.950> scenes<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.120> because

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
redo some street scenes so that because

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.740 
redo some street scenes so that because
since<00:00:37.079> Jerusalem<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.500> all<00:00:37.620> limestone<00:00:38.750> turns

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
since Jerusalem is all limestone turns

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.440 
since Jerusalem is all limestone turns
out<00:00:39.899> Casablanca<00:00:40.879> worked<00:00:41.879> really<00:00:42.120> well<00:00:42.270> for

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
out Casablanca worked really well for

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.170 
out Casablanca worked really well for
Damascus<00:00:43.200> but<00:00:43.739> not<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.219> well<00:00:44.399> for<00:00:44.430> Jerusalem

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
Damascus but not so well for Jerusalem

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.569 
Damascus but not so well for Jerusalem
which<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.750> well<00:00:45.989> known<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:47.010> they<00:00:47.160> reshot

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
which is so well known so they reshot

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.720 
which is so well known so they reshot
some<00:00:48.120> stuff<00:00:48.780> there<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:52.440> book<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.309> film<00:00:53.579> is

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
some stuff there the book is the film is

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.040 
some stuff there the book is the film is
different<00:00:53.879> than<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> book<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.690> maybe<00:00:54.840> this

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
different than the book and maybe this

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.490 
different than the book and maybe this
is<00:00:55.230> an<00:00:55.350> advantage<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.340> book<00:00:56.489> being<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:56.940> old

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
is an advantage of the book being so old

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.470 
is an advantage of the book being so old
or<00:00:58.500> having<00:00:58.770> been<00:00:58.859> written<00:00:59.010> when<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.340> was<00:00:59.550> young

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.789

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
civil war because everything would be so

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.690 
civil war because everything would be so

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
different that you couldn't ignore it

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.640 
different that you couldn't ignore it
you<00:03:33.180> wouldn't<00:03:33.330> be<00:03:33.420> running<00:03:33.540> around<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:34.019> 2015

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
you wouldn't be running around in 2015

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.580 
you wouldn't be running around in 2015
and<00:03:34.799> ignoring<00:03:35.310> right<00:03:35.670> that<00:03:35.940> war<00:03:36.269> so<00:03:36.870> 1989

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
and ignoring right that war so 1989

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.020 
and ignoring right that war so 1989
seems<00:03:37.950> like<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.430> really<00:03:39.060> good<00:03:39.570> time<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:41.030> that's

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
seems like a really good time and that's

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.060 
seems like a really good time and that's
what<00:03:42.269> it<00:03:42.360> is<00:03:42.390> it's<00:03:42.660> ultimately<00:03:43.230> a<00:03:43.410> story<00:03:43.920> of

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
what it is it's ultimately a story of

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.610 
what it is it's ultimately a story of
reconciliation<00:03:45.019> which<00:03:46.019> is<00:03:46.140> I<00:03:46.260> think<00:03:46.290> what

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
reconciliation which is I think what

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.520 
reconciliation which is I think what
