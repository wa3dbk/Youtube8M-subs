00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.029
 that in cooperation of unity games and 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.960
 the developer studio black tower studios 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.669
 axel is for four euros 49 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.680

 an android version will be available shortly 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.279
 consequences 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.040
 In the world of the game, evil mucks 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.900
 just powerful against the sky 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.970
 archangel you send now to the 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.510
 enemies of the customer back to hell 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.070
 send 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.770
 you move to achieve that 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.730
 level by level forward the screen 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.070
 will happen to you from one 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.920
 Isometric bird's eye view 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.500
 you move through simple tap gestures 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.180
 You say you just type in the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.700
 put where he wanted to go 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.949
 the levels are very linear with 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.530
 exceptions from a few branches 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.270
 who in it a few enemies or 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.760
 secrets find a enemy you can 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.950
 attack by simply tapping or 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.729
 angel then shoots a fireball 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.080
 the opponent 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.240
 Do you keep your finger on the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.710
 screen is pressed for a while 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.110
 your shot to a mighty 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.090
 Fireball on and you can several 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.090
 turn off the opponent at the same time 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.860
 In the gameplay , he always learned 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.110
 add more gestures with those you then 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.000
 The opponents can attack with one 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.920
 Swipe gesture you can do a stream attack 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.350
 Perform and an opponent easy 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.840
 over the heap race he draws a r 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.630
 on the screen, there are meteorites hailing 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.490
 and a v provides for hosted opponents 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.590
 draw a circle around her 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.270
 opponents stand up again and 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.310
 fight for a while at your side 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.320
 the different attacks are 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.789
 varied and one of the 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.789
 highlight of the game 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.160
 Defeated enemies not only bring you 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.410
 coins but also fill a part 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.180
 your health on health in 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.640
 Game represents the power of yours 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.860
 Archangels the more power your angel has 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.569
 the more money the enemies bring you 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.610
 The earned money can you then 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.680
 between the levels in a shop against 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.640
 new equipment for your archangel 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.650
 invest 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.870
 so here you can armor armor 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.590
 shields and amulets for your archangel 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.090
 purchase 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.790
 with luck you will find new ones 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.440
 equipment but also in the levels one 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.090
 funny idea is that they are all yours 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.099
 received equipment after one 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.260
 successfully completed level in 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.700
 can jeopardize play a bet 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.459
 graduated to the next level 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.660
 also successfully you get 25 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.579
 percent more 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.040
 when selling the duplicate 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.380
 but you can also do things 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:59.319
 lose everything if you are not level 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:01.299
 successfully ended my conclusion if one 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.799
 play already by unity itself 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.590
 then it is possible to publish 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.750
 First of all, in any case 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.700
 spectacular graphics await angel 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.500
 makes no exception here 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.600
 the look of the game can be completely 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.549
 convince and shine with a beautiful 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.920
 design a great presented setting 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.840
 and lighting effects also send the 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.100
 various attacks of the arc angel 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.170
 can convince 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.880
 Unfortunately it was my opinion 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.319
 Almost with the highlights of the 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.730
 play because for one thing is the 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.260
 presentation of the game pretty much 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.970
 boring advised 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.100
 The story is only simple 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.620
 text boxes and unspectacular 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.359
 Zwischensequenzen presents a big one 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.760
 Unfortunately the game is also the one of the game 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.380
 In principle, I welcome it 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.480
 although if you try the control 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.519
 to optimize for touchscreens 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.380
 in this case you are over 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.970
 the target shot out 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.650
 by constantly tapping on the 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.569
 screen to run and aim 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.000
 you always hide with his 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.680
 hand the view comes that also the 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.780
 different gestures do not always do so 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.790
 reliably performed as desired 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.950
 be and you ever in the opponent 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.680
 into it runs though one actually one 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.959
 also wanted to throw the fireball 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.400
 sound can not convince all around 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.739
 in principle , the music is indeed 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.030
 atmospheric but unfortunately it is missing too 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.250
 something the dynamics 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.320
 All in all, I have arques 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.810
 Angel promised much more 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.300
 the graphics are the fun of playing remains 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.340
 unfortunately clearly on the route nevertheless 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.260
 I'm looking forward to more unity titles 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.820
 then hopefully playful too 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.830
 put a shovel on it 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:35.070
 that was my thanks for watching 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.070
 and until the next video fabian
