00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.050 
think about it but a stick shift version
automatic<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:16.890> which<00:00:16.980> one<00:00:17.130> is<00:00:17.220> better<00:00:17.369> for<00:00:17.640> me

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
automatic and which one is better for me

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.760 
automatic and which one is better for me
personally<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.570> enjoyed<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.110> diction<00:00:19.470> alive

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
on the streets so with in traffic you're

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.140 
on the streets so with in traffic you're
going<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.890> be<00:00:29.010> using<00:00:29.369> your<00:00:29.610> clutch<00:00:29.850> all<00:00:30.090> the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
going to be using your clutch all the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.700 
going to be using your clutch all the
time<00:00:30.570> your<00:00:30.720> left<00:00:30.869> foots<00:00:31.110> going<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.289> be<00:00:31.350> in<00:00:31.560> and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
time your left foots going to be in and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.200 
time your left foots going to be in and
out<00:00:31.800> your<00:00:32.520> right<00:00:32.640> hands<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.090> be

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
touching the shifter all the time so it

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.340 
touching the shifter all the time so it
really<00:00:35.579> comes<00:00:35.850> down<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.300> how<00:00:36.750> often<00:00:37.020> do<00:00:37.290> you

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
really comes down to how often do you

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.389 
really comes down to how often do you
want<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.560> play<00:00:37.710> with<00:00:37.800> your<00:00:37.950> car

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.950 

now<00:00:41.910> if<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.210> guys<00:00:42.329> are<00:00:42.510> thinking<00:00:42.660> about

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
now if you guys are thinking about

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.479 
now if you guys are thinking about
racing<00:00:43.559> if<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.860> guys<00:00:43.920> are<00:00:44.100> wondering<00:00:44.340> of

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
racing if you guys are wondering of

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.950 
racing if you guys are wondering of
racing<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:44.969> better<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.420> stick<00:00:45.660> sure<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.870> an

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
racing is better in a stick sure of an

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.470 
racing is better in a stick sure of an
automatic<00:00:46.350> honestly<00:00:47.340> an<00:00:47.460> automatic<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> lot

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
automatic honestly an automatic is a lot

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.330 
automatic honestly an automatic is a lot
better<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:48.809> racing<00:00:49.350> especially<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.250> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
better for racing especially in a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.060 
better for racing especially in a
straight<00:00:50.610> line<00:00:50.640> why<00:00:51.540> because<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.530> computer

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
straight line why because the computer

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.100 
straight line why because the computer
says<00:00:53.309> for<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.940> eliminate<00:00:54.480> all<00:00:54.690> human

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
says for you you eliminate all human

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.770 
says for you you eliminate all human
error<00:00:55.350> when<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.620> comes<00:00:55.769> to<00:00:55.949> racing

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.780 

now<00:00:59.320> you're<00:00:59.470> wondering<00:00:59.830> how<00:00:59.950> about<00:01:00.130> autocross

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
now you're wondering how about autocross

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.390 
now you're wondering how about autocross
things<00:01:01.720> like<00:01:01.960> canyons<00:01:02.470> and<00:01:02.650> stuff<00:01:02.860> so

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
things like canyons and stuff so

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.040 
things like canyons and stuff so
obviously<00:01:04.120> a<00:01:04.150> stick<00:01:04.480> shift<00:01:04.600> allows<00:01:04.900> you

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
obviously a stick shift allows you

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.050 
obviously a stick shift allows you
better<00:01:05.230> control<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.740> RPMs<00:01:06.220> but<00:01:06.640> with<00:01:06.910> new

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
better control the RPMs but with new

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.240 
better control the RPMs but with new
technology<00:01:07.630> these<00:01:07.810> days<00:01:08.080> and<00:01:08.590> automatically

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
technology these days and automatically

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.670 
technology these days and automatically
just<00:01:09.760> as<00:01:09.880> better<00:01:10.090> or<00:01:10.840> just<00:01:11.050> as<00:01:11.170> good<00:01:11.350> just<00:01:11.410> like

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
just as better or just as good just like

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.840 
just as better or just as good just like
a<00:01:11.770> paddle<00:01:12.130> shifter

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
a paddle shifter

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.700 
a paddle shifter
but<00:01:14.420> let's<00:01:14.600> be<00:01:14.750> honest<00:01:15.049> a<00:01:15.110> lot<00:01:15.229> of<00:01:15.290> us<00:01:15.470> are<00:01:15.590> not

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
but let's be honest a lot of us are not

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.230 
but let's be honest a lot of us are not
racers<00:01:16.159> and<00:01:16.369> we're<00:01:16.460> just<00:01:16.580> driving<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.030> car

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
racers and we're just driving the car

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.870 
racers and we're just driving the car
from<00:01:17.540> work<00:01:17.750> to<00:01:18.080> work<00:01:18.350> to<00:01:18.680> home<00:01:18.920> round<00:01:19.580> and

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
from work to work to home round and

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.760 
from work to work to home round and
going<00:01:20.330> to<00:01:20.450> car<00:01:20.600> meets<00:01:20.810> so<00:01:21.350> which<00:01:21.530> one<00:01:21.740> is

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
going to car meets so which one is

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.499 
going to car meets so which one is
better<00:01:21.890> all<00:01:22.430> personal<00:01:22.970> preference

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
me personally I had an automatic for a

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.550 
me personally I had an automatic for a
while<00:01:26.090> and<00:01:26.270> then<00:01:26.450> out<00:01:26.810> of<00:01:26.869> stiction<00:01:27.259> if<00:01:27.440> my

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
while and then out of stiction if my

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.170 
while and then out of stiction if my
first<00:01:27.799> car<00:01:28.009> was<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.250> stick<00:01:28.460> shift<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:28.790> it

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
first car was the stick shift and it

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.210 
first car was the stick shift and it
still<00:01:29.360> comes<00:01:29.509> down<00:01:29.659> to<00:01:30.020> I<00:01:30.259> enjoy<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.009> stick

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
still comes down to I enjoy the stick

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.830 
still comes down to I enjoy the stick
shift<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.490> lot<00:01:31.640> better<00:01:31.850> because<00:01:32.299> I<00:01:32.479> like<00:01:32.720> to

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
shift a lot better because I like to

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.450 
shift a lot better because I like to
interact<00:01:33.170> with<00:01:33.259> my<00:01:33.440> car<00:01:33.680> but<00:01:34.130> that's<00:01:34.280> what<00:01:34.430> I

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
interact with my car but that's what I
