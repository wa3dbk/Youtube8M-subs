00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:13.085
Pirata...

00:00:13.606 --> 00:00:15.705
everyone was criticizing
the movie you brought,

00:00:15.706 --> 00:00:17.485
and I stood for you!

00:00:17.647 --> 00:00:19.729
It was a nice movie, but...

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.533
it didn't make any sense,

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:24.152
it was messed up.

00:00:24.153 --> 00:00:25.253
They don't...

00:00:26.153 --> 00:00:28.098
It's a good movie
to watch and sleep!

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:30.634
It was great then!

00:00:30.635 --> 00:00:31.728
Let me tell you something...

00:00:32.614 --> 00:00:35.186
nobody managed to watch it
until the end!

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.960
He's filming us!

00:00:54.746 --> 00:00:56.732
It's over!

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.338
- He's filming us!
- Come on, Piratinha!

00:01:11.035 --> 00:01:12.552
Country music moment!

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:37.163
The training session
was quite demanding today.

00:02:37.293 --> 00:02:38.939
This is our Lahm!

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.422
This is Negretti!

00:02:51.758 --> 00:02:53.382
What do you think
about their training?

00:02:53.383 --> 00:02:54.780
It's nice, I like it.

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.096
It's creative,
they're working at the same time,

00:02:58.097 --> 00:02:59.028
it's very nice.

00:03:01.066 --> 00:03:02.832
Caboba came up with that!

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:05.120
One of them is defending
and the other one suffering the goal.

00:03:05.121 --> 00:03:06.597
They both are defending!

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:11.131
Come on,
let's go!

00:03:11.344 --> 00:03:12.164
Go!

00:03:12.165 --> 00:03:14.344
One!
Good job!

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:15.402
Come on!

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:17.984
Let's go!
That's right!

00:03:18.091 --> 00:03:19.828
Come on, Aranha!

00:03:20.003 --> 00:03:22.053
That's it!

00:03:22.073 --> 00:03:23.984
Come on,
score the goal!

00:03:24.227 --> 00:03:25.593
Come on...yes!

00:03:27.501 --> 00:03:29.524
Good job!

00:03:32.498 --> 00:03:35.491
That goal was worth five points!

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.996
Hey, tell us a little bit
about that competition.

00:03:39.146 --> 00:03:40.796
Vladmir lost!

00:03:40.797 --> 00:03:42.457
- Did he?
- Yes, he did.

00:03:42.458 --> 00:03:43.185
What's the score?

00:03:43.186 --> 00:03:45.836
Aranha's rebounds were
almost like kicks!

00:03:47.006 --> 00:03:49.085
Aranha, are you scoring
using your hands?

00:03:51.448 --> 00:03:53.135
Using my hands,
using my feet...

00:03:53.611 --> 00:03:54.935
playing video games.

00:03:57.525 --> 00:04:00.200
Not playing video games!

00:04:01.114 --> 00:04:02.443
He has completely lost control.

00:04:02.674 --> 00:04:04.189
He's just like those guys
who suffer from gambling addiction,

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.332
the more he loses,
the more he plays.

00:04:07.672 --> 00:04:09.925
- Is that true?
- He almost had to give me a car!

00:04:11.778 --> 00:04:13.692
But I'd never accept it.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.644
Come on, guys,
let's go!

00:04:18.726 --> 00:04:22.415
One, two, three,
four, five,

00:04:22.588 --> 00:04:26.459
six, seven, eight,
nine, teen...

00:04:26.645 --> 00:04:28.005
One, two...
