 easily everything you want then 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.900
 already you take a shotgun 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:30.269
 if you smash domec 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:32.610
 if you can if you have if you 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.000

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:39.540
 perfect if you take van you are 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.170
 you went to father police so I 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.480
 advise you to go to the beach or 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.420
 will see I will show you 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:51.719
 you go to the beach then you have 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.170
 here here and there you fall there but he 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.430
 do not turn this fake bond what's that ok 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.559
 wattu marc is really late time 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:05.040
 yeah so the van if you do not know 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.490
 well in there 9002 you are he must 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.549
 to be about the same as an elixir 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.689
 daily star i 'm sorry sorry and according to 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.909
 what I used to play to whom 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.509
 save when we make small videos 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.220
 also on 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.860
 so there are nine migra of xp also I 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.520
 believe if my memories are good 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.060
 so there is 9 me of everything and basically 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.620
 there I am looking for a small exit 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:37.020
 nice bobbin 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.460
 I think I will not come because 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.970
 there I left a little bit below 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:49.050
 mouth because tameka look at our 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.300
 courses and shit we could 6 4 must 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:59.610
 go to pump 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:02:02.700
 uncle for 600 threats is supposed to be 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.110
 a fake armored in one that wants 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.750
 to say that they resist almost all 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.530
 and there they put a ring on there 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:17.730
 more happiness is normal happiness 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:20.120
 during tires it looks like guard rush 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.120
 total 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.200
 typhi days is asked what is it 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.580
 yeah so I also think that we're going 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.230
 do you a little video presentation 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.690
 of all skate parks 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.260
 our opinion on that at half an hour skate 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.080
 park and you will be asked for your 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.709
 the comments go like in the 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:54.180
 price so now have you given 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:56.010
 your oven good here there you see you 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.290
 put near town it's already done 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.610
 then you go quickly fast 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.780
 it was not expected to be like that 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.200
 because they normally follow you 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.630
 no trace then you have in 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.980
 underneath there you have you have not 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.570
 too far because otherwise the van 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.220
 can disappear then has it 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.560
 and now I really advise you 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.850
 to have your brought to max there you 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.320
 put a big heart like that 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.830
 wait he miraculously must 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.840
 always that you have the van on 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:33.180
 seeing on the mini map 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:38.160
 so here's ah yes you do not have the outfit 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:45.090
 up had to forget about it 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:47.190
 what you see I'm going there but I 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.930
 am sowing them and the strong one 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.030
 is always there so they times they 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.980
 are going to be those but now 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.230
 that they are the ones but I can go back to 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.510
 the surface 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.630
 and here it is I will wait for them 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.890
 leave a little to be quiet 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.190
 then I will show you or shoot 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.290
 to make in fewer balls possible 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.450
 or even bare hands expect them 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.769
 really speak and always have a 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.390
 small car that stays at all times 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:18.160
 if not 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:22.280

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:25.100
