have a level 34 light I know a lot of
you<00:00:44.750> guys<00:00:44.810> have<00:00:44.960> been<00:00:45.170> asking<00:00:45.380> laser<00:00:46.100> you<00:00:46.430> know

you guys have been asking laser you know
34<00:00:47.150> light<00:00:47.300> was<00:00:47.450> that<00:00:47.630> something<00:00:47.810> you

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
34 light was that something you

34 light was that something you
basically<00:00:48.860> 34<00:00:49.430> is<00:00:49.610> 365<00:00:50.210> so<00:00:50.720> it's<00:00:50.840> pretty<00:00:50.960> much

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
basically 34 is 365 so it's pretty much

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.780 
basically 34 is 365 so it's pretty much
similar<00:00:51.410> to<00:00:51.590> what<00:00:51.860> we<00:00:51.980> have<00:00:52.130> now<00:00:52.280> rate<00:00:52.520> of<00:00:52.640> fire

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
similar to what we have now rate of fire

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.200 
similar to what we have now rate of fire
for<00:00:53.000> a<00:00:53.030> shoddy<00:00:53.270> not<00:00:53.960> bad<00:00:54.170> impact<00:00:54.770> not<00:00:55.190> bad<00:00:55.430> at

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
for a shoddy not bad impact not bad at

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.560 
for a shoddy not bad impact not bad at
all<00:00:56.829> range<00:00:57.829> it's<00:00:58.220> a<00:00:58.430> little<00:00:58.820> bit<00:00:58.970> low<00:00:59.239> but<00:00:59.270> I

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
all range it's a little bit low but I

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.770 
all range it's a little bit low but I
seem<00:00:59.930> lower<00:01:00.200> I<00:01:00.470> mean<00:01:00.920> for<00:01:01.220> a<00:01:01.250> shotgun<00:01:01.970> it's<00:01:02.239> not

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
seem lower I mean for a shotgun it's not

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.749 
seem lower I mean for a shotgun it's not
that<00:01:02.840> bad<00:01:03.230> stability<00:01:03.950> we<00:01:04.369> have<00:01:04.489> a<00:01:04.519> high

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
that bad stability we have a high

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.020 
that bad stability we have a high
stability<00:01:05.059> actually<00:01:05.689> for<00:01:05.960> a<00:01:05.990> shoddy<00:01:06.469> and

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
stability actually for a shoddy and

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
reload is not as bad as well the only

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.929 
reload is not as bad as well the only
thing<00:01:09.859> that<00:01:10.009> could<00:01:10.189> be<00:01:10.310> quite<00:01:10.460> as<00:01:10.819> the

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
top and it says hacky up there so we

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.269 
top and it says hacky up there so we
have<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:35.029> first<00:01:35.209> one<00:01:35.420> which<00:01:35.569> is<00:01:35.810> a<00:01:36.200> let<00:01:37.039> me<00:01:37.130> see

00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:37.279 
have the first one which is a let me see

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
have the first one which is a let me see
if<00:01:37.340> I<00:01:37.429> could<00:01:37.490> get<00:01:37.759> that's<00:01:37.939> what<00:01:38.060> we<00:01:38.149> had<00:01:38.270> a

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
if I could get that's what we had a

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:39.929 
if I could get that's what we had a
linear<00:01:38.630> compensation<00:01:39.319> more<00:01:39.469> precision

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
linear compensation more precision

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.069 
linear compensation more precision
predictable<00:01:40.939> recoil<00:01:41.389> slightly<00:01:41.840> boost

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
predictable recoil slightly boost

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.379 
predictable recoil slightly boost
arrange<00:01:42.469> and<00:01:42.679> impact<00:01:42.979> more<00:01:43.189> retail<00:01:43.609> so<00:01:43.819> as<00:01:44.029> you

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:44.389 
arrange and impact more retail so as you

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:45.730 
arrange and impact more retail so as you
see<00:01:44.509> right<00:01:44.539> there<00:01:44.779> we<00:01:44.899> gained<00:01:45.109> a<00:01:45.139> little<00:01:45.590> bit

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
see right there we gained a little bit

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.769 
see right there we gained a little bit
of<00:01:45.829> impact<00:01:46.219> giving<00:01:47.149> a<00:01:47.179> little<00:01:47.450> bit<00:01:47.539> of<00:01:47.630> range

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:47.779 
of impact giving a little bit of range

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:50.139 
of impact giving a little bit of range
but<00:01:48.020> loose<00:01:48.229> or<00:01:48.469> stability<00:01:48.679> within<00:01:49.219> a<00:01:49.490> shotgun

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
but loose or stability within a shotgun

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.879 
but loose or stability within a shotgun
stability<00:01:50.810> is<00:01:50.840> not<00:01:51.109> that<00:01:51.349> important<00:01:51.770> my

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:51.889 
stability is not that important my

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:55.029 
stability is not that important my
personal<00:01:52.310> point<00:01:52.429> of<00:01:52.549> view<00:01:52.609> but<00:01:53.740> if<00:01:54.740> you<00:01:54.859> like

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
personal point of view but if you like

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.289 
personal point of view but if you like
the<00:01:55.219> stability<00:01:55.639> you<00:01:55.700> could<00:01:55.849> always<00:01:55.969> go<00:01:56.209> with

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
the stability you could always go with

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.109 
the stability you could always go with
the<00:01:56.479> cqb<00:01:57.259> ballistics<00:01:57.859> greatly<00:01:58.549> reduces<00:01:58.999> the

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
the cqb ballistics greatly reduces the

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.510 
the cqb ballistics greatly reduces the
recoil<00:01:59.380> significant<00:02:00.380> penalized<00:02:00.799> on<00:02:00.950> range<00:02:01.279> so

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
recoil significant penalized on range so

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.830 
recoil significant penalized on range so
you'll<00:02:01.669> see<00:02:01.819> the<00:02:01.939> big<00:02:02.090> it's<00:02:02.299> not<00:02:02.450> that<00:02:02.630> big<00:02:02.779> of

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
you'll see the big it's not that big of

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.870 
you'll see the big it's not that big of
a<00:02:02.990> difference<00:02:03.139> in<00:02:03.469> range<00:02:03.679> but<00:02:04.249> range<00:02:04.549> does

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
a difference in range but range does

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.550 
a difference in range but range does
matter<00:02:05.119> with<00:02:05.389> a<00:02:05.419> shotty<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:06.229> I<00:02:06.259> would<00:02:06.409> probably

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
matter with a shotty so I would probably

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.050 
matter with a shotty so I would probably
go<00:02:06.829> with<00:02:06.859> the<00:02:07.069> other<00:02:07.219> one<00:02:07.399> but<00:02:07.549> i'll<00:02:07.849> have<00:02:08.030> that

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
go with the other one but i'll have that

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.270 
go with the other one but i'll have that
in<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.479> weapon<00:02:08.840> review<00:02:08.989> once<00:02:09.319> we're<00:02:09.890> able<00:02:10.099> to

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
in the weapon review once we're able to

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.740 
in the weapon review once we're able to
kind<00:02:10.489> of<00:02:10.579> need<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.759> co<00:02:10.970> ahead<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.390> test<00:02:11.599> these

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
kind of need a co ahead and test these

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.030 
kind of need a co ahead and test these
guns<00:02:12.019> to<00:02:12.709> its<00:02:12.920> fullest<00:02:13.280> potential

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
guns to its fullest potential

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.920 
guns to its fullest potential
we<00:02:14.219> have<00:02:14.340> last<00:02:14.640> we<00:02:14.879> sort<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.180> weapon<00:02:15.629> handle

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
we have last we sort this weapon handle

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.050 
we have last we sort this weapon handle
handles<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:16.950> reloads<00:02:17.250> faster<00:02:17.730> when<00:02:18.030> the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
handles and reloads faster when the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.750 
handles and reloads faster when the
wielder<00:02:18.629> is<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.049> last<00:02:19.290> living<00:02:19.590> player<00:02:19.980> on<00:02:20.219> the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
wielder is the last living player on the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.390 
wielder is the last living player on the
fire<00:02:21.000> team<00:02:21.269> so<00:02:21.510> last<00:02:22.140> we<00:02:22.290> sort<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.799> believe<00:02:22.829> as<00:02:23.370> a

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
fire team so last we sort I believe as a

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.270 
fire team so last we sort I believe as a
new<00:02:23.640> perk<00:02:23.909> and<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:25.349> basically<00:02:25.620> what<00:02:26.129> it<00:02:26.159> does

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
new perk and it basically what it does

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.959 
new perk and it basically what it does
is<00:02:26.730> give<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.629> faster<00:02:28.049> reload<00:02:28.549> when<00:02:29.549> you're

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969 
is give you faster reload when you're

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.580 
is give you faster reload when you're
pretty<00:02:30.329> much<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.659> last<00:02:30.689> person<00:02:31.230> on<00:02:31.290> your<00:02:31.409> fire

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
pretty much the last person on your fire

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.250 
pretty much the last person on your fire
team<00:02:31.769> so<00:02:31.920> let's<00:02:32.099> say<00:02:32.189> you<00:02:32.220> guys<00:02:32.400> are<00:02:32.640> playing

team so let's say you guys are playing

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.140 
team so let's say you guys are playing
you<00:02:34.260> know<00:02:34.379> pretty<00:02:35.220> much<00:02:35.280> what<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.760> know<00:02:35.909> where

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
you know pretty much what you know where

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.479 
you know pretty much what you know where
you<00:02:36.390> usually<00:02:36.629> go<00:02:37.140> down<00:02:37.379> a<00:02:37.409> lot<00:02:37.709> quite<00:02:38.069> often<00:02:38.250> in

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
you usually go down a lot quite often in

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.550 
you usually go down a lot quite often in
trials<00:02:38.939> so<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.599> go<00:02:39.810> down<00:02:40.049> and<00:02:40.079> you're<00:02:40.439> the

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
trials so you go down and you're the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.660 
trials so you go down and you're the
last<00:02:40.739> one<00:02:40.980> right<00:02:41.129> there<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.400> it's<00:02:41.489> kind<00:02:41.609> of

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
like a to be one this or this is going

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.929 
like a to be one this or this is going
to<00:02:43.590> become<00:02:43.680> affected<00:02:44.189> because<00:02:44.310> you're<00:02:44.849> gonna

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:44.939 
to become affected because you're gonna

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:46.879 
to become affected because you're gonna
be<00:02:45.090> able<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.329> reload<00:02:45.599> that<00:02:45.629> quicker<00:02:46.019> and<00:02:46.319> kill

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
be able to reload that quicker and kill

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.349 
be able to reload that quicker and kill
one<00:02:47.129> and<00:02:47.159> then<00:02:47.430> reload<00:02:47.730> real<00:02:47.879> fast<00:02:48.090> if<00:02:48.239> you

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
one and then reload real fast if you

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:50.750 
one and then reload real fast if you
guys<00:02:48.480> are<00:02:48.599> running<00:02:48.689> out<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:48.959> ammo<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.560> do<00:02:50.549> keep

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
guys are running out of ammo so do keep

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.059 
guys are running out of ammo so do keep
that<00:02:50.970> in<00:02:51.180> mind<00:02:51.420> then<00:02:52.079> after<00:02:52.319> that<00:02:52.439> we<00:02:52.650> have<00:02:52.919> the

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
that in mind then after that we have the

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.670 
that in mind then after that we have the
following<00:02:53.370> which<00:02:53.849> is<00:02:54.090> awareness<00:02:54.629> kills<00:02:55.530> with

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
following which is awareness kills with

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.649 
following which is awareness kills with

short<00:03:06.840> time<00:03:07.049> so<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.680> don't<00:03:08.370> know<00:03:08.579> how<00:03:09.450> effective

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
short time so I don't know how effective

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.170 
short time so I don't know how effective
this<00:03:10.169> is<00:03:10.349> because<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.709> didn't<00:03:11.220> see<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.790> know<00:03:11.939> I

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
this is because I didn't see you know I

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.729 
this is because I didn't see you know I
didn't<00:03:12.480> see<00:03:12.569> it<00:03:12.689> in<00:03:12.810> my<00:03:12.930> mini<00:03:13.139> map<00:03:13.349> because<00:03:13.590> i

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
didn't see it in my mini map because i

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.440 
didn't see it in my mini map because i
did<00:03:13.919> use<00:03:14.069> this<00:03:14.220> gun<00:03:14.430> for<00:03:14.730> in<00:03:15.000> quite<00:03:15.299> a<00:03:15.329> while

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
did use this gun for in quite a while

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.500 
did use this gun for in quite a while
really<00:03:16.379> really<00:03:16.530> affected<00:03:17.189> gun<00:03:17.400> I'll<00:03:18.239> have

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
really really affected gun I'll have

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.649 
really really affected gun I'll have
some<00:03:18.720> gameplay<00:03:19.139> of<00:03:19.169> it<00:03:19.500> shortly<00:03:20.310> but<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:21.269> did

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 
some gameplay of it shortly but I did

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.680 
some gameplay of it shortly but I did
like<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.989> way<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:22.260> gun<00:03:22.409> performed<00:03:22.949> um<00:03:23.629> but<00:03:24.629> I

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
like the way the gun performed um but I

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
mat so really interesting Park awareness

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.780 
mat so really interesting Park awareness
so<00:03:37.260> next<00:03:37.769> we<00:03:37.949> have<00:03:38.069> lightweight<00:03:38.310> you<00:03:38.639> guys

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
so next we have lightweight you guys

so next we have lightweight you guys
pretty<00:03:38.940> much<00:03:39.060> know<00:03:39.329> what<00:03:39.419> that<00:03:39.599> is<00:03:39.629> gives<00:03:39.959> you

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
pretty much know what that is gives you

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.349 
pretty much know what that is gives you
agility<00:03:40.470> you<00:03:40.949> lose<00:03:41.159> the<00:03:41.280> stability<00:03:41.790> then<00:03:42.239> we

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
agility you lose the stability then we

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.719 
agility you lose the stability then we
got<00:03:42.510> fitted<00:03:42.780> stock<00:03:43.199> and<00:03:43.470> last<00:03:44.430> part<00:03:44.790> we<00:03:45.000> have

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:46.729 
got fitted stock and last part we have

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:51.080 
got fitted stock and last part we have
its<00:03:47.729> oiled<00:03:48.419> frame<00:03:49.139> so<00:03:49.889> fast<00:03:50.190> reload<00:03:50.519> reduces

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
its oiled frame so fast reload reduces

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.149 
its oiled frame so fast reload reduces
rain<00:03:51.299> reduces<00:03:52.139> range<00:03:52.349> so<00:03:52.530> basically<00:03:52.949> you<00:03:53.040> see

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
rain reduces range so basically you see

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.740 
rain reduces range so basically you see
the<00:03:53.280> reader<00:03:53.489> kind<00:03:53.819> of<00:03:53.879> kicks<00:03:54.120> up<00:03:54.269> all<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.659> way

brute all the way you know dramatically

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.059 
brute all the way you know dramatically
