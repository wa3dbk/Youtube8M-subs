00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
instead of ones because one basically

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.899 
instead of ones because one basically
isn't<00:01:40.460> strong<00:01:40.820> enough<00:01:40.960> so<00:01:41.960> yeah<00:01:42.670> this<00:01:43.670> is<00:01:43.729> how

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
isn't strong enough so yeah this is how
