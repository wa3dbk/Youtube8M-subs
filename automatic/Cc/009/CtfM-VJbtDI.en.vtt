00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.170
 well, good guys, welcome to my channel 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.520
 once again today we are going to make a 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.039
 classic makeup let's give a 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.779
 eyeliner on the intense lips in this 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.730
 occasion the eyeliner is going to be longer and 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.189
 normal width because we have put 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.900
 a set of lashes pretty intense and if 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.029
 not so we would lose the eyeliner yes that 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.650
 has is a little bit bigger and like 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.420
 center of attention a few lips in this 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.890
 dark case you want to know how we do 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.170
 this makeup and the tricks that you 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.120
 I have prepared to create lips 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:44.850
 dark perfect to stay watching the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.340
 video for this makeup let's do 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.590
 very natural eyes because what 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.390
 we want is the attention on the lips 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.730
 simply prepare the eyelid pointed 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.590
 with a beige shade and mark it the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.860
 banana with a little brown shadow 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.860
 mate 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.550
 Y 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.060
 yes 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.590
 also apply this brown shadow 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.820
 making a slight triangle in the part 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.770
 external and on the bottom line of 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.450
 lashes and then blur the masters well 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.450
 cut with beige front shade 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.130
 vale vale vale vale and are 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.869
 prepared for our eyeliner we are going to 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.399
 start as always downloading 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.920
 product in the central area of the eyeliner 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.569
 and then we'll go to the inner area 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.460
 then the exterior in this case we are going to 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.770
 create a rather longer eyeliner 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.299
 normal because with the set of tabs 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.520
 pretty intense let's put on top 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.819
 we can lose up to almost half of the 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.819
 eyeliner 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.670
 do not 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.890
 I never want to miss the opportunity 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.350
 to say that eyebrows is a very 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.660
 important to enclose and fit well 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.860
 an eye makeup so even if it's 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.860
 slightly retouched 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.920
 if you do not feel like it or do not like to carry 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.660
 false eyelashes you can apply 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.220
 these individual in small groups or 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.220
 simply several layers of mask 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.360
 usually always fourth when I'm 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.250
 Video editing the time it takes to 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.470
 apply the base but I remind you that 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.870
 you have to dedicate several minutes to 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:45.180
 get a much more integrated finish 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.180
 and natural when we apply the base 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.540
 yes 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.220
 if we opt for a concealer one more tone 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.080
 clear of our natural skin tone what 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.940
 we're going to get is while 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.940
 correct we will provide luminosity 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.370
 one day 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.370
 i 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.060
 after sealing the base with powders 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.890
 translucent compact as you prefer 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.260
 let's outline the line slightly 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.030
 of the jaw below the cheekbones and 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.519
 a little on the temple then we will apply 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.819
 on top of this I outline a touch of 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.819
 colors 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.580
 let's go for the interesting part the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.470
 lips the dark lips are pretty 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.349
 difficult to carry because they have to 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.060
 be perfectly made a way to 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.680
 adapt to take these serious 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.300
 dark is to continue progressing in the 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.599
 Color intensity starts with a few 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.940
 shades pretty much be much lighter and 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.830
 with less coverage and it goes up until 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.590
 get to the most mate that are the most 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.780
 opaque the most covering delineates all 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.060
 the lips with a pencil to fix 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.550
 our shape of the lips stuffed with 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.920
 lipstick and then we're going to touch up the part 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.380
 external with a concealer so that it is 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.299
 much more professional little by little with 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.290
 the intensity of the color until getting 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.290
 the most intense 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.200
 yes of lines only the external part 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:19.630
 of the lips and fillings with lipstick 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.940
 you'll have a lighter finish if you 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.130
 lines and also stuffed the lips and 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.730
 then you apply in the real one it will be denser 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.590
 and more or more durability touch up the part 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.770
 external of the lips with the pencil and 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.770
 is 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.570
 good guys I hope you liked it 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.180
 that lorre you believe as you have seen is a 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.520
 very simple makeup with a lot of touch 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.580
 of glamor and how good is intense but 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.470
 with a little moderation so if I 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.300
 recreate and you know what you behave 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.580
