practical<00:00:00.599> example<00:00:01.110> is<00:00:01.290> going<00:00:01.530> to<00:00:01.680> be<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:02.659> dog

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.480 

so<00:00:11.519> we<00:00:11.670> start<00:00:11.940> with<00:00:12.030> our<00:00:12.090> dog<00:00:12.450> our<00:00:13.490> dog

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
so we start with our dog our dog

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:35.530 
so we start with our dog our dog
geometry

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:58.660 

get<00:00:36.140> a<00:00:36.170> decent<00:00:37.100> view<00:00:37.309> of<00:00:37.430> it<00:00:37.579> here

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:07.560 

okay

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:22.410 

grow<00:01:08.200> some<00:01:08.470> hair<00:01:08.530> on<00:01:08.890> it

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.030 

it<00:01:22.900> turned<00:01:23.229> down<00:01:23.409> phrase<00:01:23.830> a<00:01:23.860> little<00:01:24.220> here<00:01:26.040> just

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
it turned down phrase a little here just

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.649 
it turned down phrase a little here just
so<00:01:27.159> you<00:01:27.280> can<00:01:27.490> see<00:01:27.729> that<00:01:27.909> things<00:01:28.150> are<00:01:28.330> straight

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
so you can see that things are straight

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:43.490 
so you can see that things are straight

a<00:01:57.000> lot<00:01:57.150> more<00:01:57.390> useful<00:01:57.570> now<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.170> they're

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
a lot more useful now that they're

to<00:02:11.630> interpenetration<00:02:12.630> here<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.230> tend<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.800> not

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
to interpenetration here I tend to not

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.990 
to interpenetration here I tend to not
use<00:02:15.590> collision<00:02:16.590> when<00:02:16.800> combing<00:02:17.280> very<00:02:17.550> often

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
use collision when combing very often

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.850 
use collision when combing very often
unless<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.480> really<00:02:18.750> need<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.110> is<00:02:19.350> particularly

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
unless I really need to is particularly

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.540 
unless I really need to is particularly
for<00:02:20.190> fur<00:02:20.720> reason<00:02:21.720> being<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.380> we<00:02:22.500> have<00:02:22.740> the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
for fur reason being is that we have the

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.120 
for fur reason being is that we have the
Rico<00:02:24.330> button<00:02:24.780> which<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.380> what<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.590> just<00:02:25.860> pressed

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
Rico button which is what I just pressed

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.620 
Rico button which is what I just pressed
here<00:02:26.460> that<00:02:27.300> pops<00:02:28.020> pops<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.770> hair<00:02:28.980> out<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:30.330> a

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
here that pops pops the hair out to to a

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.850 
here that pops pops the hair out to to a
pretty<00:02:31.170> good<00:02:31.380> tangent<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:33.860> skins

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
pretty good tangent of the skins

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.060 
pretty good tangent of the skins
orientation<00:02:38.810> so<00:02:39.810> now<00:02:40.200> I'm<00:02:40.380> still<00:02:40.680> using<00:02:40.830> the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
orientation so now I'm still using the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.150 
orientation so now I'm still using the
translate<00:02:41.610> brush<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.560> puff<00:02:43.560> some<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:43.980> hair

a stand on end brush which really just

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.350

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.540 

can<00:03:16.020> you<00:03:16.140> scale<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> little<00:03:16.800> more<00:03:17.130> because<00:03:17.280> he's

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
can you scale a little more because he's

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.950 
can you scale a little more because he's
getting<00:03:18.030> a<00:03:18.090> little<00:03:18.210> bushy<00:03:18.600> in<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.960> middle

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.780 
that's what I use the comb in the Ricoh
mand<00:04:14.480> that<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:16.140> basic<00:04:16.620> translate<00:04:17.160> brush<00:04:17.459> for

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
mand that that basic translate brush for

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.960 
mand that that basic translate brush for
initially<00:04:21.920> so<00:04:22.920> once<00:04:23.160> I'm<00:04:23.340> satisfied<00:04:23.580> with

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
initially so once I'm satisfied with

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.180 
initially so once I'm satisfied with
that<00:04:24.330> I<00:04:24.540> start<00:04:24.960> puffing<00:04:25.200> puffing<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:26.010> hair

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
that I start puffing puffing the hair

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.600 
that I start puffing puffing the hair
out

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
out

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.970 
out
okay<00:04:27.450> so<00:04:27.510> just<00:04:27.690> after<00:04:28.260> a<00:04:28.290> few<00:04:28.590> minutes<00:04:28.740> of

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
okay so just after a few minutes of

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.120 
okay so just after a few minutes of
combing<00:04:29.430> we've<00:04:30.330> got<00:04:30.630> a<00:04:30.960> pretty<00:04:31.830> good

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
combing we've got a pretty good

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.980 
combing we've got a pretty good
representation<00:04:33.120> of<00:04:33.720> how<00:04:34.550> we<00:04:35.550> want<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.360> the

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
representation of how we want the the

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.580 
representation of how we want the the
dog's<00:04:37.290> air<00:04:37.830> flow<00:04:39.140> it's<00:04:40.140> looking<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.470> little

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
dog's air flow it's looking a little

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:59.970 
dog's air flow it's looking a little
puffy<00:04:41.070> in<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.220> chest<00:04:41.610> there<00:04:42.050> and<00:04:43.050> on<00:04:43.500> its<00:04:43.680> paws

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.070 

so<00:05:00.610> again<00:05:00.910> reusing<00:05:01.420> it<00:05:01.600> the<00:05:02.200> scale<00:05:02.530> brush

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
so again reusing it the scale brush

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.260 
so again reusing it the scale brush
right<00:05:05.080> now<00:05:05.260> we<00:05:05.320> have<00:05:05.590> soft<00:05:05.950> fall<00:05:06.280> offs<00:05:06.580> turn

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
right now we have soft fall offs turn

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.870 
right now we have soft fall offs turn
down<00:05:07.540> for<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:07.900> brush<00:05:08.140> we<00:05:08.380> can<00:05:08.590> actually

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
down for the brush we can actually

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.940 
down for the brush we can actually
toggle<00:05:09.880> those<00:05:10.000> off<00:05:10.500> underneath<00:05:11.500> the<00:05:11.710> the

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
toggle those off underneath the the

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:31.870 
toggle those off underneath the the
brush<00:05:12.160> menu<00:05:12.430> there

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.970 

so<00:05:32.390> combing<00:05:32.810> it<00:05:32.900> is<00:05:33.050> really<00:05:33.320> you<00:05:33.560> know<00:05:33.590> about

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
so combing it is really you know about

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.680 
so combing it is really you know about
the<00:05:34.130> same<00:05:34.370> action<00:05:34.790> you<00:05:34.970> would<00:05:35.090> take<00:05:35.300> as<00:05:35.540> you

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
the same action you would take as you

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:46.530 
the same action you would take as you
would<00:05:35.900> if<00:05:36.050> you<00:05:36.200> were<00:05:36.230> to<00:05:36.440> pet<00:05:36.680> pet<00:05:37.640> the<00:05:37.820> dog

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.760 

okay<00:05:47.380> let's<00:05:48.660> skip<00:05:49.660> forward<00:05:49.690> here<00:05:50.290> nothing

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
okay let's skip forward here nothing

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.410 
okay let's skip forward here nothing
interesting<00:05:51.700> going<00:05:51.730> around

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
interesting going around

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.870 
interesting going around
okay<00:05:53.260> now<00:05:53.470> we're<00:05:53.710> assigning<00:05:54.010> some<00:05:54.490> some

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
okay now we're assigning some some

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.520 
okay now we're assigning some some
colors<00:05:56.130> if<00:05:57.130> you're<00:05:57.910> going<00:05:58.030> to<00:05:58.120> text<00:05:58.330> your<00:05:58.660> root

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530 
colors if you're going to text your root

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.200 
colors if you're going to text your root
and<00:05:59.650> tip<00:05:59.890> color<00:06:00.160> you<00:06:00.430> want<00:06:00.610> to<00:06:00.670> assign<00:06:01.000> the

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
and tip color you want to assign the

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.780 
and tip color you want to assign the
colors<00:06:01.570> to<00:06:01.750> be<00:06:01.870> white<00:06:02.110> because<00:06:02.470> the<00:06:03.430> the

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
colors to be white because the the

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.180 
colors to be white because the the
texture<00:06:04.300> is<00:06:04.450> going<00:06:04.570> to<00:06:04.720> multiply<00:06:05.020> by<00:06:05.830> that

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
texture is going to multiply by that

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.460 
texture is going to multiply by that
color<00:06:06.750> the<00:06:07.750> reason<00:06:07.990> why<00:06:08.080> we<00:06:08.200> just<00:06:08.350> don't

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
color the reason why we just don't

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.500 
color the reason why we just don't
ignore<00:06:08.800> the<00:06:09.190> color<00:06:09.430> if<00:06:09.610> you<00:06:09.730> texture<00:06:10.090> is<00:06:10.330> that

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
ignore the color if you texture is that

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.840 
ignore the color if you texture is that
it's<00:06:10.690> actually<00:06:10.840> a<00:06:11.800> useful<00:06:12.100> tool<00:06:12.520> to<00:06:12.550> be<00:06:12.760> able

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
it's actually a useful tool to be able

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:17.460 
it's actually a useful tool to be able
to<00:06:13.000> tint<00:06:13.300> a<00:06:14.280> preexisting<00:06:15.280> map<00:06:16.140> so<00:06:17.140> we<00:06:17.170> just

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
to tint a preexisting map so we just

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:29.370 
to tint a preexisting map so we just
left<00:06:17.620> that<00:06:17.890> in<00:06:18.040> as<00:06:18.250> an<00:06:18.970> additional<00:06:19.420> control

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.120 

beyond<00:06:30.070> that<00:06:30.450> that<00:06:31.450> map<00:06:31.810> you<00:06:32.350> also<00:06:32.560> have

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 
beyond that that map you also have

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.590 
beyond that that map you also have
things<00:06:33.460> like<00:06:34.230> hue<00:06:35.230> variation<00:06:36.600> value

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 
things like hue variation value

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.910 
things like hue variation value
variation<00:06:39.060> from<00:06:40.060> hair<00:06:40.360> to<00:06:40.390> hair<00:06:40.780> you<00:06:41.590> get<00:06:41.800> it

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:41.920 
variation from hair to hair you get it

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.780 
variation from hair to hair you get it
you'll<00:06:42.250> get<00:06:42.400> a<00:06:42.460> random<00:06:43.270> deviation<00:06:44.140> from<00:06:44.920> what

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:45.790 
you'll get a random deviation from what

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.300 
you'll get a random deviation from what
the<00:06:45.940> map<00:06:46.150> assigns<00:06:46.630> it<00:06:46.900> if<00:06:47.530> you<00:06:47.740> set<00:06:47.920> those<00:06:48.130> to

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
the map assigns it if you set those to

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.610 
the map assigns it if you set those to
zero<00:06:48.580> to<00:06:48.700> be<00:06:49.030> exactly<00:06:49.660> what<00:06:49.870> the<00:06:49.990> map<00:06:50.200> assigns

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
zero to be exactly what the map assigns

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.510 
zero to be exactly what the map assigns
it<00:06:51.270> but<00:06:52.270> that's<00:06:52.450> probably<00:06:52.660> not<00:06:52.870> what<00:06:53.140> you<00:06:53.290> want

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
it but that's probably not what you want

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.970 
it but that's probably not what you want
natural<00:06:55.360> hair<00:06:55.510> always<00:06:55.900> has<00:06:56.290> lots<00:06:56.800> of

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:56.980 
natural hair always has lots of

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:06.090 
natural hair always has lots of
variation<00:06:57.610> inside<00:06:58.000> it

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:06.100 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.090 

okay<00:07:06.700> so<00:07:06.760> there's<00:07:07.090> a<00:07:07.180> quick<00:07:07.450> render<00:07:07.990> of<00:07:08.440> where

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.100 
okay so there's a quick render of where

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.580 
okay so there's a quick render of where
we're<00:07:09.280> at<00:07:09.310> with<00:07:09.640> a<00:07:09.670> dog<00:07:09.970> that's<00:07:10.420> actually<00:07:11.380> not

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590 
we're at with a dog that's actually not

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:18.990 
we're at with a dog that's actually not
looking<00:07:11.710> too<00:07:12.040> bad<00:07:16.200> let's<00:07:17.460> make<00:07:18.460> a<00:07:18.490> few<00:07:18.790> more

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.000 
looking too bad let's make a few more

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:27.909 
looking too bad let's make a few more
adjustments<00:07:19.830> turn<00:07:20.830> up<00:07:21.040> the<00:07:21.690> count<00:07:23.100> thickness

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:33.040 

now<00:07:28.520> let's<00:07:28.729> just<00:07:28.939> skip<00:07:29.330> ahead<00:07:29.509> to<00:07:32.050> two

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.050 
now let's just skip ahead to two

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:41.850 
now let's just skip ahead to two
rendered<00:07:33.469> sequence

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:41.860 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:50.779 

and<00:07:42.010> there<00:07:42.940> is

00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:50.789 

00:07:50.789 --> 00:07:52.850 

those<00:07:51.360> are<00:07:51.569> rendered<00:07:51.870> with<00:07:52.020> the<00:07:52.139> buffer<00:07:52.529> ender

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:52.860 
those are rendered with the buffer ender

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.619 
those are rendered with the buffer ender
I<00:07:52.889> believe<00:07:53.219> those<00:07:53.460> are<00:07:53.639> about<00:07:53.819> four<00:07:54.449> minutes

00:07:54.619 --> 00:07:54.629 
I believe those are about four minutes

00:07:54.629 --> 00:08:05.940 
I believe those are about four minutes
each<00:07:55.729> hot<00:07:56.729> food<00:07:57.150> res<00:07:57.389> I<00:07:57.779> think<00:07:58.080> that's<00:07:58.259> medium

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:05.950 

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.790 

okay
