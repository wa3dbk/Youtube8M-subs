it's interesting because you know what's
been<00:00:30.250> on<00:00:30.400> my<00:00:30.430> mind<00:00:30.760> this<00:00:30.970> week<00:00:31.240> is<00:00:31.480> this

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
been on my mind this week is this

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.799 
been on my mind this week is this
concept<00:00:32.500> of<00:00:32.790> resistance<00:00:33.790> in<00:00:33.970> opposition<00:00:34.600> and

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
concept of resistance in opposition and

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.780 
concept of resistance in opposition and
we<00:00:35.410> tend<00:00:35.650> to<00:00:35.710> think<00:00:35.800> of<00:00:36.070> that<00:00:36.280> as<00:00:36.460> a<00:00:36.489> really

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
we tend to think of that as a really

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.020 
we tend to think of that as a really
negative<00:00:37.260> factor<00:00:38.260> and<00:00:38.530> I<00:00:39.280> know<00:00:39.340> when<00:00:39.670> I<00:00:39.730> was

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
negative factor and I know when I was

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.930 
negative factor and I know when I was
taking<00:00:40.239> care<00:00:40.780> of<00:00:40.809> my<00:00:41.230> little<00:00:41.610> almost<00:00:42.610> three
