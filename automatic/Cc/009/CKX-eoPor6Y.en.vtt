automatically it really would have made
this<00:02:24.680> gameplay<00:02:24.920> feel<00:02:25.340> smoother

other recent games have done this better

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.460 
other recent games have done this better
so<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.190> really<00:02:28.370> does<00:02:28.580> stick<00:02:28.879> out<00:02:29.000> here

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
so it really does stick out here

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.330 
so it really does stick out here

Li's head is a little crazy though the

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.320 
Li's head is a little crazy though the
game<00:02:43.220> doesn't<00:02:43.400> really<00:02:43.519> strive<00:02:43.849> for<00:02:44.030> realism

so that's not exactly a big deal the

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.400
