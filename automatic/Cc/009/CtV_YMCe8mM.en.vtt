having Theo and Justin added into the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.690 
having Theo and Justin added into the
rotation<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:32.530> wherever<00:02:33.190> they<00:02:33.310> need<00:02:33.519> me<00:02:33.670> to

minutes a game again and also just work
on<00:03:04.629> you<00:03:05.049> know<00:03:05.170> my<00:03:05.319> skill<00:03:05.560> set<00:03:05.799> in<00:03:05.950> terms<00:03:06.069> of

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
on you know my skill set in terms of

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.490 
on you know my skill set in terms of
finishing<00:03:06.790> around<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.209> basket<00:03:07.269> and<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.290> think

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
finishing around the basket and I think

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.569 
finishing around the basket and I think
part<00:03:08.709> of<00:03:08.739> that<00:03:08.799> comes<00:03:09.069> with<00:03:09.220> being<00:03:09.370> in<00:03:09.489> the

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
part of that comes with being in the

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.940 
part of that comes with being in the
weight<00:03:09.700> room<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:10.140> becoming<00:03:11.140> even<00:03:11.470> more<00:03:11.650> of<00:03:11.860> a

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
weight room and becoming even more of a

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.220 
weight room and becoming even more of a
consistent<00:03:12.430> jump<00:03:12.610> shooter<00:03:12.910> I<00:03:13.090> really<00:03:13.989> want<00:03:14.170> to

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
consistent jump shooter I really want to

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.170 
consistent jump shooter I really want to

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
shoot you know it's close to 50% from

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.720 
shoot you know it's close to 50% from
the<00:03:16.239> floor<00:03:16.420> as<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:17.260> can<00:03:17.470> this<00:03:17.650> year<00:03:17.889> he's<00:03:18.549> had

you<00:03:23.319> know<00:03:23.440> let's<00:03:24.010> both<00:03:24.190> doing<00:03:24.370> all<00:03:24.549> right<00:03:24.579> so

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
you know let's both doing all right so

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.020 
you know let's both doing all right so
that's<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.590> goal<00:03:26.769> of<00:03:26.889> mine<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.430> then<00:03:27.519> also<00:03:27.670> just

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
that's a goal of mine and then also just

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.729 
that's a goal of mine and then also just
being<00:03:28.180> able<00:03:28.269> to<00:03:28.450> get<00:03:28.569> above<00:03:28.750> that<00:03:28.959> 40%<00:03:29.650> from

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
being able to get above that 40% from

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.800 
being able to get above that 40% from
three<00:03:30.160> three-point<00:03:30.760> range<00:03:30.970> which<00:03:31.420> I<00:03:31.540> think

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
three three-point range which I think

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.050 
three three-point range which I think
will<00:03:32.410> be<00:03:32.440> easier<00:03:32.859> this<00:03:33.099> year<00:03:33.370> since<00:03:33.670> I<00:03:33.790> want<00:03:33.970> to

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
will be easier this year since I want to

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.270 
will be easier this year since I want to
take<00:03:34.450> as<00:03:34.630> many<00:03:34.840> tough<00:03:35.530> ones<00:03:35.769> as<00:03:35.980> I<00:03:36.069> did<00:03:36.250> last

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
take as many tough ones as I did last

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.240

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
you want to go to the gym and play

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.640 
you want to go to the gym and play
one-on-one<00:04:15.609> and<00:04:15.849> stuff<00:04:16.120> like<00:04:16.239> that<00:04:16.450> so<00:04:16.650> this

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
one-on-one and stuff like that so this

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.279 
one-on-one and stuff like that so this
team<00:04:18.070> is<00:04:18.400> has<00:04:19.060> more<00:04:19.299> gym<00:04:19.510> rats<00:04:19.720> on<00:04:19.930> it<00:04:20.109> than

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
team is has more gym rats on it than

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.440 
team is has more gym rats on it than
we've<00:04:20.709> had<00:04:20.829> in<00:04:20.889> the<00:04:21.130> past<00:04:21.310> and<00:04:21.669> the<00:04:22.090> freshmen

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
we've had in the past and the freshmen

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.909 
we've had in the past and the freshmen
are<00:04:22.539> a<00:04:22.570> big<00:04:22.810> part<00:04:23.050> of<00:04:23.140> that<00:04:23.200> and<00:04:23.500> also<00:04:23.620> I<00:04:23.800> think

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
are a big part of that and also I think

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.100 
are a big part of that and also I think
people<00:04:24.280> realize<00:04:24.640> that<00:04:24.940> we<00:04:25.599> have<00:04:25.719> a<00:04:25.750> chance<00:04:25.990> to

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
people realize that we have a chance to

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.670 
people realize that we have a chance to
be<00:04:26.200> really<00:04:26.320> good

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
be really good

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.529 
be really good
they<00:04:26.830> want<00:04:27.039> to<00:04:27.100> be<00:04:27.280> a<00:04:27.490> part<00:04:27.850> of<00:04:27.940> that<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.389> the

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:28.539 
they want to be a part of that and the

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:29.760 
they want to be a part of that and the
only<00:04:28.660> way<00:04:28.780> to<00:04:28.840> do<00:04:28.990> that<00:04:29.020> is<00:04:29.259> to<00:04:29.380> put<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.650> work

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
only way to do that is to put the work

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.310 
only way to do that is to put the work
in<00:04:30.009> so<00:04:30.280> I<00:04:30.460> think<00:04:30.699> Seabees<00:04:31.180> challenge<00:04:31.720> actually

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
in so I think Seabees challenge actually

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.200 
in so I think Seabees challenge actually
helped<00:04:32.830> a<00:04:32.860> lot<00:04:32.979> motivate<00:04:33.550> a<00:04:33.580> lot<00:04:33.729> of<00:04:33.820> guys<00:04:33.940> to

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.749 
leadership and the way I play
unselfishly<00:05:59.229> I<00:05:59.590> think<00:05:59.889> those<00:06:00.340> goals<00:06:00.610> are

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 
unselfishly I think those goals are

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.330 
unselfishly I think those goals are
still<00:06:00.849> realistic<00:06:01.449> and<00:06:01.690> if<00:06:02.110> we<00:06:02.680> win<00:06:02.919> that

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
still realistic and if we win that

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:04.649 
still realistic and if we win that
