00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
cortex a9 processor that's a mouthful

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.080 
cortex a9 processor that's a mouthful
but<00:00:16.830> it's<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.490> relatively<00:00:17.850> inexpensive

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
but it's a relatively inexpensive

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.730 
but it's a relatively inexpensive
processor<00:00:18.810> which<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:18.990> part<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.410> how<00:00:19.529> they're

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
processor which is part of how they're

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.070 
processor which is part of how they're
able<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.980> keep<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.340> price<00:00:20.550> down<00:00:20.730> here<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.930> in

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
able to keep the price down here so in

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.900 
able to keep the price down here so in
terms<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.439> Sirte<00:00:22.590> size<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.100> shape<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.490> looks<00:00:23.760> a

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
terms of Sirte size and shape it looks a

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.089 
terms of Sirte size and shape it looks a
lot<00:00:24.210> like<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.480> Google<00:00:24.900> Nexus<00:00:25.019> 7<00:00:25.590> tablet<00:00:25.980> which

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
lot like a Google Nexus 7 tablet which

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.330 
lot like a Google Nexus 7 tablet which
is<00:00:26.220> also<00:00:26.369> inexpensive<00:00:27.000> at<00:00:27.090> 199<00:00:27.539> but<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.710> memo

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
is also inexpensive at 199 but the memo

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.120 
is also inexpensive at 199 but the memo
pad<00:00:29.550> has<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:30.150> lower<00:00:30.570> resolution<00:00:30.779> 1024<00:00:31.470> by<00:00:31.920> 600

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
pad has a lower resolution 1024 by 600

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.370 
pad has a lower resolution 1024 by 600
pixel<00:00:32.550> display<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:33.059> slower<00:00:33.719> single<00:00:34.230> core

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
pixel display a slower single core

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.470 
pixel display a slower single core
processor<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.610> couple<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.910> other<00:00:36.030> changes

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
processor and a couple of other changes

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.670 
processor and a couple of other changes
so<00:00:36.630> if<00:00:36.690> we<00:00:36.780> look<00:00:36.930> at<00:00:37.020> sort<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> fit<00:00:37.559> and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
so if we look at sort of the fit and

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.380 
so if we look at sort of the fit and
finish<00:00:37.800> they<00:00:38.370> look<00:00:38.550> pretty<00:00:38.820> similar<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
finish they look pretty similar on the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.670 
finish they look pretty similar on the
back<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:39.809> we've<00:00:39.930> got<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> sort<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.350> soft

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
back but we've got a sort of soft

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.010 
back but we've got a sort of soft
plastic<00:00:40.920> touch<00:00:41.399> here<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> nexus<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.960> a

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
plastic touch here on the nexus it's a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.729 
plastic touch here on the nexus it's a
little<00:00:43.200> bit<00:00:43.320> harder<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:45.050> memo<00:00:46.050> pad<00:00:46.260> it's

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
little bit harder on the memo pad it's

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.180 
little bit harder on the memo pad it's
also<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.010> bumpier<00:00:47.520> texture<00:00:48.000> there's<00:00:48.719> on<00:00:49.649> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
also a bumpier texture there's on the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.459 
also a bumpier texture there's on the
bottom<00:00:50.550> one<00:00:51.300> advantage<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.140> there's

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
bottom one advantage is that there's

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.020 
bottom one advantage is that there's
actually<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.710> micro<00:00:52.980> SD<00:00:53.250> card<00:00:53.489> slot<00:00:53.730> here<00:00:53.760> are

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
actually a micro SD card slot here are

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.100 
actually a micro SD card slot here are
something<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.329> don't<00:00:54.510> get<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.840> Nexus

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
something you don't get on the Nexus

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.670 
something you don't get on the Nexus
tablet<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.090> we've<00:00:57.090> got<00:00:57.239> micro<00:00:57.510> USB<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.289> fairly

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
tablet and we've got micro USB a fairly

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.360 
tablet and we've got micro USB a fairly
loud<00:00:58.859> speaker<00:00:59.370> here<00:00:59.690> volume<00:01:01.070> and<00:01:02.070> power

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
loud speaker here volume and power

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.219 
loud speaker here volume and power
buttons<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.329> headphone<00:01:03.629> jack<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.080> that's

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
buttons and a headphone jack and that's

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.020 
buttons and a headphone jack and that's
about<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:05.430> what<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.610> find<00:01:05.820> around

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
about it for for what you find around

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.940 
about it for for what you find around
the<00:01:06.180> sides<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:07.020> let's<00:01:07.500> go<00:01:07.560> head<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.680> turn<00:01:07.860> it

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the sides so let's go head and turn it

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.950 
the sides so let's go head and turn it
on<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.369> take<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> quick<00:01:09.150> look<00:01:09.390> at<00:01:09.510> overall

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
on and take a quick look at overall

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.460 
on and take a quick look at overall
performance<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.070> tablet<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:12.110> not<00:01:13.110> too

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
performance of this tablet is not too

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.469 
performance of this tablet is not too
bad<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.950> mean<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.549> terms<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.880> benchmarks<00:01:15.360> it

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
bad I mean in terms of benchmarks it

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.899 
bad I mean in terms of benchmarks it
doesn't<00:01:15.659> come<00:01:15.780> anywhere<00:01:15.990> near<00:01:16.049> as<00:01:16.610> fast<00:01:17.610> as

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
doesn't come anywhere near as fast as

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.580 
doesn't come anywhere near as fast as
what<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.270> would<00:01:18.390> get<00:01:18.540> from<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:19.020> quad-core

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
what you would get from a quad-core

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.499 
what you would get from a quad-core
device<00:01:20.040> with<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.310> Tegra<00:01:20.640> 3<00:01:20.670> processor<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
device with a Tegra 3 processor like the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.780 
device with a Tegra 3 processor like the
Nexus<00:01:21.810> 7<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.860> know<00:01:22.950> most<00:01:23.159> uh<00:01:23.310> Android

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
Nexus 7 but you know most uh Android

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.670 
Nexus 7 but you know most uh Android
apps<00:01:23.939> don't<00:01:24.150> actually<00:01:24.420> need<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.170> super-fast

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
apps don't actually need a super-fast

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.440 
apps don't actually need a super-fast
processor<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.610> basic<00:01:27.180> things<00:01:27.360> like

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
processor so for basic things like

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:41.930 
processor so for basic things like
surfing<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> web<00:01:29.570> it's<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:31.229> really<00:01:31.380> not<00:01:31.560> bad

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.560 

there<00:01:42.840> might<00:01:42.960> be<00:01:43.050> a<00:01:43.080> little<00:01:43.380> bit<00:01:43.590> more<00:01:43.740> lag

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
there might be a little bit more lag

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.640 
there might be a little bit more lag
than<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.750> would<00:01:45.870> experience<00:01:46.050> on<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.350> faster

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
than you would experience on a faster

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.800 
than you would experience on a faster
tablet<00:01:46.980> but<00:01:47.100> web<00:01:47.760> surfing<00:01:47.970> look<00:01:48.240> works<00:01:48.480> fine

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
tablet but web surfing look works fine

00:01:48.810 --> 00:02:11.290 
tablet but web surfing look works fine
playing<00:01:49.260> games<00:01:49.530> works<00:01:50.130> pretty<00:01:50.340> well

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.630 

and<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.230> speakers<00:02:12.500> not<00:02:12.650> too<00:02:12.770> bad<00:02:12.950> now<00:02:13.400> can

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
and the speakers not too bad now can

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.010 
and the speakers not too bad now can
take<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.790> little<00:02:14.030> bit<00:02:14.120> longer<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:14.570> do<00:02:14.720> certain

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
take a little bit longer to do certain

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.960 
take a little bit longer to do certain
things<00:02:15.050> like<00:02:15.410> rotating<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.280> screen<00:02:16.400> or

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
things like rotating the screen or

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.940 
things like rotating the screen or
launching<00:02:17.330> applications<00:02:17.510> then<00:02:18.230> on<00:02:18.380> a<00:02:18.410> tablet

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
launching applications then on a tablet

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.830 
launching applications then on a tablet
with<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.070> faster<00:02:19.400> processor<00:02:19.850> for<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.720> most

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
with a faster processor for the most

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.210 
with a faster processor for the most
part<00:02:21.020> I<00:02:21.080> don't<00:02:21.140> have<00:02:21.380> any<00:02:21.650> real<00:02:21.800> complaints

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
part I don't have any real complaints

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.570 
part I don't have any real complaints
for<00:02:22.280> $150<00:02:22.940> device<00:02:23.870> it's<00:02:24.590> impressive<00:02:25.130> that<00:02:25.280> it

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
for $150 device it's impressive that it

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.130 
for $150 device it's impressive that it
has<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.760> processor<00:02:26.240> at<00:02:26.330> all<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.600> be<00:02:26.690> perfectly

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
has a processor at all to be perfectly

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.670 
has a processor at all to be perfectly
honest<00:02:28.090> but<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.750> know<00:02:29.840> let's<00:02:30.050> just<00:02:30.290> show<00:02:30.620> you

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
honest but you know let's just show you

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.020 
honest but you know let's just show you
another<00:02:30.920> one<00:02:31.070> here<00:02:31.280> in<00:02:31.430> terms<00:02:31.640> of<00:02:31.820> sort<00:02:31.970> of

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
another one here in terms of sort of

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:39.730 
another one here in terms of sort of
launching<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.570> game<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.350> know<00:02:39.530> there's<00:02:39.680> a

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
launching a game so you know there's a

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.820 
launching a game so you know there's a
little<00:02:40.130> bit<00:02:40.310> of<00:02:40.840> lag<00:02:41.840> while<00:02:42.260> you're<00:02:42.470> waiting

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
little bit of lag while you're waiting

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.410 
little bit of lag while you're waiting
for<00:02:42.860> things<00:02:43.190> to<00:02:43.280> open<00:02:43.670> but<00:02:43.820> once<00:02:44.000> they<00:02:44.150> open

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
for things to open but once they open

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:56.080 
for things to open but once they open
they<00:02:44.510> tend<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.720> run<00:02:44.870> just<00:02:45.020> fine

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.280 

but<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.180> one<00:02:57.420> problem<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.140> tablet

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
but the one problem that this tablet

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.710 
but the one problem that this tablet
really<00:02:58.560> has<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:59.100> that<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.400> screen<00:02:59.760> is<00:02:59.970> not<00:03:00.090> an

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
really has is that the screen is not an

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.930 
really has is that the screen is not an
IPS<00:03:01.200> display<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.980> what<00:03:02.490> that<00:03:02.610> means<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.880> you

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
IPS display and what that means is you

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.310 
IPS display and what that means is you
don't<00:03:02.970> have<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.330> wide<00:03:03.510> viewing<00:03:03.810> angles<00:03:04.200> that

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
don't have the wide viewing angles that

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.140 
don't have the wide viewing angles that
you<00:03:04.410> get<00:03:04.530> on<00:03:04.620> something<00:03:04.890> like<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.130> Nexus<00:03:05.160> 7<00:03:05.610> so

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
you get on something like the Nexus 7 so

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.940 
you get on something like the Nexus 7 so
go<00:03:06.720> ahead<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:06.900> turn<00:03:07.080> these<00:03:07.200> both<00:03:07.380> on<00:03:07.650> and

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
go ahead and turn these both on and

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.050 
go ahead and turn these both on and
you'll<00:03:08.280> see<00:03:08.520> that<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:11.420> Nexus<00:03:12.420> 7<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:13.140> the

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
you'll see that the Nexus 7 and the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.150 
you'll see that the Nexus 7 and the
MooMoo<00:03:15.060> pad<00:03:15.470> side-by-side<00:03:16.470> don't<00:03:16.770> look<00:03:16.920> that

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
MooMoo pad side-by-side don't look that

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.870 
MooMoo pad side-by-side don't look that
different

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
different

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.160 
different
but<00:03:18.180> then<00:03:18.270> if<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.450> put<00:03:18.600> them<00:03:18.720> down<00:03:18.750> on<00:03:18.930> the

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
but then if you put them down on the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.000 
but then if you put them down on the
table<00:03:19.290> flat<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:22.200> colors<00:03:22.530> are<00:03:22.800> completely

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
table flat the colors are completely

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.820 
table flat the colors are completely
washed<00:03:23.670> out<00:03:23.910> on<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.240> memo<00:03:24.510> pad<00:03:24.720> at<00:03:25.590> this

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
washed out on the memo pad at this

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.500 
washed out on the memo pad at this
particular<00:03:26.250> angle<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:26.820> they<00:03:26.880> look<00:03:27.000> just<00:03:27.210> fine

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
particular angle and they look just fine

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.930 
particular angle and they look just fine
on<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:28.170> Nexus<00:03:28.470> 7<00:03:28.620> so<00:03:29.010> again<00:03:29.580> we'll<00:03:29.760> take<00:03:29.880> a

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
on the Nexus 7 so again we'll take a

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.360 
on the Nexus 7 so again we'll take a
look<00:03:30.120> from<00:03:30.210> the<00:03:30.360> top<00:03:30.570> they<00:03:30.990> look<00:03:31.170> fine<00:03:31.380> as<00:03:31.710> you

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
look from the top they look fine as you

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.310 
look from the top they look fine as you
sort<00:03:32.550> of<00:03:32.670> start<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:32.970> come<00:03:33.120> down<00:03:33.150> here<00:03:33.630> the

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
sort of start to come down here the

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.990 
sort of start to come down here the
colors<00:03:34.620> get<00:03:34.860> washed<00:03:35.160> out<00:03:35.370> in<00:03:35.550> difficult<00:03:35.940> to

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
colors get washed out in difficult to

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.970 
colors get washed out in difficult to
see<00:03:36.210> and<00:03:36.630> what<00:03:37.320> that<00:03:37.440> means<00:03:37.620> is<00:03:37.740> if<00:03:37.860> you're

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
see and what that means is if you're

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.320 
see and what that means is if you're
watching<00:03:38.220> a<00:03:38.310> video<00:03:38.460> it's<00:03:38.970> almost<00:03:39.120> going<00:03:39.270> to

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
watching a video it's almost going to

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.400 
watching a video it's almost going to
look<00:03:39.450> like<00:03:39.540> you're<00:03:39.690> watching<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:40.140> photo

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
look like you're watching a photo

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.830 
look like you're watching a photo
negative<00:03:40.740> image<00:03:41.370> if<00:03:41.580> you're<00:03:42.030> looking<00:03:42.720> at

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
negative image if you're looking at

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.990 
negative image if you're looking at
webpages<00:03:43.290> same<00:03:43.800> problem<00:03:44.250> pictures<00:03:44.790> just

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
webpages same problem pictures just

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.700 
webpages same problem pictures just
don't<00:03:45.150> look<00:03:45.330> really<00:03:45.690> as<00:03:46.200> good<00:03:46.440> as<00:03:46.560> they<00:03:46.680> should

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
don't look really as good as they should

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.280 
don't look really as good as they should
so<00:03:47.250> we<00:03:47.700> go<00:03:47.820> from<00:03:48.000> sort<00:03:48.300> of<00:03:48.360> full<00:03:48.600> color<00:03:48.900> on<00:03:49.020> that

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
so we go from sort of full color on that

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.570 
so we go from sort of full color on that
image<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:51.290> not<00:03:52.290> exactly<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.710> full<00:03:52.860> color<00:03:53.040> it's

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
image to not exactly a full color it's

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.010 
image to not exactly a full color it's
also<00:03:53.700> a<00:03:53.820> lower<00:03:53.970> resolution<00:03:54.210> screen<00:03:54.840> which

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
also a lower resolution screen which

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.510 
also a lower resolution screen which
means<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:55.560> when<00:03:55.830> you're<00:03:55.950> on<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.310> home<00:03:57.000> oh

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.860 

basically<00:04:00.000> when<00:04:00.180> you're<00:04:00.270> on<00:04:00.330> anything<00:04:00.600> but

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
basically when you're on anything but

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.030 
basically when you're on anything but
let's<00:04:01.110> just<00:04:01.230> take<00:04:01.350> a<00:04:01.410> look<00:04:01.500> at<00:04:01.650> sort<00:04:01.860> of<00:04:01.890> the

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
let's just take a look at sort of the

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.490 
let's just take a look at sort of the
typical<00:04:02.520> size<00:04:02.970> of<00:04:03.209> an<00:04:03.330> android<00:04:03.660> application

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
typical size of an android application

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.020 
typical size of an android application
if<00:04:04.860> you're<00:04:04.980> looking<00:04:05.160> at<00:04:05.220> the<00:04:05.310> shortcuts<00:04:05.760> up

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
if you're looking at the shortcuts up

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.690 
if you're looking at the shortcuts up
close<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:07.440> don't<00:04:07.560> really<00:04:07.800> see<00:04:08.130> a<00:04:08.340> lot<00:04:08.670> of

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
close you don't really see a lot of

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.650 
close you don't really see a lot of
pixelization<00:04:09.590> or<00:04:10.590> pixelation<00:04:11.480> around<00:04:12.480> the

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
see on this particular video but it

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.409 
see on this particular video but it
almost<00:04:25.620> feels<00:04:26.100> like<00:04:26.310> you're<00:04:27.060> actually

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
almost feels like you're actually

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.290 
almost feels like you're actually
touching<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.560> area<00:04:28.890> that's<00:04:29.040> moving<00:04:29.610> on<00:04:29.790> this

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
touching the area that's moving on this

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.300 
touching the area that's moving on this
display<00:04:30.600> whereas<00:04:31.500> here<00:04:31.770> it<00:04:31.919> feels<00:04:32.070> like

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
display whereas here it feels like

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.860 
display whereas here it feels like
you're<00:04:32.430> touching<00:04:32.550> sort<00:04:32.970> of<00:04:33.030> just<00:04:33.210> above<00:04:33.570> the

you're touching sort of just above the
item<00:04:34.140> that's<00:04:34.320> moving<00:04:34.560> so<00:04:35.130> it<00:04:35.430> feels<00:04:36.000> like

there's<00:04:36.330> a<00:04:36.390> little<00:04:36.600> bit<00:04:36.930> of<00:04:37.020> a<00:04:37.080> gap<00:04:37.350> almost

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
there's a little bit of a gap almost

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.760 
there's a little bit of a gap almost
between<00:04:38.010> the<00:04:38.550> top<00:04:39.300> of<00:04:39.450> this<00:04:39.570> or<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.169> glass<00:04:40.440> and

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
the touch area below it so the screen is

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.440 
the touch area below it so the screen is
really<00:04:46.200> not<00:04:46.590> stellar<00:04:47.040> other<00:04:47.970> than<00:04:48.120> that<00:04:48.240> it's

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
really not stellar other than that it's

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.350 
really not stellar other than that it's
really<00:04:48.690> not<00:04:48.780> a<00:04:48.840> bad<00:04:48.960> tablet<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:49.590> for<00:04:49.710> $149<00:04:50.700> if

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
really not a bad tablet so for $149 if

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.120 
really not a bad tablet so for $149 if
you<00:04:51.480> get<00:04:51.630> this<00:04:51.810> and<00:04:52.140> you<00:04:52.440> plan<00:04:52.650> to<00:04:52.680> use<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:52.890> for

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
you get this and you plan to use it for

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.190 
you get this and you plan to use it for
playing<00:04:53.430> some<00:04:53.669> games<00:04:53.880> watching<00:04:54.630> some<00:04:54.930> videos

playing some games watching some videos
doing<00:04:55.440> summer<00:04:55.650> things<00:04:55.919> you<00:04:56.370> know<00:04:56.490> you<00:04:56.520> might

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
doing summer things you know you might

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.010 
doing summer things you know you might
not<00:04:56.880> really<00:04:57.060> be<00:04:57.150> that<00:04:57.240> disappointed<00:04:57.900> but

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
not really be that disappointed but

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.970 
not really be that disappointed but
you're<00:04:58.110> gonna<00:04:58.200> want<00:04:58.380> to<00:04:58.440> make<00:04:58.500> sure<00:04:58.560> that<00:04:58.800> you

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
you're gonna want to make sure that you

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.590 
you're gonna want to make sure that you
pay<00:04:59.310> attention<00:04:59.340> to<00:04:59.850> the<00:04:59.970> viewing<00:05:00.270> angles

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
pay attention to the viewing angles

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.900 
pay attention to the viewing angles
because<00:05:00.840> from<00:05:01.710> some<00:05:01.980> angles<00:05:02.130> it<00:05:02.430> looks<00:05:02.610> pretty

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
because from some angles it looks pretty

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.409 
because from some angles it looks pretty
good<00:05:03.150> from<00:05:03.900> others<00:05:04.289> it<00:05:04.560> really<00:05:05.210> looks<00:05:06.210> a<00:05:06.300> lot

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
good from others it really looks a lot

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.690 
good from others it really looks a lot
less<00:05:06.600> good

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
less good

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.280 
less good
you<00:05:09.330> know<00:05:09.450> if<00:05:09.600> you<00:05:09.660> can<00:05:09.780> afford<00:05:09.870> to<00:05:10.140> spend

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
you know if you can afford to spend

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:11.930 
you know if you can afford to spend
fifty<00:05:10.530> dollars<00:05:10.800> more<00:05:11.100> and<00:05:11.400> get<00:05:11.670> something

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
fifty dollars more and get something

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.280 
fifty dollars more and get something
like<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:12.210> Nexus<00:05:12.510> 7<00:05:12.660> I<00:05:12.870> think<00:05:12.900> you're<00:05:13.110> getting

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
like the Nexus 7 I think you're getting

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.810 
like the Nexus 7 I think you're getting
a<00:05:13.350> much<00:05:13.560> much<00:05:13.740> better<00:05:13.920> tablet<00:05:14.250> for<00:05:14.520> your<00:05:14.640> money

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
a much much better tablet for your money

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.350 
a much much better tablet for your money
and<00:05:16.100> it<00:05:17.100> seems<00:05:17.370> a<00:05:17.490> little<00:05:17.610> bit<00:05:17.820> strange<00:05:17.970> to<00:05:18.270> me

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
and it seems a little bit strange to me

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.790 
and it seems a little bit strange to me
that<00:05:18.540> of<00:05:18.750> all<00:05:18.900> the<00:05:19.050> corners<00:05:19.350> that<00:05:19.440> were<00:05:19.560> cut

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
that of all the corners that were cut

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.800 
that of all the corners that were cut
here<00:05:20.100> it's<00:05:20.460> not<00:05:20.610> just<00:05:20.670> the<00:05:20.970> processor<00:05:21.480> but

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
here it's not just the processor but

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.660 
here it's not just the processor but
also<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.410> the<00:05:22.800> display<00:05:23.190> and<00:05:23.400> I<00:05:23.430> think<00:05:23.610> you

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
also the the display and I think you

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.030 
also the the display and I think you
really<00:05:23.850> need<00:05:24.150> to<00:05:24.210> have<00:05:24.510> a<00:05:24.720> good<00:05:24.960> display<00:05:25.650> with

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
really need to have a good display with

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.860 
really need to have a good display with
wide<00:05:26.280> viewing<00:05:26.310> angles<00:05:27.060> to<00:05:27.240> offer<00:05:27.450> a<00:05:27.630> decent

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
wide viewing angles to offer a decent

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.370 
wide viewing angles to offer a decent
tablet<00:05:28.380> experience<00:05:28.590> and<00:05:29.100> in<00:05:29.790> 2013<00:05:30.090> it<00:05:30.390> just<00:05:30.750> it

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
tablet experience and in 2013 it just it

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.600 
tablet experience and in 2013 it just it
seems<00:05:31.620> a<00:05:31.680> little<00:05:31.770> bit<00:05:31.890> weird<00:05:31.980> that<00:05:32.250> people<00:05:32.310> are

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
seems a little bit weird that people are

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.890 
seems a little bit weird that people are
still<00:05:32.760> putting<00:05:32.940> out<00:05:33.090> tablets<00:05:33.480> that<00:05:33.660> don't

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
still putting out tablets that don't

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.830 
still putting out tablets that don't
have<00:05:34.140> wide<00:05:34.670> viewing<00:05:35.670> angles<00:05:36.060> from<00:05:36.390> every

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
conceivable direction if you sort of pay

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.230 
conceivable direction if you sort of pay
attention<00:05:40.320> to<00:05:40.470> which<00:05:40.830> angles<00:05:41.220> work<00:05:41.490> well<00:05:41.700> your

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
attention to which angles work well your

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.070 
attention to which angles work well your
experience<00:05:42.720> won't<00:05:42.810> be<00:05:42.960> quite<00:05:43.230> as<00:05:43.260> bad<00:05:43.910> but<00:05:45.080> you

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
experience won't be quite as bad but you

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.270 
experience won't be quite as bad but you
know<00:05:46.170> for<00:05:46.350> a<00:05:46.380> little<00:05:46.590> bit<00:05:46.710> more<00:05:46.860> money<00:05:47.040> or

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
know for a little bit more money or

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.680 
know for a little bit more money or

version<00:05:51.180> you<00:05:51.660> can<00:05:51.780> almost<00:05:51.900> get<00:05:52.080> it<00:05:52.140> for<00:05:52.290> the

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350

same<00:05:52.530> price<00:05:52.560> so<00:05:53.490> I<00:05:53.520> think<00:05:54.000> the<00:05:54.180> Nexus<00:05:54.480> 7<00:05:54.600> is<00:05:54.810> a

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
same price so I think the Nexus 7 is a

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.930 
same price so I think the Nexus 7 is a
much<00:05:55.050> better<00:05:55.230> Buy<00:05:55.500> but<00:05:56.130> the<00:05:56.220> memo<00:05:56.490> pad<00:05:56.670> 7

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
much better Buy but the memo pad 7

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.330 
much better Buy but the memo pad 7
