 a huge corrone appeared in the sun 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.139
 anal hole how great 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.259
 hello live walrus news 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.630
 NASA video recorded in the sun hour 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.810
 anal hole 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.250
 huge size huge simple just 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.350
 unreal sizes at the bottom 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.109
 made apparatus with two pictures 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.900
 a dark spot is quite clearly visible 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.449
 which usually appears together 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.430
 breaking the star's magnetic field 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.360
 photo solar and plasma stops 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.340
 hold in this area 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.620
 clean appearance of such a coronal appearance 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.660
 they vary depending on the cycle 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.570
 solar activity with weak 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.030
 activity on the star appears more than 5 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.960
 video from nasa shows progress 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.079
 coronary tour 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.270
 for five days of observations we are in touch 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.730
 in the studio the head of the center under the muse in 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.350
 Space Weather Sergei Sergei Gaydash 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.549
 please a few words on the pockets of durov 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:09.510
 coronal holes are unlocked kamenev 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:13.170
 tubes of them are expiring solar then by 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.350
 another wind and pretty you 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:21.710
 and how it affects you only we spend hours 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:25.920
 the weather influences what it pollinates 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.530
 as if the sun define everything not so long ago 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.170
 I carry a message that on earth between 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.049
 December 16 to 22 was the most powerful 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:39.270
 magnetic storm for the last three centuries we 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.310
 did not feel that I thought I had 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.259
 the time of this phenomenon was blocked 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.259
 up to 90 percent 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.530
 sunlight and what about those who 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.110
 feed on sunlight magnetic storm 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.430
 may be caused by emissions of wet 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.430
 the sun is sleeping on and 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.900
 what are we afraid of expert and that's all 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.050
 meet everyone for now look and be in

 the latest news and 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:15.930
 news on the channel walrus news itself 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:19.850
 fresh channel in corporation know them and 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.850
