lot more dynamic than the previous one

behind a lot of people think about the

behind a lot of people think about the
design<00:01:36.780> they<00:01:37.110> think<00:01:37.350> about<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.860> surface<00:01:38.610> just

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
design they think about the surface just

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.770 
design they think about the surface just
purely<00:01:39.619> so<00:01:40.619> styling<00:01:41.160> aspects<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.940> it<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:42.390> we

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
purely so styling aspects of it but we

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.450 
purely so styling aspects of it but we
see<00:01:42.960> designer<00:01:43.320> something<00:01:43.710> much<00:01:43.860> deeper<00:01:44.160> way

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
see designer something much deeper way

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.100 
see designer something much deeper way
we're<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.940> process<00:01:45.119> right<00:01:45.450> from<00:01:45.660> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
we're in the process right from the

mirrors in the new design we've we've

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.150 
mirrors in the new design we've we've
actually<00:02:15.120> taken<00:02:15.390> away<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:16.410> housing<00:02:16.890> to

actually taken away the housing to

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.490 
actually taken away the housing to
improve<00:02:17.519> the<00:02:17.790> direct<00:02:18.090> visibility<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.930> in

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
improve the direct visibility and in

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.930 
improve the direct visibility and in
doing<00:02:19.709> that<00:02:19.920> we<00:02:19.980> have<00:02:20.160> not<00:02:20.340> only<00:02:20.489> achieved

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
doing that we have not only achieved

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.940 
doing that we have not only achieved
excellent<00:02:21.630> functionality<00:02:22.320> but<00:02:22.620> we've<00:02:22.769> also

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
excellent functionality but we've also

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:34.120 
excellent functionality but we've also
achieved<00:02:23.549> a<00:02:23.640> very<00:02:24.000> characteristic<00:02:24.959> design

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.060 

for<00:02:34.880> me<00:02:35.060> it's<00:02:35.660> very<00:02:35.750> important<00:02:36.380> that<00:02:36.410> we<00:02:36.620> still

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
for me it's very important that we still

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.890 
for me it's very important that we still
keep<00:02:37.400> this<00:02:37.670> traditional<00:02:38.360> way<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.540> working

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
keep this traditional way of working

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.070 
keep this traditional way of working
play<00:02:39.830> both<00:02:40.460> in<00:02:40.700> scale<00:02:40.970> models<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.540> full<00:02:41.870> scale

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
play both in scale models and full scale

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.680 
play both in scale models and full scale
