00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.389 
and the six yard box it's gonna play
pretty<00:02:08.570> well<00:02:08.840> it's<00:02:09.320> obviously<00:02:09.649> gonna<00:02:09.860> be<00:02:09.979> very

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
pretty well it's obviously gonna be very

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.060 
pretty well it's obviously gonna be very
slippery<00:02:10.790> and<00:02:11.209> greasy<00:02:11.480> on<00:02:11.810> top<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:12.530> think

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
slippery and greasy on top and I think

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.520 
slippery and greasy on top and I think
that<00:02:13.310> makes<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.730> good<00:02:13.880> forward<00:02:14.269> play<00:02:14.530> Mike

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
that makes the good forward play Mike

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.590 
that makes the good forward play Mike
who<00:02:15.769> is<00:02:15.799> this<00:02:16.100> gonna<00:02:16.519> suit<00:02:16.850> if<00:02:17.030> anybody<00:02:17.420> these

who is this gonna suit if anybody these

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.360 
who is this gonna suit if anybody these
conditions<00:02:18.080> well<00:02:18.350> I<00:02:18.410> think<00:02:18.500> Liverpool<00:02:19.040> them<00:02:19.250> I

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.800

mean<00:02:19.760> Liverpool<00:02:20.209> a<00:02:20.239> very<00:02:20.450> professional

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
there I think it would take 10 minutes

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.449 
there I think it would take 10 minutes
for<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.780> game<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.140> settle<00:02:24.470> down<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:24.920> mean<00:02:25.250> it

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
for the game to settle down I mean it

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.310
