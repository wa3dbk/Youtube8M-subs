00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 Hello dear friends we are today 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.549
 let's talk in the next knives which was 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.700
 provided for review Novosibirsk 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.420
 shop knives blade be this knife 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.219
 mcnill companies 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.340
 called this knife mora 2000 then we 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.869
 will be in this case yes here and so 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:22.560
 2000 oranzh him so here in this 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.420
 case marking let's see 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.460
 because although he came out pretty 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.380
 for a long time on the channel I was not there and 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.869
 In general, it's pretty unusual even for 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.920
 those knives mura books that i'm the last 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.450
 time u watch means the first thing he doesn't 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.100
 I can say this on most account 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.980
 knives which did not happen to see in 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.950
 This knife on the sheath is made of leather 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.230
 suspension suspension semi free so to speak 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.120
 he bends but does not swing his sheath 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.449
 There are made such two metal 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.949
 riveted suspension good on leather belt 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.050
 hang is not scary ie skin is not 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.640
 the highest quality workmanship here 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.640
 so you can take a closer look 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.620
 but no less functional 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.879
 such rigid clamps and is tough 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.890
 skin that something needs to be prescribed 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:10.979
 order is free enough everything is convenient 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:14.090
 moves well plastic need and on 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.420
 them here and so has just written mura 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.430
 unsigned cliff 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.560
 all that stuff is made in Sweden need 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.930
 does have a wood type texture before 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.820
 bound well, just a drawing of such and such to you 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.090
 more harmful but now who is quite understandable 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.090
 like that 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.360
 2 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.939
 already two such large holes for the drain 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.689
 water well, it is clear that we are dealing with 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.180
 so bushcraft 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.680
 knife from famous Swedish 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.579
 letâ€™s own manufacturer 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.579
 mostly take a look 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.390
 so as not to run across impressions 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.920
 he will show me closer 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.729
 handle rubber plastic in the middle 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.710
 plastic to fight syria to the top too 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.450
 such a traditionally northern geometry 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.219
 right quite so simplistic so 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.530
 said such in traditionalism 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:03.819
 hitting very hard in this case 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:09.119
 that is, without modern technological 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:09.119
 or moments so here it all looks 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.220
 such geometry of the blade 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.989
 there the geometry case is very interesting 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.209
 there is additionally any stiffness 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.980
 he is here I think you can see it and you can see how 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.930
 it is organized that is, it turns out that 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.720
 from him sharply the knife begins to taper to 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.739
 the tip and from it is also a speech than here 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:36.160
 here it turns out he is betrayed not here and here 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.930
 so here's another and to the slopes so that's 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.510
 way he did on the descent of different 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.900
 size you can see here and says well I 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.819
 I will not be something that descend me project 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.060
 traditionally we need to frown 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.060
 there are no traces of carts 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.310
 In the grip the knife is convenient here in this regard 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.909
 everything is fine some difficulties too 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:11.500
 no cuts naturally without any 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:13.720
 hardship like say shall say 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.250
 so what about this geometry for me 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.799
 Said that generally produce on zippo 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.079
 positioned like that part that 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.209
 goes to stiffener here such for 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.099
 . that it is intended for heavy 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.530
 strict work on nothing but 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:29.620
 next half of the blade is practically 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.450
 provided by a very aggressive forest she 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.040
 in fact, it is a movie on a piece of paper 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.620
 then you start you try to understand 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.420
 that here is simply not something that he 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.099
 it cuts badly in this part 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.569
 just a friend what how would he cut 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.420
 even thinner, that is, you can make this 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.159
 work is quite a feature there is not very 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.750
 neatly cut there exactly this 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.639
 edge there in such and such with really 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.260
 cutting ability but this part 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:54.790
 knife it is even higher here but the knife itself 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.200
 and he showed giving a little bit going to 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.819
 my personal impressions personal 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.690
 I have such impressions not so long ago 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.090
 shot a knife review called mora 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.590
 bushcraft forest 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.410
 that's where it is used absolutely 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.819
 similar 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.470
 blade geometry is just as complicated 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.310
 how would she be absolutely the same to the nail 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:18.329
 the same length is exactly the same 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.289
 should say such a thing that 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.870
 really nice to see that 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:25.750
 mora company they develop as it were 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.419
 gradually there is such a moment that 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.889
 for the next knife with a similar geometry 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.020
 blade made in my opinion more 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.849
 lucky hilt here on course more 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.240
 bright it's a plus yes you don't like it 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:39.520
 lose but there is made sorry for 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.889
 other sounds in the frame there made 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.080
 such a better emphasis under the fingers 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.789
 Here in my personal opinion there grip 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.139
 it feels a little more 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.970
 I do not want to say by grip 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.849
 here is something bad here with a hilt too 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.539
 everything is good but there is a handle made yet 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.889
 more convenient this moment of course 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.930
 so very pleased me that is clear 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.240
 what is now considering buying here 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.669
 some kind of knife like that 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.580
 the geometry of the company moorea I would probably 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.469
 still chose to buy this knife 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.990
 but nevertheless this knife is produced 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:13.000
 it has been around for quite a while 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.010
 a million test reviews all sorts of all different 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.990
 this can be seen and how to understand what 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.450
 here is this blade geometry which then 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.400
 engineers have developed so let's say under here 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.320
 this knife is really very good 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.260
 very working in this plan right cool 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.090
 here on again considering the general 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.130
 fairly low cost of this knife 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.110
 I'm honest and I can not say Shostak 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.240
 how much is it in Russia but it seems to me 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.979
 that its price is less than two thousand rubles 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.210
 at least until that wall so suspect 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:42.520
 that of similar complexity and quality you 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.719
 this knife for the price of the tire is nothing 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.940
 this is most likely not get 

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:47.800
 so march 2000 to have a knife like that 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.349
 interesting if you are interested in 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.120
 our inexpensive one 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:54.909
 can be used for some 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.279
 tampl exit if there are some yes in the fields 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:59.740
 and somewhere there for some kind of work 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:01.659
 on wood if you need it and how 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.330
 picnic knife at the same time 

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:06.250
 get along fine then it seems to me that pestilence 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.650
 2000 still worth considering 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.570
 although I repeat that in my opinion personally 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.690
 moore's companies now with this geometry 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:16.719
 there are even more successful knives which 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:19.120
 called mora bushcraft train such 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:20.349
 I personally hope my subjective opinion 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.150
 that you were interested 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:24.150
 thank you very much for watching bye
