00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:11.580
 today we make this beautiful mackerel 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.900
 stuffed the fish already naturally 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.869
 gutted we will now try to open it 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.670
 to be able to fill it then instead of 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.380
 open it regularly of the part of 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.060
 above we enter below to try to 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.230
 open it as much as possible but here it is 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.680
 always leaning over you see we are 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.030
 above the central spine 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.129
 I will use the knife in reverse 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.170
 way to cut the thorns here it is 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.780
 let's try to remove these thorns like this 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.510
 evident if we can't do it by hand 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.399
 let's take some scissors 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.329
 help 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:01:00.109
 here we also remove these two fins 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.109
 they don't even serve here 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:07.869
 new open but without seeing it is not 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.820
 but the central thorn because it is anyway 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.820
 important also because it has a lot of flavor 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:22.000
 here's knows fish and ready 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:25.049
 we begin to prepare the filling of 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.570
 dry crumbled parsley bread 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:33.929
 garlic parmesan of the vinegar noceto lo 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:40.630
 we use immediately we put it 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:43.210
 in the bread a little oil you see it 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.319
 bread is practically already completely 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.159
 softened we take a bit of garlic and a 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.190
 bit of parsley 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.069
 let 's try to chop it even so 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:58.179
 coarse but it need not be 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:02:04.720
 too late July instead well teleterni 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:07.420
 a little bit more than here is here 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.970
 we put everything in here we take the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.220
 Parmesan say we put a couple 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.220
 of spoons we mix everything 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:23.260
 add a bit of salt very well to 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.709
 this point we can fill ours 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.150
 fish 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:30.160
 so we open it we take it 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.629
 squeeze hard with your hands see how 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.250
 it compacts as if it were a kind of 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.420
 meatloaf so don't worry in 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.700
 this case is here to do it too 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.560
 precise because then later we will go to 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.269
 then close the excess quantity 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.269
 she went out alone here 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:57.139
 at this point we take kitchen thread 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:06.290
 and we begin to tie the fish we leave 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:12.349
 from here here we make a nice little bow 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:15.499
 decorative here you see is not necessary 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:19.280
 do it too tight anyway 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:20.780
 even if some of the stuffing will come out not 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.689
 nothing happens 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.959
 Here is our fish made 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:31.790
 it's practically ready to be 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:34.340
 informed let's take a cut there 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.909
 we put a little bit of oil and there 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.629
 we can 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:46.969
 our fish another thread of oil over 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:53.259
 so it rises and now I will inform this fish 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:56.840
 for about 15 minutes at 180 190 degrees 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:57.590
 look how wonderful it really is 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.509
 very beautifull 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.799
 and in my opinion also a sin to put it 

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:07.930
 in the plate then passages la 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:07.930
 directly from here good airy sorrel 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:21.660
 here is the meat we presumed to spin 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:21.660
 and a bit of filling this morning 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.280
 really good
