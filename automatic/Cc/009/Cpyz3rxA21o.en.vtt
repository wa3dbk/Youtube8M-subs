00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
lariat to be and the lariat fastens by

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.090 
lariat to be and the lariat fastens by
passing<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> ends<00:01:56.909> through<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:58.500> brushed

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
passing the ends through that brushed

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.459 
passing the ends through that brushed
silver<00:01:59.430> loop<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.540> might<00:02:00.750> want<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> try<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.320> on

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
silver loop you might want to try it on

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.380 
silver loop you might want to try it on
your<00:02:01.649> neck<00:02:01.890> at<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.219> stage<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.790> just<00:02:02.969> decide

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
your neck at this stage and just decide

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.719 
your neck at this stage and just decide
how<00:02:03.659> long<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.930> want<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.500> be<00:02:04.680> because<00:02:05.340> you

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
how long you want it to be because you

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.880 
how long you want it to be because you
can<00:02:05.909> wear<00:02:06.119> these<00:02:06.390> shorter<00:02:07.320> at<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.680> nape<00:02:07.860> of

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890

your neck or you
can<00:02:08.950> wear<00:02:09.160> it<00:02:09.310> much<00:02:09.490> longer<00:02:09.759> if<00:02:10.149> you<00:02:10.180> want<00:02:10.539> to

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
can wear it much longer if you want to

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.840 
can wear it much longer if you want to
and<00:02:11.020> you<00:02:11.440> can<00:02:11.470> then<00:02:11.800> trim<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.460> leather<00:02:12.640> at

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
and you can then trim the leather at

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.910 
and you can then trim the leather at
this<00:02:13.030> stage<00:02:13.330> depending<00:02:13.810> on<00:02:14.080> how<00:02:14.350> what<00:02:14.620> long

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
this stage depending on how what long

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.100 
this stage depending on how what long
you<00:02:15.100> want<00:02:15.310> your<00:02:15.400> finished<00:02:15.520> lariat<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.450> be<00:02:16.630> but

ball pins and the pretty fire polish
beads<00:03:37.620> thread<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.799> fire<00:03:39.130> polished<00:03:39.489> bead<00:03:39.700> onto

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
beads thread a fire polished bead onto

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.690 
beads thread a fire polished bead onto
the<00:03:40.630> ball<00:03:40.930> pin<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.470> then<00:03:41.890> you<00:03:41.980> want<00:03:42.190> to<00:03:42.280> make<00:03:42.519> a

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
the ball pin and then you want to make a

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.630 
the ball pin and then you want to make a
loop<00:03:43.090> using<00:03:43.660> your<00:03:43.840> round<00:03:44.110> nose<00:03:44.230> pliers<00:03:44.440> so<00:03:45.160> the

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
loop using your round nose pliers so the

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.600 
loop using your round nose pliers so the
way<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:45.790> do<00:03:46.000> this<00:03:46.360> is<00:03:46.630> I<00:03:46.810> grip<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.860> head<00:03:48.310> pin

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
way I do this is I grip the head pin

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.940 
way I do this is I grip the head pin
just<00:03:48.970> above<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.450> bead<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:49.959> create<00:03:50.560> a<00:03:50.590> little

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
just above the bead and create a little

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.570 
just above the bead and create a little
bend<00:03:51.459> in<00:03:51.700> the<00:03:51.850> head<00:03:52.000> pin<00:03:52.239> and<00:03:52.480> then<00:03:52.630> use<00:03:53.019> the

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
bend in the head pin and then use the

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.060 
bend in the head pin and then use the
round<00:03:54.580> nose<00:03:54.760> pliers<00:03:55.090> as<00:03:55.299> a<00:03:55.360> former<00:03:56.110> to<00:03:56.410> pull

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
round nose pliers as a former to pull

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.640 
round nose pliers as a former to pull
the<00:03:57.430> head<00:03:57.850> pin<00:03:58.090> around<00:03:58.269> to<00:03:58.840> make<00:03:59.080> that<00:03:59.380> loop

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
the head pin around to make that loop

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.940 
the head pin around to make that loop
and<00:03:59.920> then<00:04:00.600> reposition<00:04:01.600> your<00:04:02.110> pliers<00:04:02.170> and<00:04:02.590> just

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
and then reposition your pliers and just

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.640 
and then reposition your pliers and just
take<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.459> ball<00:04:04.420> pin<00:04:04.690> right<00:04:04.930> underneath<00:04:05.350> and

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
take the ball pin right underneath and

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.069 
take the ball pin right underneath and
you've<00:04:05.739> got<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:05.950> nice<00:04:06.280> neat<00:04:06.670> loop<00:04:07.150> there<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:07.780> at

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
you've got a nice neat loop there and at

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.560 
you've got a nice neat loop there and at
this<00:04:08.320> stage<00:04:08.680> what<00:04:09.010> you<00:04:09.160> can<00:04:09.340> do<00:04:09.549> is<00:04:09.820> take<00:04:10.209> that

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
this stage what you can do is take that

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.910 
this stage what you can do is take that
little<00:04:11.290> loop<00:04:11.860> and<00:04:12.040> slip<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:13.480> chain<00:04:13.799> onto<00:04:14.799> that

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
little loop and slip the chain onto that

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.969 
little loop and slip the chain onto that
loop<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.750> now<00:04:16.750> what<00:04:16.959> you<00:04:17.049> want<00:04:17.229> to<00:04:17.349> do<00:04:17.500> is<00:04:17.799> to

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
loop and now what you want to do is to

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.190 
loop and now what you want to do is to
take<00:04:18.160> your<00:04:18.340> chain<00:04:18.700> nose<00:04:18.729> pliers<00:04:19.359> and<00:04:20.039> you

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
take your chain nose pliers and you

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.410 
take your chain nose pliers and you
to<00:04:21.440> grip<00:04:22.070> the<00:04:22.250> loop<00:04:22.430> you've<00:04:22.610> just<00:04:22.820> made<00:04:23.030> and

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
to grip the loop you've just made and

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.400 
to grip the loop you've just made and
just<00:04:24.200> finish<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:24.800> off<00:04:25.040> by<00:04:25.360> wrapping<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:27.170> end

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
just finish it off by wrapping the end

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.210 
just finish it off by wrapping the end
of<00:04:27.710> the<00:04:27.800> ball<00:04:28.010> pin<00:04:28.390> around<00:04:29.390> that<00:04:30.380> just

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
of the ball pin around that just

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.800 
of the ball pin around that just
underneath<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.880> base<00:04:32.060> of<00:04:32.270> that<00:04:32.300> loop<00:04:32.630> and

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
underneath the base of that loop and

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.600 
underneath the base of that loop and
then<00:04:33.050> you<00:04:33.170> can<00:04:33.380> use<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:33.770> cutters<00:04:34.160> just<00:04:34.460> to
