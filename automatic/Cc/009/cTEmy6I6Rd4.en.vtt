receivers is really touched down and the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.130 
receivers is really touched down and the
receiving<00:01:39.509> touchdown<00:01:39.930> alone<00:01:40.170> his<00:01:40.320> hand<00:01:40.560> POI

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
receiving touchdown alone his hand POI

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.380 
receiving touchdown alone his hand POI
not<00:01:41.830> even<00:01:41.950> including<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.370> RTG<00:01:42.940> we<00:01:43.060> get<00:01:43.270> too

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
not even including the RTG we get too

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.930 
not even including the RTG we get too
wasted<00:01:43.510> here<00:01:43.900> so<00:01:44.550> that<00:01:45.550> would<00:01:45.670> read<00:01:45.820> never

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
wasted here so that would read never

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.219 
wasted here so that would read never
thought<00:01:46.210> of<00:01:46.330> it<00:01:46.390> that<00:01:46.450> way<00:01:46.570> how<00:01:46.780> quickly<00:01:47.020> this

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
thought of it that way how quickly this

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:49.230 
thought of it that way how quickly this
a<00:01:47.380> joker<00:01:47.800> and<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.130> extra<00:01:48.550> point<00:01:48.700> makes<00:01:48.820> it<00:01:49.060> 11

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
a joker and the extra point makes it 11

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.870 
a joker and the extra point makes it 11
points<00:01:49.690> evidently<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:51.250> essentially<00:01:51.640> he<00:01:51.729> can

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
points evidently so essentially he can

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.910 
points evidently so essentially he can
have<00:01:51.970> an<00:01:52.060> 11<00:01:52.390> point<00:01:52.570> play<00:01:52.869> yes<00:01:53.440> yard<00:01:53.770> at<00:01:53.890> a

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
have an 11 point play yes yard at a

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.399 
have an 11 point play yes yard at a
lower<00:01:54.159> point<00:01:54.430> play<00:01:54.720> plus<00:01:55.720> yards<00:01:55.930> so<00:01:56.320> you

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
lower point play plus yards so you

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:06.340 
lower point play plus yards so you
probably<00:01:56.440> have<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:56.800> 12<00:01:57.070> 13<00:01:57.520> 14<00:01:57.700> 20<00:01:59.009> sack

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350
