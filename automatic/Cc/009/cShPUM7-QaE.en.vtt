00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.009
 how about youtube friends are 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.509
 welcome to a new video tutorial on 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:20.840
 this video tutorial I'm going to show you 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:26.029
 how can you create partitions with 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:30.020
 fat file systems for 32 x of 2 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.480
 3 and 4 among other file systems 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.120
 rather for that we're going to use the 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.640
 program called mini tour partition 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.530
 professional wizard in this case I already 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.820
 I have here a memory which I am going to 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.070
 use for this example and that memory 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.930
 is this removable disk that would be a 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:53.180
 usb memory of 1.85 gigabytes that 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.190
 it would be two gigabytes and good 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.110
 here we see that it shows us then the 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.079
 amount of space available in those 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.870
 in that memory that would be 1.85 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:07.230
 gigabytes 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:09.270
 well once this is done let's start 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.990
 first of all we have to eliminate them 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.760
 the partitions that we have or the or 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.590
 memory unit that we have we have 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.840
 to eliminate that file system that 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.270
 have so what you have 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.970
 what to do is a backup of 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.200
 your files before doing this well 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.520
 once they made their copy of 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.410
 security let's eliminate then 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.260
 right now we do not have any 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:34.740
 partition in no file system 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.860
 let's click here then on create 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.870
 to create then the first partition 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.630
 let's put first and let's 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.910
 select here fat32 or some other 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.430
 system that you want and this one is going to 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.520
 be for the main memory could be 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.840
 say well the main partition and we're going 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.990
 to put in this case I'm going to put 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.870
 windows for what 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.610
 let's recognize better then all this 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.890
 once this is done we will modify 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.650
 here the amount of memory that goes to 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:11.340
 have the then this partition 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:15.019
 and let's go I'm going to put it at about 1.30 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.690
 so they are roughly 500 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.760
 megabytes that I'm going to leave then in the 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.240
 second partition are already the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.620
 windows parameters in it 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.230
 as bold law as the name 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:34.310
 here then it will be primary and the system 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.599
 of files for 32 I click on ok and I 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.200
 I have the first partition here that is 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.360
 1.30 gigabytes 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.099
 and in the bottom part I have one that does not 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.709
 has still format has not yet 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.739
 format or file system I'm going to give 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:53.519
 click here in big and here it appears 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:58.530
 a message this message says that the 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:03:01.290
 new partition can not be used 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:04.400
 in windows because windows only 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.019
 recognizes the first partition 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.640
 on a disc or a removable unit 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.349
 I'm going to click yes because it does not matter 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.299
 I do not recognize windows while 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.670
 recognize for example my device 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:20.629
 android with the link to sd application 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.159
 for it is more than enough and well let 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.780
 to put then here the name I would 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:24.829
 I'm going to impose android but first before 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:30.859
 to put the name we are going to do is 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:32.209
 have this and the x3 format or the or some 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.920
 another format that you need 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.319
 seems to appear some other system of 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.000
 files can select me be 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.829
 because it works very well for me in 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.470
 Android with this application I'm going to 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.170
 put then here android I already have 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.349
 now the playball or the name tag 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.290
 from android and here we do not modify it 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:53.439
 nothing we leave it as it is 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.269
 so that we can occupy the space that already 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:58.340
 we established him or let him let's give 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.860
 click ok 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:06.080
 and then we have the system now 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.459
 of ext3 files and fat 32 this is going to 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.250
 be the main one and this is going to be the 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:13.099
 secondary we're going to click here on 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.810
 apply so that it begins to convert or 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.060
 do the partitions since by avoiding 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.250
 we also have it in a visual way but 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.930
 they really are not created yet 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.449
 that we give you click here in the 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.130
 beach we click on the beach and then 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:28.340
 tells us here that if we really want 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.960
 apply the changes we click on yes and 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.139
 We wait for you to start applying the 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.139
 changes 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.240
 depending on the amount of memory 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.150
 that you have in your memory usb or 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.090
 micro sd it will take more time in 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.760
 process or in applying the changes good 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.920
 here we already have a little window that 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.990
 says all pending changes 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:55.890
 have been applied 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.380
 satisfactorily we are going to click here 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.790
 in ok 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:06.770
 and now we have then here the 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:08.180
 main that would be fat32 at 1.30 and on 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.130
 android that I would use it with the 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:15.969
 ext3 file system I already have it in 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.860
 572 megabytes 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:20.919
 if we go to the windows explorer 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.860
 we can notice here that he has also 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:27.159
 decreased the amount he had to 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:30.099
 it had 1.87 or something like that of gigabytes and 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:32.199
 now I only have 1.29 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:34.269
 gigabytes obviously I recommend this 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:37.059
 that they do it with a memory of greater 

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:40.119
 storage capacity as could 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:43.419
 be an 8 gb memory or maybe one of 

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:46.360
 16 but well that will be a matter of 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:49.509
 each of his decision in which 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.089
 are going to apply and from the usb memory of 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:53.259
 what they have then is in which they 

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:56.409
 they are going to apply but I know what 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:58.209
 I recommend in one of 8GB are 16 and 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:00.549
 well here we already have the two files and 

00:05:58.209 --> 00:06:03.399
 by the way if you realize then for 

00:06:00.549 --> 00:06:06.159
 if the other does not recognize me the other 

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:08.259
 partition only recognizes me the 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:10.389
 first and that said it in a little message 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:12.459
 here in a small window that only 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:16.599
 is going to recognize the first partition the 

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:18.710
 second not to part xt3 does not recognize it from 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:21.500
 per hundred windows 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.550
 but if I had another face here because 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.550
 nothing else would recognize this one 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.260
 and when friends and friends would be everything 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.380
 this video tutorial I hope it is 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.500
 of utility this this information and this 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.570
 procedure and that they can do it in their 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.010
 usb or micro sd memory or where you 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.340
 they will apply it I hope that they 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:44.290
 work and remember to like this 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.500
 video and share it with your friends and 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.210
 He also liked scribes to the channel and 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.490
 let me comment at the bottom of 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:54.730
 this video to know your opinion about 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.980
 of this video tutorial that will be all I 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.230
 I say goodbye remember this is generating 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:03.780
 bits and I'll wait for you in the next 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.780
 video tutorial until next time
