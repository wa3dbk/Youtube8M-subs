00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:08.080
 friends this video is for beginners 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.449
 constructors here that put 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.190
 need for computer 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:20.410
 his processor and speakers they can be 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:24.220
 any color so if you don't have you 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:27.880
 can you take another sheep 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.630
 here here first you will arrange drag 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.310
 once again push and build first where 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.160
 device will remove for such a buy horizontal bar 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.160
 im a platform and fasten 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:48.040
 it's already a hundred and take gone so thin 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:50.230
 cube we leaf through it from here we already 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:57.000
 get a stop then take this one 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:01:01.270
 detail and trusted here is set and 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:08.009
 fasten them then take this item 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:12.219
 you can have it from the cake minifigures 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:15.850
 then fastens them and it turns out 

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:21.909
 computer and fasten it here now 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:26.189
 the computer is now the countries are straight speakers 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:31.090
 so here is such a detail and just such 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:33.609
 bind them however the eye is ready and 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:38.969
 also take the following two parts and 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:38.969
 we also fasten them here 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:49.900
 and it turns out at the column they are not only 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:54.250
 crowns but they still don't give a computer 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:58.460
 computer bend to the maximum and 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.670
 wanting when to sit on this this is 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.250
 the distance between the eyes of the little man who 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:09.680
 can not spoil the winter 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:11.510
 now we are making a processor with such 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.930
 things that 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.470
 insert disk take it like that 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:23.660
 such two Circuits put their ranks are ready 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:27.080
 we take 2 yellow shading and put them here 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:31.130
 ready to take the green empty and steel 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:35.570
 here and we put then we take this 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:40.300
 detail and put the label well here then 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:44.360
 take this part and put it like this 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:48.860
 then this story here and here you can 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:53.480
 insert a disk like this 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:03:01.209
 terrible disk stable and as if this 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:01.209
 game to the edge sits and chopped into the computer 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.380
 meetings yet
