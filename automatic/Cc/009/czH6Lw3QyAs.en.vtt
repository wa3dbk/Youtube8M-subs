00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.419
 the rhythm center back and jordi that 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.579
 always well located with good technique 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:32.070
 with freshness also what happens is 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.680
 that jefferson's income was also 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.530
 for him it does let's say you lose the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.530
 value that this boy has that does not have 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.390
 nor 90 minutes have you just completed 15 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.390
 endings and threads 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.450
 This is 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.730
 stella 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.649
 of chávez that entered another well was placed 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.880
 in the middle above jefferson tips 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.960
 when he entered 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.960
 this is a very 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.360
 a change of 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.360
 of rhythm and goes to the arch 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.830
 the right time not because the ball is 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.970
 he's left but he got him on the ground only 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.590
 this is a great game 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.450
 look I have grown up a lot I was in 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.870
 portugal to good is stronger 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.870
 physically 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.850
 barely comes to a vividness just enters 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.590
 a liveliness of youtube with freshness 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.869
 that he has because he touches the ball 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.600
 above you can claim that if the lateral 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.119
 it was from one side to another but look at the boat 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.460
 it helps him throw it over 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.780
 the goalkeeper tried but he does not come and 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.330
 Then he would come with a couple of moves 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.610
 more one to one of jefferson and one last 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.039
 from christopher gonzález that may be the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.289
 fourth goal there is something that has to 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.270
 see with confidence with the moment with 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:08.850
 the security that a player can feel 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.850
 from security 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.030
 of the confidence that a 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.380
 player and it's the first play the 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.840
 first queen play on the day of 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.330
 Chile , a classification match to 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.680
 first move of gonzález click the 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.350
 ball for a goal or is there a theme of 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.180
 confidence and freshness that is 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.190
 coinciding with the plays that have 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.890
 we leave thanks for having us 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.440

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.070
 Ecuador before Paraguay immediately here 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.070
