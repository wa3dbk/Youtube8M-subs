rack this one is I think I did like 10

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:07.969 
rack this one is I think I did like 10
to<00:02:05.369> 12<00:02:06.060> inches<00:02:06.390> from<00:02:06.599> the<00:02:06.689> surface<00:02:07.049> down<00:02:07.080> the

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
to 12 inches from the surface down the

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.490 
to 12 inches from the surface down the
SPS<00:02:08.429> one<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:09.030> will<00:02:09.660> probably<00:02:09.989> have<00:02:10.110> up<00:02:10.289> around

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
SPS one I will probably have up around

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.130 
SPS one I will probably have up around
this<00:02:10.709> region<00:02:10.950> here<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.660> will<00:02:12.870> slide<00:02:13.080> over

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
this region here so this will slide over

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.770 
this region here so this will slide over
here<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:14.160> new<00:02:14.340> Rack<00:02:14.519> will<00:02:14.549> be<00:02:14.849> about<00:02:15.060> here<00:02:15.480> and

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
here the new Rack will be about here and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.690 
here the new Rack will be about here and
I'm<00:02:16.410> gonna<00:02:16.500> probably<00:02:16.709> position<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.400> test<00:02:17.610> a

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
I'm gonna probably position the test a

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.780 
I'm gonna probably position the test a
little<00:02:17.760> bit<00:02:17.940> more<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.920> videos<00:02:19.920> left<00:02:20.280> so

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.310 
little bit more to the videos left so

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
the SPS are directly underneath that I

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.390 
the SPS are directly underneath that I
obviously<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.709> letters<00:02:22.980> don't<00:02:23.100> need<00:02:23.310> all
