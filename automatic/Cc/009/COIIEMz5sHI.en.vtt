00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.490
 of the creators of the ghost girl if 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.890
 have not seen it yet we summarize the 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.330
 story an innocent person enters 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.310
 an elevator and when they close 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.410
 doors suddenly the light stops 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.230
 operate the cabin is dark 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.749
 and a ghostly girl clinging to a 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.060
 diabolical doll goes into action emulates 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:22.249
 be a ghost and the poor innocent dry 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.630
 and I wish I was anywhere else 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.630
 less in the elevator 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.450
 well today that elevator joker 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.310
 comes back to life and never better said 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.920
 because tastes start when a few 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.660
 men leave a coffin inside and leave 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.760
 with the excuse of collecting the crown of 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.740
 flowers when they are about to enter 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.400
 the interior the doors close and 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.400
 the trip begins 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.020
 the elevator separates 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.020
 they are overwhelmed 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.260
 but it gets worse when the cause 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.260
 half opens and the dead man is left to his fate 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.929
 until suddenly I eat 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.929
 comes alive 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.370
 shouting 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.810
 more screams 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.320
 epileptic movements 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.049
 Again here 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.490
 again over there 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.490
 we shout a duet 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.979
 and feet for what I love you
