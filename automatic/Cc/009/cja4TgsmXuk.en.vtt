00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 Tell me, guys, one more Friday. 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.839
 Emotional day here in the apple world 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.940
 I'm already recording my house and the little one. 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.500
 Previous video I will not be able to record anymore 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.160
 in the car and I will not stand bullshit 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.389
 let's not go straight to the fourth and last 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.789
 part of this administration 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:24.060
 God bless, see you next week 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:27.359
 one more of you and do not throw it in our 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.939
 last subject is fights guy here you go 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.529
 have to be male even though it is not 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.540
 everyone who can do this does not 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.610
 remember the first pedro verse 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.290
 37 that I said there at the beginning of that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.180
 part speaks of the woman with the most part 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.070
 fragile then I have for myself that this 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.780
 more practical part means that it is 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.489
 much more emotional you should already have 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.950
 perceived we already commented on it 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.010
 There is no fight from a couple that 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.800
 She left because she's hurt because 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.399
 is more emotional and will open affects a lot 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.870
 that 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.180
 in the middle of the fight really that people 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.329
 it becomes more emotional to open 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.550
 if it is already out of reason and enters the emotion 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.320
 and you start to say words that 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.270
 You did not even want to say that you're not even 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.210
 reality in your heart and woman leave 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.250
 much much more injured than you 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.479
 man and that's why you have it 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.540
 To solve this 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.780
 that is you, man always has to give 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.680
 first step in reconciliation will 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.200
 speak 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.520
 But sometimes she's guilty so she 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.450
 have to talk to me 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:32.040
 Okay, now give yourself a boost in this pride and 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.770
 For love, for love, this woman will go 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.350
 start the reconciliation without I know it 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.420
 very difficult especially if you are in the 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.310
 your vision to identify who she is who 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.740
 is wrong but let me explain one 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.380
 thing the fact that you go to it gives 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.899
 beginning of reconciliation does not mean that 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.090
 you are wrong what you weak of 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.610
 history means that you as this 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.009
 woman loves to leave aside 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.680
 all pride all worry for 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.689
 reconcile to bring peace to this 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.570
 relationship is not about Thursday 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.850
 Right what 's wrong is love 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.280
 a relationship does not have anyone else 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.179
 weak or who is wrong who is right 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.750
 the two have to walk 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.629
 Ephesians in chapter 5 verse 25 says 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.879
 next husbands voice to may yours 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:22.060
 women as well as christ loved 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.530
 church and even gave himself for it 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.859
 Then I ask you who gave the first 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.200
 step in reconciliation because it 's jesus 

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:32.139
 so my friend you have to be like 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.819
 Jesus and love this woman and give 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:36.519
 first step ever 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.489
 Jesus is our greatest example of 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:42.099
 relationship and reconciliation is 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.250
 through him we come to God and are 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.379
 through him that we learn to 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.500
 to reconcile in love inspire in him 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:52.209
 beat him but he still loved 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.260
 exactly what you need to do 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.209
 with your wife 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.219
 now the woman does not 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.989
 because this is your responsibility 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:01.269
 I also told you what woman likes 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.370
 not a man but a man too 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.010
 Do you like women, and not of a bitch? 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.139
 then that does not use you then woman 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.870
 when you can reconcile 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:12.459
 be with your boyfriend boyfriend your husband the 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.010
 man go in search of reconciliation 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.139
 when you stepped on the ball does not mean 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.709
 that you are right and that he is 

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.379
 wrong 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.669
 means that he loves you above error 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.970
 What did you just commit? 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:28.090
 Then my dear ones, let us be like Jesus. 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.470
 reflect the love of the grace of Jesus on 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.299
 our whole and I hope the spirit 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.060
 holy has spoken in your heart god 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.579
 Bless you powerfully, we speak 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.590

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:48.549
