00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.660
 Well, it is with us 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.990
 president of herbalife mister michael 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.990
 johnson 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:17.530
 displays is this crisis that is 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:22.620
 affecting consumers by all 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:26.370
 sides as it has affected your business 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:29.760
 in the last quarter of 2008 we received 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:32.430
 a blow like everyone there was a 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.550
 decline in the market in general the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.340
 people did not want to spend they were nervous 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.070
 for the car so we had a quarter 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.780
 difficult in 2008 we have been 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.650
 recovering quite well in the past 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.650
 months of the year 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.030
 they will see it very soon 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.579
 we think that the year will end very 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.899
 well better than last year 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.899
 in quantitative terms 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.950
 that is a trend for growth 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:09.210
 of sales in the us and in america 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.520
 latina and why 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.740
 we have what we can say 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:20.369
 two latin markets the one in america 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.369
 Latino and the Latino audience in the USA 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.870
 which is growing very well and we are 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.740
 working very well 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:31.220
 the model is being exported 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.440
 Installing in the USA 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:40.370
 people are using the drinks the 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.680
 infusions the vitamins products in the 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.900
 home your friends come the problems the 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.950
 you know so you're had a model 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.960
 of growth for us 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.840
 mexico came to usa and one from asia and from 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.380
 latin america and it's been something 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.760
 Extremely successful for us like this 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.640
 that if the market in general in states 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.230
 united has slowed down a little we have 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.750
 noticed growth trends in the 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:09.710
 last three or four years including 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.830
 this year it is possible considering that the 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.960
 Latin market in the USA 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.630
 has been more affected than the rest of 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:22.880
 the population because of unemployment in the 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.620
 crisis in general good sounds like 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.820
 I was selling I must be careful 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.270
 but the reality is that this product 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.670
 that we have this this shake is 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:37.970
 nutritious and people for less than two 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:42.350
 dollars has a nutritious product with 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:46.610
 a good caloric balance a nutritious 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:49.940
 so in these times where pay two 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.310
 dollars for food is generous enters 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.320
 this product so in the context 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.870
 social is a product is very well 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.840
 positioned has been well received in the 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.740
 Latin market and those concepts have been 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.120
 combined quite well 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.310
 how big the business in 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.310
 latin america ' compared to the rest 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.750
 of the world latin america is 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.850
 probably a quarter of 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.180
 our business 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.490
 I could give you exact numbers later 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.160
 but when one considers business 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.930
 Latinos in the USA is most of the 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.790
 growth of our business the 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.920
 Spanish- speaking population is after 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.240
 the population that speaks English and 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.400
 We hope that the distributors in 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.710
 learn a little about the model 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.380
 that's why I came to Atlanta we hope 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:40.460
 that this extends a bit more because 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:43.370
 you think that's the way I think it's based on 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.780
 the model applied in mexico the 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.940
 distributors have penetrated their 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.270
 communities we have seen these 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.760
 opportunities have been accepted by the 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.810
 Latino community the speaking community 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.849
 Hispanic very well 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.030
 it is a model with which they feel 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:03.180
 culturally comfortable is something that 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.610
 It works that is very warm is something very 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.370
 social and then there 's the factor 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.050
 nutritional circumstances 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.610
 economic and all this seems to work 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.010
 very well 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.739
 so this has incorporated the model 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.910
 in the USA in the Hispanic population in the USA 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:24.540
 and it has taken off interesting 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.040
 you manufacture your products 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.180
 directly and if so, have 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.980
 operations of this type in america 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.270
 latina ' 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.340
 we have our own 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.690
 manufacturing plants in the south of 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.650
 california in china and we subcontract to 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.990
 manufacturers in other places if we want 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.980
 do it in latin america 'plans 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:47.160
 concrete not as these markets 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.400
 grow up it's good to have 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.290
 manufacture in the market within that 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.900
 market to work in a more environment 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.380
 local more controlled in the countries better 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.380
 that in others 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.240
 maybe the biggest market is 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:04.189
 mexico but what would be the market more 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.639
 active latin american the greatest 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:06.639
 It is Mexico 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.140
 it's something unusual for many companies 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.570
 but they have a lot of competition if in 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.910
 Mexico we have many competitions but 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:23.010
 we are very strong in the country 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:26.600
 certainly say a little about the 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:29.990
 future where are they heading 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.270
 well we are concentrating on having 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.990
 the best foods in the world and 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.810
 improve those nutritional supplements 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:42.200
 that we have we want to have supplements 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.900
 of calcium with better flavor and we want 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:47.090
 use this drink this shake as the 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.420
 central core beverage product 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:53.360
 incorporate hydration supplements 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.360
 calcium and enrich it in other ways 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.430
 we always look for alternatives so 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.870
 people are in better shape and are 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:05.240
 better fed and the actions of 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.360
 herbalife have increased 36 percent in 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.920
