00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.180
 The pond is drying gil 15 minutes ago 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.510
 nonstop 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:17.520
 This is going to end badly. We need to get her out. 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:19.080
 these calculations are very difficult 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.080
 I'm thinking of going to the library. 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.440
 to study later is the library is a 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.510
 Wonderful place to study and to 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.320
 put knowledge in the brain to which 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.120
 I mean if you have one, that's all. 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.460
 You'll be drying the face for almost a 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.200
 That's all you can say. 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:43.230

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:48.380

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.720

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.240
 find the source at three o'clock 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:40.390
 the morning I left clear in 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.390
 snow 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.680
 have to leave 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.550
 nor as for your proof the teacher 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.850

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.170
 parents about it because the union of peace and 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.000
 I wish they will take ages 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.680
 paraná of ​​the technique called for a 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.230
 meeting of parents and creatures for good 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.450

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.960

 I know what we will do 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.180
 Then I had an idea of ​​everything he 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.560

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.600

 did not come back dressed like the drag queen in 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.020
 meeting of good creature parents does not have 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.570
 what to expect to find out how much you 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.940
 It's bad that I know you were trying 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.710
 help but if I was going to reflect before now 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.110
 you kicked out 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.440

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.900
 the next 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.330
 do not be surprised if they do not applaud 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:52.650
 links a very difficult number and of course 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:56.330
 but I'm natura am in good luck because 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.330
 you will need 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.850
 this lot on this moon 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.400
