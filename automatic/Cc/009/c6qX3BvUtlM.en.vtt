it's kind of dry but I guess that's what

the<00:00:40.960> butters<00:00:41.230> for<00:00:41.559> there's<00:00:41.980> also<00:00:42.190> going<00:00:42.519> to<00:00:42.640> be

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
the butters for there's also going to be

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:45.959 
the butters for there's also going to be
butter<00:00:43.510> as<00:00:43.960> we<00:00:44.920> all<00:00:45.039> know<00:00:45.160> you<00:00:45.219> add<00:00:45.550> butter<00:00:45.879> to

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
butter as we all know you add butter to

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.040 
butter as we all know you add butter to
something<00:00:46.510> that<00:00:47.579> thing<00:00:48.579> becomes<00:00:48.820> good<00:00:49.149> next

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
something that thing becomes good next

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.680 
something that thing becomes good next
step<00:00:50.079> you<00:00:50.559> peel<00:00:51.010> it<00:00:51.039> if<00:00:51.429> I<00:00:51.579> had<00:00:51.789> a<00:00:51.820> peeler<00:00:52.449> of

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
step you peel it if I had a peeler of

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.709 
step you peel it if I had a peeler of
any<00:00:52.899> sort<00:00:53.289> I<00:00:53.469> would<00:00:53.530> use<00:00:53.859> that<00:00:53.890> but<00:00:54.699> I'm<00:00:55.480> going

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
any sort I would use that but I'm going

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.259 
any sort I would use that but I'm going
to<00:00:55.780> use<00:00:55.929> this<00:00:56.500> put<00:00:57.100> a<00:00:57.160> little<00:00:57.339> more<00:00:57.489> wasteful

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
to use this put a little more wasteful

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.180 
to use this put a little more wasteful
kinda<00:00:58.899> doesn't<00:00:59.079> matter<00:00:59.350> because<00:00:59.530> I<00:00:59.710> have

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
kinda doesn't matter because I have

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.669 
kinda doesn't matter because I have
nothing<00:01:00.280> invested<00:01:00.699> in<00:01:01.210> this<00:01:01.390> squash<00:01:01.839> if<00:01:02.469> it

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
nothing invested in this squash if it

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.280 
nothing invested in this squash if it
turns<00:01:02.710> out<00:01:03.010> terrible<00:01:03.609> I<00:01:03.850> can<00:01:04.659> just<00:01:04.780> make<00:01:04.989> some

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
cup to me might be might be more than a

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.209 
cup to me might be might be more than a
quarter<00:03:01.250> cup<00:03:02.199> but<00:03:03.199> this<00:03:03.379> is<00:03:03.560> definitely<00:03:03.829> at

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:04.219 
quarter cup but this is definitely at

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:05.920 
quarter cup but this is definitely at
least<00:03:04.250> a<00:03:04.579> quarter<00:03:04.760> cup<00:03:05.030> this<00:03:05.510> is<00:03:05.629> just<00:03:05.750> a

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
least a quarter cup this is just a

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.349 
least a quarter cup this is just a
terrifying<00:03:06.680> experiment<00:03:07.430> anyway<00:03:07.760> so<00:03:07.819> if

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
terrifying experiment anyway so if

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.459 
terrifying experiment anyway so if
things<00:03:09.019> didn't<00:03:09.349> go<00:03:09.469> wrong<00:03:09.709> yeah<00:03:11.409> okay<00:03:12.409> so

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:12.469 
things didn't go wrong yeah okay so

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:14.800 
things didn't go wrong yeah okay so
there<00:03:12.829> we<00:03:12.859> go<00:03:12.949> get<00:03:13.310> a<00:03:13.340> butter<00:03:13.699> and<00:03:14.060> our<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:14.659> can

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
there we go get a butter and our you can

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.439 
there we go get a butter and our you can
eat<00:03:14.930> salt<00:03:15.409> to<00:03:15.859> add<00:03:16.699> some<00:03:16.939> salt<00:03:17.269> here<00:03:18.040> is<00:03:19.040> to

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:19.449 
eat salt to add some salt here is to

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.210 
eat salt to add some salt here is to
sprinkle<00:03:20.449> a<00:03:20.720> little<00:03:20.930> bit<00:03:21.139> of<00:03:21.169> salt<00:03:21.680> on<00:03:21.979> there

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
sprinkle a little bit of salt on there

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.969 
sprinkle a little bit of salt on there
that's<00:03:22.879> probably<00:03:23.090> have<00:03:23.359> self<00:03:23.629> can<00:03:24.500> always<00:03:24.709> add

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:24.979 
that's probably have self can always add

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:28.030 
that's probably have self can always add
salt<00:03:25.579> later<00:03:25.939> next<00:03:26.840> if<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.109> stir<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:27.590> all

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
salt later next if you stir it all

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.729 
salt later next if you stir it all
around<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:29.000> already<00:03:29.359> is<00:03:29.509> looking<00:03:30.109> pretty<00:03:30.409> good

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
around it already is looking pretty good

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.580 
around it already is looking pretty good
pretty<00:03:31.159> nice<00:03:31.489> I<00:03:31.909> just<00:03:32.750> kept<00:03:32.930> stirring<00:03:33.319> it

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
pretty nice I just kept stirring it

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.749 
pretty nice I just kept stirring it
around<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:35.000> get<00:03:35.150> all<00:03:35.299> that<00:03:36.189> butter<00:03:37.189> and<00:03:37.489> sugar

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:37.759

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
another step that I forgot to mention is

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.110 
another step that I forgot to mention is
that<00:04:37.150> you<00:04:37.389> take<00:04:37.600> them<00:04:37.900> out<00:04:38.460> midway<00:04:39.460> through<00:04:39.790> to

that you take them out midway through to

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.710 
that you take them out midway through to
flip<00:04:40.540> them<00:04:40.750> over<00:04:40.840> I<00:04:42.300> kind<00:04:43.300> of<00:04:43.389> forgot<00:04:43.660> about

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
flip them over I kind of forgot about

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.430 
flip them over I kind of forgot about
that<00:04:43.960> step<00:04:44.490> but<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:46.570> smoke<00:04:46.810> alarm<00:04:47.139> did

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
that step but the the smoke alarm did

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.590 
that step but the the smoke alarm did
not<00:04:47.620> forget<00:04:48.070> about<00:04:48.130> that<00:04:48.370> step<00:04:48.880> flipping<00:04:49.479> over

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
not forget about that step flipping over

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.810 
not forget about that step flipping over
these<00:04:49.870> little<00:04:50.229> cubes<00:04:50.740> is<00:04:51.190> very<00:04:51.550> tedious

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
these little cubes is very tedious

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.360 
these little cubes is very tedious
there's<00:04:52.810> all<00:04:52.900> this<00:04:53.080> sugar<00:04:53.440> so<00:04:54.040> it's<00:04:54.220> all

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
there's all this sugar so it's all

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.230 
there's all this sugar so it's all
sticking<00:04:54.820> to<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.530> pan<00:04:56.530> though<00:04:57.100> the<00:04:57.310> butter<00:04:57.790> is

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
sticking to the pan though the butter is

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.540 
sticking to the pan though the butter is
is<00:04:58.720> helping<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.440> situation<00:04:59.680> because<00:05:00.400> there

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
is helping the situation because there

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.550 
is helping the situation because there
is<00:05:00.669> so<00:05:00.910> much<00:05:01.060> better<00:05:01.270> I'm<00:05:01.510> glad<00:05:01.690> I<00:05:01.810> used<00:05:02.169> so

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
is so much better I'm glad I used so

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:08.340 
is so much better I'm glad I used so
much<00:05:02.740> butter<00:05:03.039> use<00:05:03.850> a<00:05:03.880> lot<00:05:04.210> of<00:05:04.240> butter<00:05:07.320> so<00:05:08.320> I

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
much butter use a lot of butter so I

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.770 
much butter use a lot of butter so I
will<00:05:08.740> see<00:05:08.979> you<00:05:09.010> another<00:05:09.220> in<00:05:09.639> another<00:05:09.780> 20

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
will see you another in another 20

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.350 
will see you another in another 20
minutes<00:05:10.990> and<00:05:11.260> we'll<00:05:11.410> get<00:05:11.560> to<00:05:11.680> taste<00:05:11.889> this<00:05:12.360> ok

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
minutes and we'll get to taste this ok

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.200 
minutes and we'll get to taste this ok
so<00:05:13.690> it's<00:05:14.139> it<00:05:14.500> hasn't<00:05:14.889> been<00:05:15.010> quite<00:05:15.400> as<00:05:15.699> long<00:05:15.970> as

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
so it's it hasn't been quite as long as

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.860 
so it's it hasn't been quite as long as
I<00:05:16.330> thought<00:05:16.630> it<00:05:16.810> would<00:05:16.840> be<00:05:17.220> but<00:05:18.449> the<00:05:19.449> stove<00:05:19.690> is

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
I thought it would be but the stove is

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.290 
I thought it would be but the stove is
smoking<00:05:20.320> a<00:05:20.410> lot<00:05:20.530> it's<00:05:21.070> probably<00:05:21.550> time<00:05:21.789> to<00:05:21.850> get

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
smoking a lot it's probably time to get

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.510 
smoking a lot it's probably time to get
the<00:05:22.630> squash<00:05:22.990> out<00:05:23.289> of<00:05:23.440> the<00:05:23.530> oven<00:05:23.650> I<00:05:24.010> hope<00:05:24.400> I

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
the squash out of the oven I hope I

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.250 
the squash out of the oven I hope I
don't<00:05:24.580> set<00:05:25.360> up<00:05:25.479> the<00:05:25.630> smoke<00:05:25.870> alarm<00:05:26.169> because

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
don't set up the smoke alarm because

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:40.400 
don't set up the smoke alarm because
it's<00:05:26.470> annoying<00:05:26.770> but<00:05:27.720> whoa<00:05:29.370> okay<00:05:31.680> there<00:05:32.680> we<00:05:32.770> go
