00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:14.929
 this exhibition tells the context in 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:17.300
 which it is one of the most originated figures 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.800
 important even more revolutionary ones if 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.570
 we want the history of painting 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.449
 modern ie gustav klimt 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.039
 the context is a context above all 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.099
 training but also a context 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.349
 familiar with a context of relationships with 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.210
 figures that participated precisely 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.530
 to the construction of the imaginary that 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.699
 then climiti has known in a brilliant way 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.559
 carry on and build through 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.110
 a series of works that actually have it 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.309
 delivered to the history of painting of the 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.780
 last century 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.610

 museum that at the belvedere of vienna that 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:52.699
 retains most of the works of 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.900
 clint is in fact allows all 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.970

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.350
 contact with the most extraordinary works 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.960
 of klimt but also to know them 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.790
 the origin of reconstructing those that 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.229
 have been to what was the 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.280
 genesis of his own thought 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.689
 pictorial 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.580
 at the center of this exhibition itinerary 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.500
 there is the only reconstruction 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.240
 authorized reconstruction of the frieze 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.580
 dedicated to beethoven 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.530
 another key figure in the pantheon 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.870
 precisely of the art creators they have 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.460
 constituted the reference element 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.810
 so important for the genesis of 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.810
 thought of klimt's work
