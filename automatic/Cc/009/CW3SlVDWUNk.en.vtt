00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
that is either an artificial head placed

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.120 
that is either an artificial head placed
behind<00:00:19.429> my<00:00:19.730> head<00:00:20.560> there<00:00:21.560> are<00:00:21.589> very<00:00:21.859> nice

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
artificial heads they recreate exactly

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.890 
artificial heads they recreate exactly
what<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:28.070> human<00:00:28.369> ear<00:00:28.909> hears<00:00:29.269> it's<00:00:29.539> actually

on<00:00:31.669> it<00:00:31.820> and<00:00:31.909> the<00:00:31.970> mics<00:00:32.180> are<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:32.599> mics<00:00:32.780> are

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
on it and the mics are the mics are

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.510 
on it and the mics are the mics are
inside<00:00:33.200> that<00:00:33.230> here<00:00:33.560> yes

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
inside that here yes

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.620 
inside that here yes
it<00:00:35.330> looks<00:00:35.480> very<00:00:35.690> futuristic<00:00:36.110> and<00:00:37.330> so<00:00:38.330> I<00:00:38.360> use

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
it looks very futuristic and so I use

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.270 
it looks very futuristic and so I use
that<00:00:38.870> as<00:00:39.080> a<00:00:39.110> core<00:00:39.350> mic<00:00:39.590> a<00:00:39.680> very<00:00:39.860> often<00:00:40.160> that

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
that as a core mic a very often that

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.030 
that as a core mic a very often that
gives<00:00:40.490> you<00:00:40.880> a<00:00:40.910> really<00:00:41.360> great<00:00:41.780> overall<00:00:42.590> sound

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
gives you a really great overall sound

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.070 
gives you a really great overall sound
and<00:00:43.520> I<00:00:43.640> usually<00:00:44.000> place<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.420> core<00:00:44.630> mic<00:00:44.810> about

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
and I usually place the core mic about

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.600 
and I usually place the core mic about
here<00:00:45.320> just<00:00:45.560> under<00:00:45.770> the<00:00:45.890> snare<00:00:46.160> between<00:00:46.520> the

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
here just under the snare between the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.220 
here just under the snare between the
snare<00:00:46.820> at<00:00:46.940> the<00:00:47.030> kick<00:00:47.180> drum<00:00:47.420> so<00:00:47.990> you<00:00:48.050> get<00:00:48.200> a

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
snare at the kick drum so you get a

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.380 
snare at the kick drum so you get a
really<00:00:48.530> nice<00:00:48.770> near<00:00:49.220> ambience<00:00:49.670> you<00:00:49.940> know<00:00:50.120> from

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
really nice near ambience you know from

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.000 
really nice near ambience you know from
all<00:00:50.540> the<00:00:50.690> Tom's<00:00:50.900> the<00:00:51.530> snare<00:00:51.800> and<00:00:51.830> the<00:00:51.980> kick

drum it's a real you know beefy sounding

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.630 
drum it's a real you know beefy sounding
you<00:00:55.970> know<00:00:56.120> technique<00:00:56.660> it's<00:00:56.900> very<00:00:57.640> powerful

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
you know technique it's very powerful

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.240 
you know technique it's very powerful
and<00:00:59.240> everything<00:01:00.050> I<00:01:00.110> also<00:01:00.230> use<00:01:00.470> closed<00:01:00.710> miking

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
and everything I also use closed miking

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.130 
and everything I also use closed miking
on<00:01:01.580> every<00:01:01.880> instrument<00:01:02.180> I<00:01:02.450> don't<00:01:02.630> like<00:01:02.810> I<00:01:02.990> mean

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
on every instrument I don't like I mean

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.509 
on every instrument I don't like I mean
it<00:01:03.230> depends<00:01:03.470> on<00:01:03.560> the<00:01:03.680> session<00:01:03.980> of<00:01:04.100> course<00:01:04.339> in

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
it depends on the session of course in

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.249 
it depends on the session of course in
many<00:01:04.670> cases<00:01:05.119> we<00:01:05.210> just<00:01:05.420> use<00:01:05.540> two<00:01:05.720> mics<00:01:05.960> and

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
many cases we just use two mics and

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:08.770 
many cases we just use two mics and
maybe<00:01:06.799> a<00:01:06.890> kick<00:01:07.100> mic<00:01:07.340> or<00:01:07.520> just<00:01:07.850> you<00:01:08.299> know<00:01:08.420> one

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
maybe a kick mic or just you know one

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.719 
maybe a kick mic or just you know one
microphone<00:01:09.259> for<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:09.499> whole<00:01:09.619> kit<00:01:09.890> depends<00:01:10.640> on

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
microphone for the whole kit depends on

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.849 
microphone for the whole kit depends on
the<00:01:10.820> station<00:01:11.149> if<00:01:11.270> it's<00:01:11.450> jazz<00:01:11.719> or<00:01:12.079> something<00:01:12.829> a

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:12.859 
the station if it's jazz or something a

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:14.109 
the station if it's jazz or something a
little<00:01:12.920> more<00:01:13.070> acoustic<00:01:13.490> it's<00:01:13.850> always<00:01:14.090> a

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
little more acoustic it's always a

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.580 
little more acoustic it's always a
different<00:01:14.539> technique<00:01:14.810> than<00:01:15.049> if<00:01:15.170> it's<00:01:15.289> a<00:01:15.380> rock

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
different technique than if it's a rock

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.679 
different technique than if it's a rock
thing<00:01:16.219> but<00:01:16.579> one<00:01:16.850> thing<00:01:17.030> this<00:01:17.149> may<00:01:17.359> be<00:01:17.420> a<00:01:17.569> little

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
thing but one thing this may be a little

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.200 
thing but one thing this may be a little
signature<00:01:18.249> is<00:01:19.249> and<00:01:19.609> I've<00:01:19.700> done<00:01:19.850> that<00:01:19.969> on<00:01:20.060> many

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
signature is and I've done that on many

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.649 
signature is and I've done that on many
recordings<00:01:20.869> with<00:01:21.170> pop<00:01:21.590> artists<00:01:22.159> is<00:01:22.850> that<00:01:23.420> I

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
recordings with pop artists is that I

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.419 
recordings with pop artists is that I
used<00:01:24.259> to<00:01:24.700> play<00:01:25.700> a<00:01:26.210> track<00:01:26.780> with<00:01:27.740> acoustic<00:01:28.159> drums

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:28.429 
used to play a track with acoustic drums

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:32.499 
used to play a track with acoustic drums
and<00:01:29.319> then<00:01:30.319> play<00:01:31.249> it<00:01:31.280> again<00:01:31.549> with<00:01:31.789> electronic

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
and then play it again with electronic

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.739 
and then play it again with electronic
drums<00:01:32.630> and<00:01:33.369> we<00:01:34.369> play<00:01:34.909> every<00:01:35.149> fill<00:01:35.420> everything

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:35.749 
drums and we play every fill everything

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:37.389 
drums and we play every fill everything
exactly<00:01:36.229> the<00:01:36.319> same<00:01:36.530> it's<00:01:36.740> usually<00:01:36.859> a<00:01:37.039> really

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
exactly the same it's usually a really

everything exactly identical then I
replay<00:01:48.920> that<00:01:49.069> again<00:01:49.340> with<00:01:49.869> electronic<00:01:50.869> drums

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
replay that again with electronic drums

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.419 
replay that again with electronic drums
and<00:01:52.030> we<00:01:53.030> take<00:01:53.409> electronic<00:01:54.409> drum<00:01:54.679> signals<00:01:55.249> for

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
and we take electronic drum signals for

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.749 
and we take electronic drum signals for
the<00:01:55.549> basically<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.749> the<00:01:57.350> attacks<00:01:57.920> we<00:01:58.399> get<00:01:58.579> the

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
the basically the the attacks we get the

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.010 
the basically the the attacks we get the
electronic<00:01:59.179> sounds<00:01:59.420> but<00:01:59.539> we<00:01:59.569> use<00:01:59.840> the

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
electronic sounds but we use the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.129 
electronic sounds but we use the
acoustic<00:02:00.590> ambience<00:02:01.429> and<00:02:01.700> overheads<00:02:02.179> and<00:02:02.810> that

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:03.139 
acoustic ambience and overheads and that

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:06.969 
acoustic ambience and overheads and that
gives<00:02:03.950> a<00:02:04.039> really<00:02:04.399> nice<00:02:04.639> modern<00:02:05.509> you<00:02:06.229> know<00:02:06.259> a

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
gives a really nice modern you know a

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.259 
gives a really nice modern you know a
feel<00:02:07.850> that<00:02:08.780> sounds<00:02:09.319> almost<00:02:09.800> program<00:02:10.789> but<00:02:11.060> then

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
feel that sounds almost program but then

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.179 
feel that sounds almost program but then
it<00:02:11.510> isn't<00:02:11.689> you<00:02:11.989> can<00:02:12.170> tell<00:02:12.349> it's<00:02:12.590> it's<00:02:12.950> got<00:02:13.159> a

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:13.189 
it isn't you can tell it's it's got a

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:14.150 
it isn't you can tell it's it's got a
human<00:02:13.580> edge<00:02:13.760> too

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
human edge too

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.310 
human edge too
human<00:02:14.670> feel<00:02:14.850> to<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.630> get<00:02:15.750> those<00:02:15.960> really

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320

kind<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.650> impactful<00:02:17.430> direct<00:02:17.910> electronic

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
kind of impactful direct electronic

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.780 
kind of impactful direct electronic
sounds<00:02:18.750> but<00:02:19.230> with<00:02:19.380> you<00:02:19.860> know<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.190> breath<00:02:20.430> and

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
sounds but with you know the breath and

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.460 
sounds but with you know the breath and
the<00:02:20.970> air<00:02:21.330> moving<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:21.930> an<00:02:22.020> acoustic

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
the air moving of an acoustic

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.130 
the air moving of an acoustic
performance<00:02:22.970> because<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.150> ambience<00:02:24.900> mics

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
performance because of the ambience mics

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.080 
performance because of the ambience mics
that<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:25.950> put<00:02:26.310> on<00:02:26.400> top<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.730> but

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
that I that you put on top of that but

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.580 
that I that you put on top of that but
because<00:02:27.120> everything<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.840> identical<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.380> all

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
because everything is identical it all

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.650 
because everything is identical it all
matches<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.610> works<00:02:29.760> out<00:02:29.940> beautifully<00:02:30.270> it

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
matches and it works out beautifully it

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.360 
matches and it works out beautifully it
sounds<00:02:30.900> very<00:02:31.310> modern<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.640> powerful<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:33.300> think
