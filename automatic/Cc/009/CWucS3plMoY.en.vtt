can do yellow claw across the lakes but

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.900 
can do yellow claw across the lakes but
sometimes<00:03:36.000> there's<00:03:36.239> just<00:03:36.269> no<00:03:36.540> gold<00:03:36.810> there<00:03:37.049> so

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
sometimes there's just no gold there so

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.819 
sometimes there's just no gold there so
you<00:03:38.910> can<00:03:39.060> do<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:39.239> if<00:03:39.299> you<00:03:39.420> want<00:03:39.660> if<00:03:39.900> if<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.739> have

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
no competition then they'll probably be

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.400 
no competition then they'll probably be
some<00:03:42.690> there<00:03:43.019> so<00:03:43.440> let's<00:03:44.130> get<00:03:44.250> started
