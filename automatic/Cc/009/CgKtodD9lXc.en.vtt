00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
composition so far how is nobody able to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.380 
composition so far how is nobody able to
crack<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:40.890> yet<00:00:41.129> um<00:00:41.670> well<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> lot<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.180> teams

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
crack this yet um well a lot of teams

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.959 
crack this yet um well a lot of teams
just<00:00:42.570> crack<00:00:42.750> about<00:00:42.870> banning<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.700> is<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
just crack about banning it is that the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.240

only<00:00:45.090> way<00:00:45.270> uh<00:00:45.660> there's<00:00:46.590> other<00:00:46.770> ways<00:00:46.920> but<00:00:47.219> I

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
only way uh there's other ways but I

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.740 
only way uh there's other ways but I
just<00:00:47.520> don't<00:00:47.640> think<00:00:47.760> teams<00:00:48.059> like<00:00:48.270> are<00:00:48.420> used<00:00:48.600> to

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
just don't think teams like are used to

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.090 
just don't think teams like are used to
it<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.989> don't<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.260> practice<00:00:49.530> against<00:00:49.950> any

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
it you don't really practice against any

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.680 
it you don't really practice against any

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
only one in a day so we just kind of

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.740 
only one in a day so we just kind of

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.780 
objectives to win the game this game was
different<00:01:25.950> than<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> last<00:01:26.159> game<00:01:26.430> we<00:01:26.549> play<00:01:26.670> for

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
different than the last game we play for

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.280 
different than the last game we play for
his<00:01:26.880> complexity<00:01:27.330> because<00:01:27.479> we<00:01:27.600> weren't<00:01:27.780> as<00:01:28.049> far

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
his complexity because we weren't as far

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.920 
his complexity because we weren't as far
behind<00:01:28.549> so<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.909> definitely<00:01:30.270> thought<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.750> we

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
behind so I definitely thought that we

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.710 
behind so I definitely thought that we
would<00:01:31.079> um<00:01:31.229> we<00:01:31.740> would<00:01:31.860> be<00:01:31.950> able<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.250> go<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.820> get

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
would um we would be able to go in get

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.300 
would um we would be able to go in get
it<00:01:33.810> get<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.140> get<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.500> baron<00:01:34.799> early<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.250> were

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
it get it get a baron early and we were

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.499 
it get it get a baron early and we were
just<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.549> planning<00:01:35.850> that<00:01:35.970> ever<00:01:36.150> since<00:01:36.360> like

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
just like planning that ever since like

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.330 
just like planning that ever since like
six<00:01:37.170> minutes<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.799> waiting<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.159> timing

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
six minutes just waiting for the timing

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.190 
six minutes just waiting for the timing
window<00:01:38.700> there<00:01:39.150> was<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> point<00:01:39.659> where<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.020> guys

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
we just wanted them to think that we're

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.770 
we just wanted them to think that we're
backing<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.700> tried<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.240> make<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.390> look<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.600> I

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
backing I tried to make it look like I

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.850 
backing I tried to make it look like I
was<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:55.020> running<00:01:55.170> into<00:01:55.350> like<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> other

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
was like running into like the other

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.289 
was like running into like the other
side<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.159> jungle<00:01:56.340> maybe<00:01:56.579> towards<00:01:56.939> mid<00:01:57.090> and

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
side of the jungle maybe towards mid and

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.149 
side of the jungle maybe towards mid and
then<00:01:57.719> we<00:01:57.840> just<00:01:58.020> all<00:01:58.170> like<00:01:58.439> went<00:01:58.710> for<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.890> Baron

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
then we just all like went for the Baron

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.100 
then we just all like went for the Baron
I<00:01:59.340> had<00:01:59.460> max<00:02:00.119> consume<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.659> had<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> blue<00:02:00.960> buff

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
I had max consume and I had a blue buff

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.510 
I had max consume and I had a blue buff
then<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.500> can<00:02:01.680> actually<00:02:01.950> do<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.189> really

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
then so I can actually do it really

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
with me we can take that parent out in

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.499 
with me we can take that parent out in
like<00:02:08.069> 30<00:02:08.280> seconds<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.879> that's<00:02:09.119> what<00:02:09.239> ended<00:02:09.390> up

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
that we were just able to have so much

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.660 
that we were just able to have so much
momentum<00:03:15.740> we<00:03:16.100> just<00:03:16.250> pretty<00:03:16.370> much<00:03:16.520> had<00:03:16.640> a

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
teams numbers why are you able to just

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.390

mind<00:03:29.210> game<00:03:29.390> them<00:03:29.570> so<00:03:29.750> hard<00:03:29.930> I<00:03:30.230> really<00:03:31.160> wish<00:03:31.250> I

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
mind game them so hard I really wish I

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.560 
mind game them so hard I really wish I
knew<00:03:31.550> that<00:03:31.580> if<00:03:31.850> I<00:03:31.910> knew<00:03:32.090> that<00:03:32.120> we<00:03:32.390> probably

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
knew that if I knew that we probably

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.970 
knew that if I knew that we probably
wouldn't<00:03:32.870> be<00:03:32.960> losing<00:03:33.110> all<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:33.560> bottom<00:03:33.800> teen

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.940 
have armor and I'm maxed conceived at
this<00:04:17.030> point<00:04:17.239> so<00:04:17.600> we<00:04:17.960> go<00:04:18.080> into<00:04:18.230> the<00:04:18.350> fight<00:04:18.530> we

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
this point so we go into the fight we

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.920 
this point so we go into the fight we
catch<00:04:19.190> Ackerman<00:04:19.670> and<00:04:19.820> from<00:04:20.030> there<00:04:20.180> we<00:04:20.720> just

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
catch Ackerman and from there we just

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.480 
catch Ackerman and from there we just
know<00:04:21.049> he's<00:04:21.230> dead<00:04:21.380> so<00:04:21.500> we<00:04:21.590> just<00:04:21.770> called<00:04:22.220> go<00:04:22.370> go

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
know he's dead so we just called go go

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.250 
know he's dead so we just called go go
go<00:04:22.640> go<00:04:22.760> go

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
go go go

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.710 
go go go
I<00:04:23.380> think<00:04:24.010> cop<00:04:24.430> actually<00:04:24.880> bouts<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.300> wall<00:04:25.480> gets

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
I think cop actually bouts the wall gets

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.540 
I think cop actually bouts the wall gets
behind<00:04:25.870> them<00:04:26.230> and<00:04:26.380> we're<00:04:26.680> end<00:04:26.860> up<00:04:26.950> we're<00:04:27.250> at<00:04:27.340> we

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
behind them and we're end up we're at we

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.340 
behind them and we're end up we're at we
just<00:04:27.730> close<00:04:27.940> them<00:04:28.120> in<00:04:28.240> and<00:04:28.390> just<00:04:28.480> start<00:04:28.720> wiping

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
just close them in and just start wiping

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.470 
just close them in and just start wiping
the<00:04:29.620> floor<00:04:29.710> with<00:04:29.830> them<00:04:30.040> we<00:04:30.400> got<00:04:30.550> a<00:04:30.580> one<00:04:31.060> kill<00:04:31.270> on

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
the floor with them we got a one kill on

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.600 
the floor with them we got a one kill on
to<00:04:31.630> like<00:04:31.750> Morgana<00:04:32.080> tres<00:04:32.710> resets<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.190> jump<00:04:33.430> I

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
to like Morgana tres resets the jump I

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.490 
to like Morgana tres resets the jump I
think<00:04:33.820> flashes<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.360> wall<00:04:34.540> kills<00:04:35.110> me<00:04:35.260> silly

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
think flashes the wall kills me silly

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.650 
think flashes the wall kills me silly

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
against TSM because it's very likely

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.170 
against TSM because it's very likely
that<00:04:56.680> is<00:04:57.010> that<00:04:57.400> is<00:04:57.550> one<00:04:57.670> of<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:57.790> teams<00:04:58.030> you

that is that is one of the teams you
will<00:04:58.300> face<00:04:58.570> perhaps<00:04:59.020> in<00:04:59.290> the<00:04:59.350> first<00:04:59.560> round<00:04:59.830> of

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
will face perhaps in the first round of

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.500 
will face perhaps in the first round of
the<00:05:00.220> playoffs<00:05:00.430> so<00:05:01.180> what<00:05:01.360> are<00:05:01.420> you

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
specifically looking to learn from that

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.850 
specifically looking to learn from that
game<00:05:03.550> tomorrow<00:05:04.060> um<00:05:04.480> there's<00:05:05.380> a<00:05:05.470> lot<00:05:05.620> of<00:05:05.650> time

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
game tomorrow um there's a lot of time

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.610 
game tomorrow um there's a lot of time
between<00:05:06.040> now<00:05:06.880> and<00:05:07.060> playoffs<00:05:07.390> so<00:05:07.600> we're<00:05:08.590> just

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
between now and playoffs so we're just

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.230 
between now and playoffs so we're just
going<00:05:08.860> to<00:05:08.920> go<00:05:09.040> into<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.280> game<00:05:09.490> trying<00:05:09.850> to<00:05:10.030> win

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
going to go into the game trying to win

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.270 
going to go into the game trying to win
so<00:05:10.570> that<00:05:10.720> maybe<00:05:10.900> we<00:05:11.020> can<00:05:11.140> get<00:05:11.290> like<00:05:11.500> a<00:05:11.680> a

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
so that maybe we can get like a a

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.460 
so that maybe we can get like a a
different<00:05:12.940> spot<00:05:13.810> in<00:05:13.960> the<00:05:14.020> playoffs<00:05:14.110> may<00:05:14.410> be

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
different spot in the playoffs may be

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.960 
different spot in the playoffs may be
the<00:05:14.560> fourth<00:05:14.740> or<00:05:14.860> fifth<00:05:15.010> seed<00:05:15.220> we're<00:05:15.700> a<00:05:15.730> lot

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
the fourth or fifth seed we're a lot

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.150 
the fourth or fifth seed we're a lot
more<00:05:16.000> confident<00:05:16.600> again<00:05:17.020> to<00:05:17.140> dig<00:05:17.350> and<00:05:17.590> CLG<00:05:17.860> than

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
more confident again to dig and CLG than

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.770 
more confident again to dig and CLG than
we<00:05:18.250> are<00:05:18.280> against<00:05:18.610> TSM<00:05:18.790> for<00:05:19.150> some<00:05:19.300> reason<00:05:19.630> they

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
we are against TSM for some reason they

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.310 
we are against TSM for some reason they
just<00:05:19.960> read<00:05:20.110> us<00:05:20.260> better<00:05:20.440> than<00:05:20.530> other<00:05:20.890> teams<00:05:21.190> so

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
just read us better than other teams so
