 [Music] 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:27.689
 so I like photography because you 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.710
 gives time to warp and that's that 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.680
 she is also like a fairy 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.840
 thing a bit political 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.780
 a defense of boredom that is very 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.740
 different from tedium the boredom of 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.740
 how to be able to be 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.820
 and what I like in photography 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.090
 first that is a very easy technique that 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.880
 It's something I like 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.040
 akbar so I like to say that 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.440
 is how is a technique is very easy not 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.280
 I need to be like everything 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.320
 a writer 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.750
 hours not sitting alone like this 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.220
 looking for something but I'm all the 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.420
 time I have all the time 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.810
 possibility of doing in a 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.810
 thing 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.640
 [Music] 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.170
 from the magazine 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.020
 and when they look like 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.969
 I like the punch 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.380
 it's the same strength when I say of the blog 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:26.380
 which is through the frames 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.750
 in many works in the same malba I 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.880
 I think all the walls 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.770
 the groups how the human being armed 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.770
 in thematically 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.799
 interesting that is the visual grace and 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:46.799
 that life 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.409
 [Music] 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.670
 the article as a caregiver emerges 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.670
 or choose 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.610
 [Music] 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.990
 I like finding would also 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.990
 a thousand votes more 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.830
 but the title to me for example made me 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.770
 think of a house and a statement 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.060
 said policy if state and pink 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.430
 also on the blog 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.200
 why 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.269
 let her say it of voice but not what 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.819
 think now the actors one always 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:38.010
 think we are 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:42.920
 It happens that there is so much talk about me 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:46.840
 [Music] 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:55.150
 I like to be recognized by another but only 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:55.150
