00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
you're like really banging on it like

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.830 
you're like really banging on it like
crazy<00:01:22.110> train<00:01:22.530> or<00:01:22.619> something<00:01:22.909> but<00:01:23.909> other<00:01:24.689> than

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
crazy train or something but other than

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.530 
crazy train or something but other than
that<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.619> basic<00:01:26.270> holds<00:01:27.270> up<00:01:27.390> this

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
that it's just a basic holds up this

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.800 
that it's just a basic holds up this
holds<00:01:28.170> up<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.290> drums<00:01:29.240> next<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
holds up the drums next to that the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.200 
holds up the drums next to that the
drums<00:01:33.229> pretty<00:01:34.229> good<00:01:34.439> they<00:01:35.040> have<00:01:35.250> good<00:01:35.520> sensors

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
drums pretty good they have good sensors

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.840 
drums pretty good they have good sensors
on<00:01:37.110> them<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.860> pretty<00:01:38.159> much<00:01:38.250> anywhere<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:38.700> get

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
on them so pretty much anywhere you get

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.830 
on them so pretty much anywhere you get
them<00:01:39.000> they<00:01:39.780> will<00:01:40.079> register<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.680> fast<00:01:41.659> they<00:01:42.659> may

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
them they will register it fast they may

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.289 
them they will register it fast they may
have<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.350> gelatin<00:01:43.680> rubber<00:01:44.009> stuff<00:01:44.299> so

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
have this like gelatin rubber stuff so

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.929 
have this like gelatin rubber stuff so
the<00:01:45.540> noise<00:01:47.030> is<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.570> bad<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:50.310> lot<00:01:50.700> better

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
the noise is not that bad a lot better

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.499 
the noise is not that bad a lot better
than<00:01:51.240> some<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.509> other<00:01:51.659> drum<00:01:51.930> sets<00:01:52.280> so

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
than some of the other drum sets so

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.609 
than some of the other drum sets so
pretty<00:01:54.509> good<00:01:54.570> lead<00:01:55.759> and<00:01:57.020> I<00:01:58.020> think<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:58.320> coolio

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
pretty good lead and I think it's coolio

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.620 
pretty good lead and I think it's coolio
live<00:01:58.860> like<00:01:59.040> cool<00:01:59.310> sword<00:01:59.549> different<00:01:59.850> noise<00:02:00.000> to

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
live like cool sword different noise to

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.330 
live like cool sword different noise to
them<00:02:01.729> next<00:02:02.729> thing<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.979> didn't<00:02:04.979> even<00:02:05.070> know<00:02:05.219> it

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
them next thing I didn't even know it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.600 
them next thing I didn't even know it
came<00:02:05.460> with<00:02:05.640> these<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.060> these<00:02:06.180> little<00:02:06.390> tiny
