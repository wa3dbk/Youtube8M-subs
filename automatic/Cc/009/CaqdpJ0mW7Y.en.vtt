00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.680
 the hit of number 1 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.220
 in the exchanged it is the search of the attack shot in forehand 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.969
 the force striker 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.969
 he does with the forehand 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.230
 the search for investments is very important 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.949
 the player is looking for 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.949
 advance in the ball advance well in the ball 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.829
 here 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:34.330
 advance well in the ball 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.990
 ok now we're going to have three backhands three straight strokes for 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.050
 based division 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.050
 with the outermost is advanced 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.170
 advance to the net after the pulp the rights and that's the push of the foot 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.679
 law 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.599
 who throws the player forwards the net and goes to the net 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.310
 it's perfect 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.330
 the technique 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.520
 basic attack forehand 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.940
 at the gestural level 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.670
 barakett it's pretty much the same you have to pay attention to maybe 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.620
 put a little bit more of the uefa 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.270
 you are more forward in the short and the distance is a little shorter long 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.630
 be careful also at the net but anyway the footwork will do 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.840
 the difference ie whenever you can they did like 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.440
 federate one you place the left foot in front and we advance by a push 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.730
 on the left foot that already takes you in the direction of the net to 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.380
 you choose then if you want to continue to the net or not by 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.600
 against when you are on the outside very often you can not find your 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.560
 supports perfect so you will look for a good position of the right foot and this 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.870
 right foot propels you forward either directly in the wake or 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.220
 in modern tennis where players 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.580
 even more charming with a start of the right foot that launches you 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.250
 in the direction of the nets 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.250
 and the arm technique I recommend it to you 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.149
 thirteen be careful watch the ball 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.559
 because if you decided to attack 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.790
 presumably you'll take the ball sooner after the rebound and more 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:17.209
 you take a ball early after the robot plus the refocusing and delicate 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.499
 so at impact and he's well looking at the ball for sixteen hours 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:24.649
 start to get excited that's very important it's important for all 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:27.649
 couples 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.359
 look there watch the ball you hear 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.590
 all coaches 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.089
 all the teachers ask this laminate thing worse 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:38.099
 there are two points 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.400
 very important the first most important point is while you for 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.580
 place that your opponent will hit 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.630
 it's time 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.710
 you your visual attention is at its maximum 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.500
 because your opponent is going to play it right to play it left at the 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.060
 to play 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.050
 he played bass 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.709
 you must have it was and unpublished adjoining 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.659
 view 2008 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.249
 to be able to start from the side the cedh has been sent 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:05.139
 and depending on his speed choose the germillac game so of course well 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.449
 sure when you say look at the ball is also the moment of the strike 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:10.049
 watch play federate 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.109
 look like that 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.649
 head his look is a wolf for the eintracht he watched looked at her 

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:18.679
 his head did not move while typing 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:21.150
 the net has allowed the perfect centering 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.990
 and this was practically immobile while the afp 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.910
 the balance in favor of the opponent 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.260
 that's to keep the ball perfectly mediapart ball well 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.120
 look at the shot without a ball well watch at the start of his 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.130
 trajectory when TV at the opponent
