it's<00:00:18.210> really<00:00:18.510> simple<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:19.050> do<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.260> just<00:00:19.890> need

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
it's really simple to do you just need

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.269 
it's really simple to do you just need
one<00:00:20.359> layer<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.720> an<00:00:22.199> adjustment<00:00:22.680> layer<00:00:22.830> and

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
one layer and an adjustment layer and

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.420 
one layer and an adjustment layer and
some<00:00:23.580> filters<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.470> as<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.619> can<00:00:25.740> see<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:26.250> is

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
some filters and as you can see this is

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.470 
some filters and as you can see this is
the<00:00:26.580> before<00:00:26.970> here<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:28.230> city<00:00:28.529> after<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.580> I

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
the before here and the city after and I

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.240 
the before here and the city after and I
filled<00:00:31.969> original<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.540> what<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.140> gonna<00:00:34.500> do<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:35.100> I

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
filled original and what I gonna do is I

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.950 
filled original and what I gonna do is I
copy<00:00:35.640> there<00:00:35.880> by<00:00:36.120> holding<00:00:36.420> down<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.690> Alt<00:00:36.840> key

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
copy there by holding down the Alt key

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.850 
copy there by holding down the Alt key
and<00:00:37.140> drag<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.879> layer<00:00:38.879> upwards<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.809> then<00:00:40.739> I'm

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
and drag the layer upwards and then I'm

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.779 
and drag the layer upwards and then I'm
going<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.160> image<00:00:42.110> adjustment<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.789> threshold

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
going to image adjustment and threshold

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.760 
going to image adjustment and threshold
this<00:00:45.450> time<00:00:45.690> I'm<00:00:45.870> working<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:48.079> pixel<00:00:49.079> image<00:00:49.410> not

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
this time I'm working on pixel image not

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.880 
this time I'm working on pixel image not
on<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.950> smart<00:00:50.430> object<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:52.140> working

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
on a smart object and we working

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.670 
on a smart object and we working
destructive<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.780> okay<00:00:55.110> because<00:00:55.410> we

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
destructive but it's okay because we

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.299 
destructive but it's okay because we
have<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.940> copy<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:58.230> I'm<00:00:58.949> going<00:00:59.190> to

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
have a copy of that so I'm going to

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.299 
have a copy of that so I'm going to
lower<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> threshold<00:01:00.920> until<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.949> have

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
lower the threshold until I have

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.980 
lower the threshold until I have
something<00:01:02.760> like<00:01:02.940> that<00:01:05.330> until<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> lights<00:01:06.659> are

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
something like that until the lights are

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
something like that until the lights are
coming<00:01:07.380> through<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.510> trees<00:01:09.510> here<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.140> then<00:01:10.920> I

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
coming through the trees here and then I

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.620 
coming through the trees here and then I
click<00:01:11.250> okay<00:01:12.530> then<00:01:13.530> I'm<00:01:13.770> going<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.630> convert

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
click okay then I'm going to convert

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.490 
click okay then I'm going to convert
this<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> smart<00:01:16.170> object<00:01:17.390> and<00:01:18.390> I'm<00:01:19.229> giving

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
this to a smart object and I'm giving

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.679 
this to a smart object and I'm giving
with<00:01:20.090> filter<00:01:21.090> blur<00:01:21.930> radial<00:01:22.400> blur<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:24.270> I'm

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
with filter blur radial blur and I'm

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.910 
with filter blur radial blur and I'm
going<00:01:24.900> with<00:01:25.020> assume<00:01:25.820> amount<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:27.000> 100<00:01:27.630> and

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
going with assume amount of 100 and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.569 
going with assume amount of 100 and
quality<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:28.979> best<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:30.450> dragged<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:32.220> point

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
quality is best and I dragged the point

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.410 
quality is best and I dragged the point
where<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.000> stands<00:01:33.329> up<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.790> about<00:01:36.060> this

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
where it stands up to the to about this

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.390 
where it stands up to the to about this
point<00:01:36.540> here<00:01:36.960> while<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> Sun<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.220> coming

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
point here while the Sun is coming

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.170 
point here while the Sun is coming
through<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.180> click<00:01:40.170> OK<00:01:40.640> then<00:01:41.640> Photoshop<00:01:42.060> is

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
through and click OK then Photoshop is

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.120 
through and click OK then Photoshop is
working<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.689> little<00:01:42.810> bit<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.290> creates<00:01:46.130> radial

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
working a little bit and creates radial

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.139 
working a little bit and creates radial
blur<00:01:47.369> or<00:01:47.850> zoom<00:01:48.240> blur<00:01:48.770> and<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.729> takes<00:01:51.000> the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
blur or zoom blur and it takes the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.789 
blur or zoom blur and it takes the
moment

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
moment

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.910 
moment
my<00:01:53.700> graphic<00:01:54.090> card<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:55.560> a<00:01:55.649> replacement

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
my graphic card is just a replacement

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.179 
my graphic card is just a replacement
right<00:01:56.490> now<00:01:56.759> because<00:01:57.090> my<00:01:57.479> really<00:01:58.470> good<00:01:58.649> one<00:01:58.829> is

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
right now because my really good one is

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.600 
right now because my really good one is
in<00:01:59.369> their<00:01:59.520> pair<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:01.140> because<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.280> out<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
in their pair and because of the out the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.830 
in their pair and because of the out the
things<00:02:03.509> are<00:02:03.720> going<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.990> little<00:02:04.140> bit<00:02:04.320> slower<00:02:04.560> and

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
things are going a little bit slower and

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.749 
things are going a little bit slower and
now<00:02:06.840> I'm<00:02:07.110> setting<00:02:07.470> this<00:02:07.619> layer<00:02:07.920> here<00:02:08.310> to

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
now I'm setting this layer here to

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.610 
now I'm setting this layer here to
screen<00:02:10.190> like<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.510> now<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.569> can<00:02:12.989> see<00:02:13.019> we<00:02:13.410> have

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
screen like that now you can see we have

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.000 
screen like that now you can see we have
two<00:02:13.769> rays<00:02:14.010> coming<00:02:14.550> through<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.230> trees<00:02:16.230> but

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
two rays coming through the trees but

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.170 
two rays coming through the trees but
it's<00:02:17.519> still<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:18.269> little<00:02:18.450> bit<00:02:18.630> too<00:02:19.080> harsh<00:02:20.180> too

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
it's still a little bit too harsh too

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.309 
it's still a little bit too harsh too
harsh<00:02:21.569> edges<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.489> now<00:02:23.489> it's<00:02:23.700> not<00:02:23.880> so

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
harsh edges and now it's not so

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.530 
harsh edges and now it's not so
realistic<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:26.040> for<00:02:26.549> this<00:02:26.670> I'm<00:02:26.910> going<00:02:27.209> to<00:02:27.360> add

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
realistic and for this I'm going to add

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.900 
realistic and for this I'm going to add
another<00:02:27.870> filter<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.769> this<00:02:28.860> layer<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.430> blur

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
another filter to this layer a blur

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.960 
another filter to this layer a blur
filter<00:02:30.180> Gaussian<00:02:30.900> blur<00:02:31.080> filter<00:02:31.670> gosh<00:02:32.670> blur

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
filter Gaussian blur filter gosh blur

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.479

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
maybe go a little bit with light

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.120 
maybe go a little bit with light
lightness<00:03:21.750> here<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:23.390> think<00:03:24.390> that's<00:03:24.660> ok<00:03:25.560> right

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
lightness here and think that's ok right

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.180 
lightness here and think that's ok right
now<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.640> then<00:03:26.850> I'm<00:03:27.060> going<00:03:27.269> back<00:03:27.329> to<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.660> layer

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
now and then I'm going back to the layer

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.199 
now and then I'm going back to the layer
to<00:03:29.190> our<00:03:29.310> blur<00:03:29.910> layer<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.660> I<00:03:31.109> know<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.410> opacity

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
to our blur layer and I know the opacity

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.449 
to our blur layer and I know the opacity
just<00:03:33.209> a<00:03:33.720> little<00:03:34.260> bit<00:03:34.440> so<00:03:34.709> that<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.190> looks

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
just a little bit so that it looks

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.370 
just a little bit so that it looks
realistic

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
realistic

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.890

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
something about 50 to 60 percent in this

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.819 
something about 50 to 60 percent in this
case<00:03:40.489> ok<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.700> that's<00:03:42.180> it<00:03:42.420> that's<00:03:43.049> before<00:03:43.620> and
