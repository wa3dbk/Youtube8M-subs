neat little tool for you guys today this
is<00:00:10.460> a<00:00:11.379> obd2<00:00:12.610> memory<00:00:13.610> saver<00:00:14.410> which<00:00:15.410> is<00:00:15.620> quite

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:16.099 
is a obd2 memory saver which is quite

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.749 
is a obd2 memory saver which is quite
different<00:00:16.460> than<00:00:16.930> these<00:00:17.930> that<00:00:18.650> plug<00:00:18.980> into<00:00:19.189> the

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:19.759 
different than these that plug into the

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:22.929 
different than these that plug into the
cigarette<00:00:20.270> lighter<00:00:20.570> now<00:00:21.410> the<00:00:21.470> problem<00:00:22.040> with

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
cigarette lighter now the problem with

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.920 
cigarette lighter now the problem with
these<00:00:23.180> is<00:00:23.509> the<00:00:23.869> cigarette<00:00:24.230> lighter<00:00:25.450> has<00:00:26.450> to<00:00:26.720> be

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
these is the cigarette lighter has to be

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.299 
these is the cigarette lighter has to be
on<00:00:27.200> all<00:00:27.950> the<00:00:28.220> time<00:00:28.489> and<00:00:29.500> there<00:00:30.500> are<00:00:30.529> some<00:00:31.040> cars

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
on all the time and there are some cars

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.319 
on all the time and there are some cars
out<00:00:31.489> there<00:00:31.730> that<00:00:31.939> have<00:00:32.090> switchable<00:00:32.840> ones<00:00:33.079> so

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
out there that have switchable ones so

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:51.100 
out there that have switchable ones so
this<00:00:35.329> is<00:00:35.809> the<00:00:36.559> way<00:00:36.710> to<00:00:36.770> go<00:00:48.190> see<00:00:49.190> that<00:00:49.900> you<00:00:50.900> get

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
this is the way to go see that you get

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.460 
this is the way to go see that you get
your<00:00:53.440> plug<00:00:54.440> for<00:00:54.740> the<00:00:54.829> obd2<00:00:56.050> plug<00:00:57.050> it<00:00:57.200> right<00:00:57.290> in

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
your plug for the obd2 plug it right in

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.870 
your plug for the obd2 plug it right in
there<00:00:58.030> now<00:00:59.030> see<00:00:59.270> what<00:00:59.390> they<00:00:59.540> did<00:00:59.840> is<00:01:00.050> they<00:01:00.880> put

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
there now see what they did is they put

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.380 
there now see what they did is they put
this<00:01:02.030> configuration<00:01:02.530> on<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:03.590> other<00:01:04.070> side<00:01:04.390> so

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
this configuration on the other side so

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.250 
this configuration on the other side so
it's<00:01:06.079> made<00:01:06.530> for<00:01:06.799> those<00:01:06.920> portable<00:01:07.900> power<00:01:08.900> packs

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
it's made for those portable power packs

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.910 
it's made for those portable power packs
and<00:01:09.820> so<00:01:10.820> you<00:01:10.909> plug<00:01:11.479> that<00:01:11.510> right<00:01:11.960> into<00:01:12.409> the

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
and so you plug that right into the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.969 
and so you plug that right into the
power<00:01:13.130> pack<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:14.060> get<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:14.390> 12<00:01:14.870> volts<00:01:15.260> and<00:01:15.409> we

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
power pack to get you 12 volts and we

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.460 
power pack to get you 12 volts and we
get<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.360> ready<00:01:17.360> light<00:01:17.659> here<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.140> tell<00:01:18.320> us<00:01:18.350> that

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
get a ready light here to tell us that

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.570 
get a ready light here to tell us that
power<00:01:19.220> is<00:01:19.550> flowing<00:01:20.000> out<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:21.140> cable<00:01:21.560> so<00:01:22.400> that's

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
power is flowing out the cable so that's

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.820 
power is flowing out the cable so that's
going<00:01:22.729> to<00:01:22.790> be<00:01:22.909> very<00:01:23.120> interesting<00:01:24.020> to<00:01:24.049> use<00:01:24.560> now

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
going to be very interesting to use now

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.940 
going to be very interesting to use now
of<00:01:25.220> course<00:01:25.490> this<00:01:26.270> is<00:01:26.510> only<00:01:26.720> going<00:01:27.020> to<00:01:27.260> be<00:01:27.409> able

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
any memory in the computer if we don't

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.810 
any memory in the computer if we don't
have<00:04:24.740> a<00:04:24.770> memory<00:04:25.250> saver<00:04:27.310> all<00:04:28.310> right<00:04:28.430> this<00:04:28.639> is

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
have a memory saver all right this is

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.500 
have a memory saver all right this is
just<00:04:29.000> a<00:04:29.150> demonstration<00:04:30.760> to<00:04:31.760> make<00:04:32.150> sure<00:04:32.330> that

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
just a demonstration to make sure that

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.600 
just a demonstration to make sure that
it<00:04:32.630> works<00:04:32.870> now<00:04:33.139> if<00:04:33.260> you<00:04:33.350> do<00:04:33.590> take<00:04:34.070> you<00:04:34.280> if<00:04:34.460> you

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
it works now if you do take you if you

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.210 
it works now if you do take you if you
are<00:04:34.849> changing<00:04:35.449> the<00:04:35.510> battery<00:04:36.010> remember<00:04:37.010> when

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
are changing the battery remember when

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.339 
are changing the battery remember when
you<00:04:37.340> take<00:04:37.550> that<00:04:37.760> positive<00:04:38.090> cable<00:04:38.630> off<00:04:38.990> there

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
you take that positive cable off there

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:44.890 
you take that positive cable off there
that's<00:04:40.280> life<00:04:40.750> so<00:04:41.750> protect<00:04:42.460> that<00:04:43.460> cable<00:04:44.270> do<00:04:44.510> not

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
that's life so protect that cable do not

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.469 
that's life so protect that cable do not
let<00:04:45.289> that<00:04:45.320> positive<00:04:46.099> cable<00:04:46.310> touch<00:04:46.940> any<00:04:47.120> ground

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
let that positive cable touch any ground

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.560 
let that positive cable touch any ground
because<00:04:48.260> you've<00:04:48.530> got<00:04:48.919> voltage<00:04:49.849> from<00:04:50.419> that

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
because you've got voltage from that

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.100 
because you've got voltage from that
memory<00:04:50.750> saver<00:04:51.340> all<00:04:52.340> right<00:04:52.520> now<00:04:53.419> put<00:04:53.750> this<00:04:53.840> back

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110

on and we'll disconnect memory saver and
we'll<00:05:03.380> do<00:05:03.500> a<00:05:03.530> scan<00:05:03.949> of<00:05:03.979> the<00:05:04.250> computer<00:05:04.820> and<00:05:05.000> see

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
we'll do a scan of the computer and see

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:13.260 
we'll do a scan of the computer and see
