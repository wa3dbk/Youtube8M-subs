at impact that's the hardest thing to do

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.110 
at impact that's the hardest thing to do
and<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.739> do<00:00:34.920> that<00:00:35.160> I'm<00:00:35.580> going<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.790> give<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.059> a

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:38.339 
better visual for that also and that's

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.610 
better visual for that also and that's
what<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.790> call<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.629> ball<00:00:39.870> liner<00:00:40.199> what<00:00:40.470> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
what we call the ball liner what the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.070 
what we call the ball liner what the
ball<00:00:40.800> liner<00:00:41.070> does<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.210> allows<00:00:42.449> you<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.809> draw

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.080 
ball liner does is it allows you to draw

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.100 
ball liner does is it allows you to draw
a<00:00:43.110> line<00:00:43.409> on<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.680> golf<00:00:43.979> ball<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.790> such<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.809> manner

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
a line on the golf ball in such a manner

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.990 
a line on the golf ball in such a manner
that<00:00:46.229> it<00:00:46.470> kind<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.769> gives<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.159> a<00:00:47.190> flat<00:00:47.640> surface

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
that it kind of gives you a flat surface

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.869 
that it kind of gives you a flat surface
to<00:00:48.239> aim<00:00:48.600> at<00:00:48.839> so<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.170> put<00:00:49.470> my<00:00:49.619> ball<00:00:49.860> liner<00:00:50.159> on<00:00:50.460> here

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
to aim at so I put my ball liner on here

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.619 
to aim at so I put my ball liner on here
I'm<00:00:51.659> going<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.989> draw<00:00:52.229> a<00:00:52.619> few<00:00:53.190> lines<00:00:53.489> with<00:00:54.119> my<00:00:54.299> my

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
I'm going to draw a few lines with my my

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.310 
I'm going to draw a few lines with my my
Sharpie<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.790> really<00:00:56.790> this<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.659> a<00:00:57.690> concept

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
Sharpie here really this is a concept

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.670 
Sharpie here really this is a concept
that<00:00:58.470> a<00:00:58.530> lot<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.799> people<00:00:59.070> use<00:01:00.140> to<00:01:01.140> draw<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.409> line

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
that a lot of people use to draw a line

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.189 
that a lot of people use to draw a line
on<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.949> ball<00:01:02.220> to<00:01:02.519> aim<00:01:02.790> it<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.629> word<00:01:03.839> we've<00:01:04.019> got

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
on the ball to aim it the word we've got

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.859 
on the ball to aim it the word we've got
one<00:01:04.439> line<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.979> aim<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.420> we've<00:01:06.420> got<00:01:06.570> another

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
one line to aim it we've got another

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.250 
one line to aim it we've got another
line<00:01:07.220> we<00:01:08.220> draw<00:01:08.430> on<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> back<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.659> creates<00:01:10.049> a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
line we draw on the back that creates a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.350 
line we draw on the back that creates a
flat<00:01:10.530> surface<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.189> another<00:01:11.460> line<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.060> top

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
flat surface and another line on the top

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.719 
flat surface and another line on the top
that<00:01:12.840> gives<00:01:12.990> us<00:01:13.200> kind<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.590> point<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.399> be<00:01:14.640> able

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
that gives us kind of a point to be able

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.940 
that gives us kind of a point to be able
to<00:01:14.850> look<00:01:15.119> at<00:01:15.329> what<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.570> put<00:01:16.289> the<00:01:16.439> ball<00:01:16.649> down<00:01:16.920> on

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
to look at what we put the ball down on

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.770 
to look at what we put the ball down on
the<00:01:17.189> ground<00:01:17.429> so<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:17.700> know<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:17.969> we've<00:01:18.630> got

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
the ground so we know that we've got

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.630 
the ground so we know that we've got
everything<00:01:19.079> lined<00:01:19.259> up<00:01:19.469> good<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.219> once<00:01:20.429> I'm

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
everything lined up good so once I'm

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.639 
everything lined up good so once I'm
done<00:01:20.789> with<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> ball<00:01:21.299> liner<00:01:21.630> I'm<00:01:22.350> going<00:01:22.590> to

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
done with the ball liner I'm going to

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.429 
done with the ball liner I'm going to
have<00:01:22.829> the<00:01:23.009> golf<00:01:23.250> ball<00:01:23.549> looking<00:01:24.270> like<00:01:24.329> this<00:01:24.749> and

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
have the golf ball looking like this and

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.230 
have the golf ball looking like this and
when<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.560> line<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.100> up<00:01:26.249> on<00:01:26.609> the<00:01:26.759> ground

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
when I line it up on the ground

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.429 
when I line it up on the ground
I<00:01:27.329> aim<00:01:27.899> this<00:01:28.409> line<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:29.159> where<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.340> want<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.640> go

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
I aim this line to where I want to go

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.380 
I aim this line to where I want to go
and<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.499> also<00:01:31.679> have<00:01:32.130> my<00:01:32.159> straight<00:01:32.729> line<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:33.299> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
and I also have my straight line on the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.539 
and I also have my straight line on the
back<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.869> golf<00:01:34.109> ball<00:01:34.229> gives<00:01:34.890> me<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> great

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
back of the golf ball gives me a great

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.179 
back of the golf ball gives me a great
visual<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.509> when<00:01:36.749> I<00:01:36.780> come<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.679> impact

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
visual so that when I come in to impact

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.929 
visual so that when I come in to impact
I'm<00:01:38.520> going<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.759> try<00:01:39.359> to<00:01:39.420> keep<00:01:39.719> the<00:01:39.960> putter<00:01:40.319> face

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
I'm going to try to keep the putter face

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.840 
I'm going to try to keep the putter face
square<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.869> line<00:01:43.259> that's<00:01:43.799> now<00:01:44.069> on<00:01:44.340> my<00:01:44.579> golf

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
square to the line that's now on my golf

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.469 
square to the line that's now on my golf
ball<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.420> flat<00:01:46.319> on<00:01:46.649> flat<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.460> always<00:01:48.179> going<00:01:48.420> to

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
ball and flat on flat is always going to

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.440 
ball and flat on flat is always going to
equal<00:01:48.990> ball<00:01:49.619> starting<00:01:50.219> off<00:01:50.369> where<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.210> aimed

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
equal ball starting off where you aimed

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.630
