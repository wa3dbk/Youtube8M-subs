00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.850
 Lieferheld it is up to the em-start guests still visible to the naked eye 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.799
 put 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.199
 For the lights began, the pet dog they are extraordinarily far from 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.659
 removed us that's nonsense attributed 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:24.619
 because if they get too close then that question would not make him think so 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.969
 That means going up and down at the counters when they have to go far away 

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:28.570
 his 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.460
 The next star we saw was Hark until the sun was the one 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.359
 Distance of 150 million kilometers 

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:39.350
 the light from the sun to us need 8 minutes 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.400
 So the sun is 8 light minutes away from us 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.260
 the next stars are already light years away from us so how 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.800
 far that is you can calculate yourself year 3d movie 60 days each 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.990
 Day has 6 000 companies seconds and the speed of light is 300 thousand 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.240
 Kilometers per second calculate so times when you see in the light is yes 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.270
 very long 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.460
 So 70 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.340
 but that's just the astronomical environment 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.170
 the home of and ran stars that were closest from 14 0 left 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.780
 was 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.619
 a few light years away from us, what are the plans? 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.000
 enjoy a few hundred light-years away from us 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.969
 sometimes very good powers so then 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.229
 if you sink properly pace then you can even recognize the next Galaxy 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.060
 Andromeda 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.060
 Andromeda is two comebacks 2 5 million light-years away from us 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.570
 or is it too 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.070
 more than this distance we can not see with the naked eye 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.880
 Andromeda is the object we are 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.350
 if something farthest away from us is an island of stars like ours 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.720
 Milky Way otherwise, all the stars we see so 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.870
 by normal means so a few thousand light-years away from us 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.220
 because we live in a cosmic environment 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.570
 which is not so intoxicating now what is actually more of a cosmic 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.060
 Backyard at all during the home games were at Brussels Square 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.819
 the milky way its disks galaxy why we see a band in the sky 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.900
 because we are looking from the side in this disc 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.940
 and in these slices galaxy gives spiral arms 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.490
 There are many stars in the spiral arms and we are so behind a little bit 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.310
 large stable is chosen unanimously 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.689
 it was clear so speaks of a local to be clear 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.659
 that is the sun is burning 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.679
 and we are fine 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:22.129
 so the distances to other objects in the markets 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.209
 we are obviously very powerful 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.529
 has that any meaning for us 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:27.949
 as a matter of fact 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:31.489
 because the fact that the other stars are so far from our star 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.260
 our sun has gone normal 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.889
 Consequences for it 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.899
 that this planet system in which we live 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:41.769
 through the solar system where the earth is their third planet 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.280
 that this system has been so stable since February 5 billion years ago 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.320
 he always stands in front of the stars are much closer to each other 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:51.660
 only Burma on we would have a next star 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.890
 the practical still within the present extent of the solar system 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.670
 Samowar few 10 light minutes away from us in the sun again and again 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.769
 flying over what would the coat 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.109
 Yes 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.439
 the body in question kicked the amps for the answer 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:09.250
 that that one such just such a mass of stars of course to do so 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:13.640
 would cause that the planetary orbits went around the sun we were disturbed 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:17.389
 by the presence of this other city 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.959
 So we do not have to wonder that this other star is so far 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.269
 away from us 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.709
 that we come in billions of kilometers areas 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.869
 the interesting thing is firstly 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:31.229
 why do we see that at all because there is no between us in these stars 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:35.339
 Material is more what the light of these stars in Irvine way 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:39.059
 completing so nice that we can as far as groups is an expression 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:41.999
 for the universe being so empty 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:45.469
 as it is today and it is no wonder because the universe is 13 19 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:47.499
 Billions of years old 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:50.719
 spread out the room has spread and in this way 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:53.069
 expand through this 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.089
 that the density is unbelievably down 

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:58.609
 always small and small place 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:03:59.969
 and therefore 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:03.549
 because the universe is so big and so old and so cold 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.539
 it is so empty too 

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:09.789
 because it is so empty we can use this gas ball 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:13.589
 I'm loud miles away from us are so wonderful 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.180
 if he really really good night of interest 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.180
 I think that's wonderful
