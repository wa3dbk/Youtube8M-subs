solutions<00:01:15.270> well<00:01:16.050> one<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.680> was<00:01:16.800> surprising

solutions well one that was surprising

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.390 
solutions well one that was surprising
as<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.020> solution<00:01:19.020> for<00:01:19.380> transportation<00:01:19.800> was

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
as the solution for transportation was

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.130 
as the solution for transportation was

electric submarine cars they were
looking<00:01:25.410> at<00:01:25.680> different<00:01:25.979> ways<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.630> getting<00:01:27.630> the

that<00:01:30.420> was<00:01:30.570> definitely<00:01:30.780> not<00:01:31.170> something<00:01:31.440> that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
that was definitely not something that

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.450 
that was definitely not something that
was<00:01:32.150> in<00:01:33.150> my<00:01:33.360> expectation<00:01:34.080> it<00:01:34.770> was<00:01:34.950> amazing<00:01:35.430> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
was in my expectation it was amazing to

was in my expectation it was amazing to
see<00:01:35.789> these<00:01:36.750> kids<00:01:36.990> get<00:01:37.289> up<00:01:37.410> there<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.890> have

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
see these kids get up there and have
