beyond<00:02:10.399> its<00:02:10.700> impact<00:02:11.090> on<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.450> economy<00:02:12.160> but<00:02:13.160> i

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
beyond its impact on the economy but i

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.259 
beyond its impact on the economy but i
think<00:02:13.519> that<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:15.019> net<00:02:15.530> impact<00:02:16.040> if<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:16.459> ask<00:02:16.730> is

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
think that the net impact if you ask is

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.309 
think that the net impact if you ask is
going<00:02:17.660> to<00:02:17.810> be<00:02:17.989> positive<00:02:18.819> because<00:02:19.819> it<00:02:20.390> it's<00:02:21.170> a

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
going to be positive because it it's a

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.920 
going to be positive because it it's a
whole<00:02:21.560> new<00:02:22.040> source<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.780> aggregate<00:02:23.780> demand

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
whole new source of aggregate demand

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.869 
whole new source of aggregate demand
there<00:02:24.860> are<00:02:24.950> so<00:02:25.099> many<00:02:25.220> things<00:02:25.549> to<00:02:25.879> do<00:02:27.670> thank<00:02:28.670> you

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
there are so many things to do thank you

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.690 
there are so many things to do thank you
we<00:02:29.870> have<00:02:30.049> a<00:02:30.080> very<00:02:30.379> structured<00:02:30.769> initiative<00:02:31.459> to

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
we have a very structured initiative to

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.089 
we have a very structured initiative to
to<00:02:32.420> create<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.780> process<00:02:33.170> that's<00:02:33.410> repeatable

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
to create a process that's repeatable

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.309 
to create a process that's repeatable
throughout<00:02:34.519> the<00:02:34.700> whole<00:02:34.940> group<00:02:35.360> in<00:02:35.810> how<00:02:36.260> we

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
throughout the whole group in how we

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.440 
throughout the whole group in how we
manage<00:02:36.890> better<00:02:37.130> our<00:02:37.400> suppliers<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.120> supply

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
manage better our suppliers and supply

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.390 
manage better our suppliers and supply
chain<00:02:38.480> now<00:02:39.440> we're<00:02:39.620> going<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:39.799> move<00:02:39.860> into<00:02:40.130> the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
chain now we're going to move into the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.550 
chain now we're going to move into the
factory<00:02:40.849> tour<00:02:41.239> what<00:02:42.079> you're<00:02:42.260> going<00:02:42.410> to<00:02:42.530> hear

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
factory tour what you're going to hear

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.300 
factory tour what you're going to hear
is<00:02:42.920> basically<00:02:43.400> how<00:02:43.549> we<00:02:43.579> design<00:02:43.879> products<00:02:45.310> are

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
is basically how we design products are

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.460 
is basically how we design products are
we<00:02:46.519> make<00:02:46.760> them<00:02:47.890> how<00:02:48.890> we<00:02:48.950> test<00:02:49.370> them<00:02:49.640> and<00:02:50.410> how<00:02:51.410> we

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
we make them how we test them and how we

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.869 
we make them how we test them and how we
market<00:02:51.860> them<00:02:52.220> I<00:02:54.099> think<00:02:55.099> it<00:02:55.220> was<00:02:55.340> very<00:02:55.400> good<00:02:55.730> to

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
market them I think it was very good to

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.089 
market them I think it was very good to
have<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.150> opportunity<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.720> actually<00:02:57.530> see<00:02:57.980> the

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
have the opportunity to actually see the

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.830 
have the opportunity to actually see the
manufacturing<00:02:58.819> side<00:02:59.000> but<00:02:59.299> also<00:02:59.450> see<00:02:59.720> the

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
manufacturing side but also see the

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.410 
manufacturing side but also see the
diversity<00:03:00.019> and<00:03:00.530> complexity<00:03:01.190> of<00:03:01.549> the<00:03:02.030> product

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
diversity and complexity of the product

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.440 
diversity and complexity of the product
I<00:03:02.629> think<00:03:02.900> it's<00:03:03.019> really<00:03:03.139> confirmed<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.799> growth

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
I think it's really confirmed the growth

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.229 
I think it's really confirmed the growth
potential<00:03:05.450> from<00:03:05.660> innovation<00:03:06.079> and<00:03:06.700> there<00:03:07.700> was

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
potential from innovation and there was

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.090 
potential from innovation and there was
we're<00:03:08.660> talking<00:03:08.900> about<00:03:09.019> a<00:03:09.109> market<00:03:09.590> that<00:03:09.620> simply

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
we're talking about a market that simply

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.979 
we're talking about a market that simply

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
been a mechanical lock market for a very

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.870 
been a mechanical lock market for a very
long<00:03:12.200> time<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:12.530> now<00:03:12.920> we're<00:03:13.100> shifting<00:03:13.280> into<00:03:13.760> an

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
long time and now we're shifting into an

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.849 
long time and now we're shifting into an
electronic<00:03:14.299> market<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:15.049> the<00:03:15.380> adoption<00:03:15.799> of

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
electronic market and the adoption of

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
that is accelerating and by spending our

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.530 
that is accelerating and by spending our
indeed<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.310> sales<00:03:19.579> that<00:03:19.849> is<00:03:19.970> more<00:03:20.180> than<00:03:20.239> your

indeed to sales that is more than your

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.539 
indeed to sales that is more than your
competitors<00:03:21.049> and<00:03:21.230> being<00:03:21.470> bigger<00:03:21.739> you<00:03:22.370> have<00:03:22.519> a

competitors and being bigger you have a

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.610 
competitors and being bigger you have a
massive<00:03:22.790> dollar<00:03:23.150> block<00:03:23.630> advantage<00:03:24.200> and<00:03:24.380> aren

massive dollar block advantage and aren

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.259 
massive dollar block advantage and aren
t<00:03:24.769> I<00:03:25.069> think<00:03:25.549> the<00:03:25.670> important<00:03:26.060> thing<00:03:26.090> we've

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
t I think the important thing we've

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.819 
t I think the important thing we've
shown<00:03:26.480> them<00:03:26.510> today<00:03:26.810> is<00:03:27.109> really<00:03:27.349> that<00:03:27.650> we<00:03:27.769> are
