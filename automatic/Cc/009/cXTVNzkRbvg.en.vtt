it maybe i'll just like I my mouth I'm

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.090 
it maybe i'll just like I my mouth I'm
sure<00:04:09.810> I'm<00:04:10.139> sure<00:04:10.170> they<00:04:10.500> won't<00:04:10.620> do<00:04:10.859> something

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
don't know hopefully they don't have

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.659
