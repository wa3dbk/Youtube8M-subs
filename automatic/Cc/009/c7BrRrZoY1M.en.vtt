00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
kind of ironic because it does talk a

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.020 
kind of ironic because it does talk a
little<00:00:36.860> bit<00:00:37.040> about<00:00:37.220> something<00:00:37.670> I<00:00:37.730> wanted<00:00:37.970> to

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
little bit about something I wanted to

little bit about something I wanted to
do<00:00:38.150> and<00:00:38.449> it's<00:00:39.019> interesting<00:00:39.620> to<00:00:39.860> think<00:00:39.890> that

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
do and it's interesting to think that

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.969 
do and it's interesting to think that
dust<00:00:41.300> bowl<00:00:41.510> is<00:00:41.629> kind<00:00:41.870> of<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.080> map<00:00:42.260> I<00:00:42.530> was

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:42.979 
dust bowl is kind of the map I was

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:44.320 
dust bowl is kind of the map I was
actually<00:00:43.220> going<00:00:43.430> to<00:00:43.519> do<00:00:43.580> a<00:00:43.610> soldier<00:00:44.000> map<00:00:44.180> in

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:44.330 
actually going to do a soldier map in

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.509 
actually going to do a soldier map in
mind<00:00:44.540> to<00:00:44.750> begin<00:00:44.960> with<00:00:45.170> but<00:00:45.650> the<00:00:45.890> topic<00:00:46.129> in<00:00:46.400> my

00:00:46.509 --> 00:00:46.519 
mind to begin with but the topic in my

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:47.979 
mind to begin with but the topic in my
head<00:00:46.729> changed<00:00:47.210> as<00:00:47.330> soon<00:00:47.510> as<00:00:47.629> I<00:00:47.720> started

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
head changed as soon as I started

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.439 
head changed as soon as I started
watching<00:00:48.199> the<00:00:48.470> footage<00:00:48.739> it's<00:00:49.640> kind<00:00:50.030> of<00:00:50.180> funny

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
watching the footage it's kind of funny

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.200 
watching the footage it's kind of funny
to<00:00:50.540> think<00:00:50.659> that<00:00:51.159> hats<00:00:52.159> and<00:00:52.519> team<00:00:52.640> fortress<00:00:53.030> 2

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
to think that hats and team fortress 2

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.030 
to think that hats and team fortress 2
are<00:00:53.449> kind<00:00:53.720> of<00:00:53.870> what<00:00:54.110> revolve<00:00:54.530> around<00:00:54.739> this

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
are kind of what revolve around this

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.250 
are kind of what revolve around this
game<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:55.670> it's<00:00:56.119> sort<00:00:56.390> of<00:00:56.510> a<00:00:56.600> strange<00:00:56.839> thing

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
game and it's sort of a strange thing

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.869 
game and it's sort of a strange thing
because<00:00:57.290> it<00:00:57.710> does<00:00:57.860> not<00:00:57.890> take<00:00:58.309> really<00:00:58.610> any

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
because it does not take really any

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:00.549 
because it does not take really any
effort<00:00:59.269> to<00:00:59.299> get<00:00:59.600> hats<00:00:59.809> think<00:01:00.170> about<00:01:00.379> it<00:01:00.470> in

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
effort to get hats think about it in

better<00:03:42.090> as<00:03:42.299> soldier<00:03:42.660> that's<00:03:42.870> where<00:03:43.019> I<00:03:43.079> think

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
better as soldier that's where I think

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:44.330 
better as soldier that's where I think
Strange's<00:03:43.829> are<00:03:43.919> a<00:03:43.950> little<00:03:44.099> bit<00:03:44.250> more
