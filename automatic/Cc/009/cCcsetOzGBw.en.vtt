00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.490 
so the small ones can get out the bacon
is<00:02:06.140> gonna<00:02:06.320> stay<00:02:06.700> and<00:02:07.700> then<00:02:07.940> I<00:02:08.330> think<00:02:09.170> this<00:02:09.319> is

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
is gonna stay and then I think this is

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.930 
is gonna stay and then I think this is
an<00:02:09.649> easier<00:02:09.920> thing<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:10.190> think<00:02:10.520> this<00:02:10.610> is<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.789> best

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
an easier thing I think this is the best

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.420 
an easier thing I think this is the best
thing<00:02:11.150> to<00:02:11.180> do<00:02:11.420> right<00:02:11.810> here<00:02:13.240> 50<00:02:14.240> dips<00:02:15.220> dunk<00:02:16.220> my
