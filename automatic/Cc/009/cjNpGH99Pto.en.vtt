question<00:03:40.090> what<00:03:40.239> he's<00:03:40.450> never<00:03:40.660> came<00:03:40.900> back

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
question what he's never came back

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.539 
question what he's never came back
apparently<00:03:41.380> is<00:03:41.620> going<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:41.799> return<00:03:42.010> only<00:03:42.220> in

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
apparently is going to return only in

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.400 
apparently is going to return only in
emergency<00:03:43.269> situations<00:03:43.480> but<00:03:44.139> they<00:03:44.230> were<00:03:44.290> never

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
emergency situations but they were never

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.839 
emergency situations but they were never
really<00:03:44.620> in<00:03:44.739> this<00:03:44.980> ballgame<00:03:45.220> in<00:03:45.489> the<00:03:45.549> second

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
really in this ballgame in the second

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.159 
really in this ballgame in the second
half<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.060> begin<00:03:46.299> with<00:03:46.480> so<00:03:46.510> we<00:03:46.690> didn't<00:03:46.930> have<00:03:46.959> to

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
half to begin with so we didn't have to

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.500 
half to begin with so we didn't have to
risk<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.829> Jared<00:03:48.609> Allen<00:03:48.700> took<00:03:48.910> a<00:03:49.030> stinger

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
risk that Jared Allen took a stinger

and that was basically it there's no
worries<00:04:00.040> about<00:04:00.190> him<00:04:00.579> but<00:04:00.760> it<00:04:00.849> looks<00:04:01.000> like<00:04:01.150> he

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
worries about him but it looks like he

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
it was just fine so other than that

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.080 
it was just fine so other than that
though<00:04:05.290> looks<00:04:06.130> like<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:06.430> two<00:04:06.639> starting

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090
