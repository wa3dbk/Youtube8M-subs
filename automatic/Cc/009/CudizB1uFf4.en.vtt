 of 2 lemons or if we do not have lemon for 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.070
 case we can use lemon essence 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.070
 we start 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.519
 the first step will be to make a syrup 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.930
 we will throw the glass of water and three 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:33.200
