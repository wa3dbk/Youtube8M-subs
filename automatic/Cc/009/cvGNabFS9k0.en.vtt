00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.380
 hello I am olaf and since at the 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.140
 green car care tutorials car care 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.619
 The dream car is made easy 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.060
 door 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.890
 you have moved him and the first thing 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.449
 It gets dirty in the rims that goes 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.880
 not at all like her again clean 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.890
 I'll show you the rims now 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.409
 cleaning is meaningfully wise 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.029
 start the car wash because the falls 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.649
 should be cold for a second 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.960
 but also dry because then the cleaner 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.420
 works better and we take in the case 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.150
 the evo tec rim cleaner and spray 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.540
 simply the dirty rim flat with 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.820
 the cleaner 1 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.590
 important here is that we really 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.630
 catch all corners and edges 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.250
 everything we do with the rim cleaner 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.710
 spray and also afterwards 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:58.610
 we do not have to play otherwise 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.730
 edit more by hand 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.440
 rim cleaner has a factory indicator 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.200
 that means he shows us through one 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.270
 discoloration when he is ready for 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.640
 rinse 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.159
 Usually it is exactly the time 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.490
 it takes around four wheels once 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.880
 sprayed supposes early on 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.869
 Pay attention to the corners and depending on the personal 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.030
 Taste the same as the rim bed 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.289
 looks good here now and now 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.929
 I'll do the other three cases 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.899
 and then I come back to rinse off 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:35.359
 so the rim cleaner has acted and 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.969
 discolored you can see that at the elan 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:39.079
 and now it had to be rinsed off 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.729
 it can of course a 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.990
 take garden hose but if you 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.090
 I want you to get a perfect result 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.340
 did you take a high-pressure radiator? 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.020
 who has no home can in the 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.749
 drive next washbox 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.770
 we are fortunate enough to become one 

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:53.770
 Rinse all over now 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.039
 that's how easy the rim is 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.170
 We are still doing the three of them now 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.400
 others and then our cases 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.160
 cleaning completed 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.930
 If you want to see more, have a look 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.239
 the next two videos like 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.640
 we seal the rim and afterwards 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.080
 the tires fly so are the rims 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.970
 clean again i hope it has you 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.620
 fallen and you could learn something 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.849
 products I have used 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.980
 See below in the description 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.250
 Bye and see you next time euro 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.250
