okay so it is now 1 30 this is part 1 of
lunch<00:02:25.770> because<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.310> more<00:02:27.030> potatoes<00:02:27.209> cooking

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
lunch because this more potatoes cooking

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.260 
lunch because this more potatoes cooking
in<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.930> oven<00:02:28.160> had<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.190> craving<00:02:29.430> for<00:02:29.610> beetroot

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
in the oven had a craving for beetroot

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.270 
in the oven had a craving for beetroot
this<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.810> low-sodium<00:02:31.440> pasta<00:02:32.100> sauce

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
this is the low-sodium pasta sauce

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.730 
this is the low-sodium pasta sauce
because<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:32.940> can't<00:02:33.360> find<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.750> tomatoes<00:02:34.230> swords

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
because I can't find the tomatoes swords

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.360 
because I can't find the tomatoes swords
that<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:36.090> actually<00:02:36.840> lower<00:02:37.170> sodium<00:02:37.470> than<00:02:37.709> 230

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
that is actually lower sodium than 230

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.030 
that is actually lower sodium than 230
so<00:02:38.730> just<00:02:38.910> use<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.030> pasta<00:02:39.450> sauce<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:40.040> lettuce

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
so just use a pasta sauce and lettuce

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.440 
so just use a pasta sauce and lettuce
