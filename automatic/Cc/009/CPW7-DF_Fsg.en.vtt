skis<00:00:13.070> come<00:00:14.070> back<00:00:14.280> traditionally<00:00:14.849> was<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.260> 102

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
skis come back traditionally was a 102

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.590 
skis come back traditionally was a 102
underfoot<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.310> new<00:00:17.490> skis<00:00:17.789> are<00:00:18.000> completely

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
underfoot the new skis are completely

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.810 
underfoot the new skis are completely
different<00:00:18.990> we've<00:00:19.199> got<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> 104<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.400> then<00:00:20.699> we've

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
different we've got a 104 and then we've

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.640 
different we've got a 104 and then we've
added<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.210> 114<00:00:23.810> completely<00:00:24.810> overhauled<00:00:25.260> ski<00:00:25.529> we

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
added a 114 completely overhauled ski we

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.349 
added a 114 completely overhauled ski we
got<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> new<00:00:26.010> construction<00:00:26.640> on<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.910> it's<00:00:27.119> quite

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
got a new construction on it it's quite

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.730 
got a new construction on it it's quite
a<00:00:27.390> bit<00:00:27.570> lighter<00:00:27.810> than<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.140> original<00:00:28.170> was

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
a bit lighter than the original was

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.500 
a bit lighter than the original was
we've<00:00:29.369> given<00:00:29.609> this<00:00:29.760> ski<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> little<00:00:30.179> bit<00:00:30.330> of

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
we've given this ski a little bit of

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.110 
we've given this ski a little bit of
tail<00:00:30.689> rocker<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.410> also<00:00:32.160> bit<00:00:32.340> a<00:00:32.369> little<00:00:32.880> bit<00:00:33.000> of

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
tail rocker and also bit a little bit of

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.840 
tail rocker and also bit a little bit of
tail<00:00:33.360> taper<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.950> combination<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.670> those

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
tail taper so the combination of those

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.000 
tail taper so the combination of those
two<00:00:35.910> things<00:00:36.210> allow<00:00:36.840> you<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.140> adjust<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.710> shape

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
two things allow you to adjust the shape

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.160 
two things allow you to adjust the shape
of<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> turn<00:00:38.489> much<00:00:38.820> easier<00:00:39.239> especially<00:00:39.690> when

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
of the turn much easier especially when

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.750 
of the turn much easier especially when
you<00:00:40.290> get<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.530> heavy<00:00:40.739> thick<00:00:41.070> snow<00:00:41.309> that's<00:00:41.579> not

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
you get in heavy thick snow that's not

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.000 
you get in heavy thick snow that's not
as<00:00:41.910> easy<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.210> skid<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.570> ski<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.590> allows<00:00:43.800> you

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
as easy to skid the ski so it allows you

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.470 
as easy to skid the ski so it allows you
to<00:00:44.100> really<00:00:44.250> tighten<00:00:44.670> up<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> radius<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:45.360> you

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
to really tighten up the radius if you

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.440 
to really tighten up the radius if you
want<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.500> shovel<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.010> same<00:00:47.309> we've<00:00:47.730> got<00:00:47.940> more

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
want the shovel is same we've got more

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.240 
want the shovel is same we've got more
shovel<00:00:48.930> rocker<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.559> ski<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.070> had

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
shovel rocker in this ski that we had

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.729 
shovel rocker in this ski that we had
previously<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.960> also<00:00:52.140> gave<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.620> ski

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
previously and we also gave this ski

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.430 
previously and we also gave this ski
some<00:00:53.100> taper<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:54.090> initiates<00:00:54.660> much<00:00:54.899> easier

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
some taper so it initiates much easier

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.650 
some taper so it initiates much easier
it's<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.100> much<00:00:56.250> much<00:00:56.670> friendlier<00:00:57.210> ski<00:00:57.480> than

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
it's a much much friendlier ski than

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.720 
it's a much much friendlier ski than
before<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.800> other<00:00:58.949> thing<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.280> did<00:00:59.460> with<00:00:59.609> these

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
before the other thing we did with these

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.349 
before the other thing we did with these
skis<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.530> we<00:01:01.530> aim<00:01:01.649> sidewalls<00:01:02.219> previously<00:01:03.180> this

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
skis is we aim sidewalls previously this

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.350 
skis is we aim sidewalls previously this
ski<00:01:03.570> was<00:01:03.750> capped<00:01:04.500> tip<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.070> tail<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.180> cap

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
ski was capped tip to tail and the cap

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.300 
ski was capped tip to tail and the cap
construction<00:01:07.020> allows<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.439> ski<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.799> initiate

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
construction allows the ski to initiate

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.340 
construction allows the ski to initiate
a<00:01:08.340> little<00:01:08.700> bit<00:01:08.820> easier<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.420> finish<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.170> turn

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
a little bit easier and finish the turn

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.679 
a little bit easier and finish the turn
a<00:01:10.380> little<00:01:10.530> bit<00:01:10.710> easier<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.180> sidewall

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
a little bit easier but the sidewall

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.940 
a little bit easier but the sidewall
underfoot<00:01:13.080> gives<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> better<00:01:13.740> edge

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
underfoot gives you a better edge

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.929 
underfoot gives you a better edge
purchase<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.750> great<00:01:15.750> blending<00:01:16.200> there<00:01:16.439> and

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
purchase so great blending there and

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.340 
purchase so great blending there and
then

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.500 

we<00:01:20.980> added<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:22.090> 1:14<00:01:22.930> width<00:01:23.200> to<00:01:23.440> this<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:25.240> ski

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
we added the 1:14 width to this this ski

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.720 
we added the 1:14 width to this this ski
has<00:01:25.540> a<00:01:25.720> ton<00:01:26.170> more<00:01:26.380> carbon<00:01:26.860> fiber<00:01:27.100> you<00:01:27.280> can<00:01:27.520> see

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
has a ton more carbon fiber you can see

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.820 
has a ton more carbon fiber you can see
all<00:01:27.910> the<00:01:28.060> longitudinal<00:01:28.810> carbon<00:01:29.200> fiber<00:01:29.410> strips

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
all the longitudinal carbon fiber strips

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.310 
all the longitudinal carbon fiber strips
they're<00:01:30.070> both<00:01:30.970> these<00:01:31.240> skis<00:01:31.570> get<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:31.870> carbon

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
they're both these skis get a carbon

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.400 
they're both these skis get a carbon
fiber<00:01:32.530> web<00:01:32.890> in<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:34.090> shovel<00:01:34.510> and<00:01:34.690> in<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.170> tail

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
fiber web in the shovel and in the tail

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.560 
fiber web in the shovel and in the tail
and<00:01:35.680> what<00:01:36.160> that<00:01:36.340> does<00:01:36.580> is<00:01:36.790> just<00:01:36.940> increase<00:01:37.390> the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
and what that does is just increase the

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.180 
and what that does is just increase the
torsion<00:01:38.020> at<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.230> tip<00:01:38.410> and<00:01:38.530> tail<00:01:38.590> gives<00:01:39.040> you<00:01:39.160> a

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
torsion at the tip and tail gives you a

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.770 
torsion at the tip and tail gives you a
little<00:01:39.340> bit<00:01:39.490> better<00:01:39.640> edge<00:01:39.880> hold<00:01:39.910> a<00:01:40.420> little<00:01:40.660> bit

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
little bit better edge hold a little bit

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.150 
little bit better edge hold a little bit
stronger<00:01:41.170> ski<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.810> ski<00:01:44.140> has<00:01:44.350> all<00:01:44.650> the<00:01:44.890> same
