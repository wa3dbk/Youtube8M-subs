it's real it is real the reason I went

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.220 
it's real it is real the reason I went
with<00:02:02.160> this<00:02:02.310> one<00:02:02.370> is<00:02:02.760> because<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.780> didn't<00:02:04.110> have

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
with this one is because I didn't have

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.790 
with this one is because I didn't have
enough<00:02:04.260> money<00:02:04.440> to<00:02:04.680> get<00:02:04.920> another<00:02:06.800> another

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
enough money to get another another

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.360 
enough money to get another another
strata<00:02:08.280> keffe<00:02:08.550> J<00:02:09.170> this<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.320> a<00:02:10.350> lot<00:02:10.590> cheaper<00:02:10.830> so

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
strata keffe J this is a lot cheaper so

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.740

let me give you some details now with
this<00:02:51.989> one<00:02:52.139> you're<00:02:52.230> getting<00:02:52.319> in<00:02:52.530> hardbodies

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
this one you're getting in hardbodies

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.910 
this one you're getting in hardbodies
which<00:02:53.250> is<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:54.000> frame<00:02:54.299> is<00:02:54.510> aluminum<00:02:54.989> which<00:02:55.709> I

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
which is the frame is aluminum which I

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.259 
which is the frame is aluminum which I
like<00:02:56.189> a<00:02:56.370> little<00:02:56.579> bit<00:02:56.669> of<00:02:56.730> body<00:02:56.879> because<00:02:57.180> you

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
like a little bit of body because you

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.050 
like a little bit of body because you
get<00:02:57.389> a<00:02:57.419> lot<00:02:57.569> of<00:02:57.599> sense<00:02:57.810> sensitivity<00:02:58.909> so<00:02:59.909> this

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
get a lot of sense sensitivity so this

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.640 
get a lot of sense sensitivity so this
whole<00:03:00.209> thing<00:03:00.239> is<00:03:00.450> aluminum<00:03:00.959> it's<00:03:01.260> really

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
whole thing is aluminum it's really

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.890 
whole thing is aluminum it's really

in it will give you a loop this kind of

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.650 
in it will give you a loop this kind of

eliminates that but anyways gonna spin a
rail<00:03:56.870> you<00:03:56.989> should<00:03:57.200> when<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.650> pull<00:03:57.950> up<00:03:58.010> the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
rail you should when you pull up the

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.979 
rail you should when you pull up the
bail<00:03:58.310> overcast<00:03:58.760> you<00:03:59.300> should<00:03:59.450> put<00:03:59.870> it<00:03:59.959> back

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
bail overcast you should put it back

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.420 
bail overcast you should put it back
over<00:04:00.230> with<00:04:00.440> your<00:04:00.530> hand<00:04:00.709> you'll<00:04:01.040> get<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.250> lot

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
over with your hand you'll get a lot

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.250 
over with your hand you'll get a lot
less<00:04:01.459> loops<00:04:02.049> did<00:04:03.049> you<00:04:03.140> guess

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
less loops did you guess

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.000 
less loops did you guess
all<00:04:05.010> digital<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:05.640> it's<00:04:06.239> going<00:04:06.420> to<00:04:06.480> air<00:04:06.659> rotor

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
all digital and it's going to air rotor

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.679 
all digital and it's going to air rotor
so<00:04:08.010> this<00:04:08.159> error<00:04:08.430> right<00:04:08.879> here<00:04:08.939> the<00:04:09.269> rotor<00:04:09.480> that

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689 
so this error right here the rotor that

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.089 
so this error right here the rotor that
actually<00:04:10.019> holds<00:04:10.409> the<00:04:10.650> bail<00:04:11.180> it<00:04:12.180> comes<00:04:12.420> around

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
actually holds the bail it comes around

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.069 
actually holds the bail it comes around
it's<00:04:14.099> a<00:04:14.459> lot<00:04:14.849> stiffer<00:04:15.180> than<00:04:15.420> most<00:04:15.599> so<00:04:15.959> it

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
it's a lot stiffer than most so it

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.449 
it's a lot stiffer than most so it
doesn't<00:04:16.350> flex<00:04:16.590> as<00:04:16.709> much<00:04:16.889> when<00:04:17.070> you<00:04:17.160> set<00:04:17.370> the

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
doesn't flex as much when you set the

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.000 
doesn't flex as much when you set the
hook<00:04:17.579> this<00:04:18.479> part<00:04:18.780> of<00:04:18.900> it<00:04:19.019> flexes<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.620> then<00:04:19.919> if

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
hook this part of it flexes and then if

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.409 
hook this part of it flexes and then if
you<00:04:20.100> don't<00:04:20.250> have<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.579> Flex<00:04:20.789> of<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.000> real<00:04:21.180> the

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
you don't have the Flex of the real the

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.620 
you don't have the Flex of the real the
real<00:04:21.989> arm<00:04:22.610> you'll<00:04:23.610> get<00:04:23.789> the<00:04:23.910> Flex<00:04:24.150> of<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.389> arm

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
real arm you'll get the Flex of the arm

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.290 
real arm you'll get the Flex of the arm
here<00:04:24.720> so<00:04:25.680> there's<00:04:26.039> less<00:04:26.220> let<00:04:26.460> does<00:04:26.729> Plus<00:04:27.030> flex

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
here so there's less let does Plus flex

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.740 
here so there's less let does Plus flex
of<00:04:27.510> this<00:04:27.630> arm<00:04:27.860> solvent<00:04:29.150> you<00:04:30.150> know<00:04:30.210> you<00:04:30.600> got

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
of this arm solvent you know you got

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.730 
of this arm solvent you know you got
that<00:04:30.889> really<00:04:31.889> really<00:04:32.100> light<00:04:32.370> bail<00:04:32.960> it's<00:04:33.960> nice

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
that really really light bail it's nice

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
that really really light bail it's nice

so so if you're going to be using six

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.219 
so so if you're going to be using six
