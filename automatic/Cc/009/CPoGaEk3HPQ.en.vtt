00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.710

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.570
 quentinois interested look at me 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.090
 start by applying a jumbo from 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.740
 nyx so the white color is the 604 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.570
 that I apply on the whole eyelid 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.949
 will really bring out the lighthouses 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:36.270
 afterwards I think it's a 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:37.980
 very good base for this makeup I 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.140
 take the sugar n space pallet 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.910
 2 to fight and I start by applying 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.500
 this purple taupe color that 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.480
 is called club and she is completely 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.250
 maths and I applied it all over the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.840
 mobile eyelid degrading a small 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.840
 little for a little smoked the whole 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.310
 Oh 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.920
 I do not hesitate to degrade with a 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.390
 big brush for really smoke 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.710
 the set is then I come to take 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.240
 the same color that I apply 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.830
 will it be lower then I come 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.960
 take the black color of the palette 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.880
 which is called black liqueur and I 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.800
 place really will it be lower for 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.940
 to make a liner a little smoky 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.940
 always in that spirit 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.590
 then to bring some light 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.660
 to his makeups I take the lighthouse of 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.030
 at l'orÃ©al it's having beige ice cream 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.040
 number 2 which is just super bright there 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.690
 is super pretty and I'm applying it wedge 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.400
 internal by degrading a little bit about 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.270
 the other color and I also apply them 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.860

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.670
 of checchi caused a hue really 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.470
 nude that is perfect for applying in 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.770
 the mucosa and I find that it opens the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.770
 look 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.250

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.920

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.990

 makes a super natural effect and at the same 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.090
 time there is suffering where it takes 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.090
