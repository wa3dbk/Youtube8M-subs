00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 so now we compare with you new 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.720
 shockproof smartphone in android from 9 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.880
 old 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:14.960
 kind rumba x5 king so well that's what 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.380
 outwardly they represent themselves visually 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:23.279
 you can compare them by thickness 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.590
 obviously he wants more though 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.070
 be it just some kind of external such 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.340
 visual deception 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.680
 so in width a little bit more lan 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.870
 driver 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.870
 from 9 to about 5 millimeters 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:52.000
 so here we see something a little 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.670
 a little blood 3-5 millimeters wide 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.309
 in height they are exactly the same but 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.010
 the thickness we visually see that rumba 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.729
 x5 of course a little bit thicker than he rover 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.460
 of 9 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.860
 so let's compare the rear rear covers 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.979
 covers but 6 bolts equally like 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.200
 batteries large battery sizes 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.080
 about the same but vatu he rover 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.110
 make the lid much wider equally 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.020
 the cameras of his apparatuses are generally external 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.840
 the similarity of me she is very very very 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.360
 strongly strikes because android 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.399
 did later rumba did much 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.780
 before and respectively all those 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:34.179
 technology the best things the best moments 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.509
 that were designed for the round 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:40.479
 of course we use android os 9 so 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.200
 means by the presence of buttons camera button 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.429
 more volume less 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.149
 so here is the photosensitive 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:52.780
 the sensor here is so no sorry 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:56.640
 this is camera cam damage right here with diet 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.640
 cameras here is further 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:04.120
 buttons programmable button sos here 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.760
 she damage god button so this 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.910
 programmable button 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:13.540
 apps for walkie talk damage god this button 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.680
 to the radio you 9 sos button you 9 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.350
 football and 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.640
 next I understand channel changes 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:24.750
 most likely so but we know everything yes 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.750
 which opening mechanism 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:33.980
 yusb port in a special working 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:36.260
 such double-sided fasteners 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.950
 well for me duck he is much worse than himself 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.690
 manifest than the usual standard 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.080
 fastener porridge here is soft u soft 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.510
 rubber seal but for me so 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.829
 this is the side where tanks can 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.829
 get some water just here the radio 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:58.640
 principle equally flashlights button 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:02.450
 inclusions ie we see that from 09 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.900
 just appear that is lan driver here 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.010
 to be by and large copies 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.239
 this he has a reduced amount 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.760
 random access memory 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.829
 but there is a little cheaper address 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.180
 was as rumba is still a brand but 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.129
 when compared by plastic 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.230
 the turbo machine is made of 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:23.060
 plastic is a little softer but of course 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.709
 spout thereby most pleasant so if 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.379
 talk about batteries here are my hands I 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.500
 keep batteries off of 9 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:34.450
 controller with 9 this battery at 4100 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.450
 ampere ampere hours for comparison 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:43.160
 dad motre 800 battery goes by default 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.959
 in the kit and under the order we carry on 4 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.430
 thousand 200 milliamp hours and not even 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.329
 four and a half thousand milliamps 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:55.819
 hours that is basically how batteries from 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:57.440
 set a little better with 09 so more 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.959
 devices have nothing to add 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.790
 We will answer all the questions. 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.030
 likes to video thank you all for your attention 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.030
 until
