00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.160
 another avon tutorial today we're going to talk 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.870
 of the look avon hair care that 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.780
 we are going to try that you have a hair 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.130
 brilliant and stupendous so let's go 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.750
 there 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.000
 good to explain the cares of the 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.949
 hair I think it would be something that already 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.960
 we do what we do every day 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.640
 true is that we are going to talk right now 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.739
 of the avon professional line the most 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.720
 high and I in this case I'm going to decant 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.309
 for the supreme and why then because to 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.070
 obviously it serves me and I think that 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.199
 you too first shampoo 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.180
 It's worth if we say it like that, not the 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.769
 shampoo is super important more than 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.040
 What do you think is the one who will give us then? 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:48.260
 that healthy tone in the hair that shine 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.670
 it's worth to me the supreme line and I 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.619
 It hydrates a lot that sometimes I need 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.119
 hydration for a matter of stress 

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:57.379
 If I have stress like everyone or a 

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:58.850
 bad food that I sometimes go with 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.220
 hurry then the hair reflects 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.350
 very much that kind of life because sometimes 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.040
 a little accelerated helps me a lot 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.500
 Regain brightness the natural color 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.780
 have a lot a lot a lot of healthy 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.400
 what is it that interests me and the shampoo is 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.720
 first thing and what helps me best what 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.580
 second 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.890
 senator because especially for the 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.630
 moment to untangle in this case I 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.070
 help then at the time not to break the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.620
 hair because especially when it is 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.410
 wet we tend to pull more than normal 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.630
 and with the line conditioner 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.850
 the supreme line today we are going to achieve 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.650
 do not break our hair ok 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.300
 once a week mask ok 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.360
 here we do have to take some time 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.580
 what is good what I think is 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.530
 what pilot or what else we are going to put 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.390
 the mask and in this case the line 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.880
 supreme today what we are going to achieve is that 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.650
 it's one minute of mask yes sir 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.630
 it's generally a 15 hey 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.570
 leave in 1 since we are going in such a hurry 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.450
 we make it easy, the best of all is 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.860
 that helps you throughout the week to 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.170
 that care with shampoo and 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.330
 conditioner as they are noticed and 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.400
 obviously, what he does is follow 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.200
 nourishing the hair in a very 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.570
 natural, you are going to notice a lot 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.790
 I'm going to advice you that especially 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.520
 You are very attentive, you are good, I am going to 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.270
 present the time the teaser 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.980
 and that seems 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.990
 good thing is that I like to do well 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.090
 because it activates the circulation for me 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.550
 that's what it's about, what it causes is 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.560
 activate the circulation of the part of the 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.140
 scalp because because by year 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.940
 for b as I always say that the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.730
 blood reaches the head is that it reaches the 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.670
 hair with which this activates it is worth not 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.650
 it breaks the hair and it fits in the hand 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.290
 It fits in your suitcase that I wear it 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.940
 whenever I travel so much and it comes 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.310
 also those huge brushes video 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.200
 because this is perfect perfect 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.600
 to travel perfect to use all 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.870
 Whether day or wonderful the jungle 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.810
 I recommend you teacher 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.360
 the hair obviously and we're going to him 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.970
 biphasic is an oil that nourishes repairs 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.000
 has five types of oil with which 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.890
 what you are going to do is a perfect finish 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.990
 because then because once we have 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.170
 all of the above this reinforces it as 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.670
 you already know very important and what 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.230
 what will cause is that you have then the 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.030
 shine naturalness and everything that 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.980
 we have worked previously with 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.780
 which I recommend you have to shake it 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.760
 by the way, it's good to mix the 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.780
 five oils have all the nutrients 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.560
 to point 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.870
 we pulverize cabbage and especially in hair 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.709
 wet that has good needs 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.260
 big clarified what not to need 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.319
 partially clarified the most so nothing 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:45.370
 all this is done a little bit each 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.600
 day you know once a week 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.360
 to cause you to have a hair because it is 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.739
 very healthy very nice very natural that 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.840
 is what we look for almost all and almost 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.580
 all and then and something sophisticated then 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.680
 we're doing nothing that I send you a 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.930
 little kiss that you already know that you put a 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.120
 like on youtube on the channel I do 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.530
 Spain and that I wait for you in another tutorial 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.530
