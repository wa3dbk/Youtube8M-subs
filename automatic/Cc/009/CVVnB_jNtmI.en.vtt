00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.220
 hello welcome to my channel our house 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.129
 in this video the eau show how to do 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.539
 a fruit jelly with cheese those 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.280
 are the ingredients remember that 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:13.249
 information I always leave it here 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.250
 in the information box the first thing that 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:18.619
 let's do is to hydrate the grenetina 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.140
 in the cup of water we are going to add 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.110
 the grenetina we're going to beat and we 're going 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.420
 to let rest 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.330
 while in a blender we are going to 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.620
 add what is cream cheese the 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.960
 condensed and evaporated milk 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.240
 we're going to add the grenadine 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.640
 melted that must have already put in 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.640
 microwave and you're going to start liquefying 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.149
 when you finish liquefying everything 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.980
 he's just going to do it in a 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.780
 container and let the life 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.730
 meanwhile we will continue with the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.559
 second part of the gelatin you're going to 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.840
 need a jelly box of the 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.449
 that they sell in stores plus a 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.850
 unsweetened grenetine sachet follows 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.160
 the instructions and when solving the 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.600
 gelatin that you bought you are going to add 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.600
 at the same time the grenetina 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.130
 remember to follow the rest of the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.229
 instructions 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.250
 then you are going to grease a mold to 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.000
 gelatine and we're going to add so much 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.399
 gelatin and you're going to put it in 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.409
 refrigerator until it takes out your 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.880
 gelatin and we are going to add all the 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.880
 fruit that you decided is to use 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.180
 add the rest of the gelatin and finish 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.180
 the refrigerator until it set 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.060
 and here the gelatin had taken the base 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.490
 take out and we are going to add the gelatin 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.189
 that we made at the beginning the cheese 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.990
 if the cheese is curdled you can 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.670
 put in the microwave for a few 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.670
 minutes until it melts 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.760
 Then put the gelatin in 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.400
 refrigerator until it sets if it is 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.920
 preferable to leave it overnight 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.260
 to unmold gelatin what we're going 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.050
 to do is start to take off 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.210
 edges of the gelatin mold and 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.330
 immediately we will grab some 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.400
 container where you have hot water 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.700
 we are going to put the gelatin there until 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.400
 it starts to take off 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.160
 flip it on a plate and you'll see that it will come out 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.590
 very easy 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.680
 and that's how our jelly is 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.450
 creamy with fruit I hope and I have them 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.190
