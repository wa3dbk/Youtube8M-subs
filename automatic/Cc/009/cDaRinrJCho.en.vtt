amphitheatre<00:02:00.640> of<00:02:00.670> space<00:02:01.200> comes<00:02:02.200> at<00:02:02.320> the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
amphitheatre of space comes at the

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.380 
detriment of center of gravity
so<00:02:06.159> we<00:02:06.250> decided<00:02:06.549> to<00:02:06.760> set<00:02:06.970> up<00:02:07.000> a<00:02:07.150> simple

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
so we decided to set up a simple

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.340 
so we decided to set up a simple
selection<00:02:08.289> of<00:02:08.380> cones<00:02:08.649> for<00:02:08.979> a<00:02:09.039> slalom<00:02:10.350> the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
selection of cones for a slalom the

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.559 
selection of cones for a slalom the
sudden<00:02:11.770> direction<00:02:12.310> change<00:02:12.610> in<00:02:12.819> this<00:02:13.000> slalom

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
sudden direction change in this slalom

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.930 
sudden direction change in this slalom
will<00:02:13.870> reveal<00:02:14.230> whether<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.830> B<00:02:15.010> Maxie's<00:02:15.490> extra

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
will reveal whether the B Maxie's extra

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.510 
will reveal whether the B Maxie's extra
height<00:02:16.150> has<00:02:16.420> made<00:02:16.660> it<00:02:16.780> unstable<00:02:17.350> johnny<00:02:18.310> will

height has made it unstable johnny will

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.880 
height has made it unstable johnny will
hit<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.730> at<00:02:18.850> 30<00:02:19.120> miles<00:02:19.330> an<00:02:19.480> hour<00:02:19.630> then<00:02:20.050> 50<00:02:20.680> and

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
hit it at 30 miles an hour then 50 and

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.490 
hit it at 30 miles an hour then 50 and
then<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.490> gut-wrenching<00:02:22.350> 17<00:02:25.200> when<00:02:26.200> I'm<00:02:26.290> taking

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
then a gut-wrenching 17 when I'm taking

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.850 
then a gut-wrenching 17 when I'm taking
you<00:02:26.770> to<00:02:26.800> bingo<00:02:27.540> when<00:02:28.540> we<00:02:28.630> did<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.900> at<00:02:29.050> 30<00:02:29.319> cough

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
you to bingo when we did it at 30 cough

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.920 
you to bingo when we did it at 30 cough
up<00:02:30.130> C<00:02:30.400> fine<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.819> wasn't<00:02:30.970> being<00:02:31.300> pushed<00:02:31.569> hard<00:02:31.810> at

up C fine it wasn't being pushed hard at
all

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
all

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.550 
all
that's<00:02:32.860> quieter<00:02:33.370> less<00:02:33.550> aslam<00:02:34.110> Ford's<00:02:35.110> say<00:02:35.350> the

so<00:02:38.980> far<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.459> reckon<00:02:40.000> they're<00:02:40.180> right<00:02:40.390> 50<00:02:41.260> miles

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
so far I reckon they're right 50 miles

so far I reckon they're right 50 miles
an<00:02:41.620> hour<00:02:41.739> it<00:02:41.950> didn't<00:02:42.310> really<00:02:42.610> have<00:02:42.760> any

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
an hour it didn't really have any

now<00:02:46.180> don't<00:02:46.540> give<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:46.900> birdie<00:02:47.170> one<00:02:47.500> that<00:02:47.709> were

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
now don't give it a birdie one that were

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.990 
now don't give it a birdie one that were
