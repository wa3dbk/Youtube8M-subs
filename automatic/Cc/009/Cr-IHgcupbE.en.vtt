00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
design in the world it took me a little

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.300 
design in the world it took me a little
while<00:02:10.490> to<00:02:10.880> get<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.270> where<00:02:11.510> I<00:02:11.540> wanted<00:02:11.990> to<00:02:12.050> be

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
while to get to where I wanted to be

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.670 
while to get to where I wanted to be
after<00:02:13.310> sifting<00:02:13.610> through<00:02:13.820> a<00:02:14.000> bunch<00:02:14.209> of<00:02:14.360> menus

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680

fortunately<00:02:15.680> in<00:02:15.890> Rocksmith<00:02:16.459> 2014<00:02:16.730> they've

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
fortunately in Rocksmith 2014 they've

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.480 
fortunately in Rocksmith 2014 they've
redesigned<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.410> user<00:02:18.620> interface<00:02:19.160> from<00:02:19.400> the

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
redesigned the user interface from the

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.220 
redesigned the user interface from the
ground<00:02:19.850> up<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:20.270> as<00:02:20.540> you<00:02:20.600> can<00:02:20.750> see<00:02:20.930> from<00:02:21.050> the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
ground up and as you can see from the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.390 
ground up and as you can see from the
screens<00:02:21.500> in<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.709> video<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.070> I'm<00:02:22.130> showing

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
screens in the video that I'm showing

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.970 
screens in the video that I'm showing
you<00:02:22.640> it's<00:02:23.120> not<00:02:23.450> only<00:02:23.720> pretty<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:24.350> look<00:02:24.500> at<00:02:24.709> but

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
you it's not only pretty to look at but

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.670 
you it's not only pretty to look at but
it's<00:02:25.400> also<00:02:25.700> snappy<00:02:26.300> quick<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.230> almost

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
it's also snappy quick and almost

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.259 
it's also snappy quick and almost
instant<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:28.519> those<00:02:28.670> are<00:02:28.790> one<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.030> minor

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
instant so those are one of the minor

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.360 
instant so those are one of the minor
tweaks<00:02:29.630> of<00:02:29.810> rocks<00:02:30.290> with<00:02:30.470> 2014<00:02:31.040> at<00:02:31.160> least<00:02:31.280> I

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
tweaks of rocks with 2014 at least I

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.830 
tweaks of rocks with 2014 at least I
think<00:02:31.610> it's<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.760> big<00:02:31.880> improvement<00:02:32.090> but<00:02:32.360> for

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
think it's a big improvement but for

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.910 
think it's a big improvement but for
most<00:02:33.019> people<00:02:33.230> is<00:02:33.290> probably<00:02:33.380> just<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.739> minor

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
most people is probably just a minor

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.350 
most people is probably just a minor
tweak<00:02:34.280> let's<00:02:34.519> go<00:02:34.670> ahead<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:34.910> talk<00:02:35.030> about<00:02:35.209> one

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
tweak let's go ahead and talk about one

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.780 
tweak let's go ahead and talk about one
