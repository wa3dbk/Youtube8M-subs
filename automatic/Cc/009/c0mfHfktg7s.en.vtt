cow<00:02:17.510> but<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.140> get<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.350> embryo<00:02:18.650> you<00:02:18.770> need<00:02:19.010> the

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
cow but to get the embryo you need the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.070 
cow but to get the embryo you need the
DNA<00:02:19.310> which<00:02:19.640> comes<00:02:19.880> from<00:02:20.000> frozen<00:02:20.480> meat<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:20.870> you
