00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
Wizard now I don't exactly know what I

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.890 
Wizard now I don't exactly know what I
did<00:03:01.280> wrong<00:03:01.310> they're<00:03:01.850> being<00:03:02.420> that<00:03:02.630> that<00:03:02.780> guy

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
did wrong they're being that that guy

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.770 
did wrong they're being that that guy
had<00:03:03.110> one<00:03:03.350> item<00:03:03.680> on<00:03:03.800> maybe<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:05.000> was<00:03:05.150> because<00:03:05.269> he

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
had one item on maybe it was because he

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.720 
had one item on maybe it was because he
looked<00:03:05.989> like<00:03:06.080> Hulk<00:03:06.440> that's<00:03:07.130> probably<00:03:07.519> a<00:03:07.700> good

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
looked like Hulk that's probably a good

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.180 
looked like Hulk that's probably a good
reason<00:03:07.940> um<00:03:08.570> that<00:03:08.989> I<00:03:09.200> think<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:09.769> gives<00:03:09.920> him<00:03:10.070> an

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
reason um that I think that gives him an

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.160 
reason um that I think that gives him an
advantage<00:03:10.280> I'm<00:03:11.120> gonna<00:03:11.239> ask<00:03:11.540> if<00:03:11.870> this<00:03:11.989> guy

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
advantage I'm gonna ask if this guy

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
advantage I'm gonna ask if this guy
would<00:03:12.230> like<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.590> fight<00:03:13.300> fight<00:03:15.130> possible<00:03:16.130> oh

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.550 
there's that one item guy again just
going<00:03:18.860> around<00:03:18.950> thinking<00:03:19.430> he's<00:03:19.459> a<00:03:19.580> champion<00:03:20.060> of

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
going around thinking he's a champion of

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
going around thinking he's a champion of
runescape<00:03:21.560> which<00:03:21.709> he<00:03:21.830> probably<00:03:22.040> is<00:03:22.250> because

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
runescape which he probably is because

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.490 
runescape which he probably is because
he<00:03:22.760> could<00:03:22.910> take<00:03:23.060> on<00:03:23.209> people<00:03:23.600> so<00:03:24.140> I'm<00:03:24.200> gonna<00:03:24.320> run

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
in the swing of things let's try this

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.480 
in the swing of things let's try this
out<00:05:51.690> usually<00:05:52.380> I<00:05:52.410> see<00:05:52.740> videos<00:05:53.100> and<00:05:53.400> this

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
out usually I see videos and this

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.900 
out usually I see videos and this
usually<00:05:53.700> works<00:05:54.470> not<00:05:55.470> for<00:05:55.740> me<00:05:55.950> that<00:05:56.520> that's<00:05:56.820> a

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
usually works not for me that that's a

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.090 
usually works not for me that that's a
wrong<00:05:57.570> I'm<00:05:57.870> not<00:05:58.110> allowed<00:05:58.320> to<00:05:58.350> do<00:05:58.590> that<00:05:58.710> in

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
wrong I'm not allowed to do that in

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.330 
wrong I'm not allowed to do that in
fights<00:05:59.460> by

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
fights by

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.780 
fights by
that's<00:06:00.669> that's<00:06:01.300> okay<00:06:01.630> so<00:06:02.560> far<00:06:02.830> not<00:06:03.190> too<00:06:03.550> bad

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
that's that's okay so far not too bad

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.610 
that's that's okay so far not too bad
we're<00:06:04.090> gonna<00:06:04.210> use<00:06:04.389> tornado<00:06:04.870> all<00:06:05.230> right<00:06:05.410> that

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
we're gonna use tornado all right that

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.000 
we're gonna use tornado all right that
that<00:06:05.889> hit<00:06:06.340> that<00:06:06.790> that<00:06:07.090> was<00:06:07.240> definitely<00:06:07.570> good

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
that hit that that was definitely good

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.790 
that hit that that was definitely good
we're<00:06:09.010> gonna<00:06:09.130> give<00:06:09.460> them<00:06:09.550> a<00:06:09.669> little<00:06:09.820> punch

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
we're gonna give them a little punch

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.980 
we're gonna give them a little punch
hopefully<00:06:11.800> that'll<00:06:11.979> do<00:06:12.250> something<00:06:13.030> ok<00:06:13.960> I

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
hopefully that'll do something ok I

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.290 
hopefully that'll do something ok I
think<00:06:14.110> think<00:06:14.500> we<00:06:14.590> stun<00:06:14.919> them<00:06:15.070> with<00:06:15.100> that<00:06:15.300> so

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
think think we stun them with that so

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.670 
think think we stun them with that so
now<00:06:16.389> we're<00:06:16.479> gonna<00:06:16.540> use<00:06:16.810> this<00:06:17.139> that<00:06:17.470> supposed

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
now we're gonna use this that supposed

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.240 
now we're gonna use this that supposed
to<00:06:17.770> be<00:06:17.860> like<00:06:18.010> 5k<00:06:18.460> damage<00:06:18.910> okay<00:06:19.600> close<00:06:19.960> enough

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
to be like 5k damage okay close enough

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:24.469 
to be like 5k damage okay close enough
that's<00:06:21.250> fine<00:06:22.050> um<00:06:23.050> I<00:06:23.169> think<00:06:23.199> we're<00:06:23.560> winning

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
that's fine um I think we're winning
