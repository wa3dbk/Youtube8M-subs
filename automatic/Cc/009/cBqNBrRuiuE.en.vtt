about that their argument seems to be

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.450 
about that their argument seems to be
that<00:01:53.700> because<00:01:54.700> the<00:01:55.060> system<00:01:55.360> is<00:01:55.450> broken<00:01:56.460> we

that because the system is broken we

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.950 
that because the system is broken we
shouldn't<00:01:57.729> make<00:01:57.790> an<00:01:57.909> effort<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.210> fix<00:01:58.390> it<00:02:00.960> it
