00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hi to all today I wanted 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.990
 show a little trick a 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.000
 little thing super nice good it's a 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.880
 question of taste but that I do not find 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.830
 badly these are 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.050
 two big flower pots in fact it's 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.920
 old nozzle 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.920
 which served for 1 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.710
 are in the ditches for sewage 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.870
 or rainwater 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.850
 so often long holes and a hacker 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.260
 who take and places for 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.090
 waste dumps so it trails a little bit 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.099
 everywhere and I go forward and hyper loire 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.270
 people there had picked up some that 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.870
 I carved carefully with one with 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:45.050
 a big dose that I cut from 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.050
 different sizes and being too scared 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.810
 and it makes the rendering really great 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.850
 after each puts what he wants in my 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.739
 c 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.530
 everything was less bushy good the hyena roses 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.269
 hollyhocks after there are other slope I 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.250
 can not say there is lemongrass and 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.580
 at the end there is the watch starts and 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.590
 Small and occasionally a CD 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.560
 fresh mango 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.960
 so the gateway the tax is just 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.649
 went ash up that was touting the watch 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.649
 vivaldi 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.950
 we want a little idea the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.159
 old nozzles this when we see the price 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.990
 flower depots and all the trimmings 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:31.620
 and again that I read them the 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.230
 does not pop up what I'm in 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.330
 I have a bit of a wild but obviously 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.680
 we can depend 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.090
 but hey it's not super ecological 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.580
 obviously it's a lot more 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.570
 aesthetic we agree but we 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.960
 is still not theirs that it does 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.600
 handle 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.200
 so here's a little one has a quick little thing 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.439
 made 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.439
 who 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.470
 do not look like mine but finally 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.140
 that there are flowers two years and that's 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:03.760
 pretty friendly 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.760
 always the link to read more
