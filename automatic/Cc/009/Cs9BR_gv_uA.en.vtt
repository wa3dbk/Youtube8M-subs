00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.320 
should be directly integrated with the
customers<00:03:03.270> website<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:05.280> wasn't<00:03:05.670> providing

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
customers website so it wasn't providing

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.140 
customers website so it wasn't providing
those<00:03:06.860> functionalities<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.340> then<00:03:08.459> I<00:03:08.640> looked

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
those functionalities and then I looked

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.570 
those functionalities and then I looked
at<00:03:09.270> Salesforce<00:03:09.840> which<00:03:10.080> is<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.260> great<00:03:10.620> crm

at Salesforce which is a great crm

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.240 
at Salesforce which is a great crm
system<00:03:12.000> but<00:03:12.150> it's<00:03:12.270> quite<00:03:12.390> expensive<00:03:13.160> as<00:03:14.160> you

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
system but it's quite expensive as you

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.210 
system but it's quite expensive as you
can<00:03:14.340> see<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:14.940> know<00:03:15.030> it's<00:03:15.180> best<00:03:15.420> for

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
can see you know it's best for

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.650 
can see you know it's best for
enterprise<00:03:17.220> mid-market<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.330> small

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
enterprise mid-market and small

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.220 
enterprise mid-market and small
businesses<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:20.330> you<00:03:21.330> know<00:03:21.420> really<00:03:21.959> for<00:03:22.170> the

businesses so you know really for the

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.560 
businesses so you know really for the
cost<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.709> this<00:03:22.860> that<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.250> cost<00:03:23.489> can<00:03:23.700> get<00:03:23.910> high

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
cost of this that the cost can get high

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.190 
cost of this that the cost can get high
quickly<00:03:25.260> when<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.530> comes<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.860> self<00:03:26.100> salesforce
