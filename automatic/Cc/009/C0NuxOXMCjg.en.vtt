 most popular indies as I said in the 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.150
 last part if I saw that I'm missing 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:18.370

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.510
 and here I am bringing you the second 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.890
 part and without further ado let's start

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.539

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.710
 simple game and has come to have 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:38.379
 multiple versions of it bingo 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.329
 if it's about an isaac boy being 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.399
 quietly at home without doing anything 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.800
 and the mother comes with intentions of 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.769
 kill him because his own mother wants 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.539
 kill him because God ordered him and of 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.460
 from then on the poor Isaac was 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.499
 faces a series of demons that do not 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.569
 they are more than their lost brothers who are 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:57.999
 found under a hidden trapdoor in 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:01:00.639
 your basement the game's argument is 

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:05.039
 grotesque and the game even more for who 

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:05.039
 I have not played it I recommend it xd 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.320

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.030
 Dark atmosphere and sad character

 his sister and on the way he goes 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.420

 change the scenario and enter a 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.189
 destroyed city where the climax of the 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.229
 story begins limbo is a game that 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.420
 maybe some of you know about having seen it 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.689
 in the stores of their consoles either 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.299
 xbox arcade or playstation network is a 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.220
 game that is really worth playing 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.920
 the game has even won awards in a 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.289
 independent games festival and 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.110
 Even if the game seems to be simple, do not 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:54.159
 is for nothing more nothing to say a great 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.159
 platinum game 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.830
 super meat boy is a game where 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.750
 we control my I go for a quantity 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.880
 very high levels that require a 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.730
 almost perfect synchronization to be able 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.830
 complete them our mission is to find 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.510
 to our girlfriend who was kidnapped 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.400
 for the bad guy in the game 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.230
 this game requires playing with a great 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.870
 concentration and with a control and 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.090
 almost perfect precision in the levels 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.210
 we must avoid obstacles like 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.890
 they are close salt among other things I think 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.310
 which is currently only available 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.840
 for xbox windows and linux is a game 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.840
 unsettling but very good 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.710
 this game is also one that had 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.100
 annotated to talk about him in the first 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.870
 part of the video and I did not do it either xd 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.240
 ssp containment bridge is a game that 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.490
 has a story behind it is a 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.640
 very good game is psychological terror 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.500
 suspense bar is about that we are a 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.560
 test doll that must enter with 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.600
 sct 173 the name given to the 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.050
 supposed main enemy of the game 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.940
 something goes wrong and 173 kills our two 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.940
 test partners also and to all 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.890
 in the least place to us we have to 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.900
 survive the most amount of time 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.600
 that we can to escape the 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.610
 facilities the game is always very 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.430
 random in the sense that the mapping 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.980
 the doors the possibilities and the 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.650
 ways to escape always change the 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.360
 story of the game is pretty good if 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.310
 they like scary games and 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.740
 them psychological horror games 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.080
 I highly recommend this game and if I 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.080
 can play with friends even more x of d 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.480
 mat pixel is a pixelated game that has 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.430
 a very, very, very random content that 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.020
 not any can play has to be 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.239
 played by someone who has a 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.489
 child mentality since the game can 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.220
 be offensive to some people 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.860
 the game is that we must save 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.660
 to the day consists of several screens in 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.700
 varied scenarios where we will have 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.739
 various objects to which we can 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.780
 clicking to interact with them 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.700
 depending on what happens when doing 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.980
 click on them we can disable the 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.170
 bomb and win the screen or just 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.510
 we can lose the screen with clicking 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.610
 in a wrong place is a game that 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.830
 really personally I think maybe 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.810
 a little silly for my taste but that's not 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.180
 it removes that I have played it several times and 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.250
 even from my xd phone if they have a 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.010
 phone with android can search it and 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.840
 try it if they like if they are creative the 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.320
 game should not be a problem for 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.320
 your 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.900
 they are and that is a game that has many 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.150
 spin-off articles television series 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.159
 and everything to his credit and has a 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.800
 horror story as well known as a 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:40.870
 supposed damn video game of the sonic 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.789
 dot exe is a game made by someone 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.039
 that complements a horror story 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.930
 with mutating well in one of the games of 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.030
 most spooky terror of all 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.150
 horror games as I like it 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.439
 a lot this about horror stories 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.360
 I'm just going to tell you that it's a 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:57.310
 good story and if you want to know more 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.409
 of the sonic dot exe game and its 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.050
 history will have to search for you 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:04.379
 themselves the story and the game nothing more 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.379
 what to say 

00:05:04.929 --> 00:05:09.499
 will surely remember that in the part 

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:11.869
 earlier in this video I talked about slender 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:14.209
 Well today I'll talk about slim titubees 

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:16.189
 as already some will know or as already 

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:18.559
 you can imagine is a kind of 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:21.229
 slender man only now he chases you 

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:23.479
 tinky winky xd but do not be fooled 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.490
 the teletubbies no longer have the same 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.039
 innocent appearance of the program that 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:30.649
 we all saw now they are frightening 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.589
 some more than others and others less than 

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:35.629
 some the case is that this game like 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:37.879
 slender man his strong is terror 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:39.889
 psychological because you know they come to 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:42.019
 for you these colorful bugs but 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.269
 Despite knowing it, you do not know how or when 

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:46.159
 nor where will you get another great 

00:05:44.269 --> 00:05:48.379
 difference is that these bugs do not 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:50.479
 appear little by little when they appear 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:52.939
 they do not do it momentarily as a 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:55.069
 screamer these appear suddenly and 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:57.589
 they are scaring you screaming at you 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:59.419
 a while and also the scream they make 

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:01.939
 when they find you it's the cries 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.949
 more frightening than there may be 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:05.749
 I say that I am a person who has seen 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:08.719
 many many screamer pse in all its 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:10.909
 life xd but good if they have will and 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:13.329
 nerves of steel I recommend you play 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:13.329
 this game 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.970
 and finally we have a to the moon 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:23.520
 this indie game became popular for its 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.620
 excellent story despite being a 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.659
 game with a gameplay really 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.400
 simple its aesthetics and its history what 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:31.889
 they make not only a game of which always 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.629
 it's talked about indie games but 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:35.610
 that they also do a game that we 

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:37.349
 can make you feel feelings that you do not 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.349
 sorry with other official games 

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:42.599
 super famous is a game that undoubtedly 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:45.030
 some we must play at some time 

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:46.860
 our life is enjoyable for young people 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.870
 as adults and you do not have to be a big 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.599
 deductive to understand the plot 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.550
 personally to the moon next to that 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:56.580
 cp containment bridge are the ones that 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.530
 recommend playing for nothing so that 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.599
 it was all for today I hope they 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.639
 have liked the video and remember that 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:05.159
 that indie game that I did not mention today what 

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:08.780
 will see in the next part x of a 

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:08.780
 I greet everyone and see you next time
