what<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:06.959> see<00:04:07.139> is<00:04:07.169> my<00:04:07.650> interpretation<00:04:07.950> of

what you see is my interpretation of

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.770 
what you see is my interpretation of
Super<00:04:08.730> Bowl<00:04:08.849> because<00:04:08.940> it's<00:04:09.150> difficult<00:04:09.359> to

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
Super Bowl because it's difficult to

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.569 
Super Bowl because it's difficult to
capture<00:04:09.989> what<00:04:10.169> you<00:04:10.440> see<00:04:10.620> in<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.799> comic<00:04:11.190> if<00:04:11.400> she

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
capture what you see in the comic if she

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.390 
capture what you see in the comic if she
is<00:04:11.669> written<00:04:11.970> so<00:04:12.000> strong<00:04:12.569> and<00:04:12.810> so<00:04:12.840> just<00:04:13.400> spicy

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
is written so strong and so just spicy

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.910 
is written so strong and so just spicy
but<00:04:14.730> I<00:04:14.760> tried<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.239> bring<00:04:15.389> as<00:04:15.480> much<00:04:15.599> as

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
but I tried to bring as much as

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.000
