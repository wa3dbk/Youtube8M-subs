00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
so the Scotch TL 901 laminator this is a

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.289 
so the Scotch TL 901 laminator this is a
laminator<00:00:04.710> it's<00:00:04.950> available<00:00:05.520> very<00:00:05.730> cheaply<00:00:06.089> on

laminator it's available very cheaply on

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.030 
laminator it's available very cheaply on
Amazon<00:00:06.870> I<00:00:06.899> saw<00:00:07.350> it<00:00:07.470> on<00:00:07.560> sale<00:00:07.890> once<00:00:08.160> for<00:00:09.710> 1699<00:00:10.710> I

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
Amazon I saw it on sale once for 1699 I

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.640 
Amazon I saw it on sale once for 1699 I
paid<00:00:11.490> a<00:00:11.519> bit<00:00:11.700> more<00:00:11.940> than<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.269> for<00:00:12.509> mine<00:00:12.750> but

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
paid a bit more than that for mine but

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.560 
paid a bit more than that for mine but
my<00:00:14.160> hopes<00:00:14.429> were<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.880> use<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.360> for<00:00:16.070> PCB<00:00:17.570> toner

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
my hopes were to use this for PCB toner

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.029 
my hopes were to use this for PCB toner
transfer<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:20.510> got<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:22.560> had<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.890> make

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
transfer so I got it and I had to make

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.560 
transfer so I got it and I had to make
one<00:00:23.250> minor<00:00:23.490> modification<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.330> get<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
one minor modification to get the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.839 
one minor modification to get the
temperature<00:00:24.840> up<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.170> little<00:00:25.320> higher<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:25.859> I

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
temperature up a little higher so I

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.960 
temperature up a little higher so I
thought<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.180> would<00:00:27.330> share<00:00:27.660> with<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:28.609> how<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> did

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
thought I would share with you how I did

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.479 
thought I would share with you how I did
that<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:31.109> first<00:00:31.289> step<00:00:31.619> you're<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.340> have

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
that so first step you're going to have

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.090 
that so first step you're going to have
to<00:00:32.610> do<00:00:32.730> flip<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.660> unit<00:00:33.809> over<00:00:34.050> take<00:00:34.770> out<00:00:34.950> all

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
to do flip the unit over take out all

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.450 
to do flip the unit over take out all
the<00:00:35.219> screws<00:00:35.550> there's<00:00:35.820> six<00:00:38.600> 102<00:00:39.600> QC<00:00:40.370> one<00:00:41.370> in

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the screws there's six 102 QC one in

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.549 
the screws there's six 102 QC one in
each<00:00:41.579> corner<00:00:41.820> one<00:00:42.059> here<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.629> six<00:00:42.930> total<00:00:43.290> three

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
each corner one here so six total three

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.889 
each corner one here so six total three
on<00:00:43.680> each<00:00:43.860> side<00:00:44.090> once<00:00:45.090> you've<00:00:45.270> taken<00:00:45.480> all<00:00:45.750> those

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
on each side once you've taken all those

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.569 
on each side once you've taken all those
screws<00:00:46.320> out<00:00:49.070> two<00:00:50.070> pieces<00:00:50.570> will<00:00:51.570> separate<00:00:52.110> and

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
screws out two pieces will separate and

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.420 
screws out two pieces will separate and
you<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:53.940> kind<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.329> flop<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.350> gray<00:00:56.129> side

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
you can just kind of flop the gray side

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.569 
you can just kind of flop the gray side
over<00:00:57.020> now<00:00:58.640> if<00:00:59.690> you<00:01:00.690> look<00:01:00.960> down<00:01:01.379> here<00:01:01.920> I've<00:01:02.100> got

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
over now if you look down here I've got

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.960 
over now if you look down here I've got
pictures<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> website<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.700> check<00:01:05.700> there

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
pictures on the website so check there

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.620 
pictures on the website so check there
for<00:01:06.270> detailed<00:01:06.900> instructions<00:01:08.210> but<00:01:09.210> there's<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
for detailed instructions but there's a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.050 
for detailed instructions but there's a
little<00:01:09.869> thermistor<00:01:10.580> little<00:01:11.580> thermistor

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
little thermistor little thermistor

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.399 
little thermistor little thermistor
checks<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:13.400> temperature<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:15.450> roller<00:01:16.850> so

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
checks the temperature of the roller so

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.999 
checks the temperature of the roller so
the<00:01:19.409> wires<00:01:19.939> that<00:01:20.939> come<00:01:21.150> off<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.330> thermistor

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
the wires that come off that thermistor

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.420 
the wires that come off that thermistor
come<00:01:23.009> over<00:01:23.280> here<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.119> two<00:01:24.299> black<00:01:24.659> wires<00:01:25.430> so

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
come over here to the two black wires so

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.810 
come over here to the two black wires so
these<00:01:26.759> two<00:01:27.060> black<00:01:27.390> wires<00:01:27.689> here<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.229> this

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
these two black wires here and this

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.170 
these two black wires here and this
bundle<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:30.299> mess<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:32.009> two<00:01:32.220> black<00:01:32.520> wires<00:01:32.820> are

bundle of mess the two black wires are

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.090 
bundle of mess the two black wires are
coming<00:01:33.360> from<00:01:33.570> your<00:01:33.780> thermistor<00:01:34.110> what<00:01:34.979> you

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
coming from your thermistor what you

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.420 
coming from your thermistor what you
have<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.729> cut<00:01:36.119> one<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.750> them<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.430> here's

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
have to do is cut one of them and here's

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.460 
have to do is cut one of them and here's
what<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.640> did<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.390> temporary<00:01:39.960> solution

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
what I did is just a temporary solution

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.649 
what I did is just a temporary solution
ideally<00:01:41.189> what<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.369> want<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.700> do<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.030> put<00:01:42.630> a

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
ideally what I want to do is put a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.870 
ideally what I want to do is put a
switch<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.890> front<00:01:44.159> panel<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.700> gray

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
switch on the front panel of the gray

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.230 
switch on the front panel of the gray
part<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.329> I'm<00:01:45.509> still<00:01:45.840> waiting<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.470> switch

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
part but I'm still waiting on a switch

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.850 
part but I'm still waiting on a switch
cut<00:01:48.240> one<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.570> black<00:01:48.780> wires<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.470> put<00:01:49.829> a

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
cut one of the black wires and put a

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.380 
cut one of the black wires and put a
one-point<00:01:50.610> 2k<00:01:51.329> resistor<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.890> line<00:01:53.820> with<00:01:54.210> it

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
one-point 2k resistor in line with it

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.429 
one-point 2k resistor in line with it
now<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.759> just<00:01:56.759> strip<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.659> wire<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.020> wrapped<00:01:58.259> it

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
now I just strip the wire and wrapped it

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.889 
now I just strip the wire and wrapped it
around<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:58.979> quick<00:01:59.250> as<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> test<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.689> does

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
around just quick as a test and it does

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.050 
around just quick as a test and it does
work<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.350> raises<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.009> temperature<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.670> right

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
work it raises the temperature to right

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.210 
work it raises the temperature to right
around<00:02:04.189> 148<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.399> 150<00:02:06.210> Celsius<00:02:06.540> which<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.220> right

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
around 148 to 150 Celsius which is right

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.440 
around 148 to 150 Celsius which is right
in<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.459> ideal<00:02:08.789> range<00:02:09.119> for<00:02:09.629> toner<00:02:09.959> transfer

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
in the ideal range for toner transfer

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.530 
in the ideal range for toner transfer
and<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:13.040> can<00:02:13.220> take<00:02:13.459> that<00:02:13.610> resistor<00:02:14.090> back<00:02:14.270> out

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
and you can take that resistor back out

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.630 
and you can take that resistor back out
connect<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.349> two<00:02:15.500> wires<00:02:15.739> back<00:02:16.040> together<00:02:16.250> and

specifically<00:02:27.050> I<00:02:27.379> checked<00:02:28.220> and<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:29.630> was<00:02:29.989> high

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
specifically I checked and it was high

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.170 
specifically I checked and it was high
enough<00:02:31.510> was<00:02:32.510> I<00:02:32.720> believe<00:02:33.190> 188<00:02:34.190> Celsius<00:02:34.910> or

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
enough was I believe 188 Celsius or

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.150 
enough was I believe 188 Celsius or
something<00:02:35.480> like<00:02:35.569> that<00:02:35.780> but<00:02:36.349> check<00:02:36.830> yours

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
something like that but check yours

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.750 
something like that but check yours
before<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:37.760> do<00:02:37.940> this<00:02:38.120> because<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:40.310> could

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
before you do this because you could

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.420 
before you do this because you could
potentially<00:02:41.260> burn<00:02:42.260> out<00:02:42.500> that<00:02:42.530> thermal<00:02:43.099> fuse

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
potentially burn out that thermal fuse

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.250 
potentially burn out that thermal fuse
if<00:02:44.380> it<00:02:45.380> were<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.400> or<00:02:47.120> if<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.599> thing<00:02:47.900> were<00:02:48.080> to

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
if it were to or if the thing were to

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.059 
if it were to or if the thing were to
start<00:02:48.739> over<00:02:48.890> heating<00:02:49.340> so<00:02:50.590> make<00:02:51.590> sure<00:02:51.620> that

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
start over heating so make sure that

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.190 
start over heating so make sure that
your<00:02:52.430> thermal<00:02:52.819> fuse<00:02:53.090> is<00:02:53.890> rated<00:02:54.890> for<00:02:55.340> over<00:02:56.200> 150

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
your thermal fuse is rated for over 150

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.280 
your thermal fuse is rated for over 150

don't<00:03:00.500> know<00:03:00.860> if<00:03:01.040> it's<00:03:01.730> different<00:03:02.450> for<00:03:02.930> each

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
don't know if it's different for each

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.710 
don't know if it's different for each

unit or how they manufacture these I

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.479 
unit or how they manufacture these I
only<00:03:05.900> have<00:03:06.140> one<00:03:07.780> unit<00:03:08.780> obviously<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.860> use<00:03:10.280> as

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
only have one unit obviously to use as

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.490 
only have one unit obviously to use as
an<00:03:10.640> example<00:03:10.840> but<00:03:11.840> once<00:03:12.079> you<00:03:12.230> put<00:03:12.440> that

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
an example but once you put that

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.900 
an example but once you put that
resistor<00:03:13.130> in<00:03:13.280> I<00:03:13.489> hooked<00:03:14.239> in<00:03:14.599> a<00:03:15.489> couple<00:03:16.489> extra

little jumper wires into that those two
black<00:03:19.880> ones<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:20.630> I<00:03:20.660> could<00:03:20.900> monitor<00:03:21.500> the

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
black ones so that I could monitor the

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.430 
black ones so that I could monitor the
temperature<00:03:22.790> with<00:03:23.450> my<00:03:23.840> multimeter<00:03:26.319> with<00:03:27.319> the

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
temperature with my multimeter with the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.720 
temperature with my multimeter with the
lid<00:03:27.620> on<00:03:27.859> and<00:03:28.160> again<00:03:29.560> information<00:03:30.560> on<00:03:30.739> the

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
lid on and again information on the

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.849 
lid on and again information on the
values<00:03:32.359> I<00:03:32.660> found<00:03:32.989> for<00:03:33.790> what<00:03:35.380> what<00:03:36.380> was<00:03:36.560> what

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
values I found for what what was what

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.550 
values I found for what what was what
what<00:03:37.850> temperature<00:03:38.420> related<00:03:38.900> to<00:03:39.109> what<00:03:39.290> voltage

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
what temperature related to what voltage

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.599 
what temperature related to what voltage
is<00:03:40.010> all<00:03:40.700> on<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.000> website<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:42.769> link<00:03:43.459> to

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
is all on the website and the link to

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.280 
is all on the website and the link to
that<00:03:43.639> post<00:03:43.970> is<00:03:44.239> in<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.389> description<00:03:45.049> so<00:03:45.260> go

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
that post is in the description so go

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.349 
that post is in the description so go
there<00:03:45.709> for<00:03:45.980> all<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.760> detailed<00:03:47.180> information

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
there for all the detailed information

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.300 
there for all the detailed information
but<00:03:47.810> essentially<00:03:48.470> this<00:03:48.590> is<00:03:48.650> all<00:03:48.920> you'll<00:03:49.100> need

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
but essentially this is all you'll need

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.490 
but essentially this is all you'll need
to<00:03:49.400> do<00:03:49.549> to<00:03:50.269> get<00:03:50.480> this<00:03:50.840> laminator<00:03:52.060> ready<00:03:53.060> to

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
to do to get this laminator ready to

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.949 
to do to get this laminator ready to
transfer<00:03:54.500> tone<00:03:54.739> around<00:03:55.010> your<00:03:55.220> PCBs<00:03:55.670> so<00:03:56.599> thanks

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
transfer tone around your PCBs so thanks

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.440 
transfer tone around your PCBs so thanks
for<00:03:57.079> watching
