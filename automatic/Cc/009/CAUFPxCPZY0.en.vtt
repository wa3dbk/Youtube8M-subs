00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 yo faka gamers glaze like you 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.589
 probably noticed it is 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.080
 today and also the next few days 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.240
 incredibly warm in the Netherlands and that is possible 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.099
 the heat is of course very cool 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.719
 is an excellent reason to socialize with 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.940
 a few friends to the pool too 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.529
 but the heat can also be very bad 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.449
 be dangerous 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.460
 and therefore I have for you 5 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.380
 tips put on a list where you know the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.170
 heat of the next few days 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.570
 certainly about life this number 1 concern 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.189
 make sure you drink enough and then 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.620
 I do not mean lemonade or other 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.050
 sweets but especially make sure that 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.879
 you get enough water 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.950
 water is very important 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.170
 prevent your body from drying out 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.149
 this heat and then free tip for me 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.140
 filling is once a time 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.450
 liter bottle 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.910
 just grow that bottle with tap water 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.800
 in the fridge and after half an hour until 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.199
 one hour you have a liter 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.190
 delicious chilled water specially for you 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.620
 to cool your body again 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.649
 tip number two make sure you get the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.719
 doors windows and the curtains so much 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.880
 possibly closed this is namely 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.890
 a very easy way to handle the heat 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.140
 so keep the room outside 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.510
 temperature stays nice and cool 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.060
 tip number 3 make sure you get that fast 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.020
 possibly a number of fans in the house 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.640
 gets it 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.960
 certainly nowadays one thing really has to be done 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.350
 no more than a tenner at the blocker 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.360
 to cost but be on time 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.280
 certainly with this heat it can happen very quickly 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.200
 prevent the stores from completing completely 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.689
 out of stock and then you are 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.759
 without and nice refreshing breeze 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.770
 tip number four wear as much as possible 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.079
 white or at least light clothing 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.329
 what I am wearing now is very 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.490
 foolishly loves dark clothing 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.470
 the heat is very solid 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.110
 light clothing, on the other hand, cheese 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.189
 heat back so that you yourself tasty 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.780
 stays cool 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.729
 and finally of course tip number five 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.189
 make sure you do as much as possible 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.619
 stay inside and minimize yourself 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.869
 effort becomes nice and cold foot bath 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.250
 put a large glass of ice cold water 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.960
 next to you on the table 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.610
 then you go the next few days 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.079
 completely survive 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.479
