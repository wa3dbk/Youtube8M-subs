00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
system lying down and you'll still have

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.249 
system lying down and you'll still have
access<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.240> everything<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.780> logo<00:00:13.049> will

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
want to have a stand Sony's got this

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.910 
want to have a stand Sony's got this
stand<00:00:41.309> here<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:42.420> they're<00:00:42.570> selling<00:00:42.899> for<00:00:43.110> $15

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
stand here that they're selling for $15

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.049 
stand here that they're selling for $15
and<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.850> got<00:00:45.379> angles<00:00:46.379> as<00:00:46.649> well<00:00:46.879> just<00:00:47.879> like

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and it's got angles as well just like

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.450 
and it's got angles as well just like
the<00:00:48.120> unit<00:00:48.510> itself<00:00:48.860> so<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.920> put<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.190> stand

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the unit itself so you put the stand

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.290 
the unit itself so you put the stand
down<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.980> you<00:00:52.980> put<00:00:53.399> these<00:00:53.670> sort<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.059> rubber

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
down and you put these sort of rubber

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.709 
down and you put these sort of rubber
nubs<00:00:54.750> into<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> grooves<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.879> system<00:00:57.420> and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
nubs into the grooves of the system and

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.160 
nubs into the grooves of the system and
then<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.800> turn<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.090> locking<00:01:00.539> mechanism

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
then you turn the locking mechanism

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.910 
then you turn the locking mechanism
wheels<00:01:02.390> so<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.660> locks<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.650> can

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
wheels so that this locks so that I can

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.050 
wheels so that this locks so that I can
hold<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.939> let's<00:01:06.750> say<00:01:06.930> secure<00:01:07.439> firm<00:01:07.770> right<00:01:08.070> and

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
hold it let's say secure firm right and

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.630 
hold it let's say secure firm right and
then<00:01:09.360> when<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.659> put<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:09.990> down<00:01:12.830> more<00:01:13.830> stable<00:01:14.250> so

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
then when I put it down more stable so

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.190 
then when I put it down more stable so
it's<00:01:14.760> still<00:01:14.939> going<00:01:15.119> wobble<00:01:15.659> if<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.840> poke<00:01:16.049> it

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
it's still going wobble if I poke it

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.899 
it's still going wobble if I poke it
your<00:01:16.409> cat<00:01:16.590> may<00:01:16.799> still<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.100> able<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.400> do<00:01:17.729> things
