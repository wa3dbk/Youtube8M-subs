phloem at 30 30 series flowmasters
full-length<00:00:43.570> tubes<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:45.460> it<00:00:46.330> really<00:00:46.900> the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
full-length tubes and it really the

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.080 
full-length tubes and it really the
motor<00:00:47.410> just<00:00:47.650> overpowers<00:00:48.310> the<00:00:48.460> flow<00:00:48.640> masters

motor just overpowers the flow masters

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.430 
motor just overpowers the flow masters
and<00:00:49.239> they<00:00:49.300> really<00:00:49.600> do<00:00:49.720> the<00:00:49.840> end<00:00:49.960> up<00:00:50.050> coming<00:00:50.320> out

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
and they really do the end up coming out

00:00:50.440 --> 00:01:20.640 
and they really do the end up coming out
and<00:00:50.530> sounded<00:00:50.830> really<00:00:51.010> good

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.470 

and<00:01:20.890> then<00:01:21.400> we'll<00:01:21.550> stay<00:01:21.790> right<00:01:21.820> there<00:01:22.090> you're

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
and then we'll stay right there you're

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.830 
and then we'll stay right there you're
already<00:01:22.750> sitting<00:01:23.110> at<00:01:23.380> 80<00:01:24.240> before<00:01:25.240> you<00:01:25.630> even

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
already sitting at 80 before you even

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.050 
already sitting at 80 before you even
get<00:01:26.080> very<00:01:26.320> far<00:01:26.620> into<00:01:26.920> third<00:01:27.130> gear

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
get very far into third gear

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.480 
get very far into third gear
I<00:01:29.149> gotta<00:01:29.840> say<00:01:30.049> it's<00:01:30.320> a<00:01:30.470> lot<00:01:30.680> of<00:01:30.710> fun<00:01:31.040> although

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
I gotta say it's a lot of fun although

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.840 
I gotta say it's a lot of fun although
the<00:01:31.670> gas<00:01:31.880> mileage<00:01:32.450> certainly<00:01:32.930> isn't<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:34.310> 33

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
the gas mileage certainly isn't the 33

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.580 
the gas mileage certainly isn't the 33
miles<00:01:35.060> again<00:01:35.360> I<00:01:35.420> used<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:35.960> be<00:01:36.049> able<00:01:36.140> to<00:01:36.290> get<00:01:36.439> on

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
miles again I used to be able to get on

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.420 
miles again I used to be able to get on
a<00:01:36.619> good<00:01:36.710> day<00:01:37.100> I<00:01:38.530> must<00:01:39.530> say<00:01:39.649> it<00:01:39.829> at<00:01:40.159> least<00:01:40.369> has

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
a good day I must say it at least has

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.249 
a good day I must say it at least has
actually<00:01:43.430> slightly<00:01:43.670> surpassed<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.570> ratio<00:01:45.140> of

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
actually slightly surpassed the ratio of

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.600 
actually slightly surpassed the ratio of
horsepower<00:01:46.100> for<00:01:46.549> miles<00:01:47.270> per<00:01:47.600> gallon<00:01:48.110> of

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
horsepower for miles per gallon of

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.870 
horsepower for miles per gallon of
dropping<00:01:49.610> you<00:01:49.759> know<00:01:49.880> from<00:01:50.210> 33<00:01:51.110> down<00:01:51.409> to<00:01:51.619> about

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
dropping you know from 33 down to about

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.889 
dropping you know from 33 down to about
16<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:53.090> 18<00:01:53.600> but<00:01:54.670> by<00:01:55.670> far<00:01:56.000> doubling<00:01:56.750> the

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
16 to 18 but by far doubling the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.580 
16 to 18 but by far doubling the
horsepower<00:01:58.060> so<00:01:59.060> I<00:01:59.450> can't<00:01:59.810> complain<00:02:00.170> too<00:02:00.229> much

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
horsepower so I can't complain too much

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.270 
horsepower so I can't complain too much
I<00:02:00.770> knew<00:02:00.920> it<00:02:01.069> was<00:02:01.280> going<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:01.640> be<00:02:01.759> bad<00:02:03.159> you<00:02:04.159> know

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
I knew it was going to be bad you know

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.840 
I knew it was going to be bad you know
whenever<00:02:04.549> I<00:02:05.080> did<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.259> swap<00:02:06.530> but<00:02:07.009> that's<00:02:07.670> just

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
whenever I did the swap but that's just

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.660 
whenever I did the swap but that's just
one<00:02:08.060> of<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.179> things<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:08.750> pay<00:02:08.959> for<00:02:09.190> having<00:02:10.190> fun

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
one of the things you pay for having fun

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.460 
one of the things you pay for having fun
so

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.060 

is<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.190> worth<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.580> yeah<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:15.820> think<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:16.630> but<00:02:17.070> it's

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
is it worth it yeah I think so but it's

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.600 
is it worth it yeah I think so but it's
definitely<00:02:19.620> takes<00:02:20.620> some<00:02:20.740> more<00:02:21.010> maintenance

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
definitely takes some more maintenance

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.160 
definitely takes some more maintenance
and<00:02:22.650> care<00:02:23.650> than<00:02:23.980> what<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.280> used<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:24.670> but<00:02:25.390> sure

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
and care than what it used to but sure

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.520 
and care than what it used to but sure
it's<00:02:26.440> an<00:02:26.560> overall<00:02:26.800> blast<00:02:27.250> not<00:02:27.580> having<00:02:27.970> done

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
it's an overall blast not having done

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.080 
it's an overall blast not having done
you<00:02:29.530> know<00:02:29.620> just<00:02:29.800> being<00:02:29.890> able<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.190> smile<00:02:30.610> at<00:02:30.910> the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
you know just being able to smile at the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.050 
you know just being able to smile at the
the<00:02:32.050> kids<00:02:32.380> out<00:02:32.680> on<00:02:32.710> the<00:02:32.890> roads<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.580> know<00:02:33.790> and

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
the kids out on the roads you know and

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.760 
the kids out on the roads you know and
not<00:02:34.180> even<00:02:34.420> having<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.810> try<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.140> race<00:02:35.440> it<00:02:35.650> good

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
not even having to try to race it good

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.390 
not even having to try to race it good
you<00:02:35.890> know<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:36.100> can<00:02:36.370> beat<00:02:36.580> them<00:02:36.700> easily<00:02:37.380> but

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
you know you can beat them easily but

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.860 
you know you can beat them easily but
that's<00:02:39.400> all<00:02:39.610> part<00:02:39.910> of<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.240> it's<00:02:40.390> definitely<00:02:40.840> a

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
that's all part of it it's definitely a

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.480 
that's all part of it it's definitely a
lot<00:02:41.170> more<00:02:41.380> fun

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.550 

you
