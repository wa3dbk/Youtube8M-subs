about a thousand pounds of pressure into
their<00:00:51.030> punches<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:52.289> there<00:00:53.070> are<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.250> lot<00:00:53.370> of

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.930 
different ways to punch you'll see a lot
of<00:00:55.800> people<00:00:56.489> maybe<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:58.199> Wing<00:00:59.100> Chun<00:00:59.430> system

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
of people maybe in the Wing Chun system

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.900 
of people maybe in the Wing Chun system
and<00:01:00.120> some<00:01:00.300> crew<00:01:00.510> systems<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.739> they<00:01:02.160> punch

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and some crew systems that they punch

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.240 
and some crew systems that they punch
centerline<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.750> which<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:05.010> there's

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
centerline and which is if there's

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.380 
centerline and which is if there's
nothing<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.580> don't<00:01:05.640> want<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.880> say<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.150> one's

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
nothing I don't want to say that one's

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.850 
nothing I don't want to say that one's
better<00:01:06.630> than<00:01:06.720> another<00:01:06.900> just<00:01:07.290> different<00:01:07.590> one

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
better than another just different one

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.380 
better than another just different one
you'll<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.070> able<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.369> throw<00:01:08.520> faster<00:01:09.000> punches

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
you'll be able to throw faster punches

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.070 
you'll be able to throw faster punches
but<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.229> minimize<00:01:10.680> some<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:10.979> your<00:01:11.159> power

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
but you minimize some of your power

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.630 
but you minimize some of your power
because<00:01:13.080> you're<00:01:13.439> stopping<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> rotation<00:01:14.490> of

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
because you're stopping the rotation of

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.280 
because you're stopping the rotation of
your<00:01:14.790> shoulders<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.900> know<00:01:16.020> some<00:01:16.200> people

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
your shoulders you know some people

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.590 
your shoulders you know some people
would<00:01:16.530> disagree<00:01:16.770> but<00:01:17.210> that's<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.450> my

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
would disagree but that's just my

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.039 
would disagree but that's just my
opinion

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
opinion

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.530 
opinion
so<00:01:19.470> just<00:01:20.100> similarly<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:21.060> way<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.420> we're

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
so just similarly the way that we're

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.609 
so just similarly the way that we're
gonna<00:01:21.600> try<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.930> throw<00:01:22.170> right<00:01:22.380> now<00:01:22.470> and

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
gonna try to throw right now and

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.240 
gonna try to throw right now and
practice<00:01:23.040> throwing<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:24.150> right<00:01:24.450> cross<00:01:25.250> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
practice throwing a right cross and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.730 
practice throwing a right cross and
trying<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.610> throw<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.880> as<00:01:27.030> hard<00:01:27.060> as<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.479> can

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
trying to throw it as hard as you can

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.520 
trying to throw it as hard as you can
it's<00:01:29.189> kind<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.490> similar<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:30.479> imagine<00:01:31.229> holding

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
it's kind of similar to imagine holding

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.740 
it's kind of similar to imagine holding
a<00:01:31.619> baseball<00:01:32.070> bat<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.240> want<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.479> swing<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
a baseball bat and you want to swing the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.170 
a baseball bat and you want to swing the
baseball<00:01:34.049> bat<00:01:34.200> I'm<00:01:34.409> not<00:01:34.560> standing<00:01:34.860> square<00:01:35.549> to

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
baseball bat I'm not standing square to

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.840 
baseball bat I'm not standing square to
swing<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.479> baseball<00:01:36.840> bat<00:01:37.020> I'm<00:01:37.500> having<00:01:38.159> one

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
swing the baseball bat I'm having one

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.969 
swing the baseball bat I'm having one
foot<00:01:39.090> forward<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.810> really<00:01:40.259> movement<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
foot forward and really movement of the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.190 
foot forward and really movement of the
baseball<00:01:41.430> bat<00:01:41.610> starts<00:01:42.060> with<00:01:42.180> my<00:01:42.329> feet<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
baseball bat starts with my feet the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.530 
baseball bat starts with my feet the
feet<00:01:43.409> then<00:01:43.890> who<00:01:44.220> we've<00:01:44.790> been<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.030> moves<00:01:45.180> up<00:01:45.390> to

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
feet then who we've been it moves up to

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.789 
feet then who we've been it moves up to
my<00:01:45.659> hips<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.079> then<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.710> extend<00:01:47.490> using<00:01:48.360> my<00:01:48.509> hands

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
my hips and then I extend using my hands

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.249 
my hips and then I extend using my hands
so<00:01:49.799> very<00:01:50.729> similar<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:52.049> how<00:01:52.200> you

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
so very similar to this is how you

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.749 
so very similar to this is how you
punching<00:01:52.979> when<00:01:53.909> you<00:01:54.509> throw<00:01:54.810> your<00:01:54.990> right<00:01:55.110> cross

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
punching when you throw your right cross

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.249 
punching when you throw your right cross
it's<00:01:56.759> not<00:01:57.030> I'm<00:01:57.299> not<00:01:57.450> throwing<00:01:57.630> with<00:01:57.869> my<00:01:57.990> hand

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
it's not I'm not throwing with my hand

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.550 
it's not I'm not throwing with my hand
I'm<00:01:59.159> throwing<00:01:59.520> with<00:02:00.030> my<00:02:00.180> body<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:01.350> whole

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
I'm throwing with my body the whole

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
is to get proper range you're gonna

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.530 
is to get proper range you're gonna
touch<00:02:13.600> glove<00:02:14.020> with<00:02:14.680> your<00:02:14.830> left<00:02:15.040> hand<00:02:15.310> and<00:02:15.610> then

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
quite a bit that I can extend so imagine

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.460 
quite a bit that I can extend so imagine
if<00:02:21.460> this<00:02:21.640> word<00:02:21.880> I'm<00:02:21.970> connecting<00:02:22.480> is<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.720> piece
