00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
and that break goes about halfway

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:40.540 
and that break goes about halfway
halfway<00:00:32.669> through<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.180> nail<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:37.670> little<00:00:38.670> bumps

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
halfway through the nail so little bumps

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.400 
halfway through the nail so little bumps
I'm<00:00:41.550> going<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.850> buff<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.780> out<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.960> little<00:00:43.170> more

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
and see if I can get rid of those little

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.619 
and see if I can get rid of those little
bumps<00:00:46.320> without<00:00:46.829> removing<00:00:47.820> too<00:00:48.030> much<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
bumps without removing too much of the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.040 
bumps without removing too much of the
nail<00:00:49.050> glue<00:00:49.410> there<00:00:52.489> shouldn't<00:00:53.489> be<00:00:53.520> too<00:00:53.730> bad

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
nail glue there shouldn't be too bad

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.260 
nail glue there shouldn't be too bad
plus<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.289> base<00:00:55.440> coat<00:00:55.739> will<00:00:56.129> smooth<00:00:57.059> them<00:00:57.180> out

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
plus the base coat will smooth them out

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.369 
plus the base coat will smooth them out
a<00:00:57.539> little<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:58.579> way<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.789> Polish<00:01:00.719> goes<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.170> a

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
a little that way the Polish goes on a

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:11.090 
a little that way the Polish goes on a
little<00:01:01.500> nicer

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:24.950 

there's<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.060> side<00:01:12.330> there<00:01:14.810> looks<00:01:15.810> okay

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:38.870 

it's<00:01:25.530> my<00:01:25.740> measurements<00:01:32.000> almost<00:01:33.000> an<00:01:33.300> inch<00:01:37.850> so<00:01:38.850> I

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
it's my measurements almost an inch so I

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.350 
it's my measurements almost an inch so I
thought<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.210> would<00:01:39.300> reach<00:01:40.259> an<00:01:40.560> inch<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:41.360> two

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
thought I would reach an inch in two

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.600 
thought I would reach an inch in two
weeks<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:43.050> I'm<00:01:43.290> not<00:01:43.650> going<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.950> do<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.070> it's

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
weeks but I'm not going to do that it's

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.780 
weeks but I'm not going to do that it's
just<00:01:44.880> not<00:01:44.909> going<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.149> happen<00:01:46.430> no<00:01:47.430> way<00:01:47.640> i<00:01:49.790> would

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
just not going to happen no way i would

00:01:50.790 --> 00:02:10.930 
just not going to happen no way i would
say<00:01:51.180> another<00:01:51.509> three<00:01:52.020> weeks

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:23.000 

oh<00:02:11.000> there<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.020> go

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.080 

my<00:02:23.580> right<00:02:23.819> hand<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:25.129> little<00:02:26.129> too<00:02:26.489> close<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.760> the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
my right hand a little too close to the

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:38.420 
my right hand a little too close to the
camera<00:02:27.360> there<00:02:27.659> I<00:02:27.930> think<00:02:36.739> it's<00:02:37.739> a<00:02:37.890> little<00:02:38.010> a

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
camera there I think it's a little a

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.880 
camera there I think it's a little a
little<00:02:39.230> difficult<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.440> way<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.590> have<00:02:40.769> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
little difficult the way I have the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.430 
little difficult the way I have the
camera<00:02:41.250> on<00:02:41.400> my<00:02:41.579> desk<00:02:41.819> right<00:02:42.060> now<00:02:42.409> it's<00:02:43.409> a

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
camera on my desk right now it's a

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.699 
camera on my desk right now it's a
little<00:02:43.470> too<00:02:43.890> close<00:02:44.159> to<00:02:44.190> my<00:02:44.640> nails<00:02:45.560> gonna<00:02:46.560> have

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
little too close to my nails gonna have

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.319 
little too close to my nails gonna have
to<00:02:46.829> fix<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.190> for<00:02:47.670> my<00:02:47.819> next<00:02:48.030> videos<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:51.120> looks

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
to fix that for my next videos it looks

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:56.360 
to fix that for my next videos it looks
it<00:02:51.599> looks<00:02:51.659> nice<00:02:52.579> it's<00:02:53.579> in<00:02:53.760> focus<00:02:53.909> but<00:02:55.370> it

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
it looks nice it's in focus but it

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.809 
it looks nice it's in focus but it
shouldn't<00:02:56.700> be<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.849> close<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.450> my<00:02:57.840> nails<00:02:58.079> I

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
shouldn't be that close to my nails I

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:16.600 
shouldn't be that close to my nails I
think

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.630 

it's<00:03:17.060> always<00:03:17.180> hard<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.570> measure<00:03:17.810> that<00:03:18.110> nail

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
it's always hard to measure that nail

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.700 
it's always hard to measure that nail
because<00:03:19.640> I<00:03:19.910> have<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.330> tea<00:03:20.540> bag<00:03:20.780> on<00:03:21.140> that<00:03:21.500> nail

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
because I have the tea bag on that nail

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.420 
because I have the tea bag on that nail
not<00:03:22.460> just<00:03:22.760> on<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.090> top<00:03:23.960> but<00:03:24.350> also<00:03:24.500> on<00:03:25.100> the

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
not just on the top but also on the

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.790 
not just on the top but also on the
bottom<00:03:25.900> just<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:27.110> make<00:03:27.230> sure<00:03:27.260> that<00:03:27.590> nail

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
bottom just to make sure that nail

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.820 
bottom just to make sure that nail
doesn't<00:03:28.190> go<00:03:28.310> anywhere<00:03:29.200> it's<00:03:30.200> always<00:03:30.320> bad<00:03:30.770> when

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
doesn't go anywhere it's always bad when

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.340 
doesn't go anywhere it's always bad when
you<00:03:31.550> lose<00:03:31.880> a<00:03:31.910> nail<00:03:32.240> and<00:03:32.510> you<00:03:32.630> have<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.930> look<00:03:33.080> for

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
you lose a nail and you have to look for

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.600 
you lose a nail and you have to look for
it<00:03:33.380> or<00:03:34.630> you<00:03:35.630> know<00:03:35.780> it's<00:03:36.770> always<00:03:36.890> nice<00:03:37.250> when<00:03:37.430> a

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
it or you know it's always nice when a

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.900 
it or you know it's always nice when a
nail<00:03:37.880> breaks<00:03:38.240> but<00:03:38.750> it's<00:03:38.930> still<00:03:39.170> attached

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
nail breaks but it's still attached

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.210 
nail breaks but it's still attached
that's<00:03:40.910> a<00:03:41.090> good<00:03:41.240> break<00:03:43.060> or<00:03:44.060> I<00:03:44.780> like<00:03:45.740> to<00:03:45.770> think<00:03:46.040> a

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
that's a good break or I like to think a

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.610 
that's a good break or I like to think a
good<00:03:46.370> break<00:03:46.610> is<00:03:46.850> when<00:03:47.540> the<00:03:47.690> break<00:03:47.900> is<00:03:47.930> towards

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
good break is when the break is towards

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.500 
good break is when the break is towards
the<00:03:48.950> tip<00:03:49.160> not<00:03:49.700> towards<00:03:50.510> the<00:03:50.570> smile<00:03:50.959> line<00:03:52.510> I've

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
the tip not towards the smile line I've

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.990 
the tip not towards the smile line I've
had<00:03:53.780> all<00:03:54.260> kinds<00:03:54.860> of<00:03:54.920> breaks<00:03:55.220> and<00:03:55.959> I<00:03:57.970> like<00:03:58.970> the

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
had all kinds of breaks and I like the
