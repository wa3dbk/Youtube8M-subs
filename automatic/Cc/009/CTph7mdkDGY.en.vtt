as a follow-up to our jelton casting
that<00:00:03.929> we<00:00:04.080> made<00:00:04.319> in<00:00:04.500> our<00:00:04.620> alginate<00:00:05.220> mold<00:00:05.490> we're

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
that we made in our alginate mold we're

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.810 
that we made in our alginate mold we're
going<00:00:06.390> to<00:00:06.509> make<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.720> jelton<00:00:07.470> casting<00:00:08.130> softened

retain its strength and shape as well as
by<00:00:23.760> adding<00:00:24.210> silicone<00:00:24.720> fluid<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.230> can<00:00:25.380> also

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
by adding silicone fluid you can also

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.160 
by adding silicone fluid you can also
lower<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.699> viscosity<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.420> gelatin<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
lower the viscosity of gelatin to the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.470 
lower the viscosity of gelatin to the
point<00:00:28.439> where<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.740> will<00:00:28.980> not<00:00:29.220> trap<00:00:29.609> any<00:00:30.150> air

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480

bubbles<00:00:31.340> now<00:00:32.340> keep<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.730> mind<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.360> more

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
bubbles now keep in mind the more

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.260 
bubbles now keep in mind the more
silicone<00:00:34.020> fluid<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.559> add<00:00:34.739> also<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.670> that

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
silicone fluid you add also that that

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.240 
silicone fluid you add also that that
will<00:00:36.420> also<00:00:36.540> impair<00:00:37.079> some<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.530> painting<00:00:37.980> so

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
will also impair some of the painting so

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.380 
will also impair some of the painting so
here<00:00:39.149> we're<00:00:39.329> going<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.600> add<00:00:39.809> about<00:00:40.879> 50%<00:00:41.879> fluid

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
here we're going to add about 50% fluid

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.410 
here we're going to add about 50% fluid
to<00:00:42.570> 50%<00:00:43.050> mix<00:00:43.649> gel<00:00:44.070> tin<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.730> about<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> hundred

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
to 50% mix gel tin so about a hundred

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.350 
to 50% mix gel tin so about a hundred
percent<00:00:45.539> fluid<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.500> our<00:00:46.620> total<00:00:47.010> weight<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.550> gel

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
percent fluid to our total weight of gel

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.439 
percent fluid to our total weight of gel
10<00:00:48.800> now<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:49.860> started<00:00:50.340> by<00:00:50.489> mixing<00:00:50.789> out<00:00:51.180> our<00:00:51.329> a

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
10 now we started by mixing out our a

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.240 
10 now we started by mixing out our a
and<00:00:51.600> B<00:00:51.780> we've<00:00:52.050> already<00:00:52.289> mixed<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.890> one

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
and B we've already mixed in one

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.650 
and B we've already mixed in one
component<00:00:53.640> we're<00:00:53.940> about<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.239> add<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.390> other

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
component we're about to add the other

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.099 
component we're about to add the other
and<00:00:55.309> here<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.730> fill<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.300> our<00:00:57.570> mold<00:00:57.870> we're

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
and here to fill this our mold we're

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.349 
and here to fill this our mold we're
going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.440> mix<00:00:58.649> up<00:00:58.859> 32<00:00:59.460> ounces<00:00:59.879> total

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
going to mix up 32 ounces total

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.810 
going to mix up 32 ounces total
so<00:01:00.570> I'm<00:01:00.719> measuring<00:01:01.199> out<00:01:01.410> eight<00:01:01.980> ounces<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
so I'm measuring out eight ounces of a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.630 
so I'm measuring out eight ounces of a
and<00:01:03.180> 8<00:01:03.449> ounces<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.930> B<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.470> our<00:01:04.680> Platts<00:01:05.010> ill<00:01:05.280> gel

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.350 
and 8 ounces of B of our Platts ill gel
tin<00:01:06.619> now<00:01:07.619> we're<00:01:07.799> not<00:01:07.890> retarding<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.610> any<00:01:08.820> so

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
tin now we're not retarding this any so

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.840 
tin now we're not retarding this any so
keep<00:01:09.600> in<00:01:09.720> mind<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.260> gel<00:01:10.560> tin<00:01:10.830> has<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> six

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
keep in mind that gel tin has a six

at<00:01:14.490> 70<00:01:15.090> degrees<00:01:16.009> adding<00:01:17.009> silicone<00:01:17.580> fluid<00:01:17.820> will

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
at 70 degrees adding silicone fluid will

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.230 
at 70 degrees adding silicone fluid will
slow<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.170> down<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.380> little<00:01:19.500> bit<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:20.880> want<00:01:21.060> to

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
slow it down a little bit so we want to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.140 
slow it down a little bit so we want to
allow<00:01:21.600> about<00:01:22.229> an<00:01:22.560> hour<00:01:23.009> for<00:01:23.490> our<00:01:23.580> D<00:01:23.759> mold<00:01:24.000> time

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
allow about an hour for our D mold time

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.270 
allow about an hour for our D mold time
now<00:01:27.150> here<00:01:27.420> I'm<00:01:27.540> measuring<00:01:27.840> out<00:01:28.200> 16<00:01:28.950> fluid

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
now here I'm measuring out 16 fluid

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.170 
now here I'm measuring out 16 fluid
ounces<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:30.590> silicone<00:01:31.590> fluid<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:34.970> we're<00:01:35.970> going

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
ounces of silicone fluid and we're going

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.440 
ounces of silicone fluid and we're going
to<00:01:36.240> stir<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.869> into<00:01:37.500> our<00:01:37.710> jelton<00:01:38.310> mixture<00:01:38.820> so

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
to stir that into our jelton mixture so

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
to stir that into our jelton mixture so
we're<00:01:39.630> using<00:01:39.930> an<00:01:40.229> equal<00:01:40.799> volume<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:42.470> silicone

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
we're using an equal volume of silicone

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.170 
we're using an equal volume of silicone
fluid<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.189> our<00:01:44.549> Platt<00:01:44.939> SIL<00:01:45.240> gel<00:01:45.570> ten

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.230 

now<00:01:51.930> we're<00:01:52.650> going<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.980> stir<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.280> up<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.880> add

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
now we're going to stir that up and add

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.420 
now we're going to stir that up and add
our<00:01:54.270> pigments<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.170> again<00:01:55.890> we're<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.310> to

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
our pigments and again we're going to

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.360 
our pigments and again we're going to
pigment<00:01:56.970> this<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.510> a<00:01:57.690> a<00:01:58.080> basic<00:01:58.740> flesh<00:01:59.070> tone

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
pigment this just a a basic flesh tone

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.530 
pigment this just a a basic flesh tone
using<00:02:00.240> some<00:02:00.810> flesh<00:02:01.290> colored<00:02:01.680> flocking<00:02:02.310> and

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
using some flesh colored flocking and

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.390 
using some flesh colored flocking and
some<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.600> our<00:02:03.750> flesh<00:02:04.170> colored<00:02:04.620> silicon

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
some of our flesh colored silicon

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.090 
some of our flesh colored silicon
pigment<00:02:05.990> now<00:02:06.990> we<00:02:07.050> want<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.470> add<00:02:07.620> a<00:02:07.650> little<00:02:07.920> bit

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
pigment now we want to add a little bit

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.340 
pigment now we want to add a little bit
more<00:02:08.130> pigment<00:02:08.820> than<00:02:08.970> we<00:02:09.090> normally<00:02:09.270> would<00:02:09.540> when

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
more pigment than we normally would when

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.980 
more pigment than we normally would when
we're<00:02:10.530> just<00:02:10.710> molding<00:02:11.580> with<00:02:11.730> straight<00:02:12.240> gel<00:02:12.630> tin

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
we're just molding with straight gel tin

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.510 
we're just molding with straight gel tin
the<00:02:13.590> reason<00:02:13.980> here<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.910> silicone<00:02:15.780> fluid

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
the reason here is the silicone fluid

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.030 
the reason here is the silicone fluid
makes<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.880> Platte<00:02:18.540> SIL<00:02:18.810> gelatin<00:02:19.290> even<00:02:19.770> more

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040

it's<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:56.640> good<00:02:56.670> idea<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.180> make<00:02:57.330> sure<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.600> spend

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
it's a good idea to make sure you spend

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.009 
it's a good idea to make sure you spend
plenty<00:02:58.140> of<00:02:58.350> time<00:02:58.530> mixing<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.480> that<00:03:00.480> pigment

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
plenty of time mixing that that pigment

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.770 
plenty of time mixing that that pigment

sometimes<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.930> has<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.050> tendency<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:05.239> suspend

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
sometimes it has a tendency to suspend

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.820 
sometimes it has a tendency to suspend

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
that it has - it is very much like a

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.030 
that it has - it is very much like a
real<00:04:39.360> flesh<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:40.050> only<00:04:40.290> thing<00:04:40.590> we're<00:04:40.800> lacking

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
real flesh the only thing we're lacking

here<00:04:41.490> is<00:04:41.550> a<00:04:41.580> bone<00:04:41.940> structure<00:04:42.510> inside<00:04:42.870> so<00:04:43.139> this

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
here is a bone structure inside so this

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.400 
here is a bone structure inside so this
is<00:04:43.410> much<00:04:43.770> like<00:04:44.010> a<00:04:44.040> boneless<00:04:44.600> chicken<00:04:45.600> but

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
there you have it a plasticized gel tin

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.090 
there you have it a plasticized gel tin
casting<00:04:51.800> with<00:04:52.800> a<00:04:53.370> hundred<00:04:53.850> percent<00:04:55.100> silicone

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
casting with a hundred percent silicone
