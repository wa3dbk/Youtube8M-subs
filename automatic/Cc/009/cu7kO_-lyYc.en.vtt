00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.510 
back my loan that apart from them and so
that<00:01:10.820> started<00:01:11.570> the<00:01:11.659> process<00:01:11.900> of<00:01:12.400> looking<00:01:13.400> at

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
that started the process of looking at

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.219 
that started the process of looking at
the<00:01:13.670> numbers<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:14.060> where<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.810> money<00:01:14.990> was

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
the numbers and where the money was
