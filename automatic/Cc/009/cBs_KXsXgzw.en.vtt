gets full you need to be prepared a good
ability<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.899> use<00:02:07.140> on<00:02:07.380> him<00:02:07.560> because<00:02:08.399> if<00:02:09.030> you

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
ability to use on him because if you

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.460 
ability to use on him because if you
don't<00:02:09.569> he<00:02:10.259> will<00:02:10.289> heal<00:02:11.930> 12,000<00:02:12.930> h

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
don't he will heal 12,000 h

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.780 
don't he will heal 12,000 h
p<00:02:13.680> and<00:02:13.920> will<00:02:14.670> enforce<00:02:15.240> his<00:02:15.570> minions<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:17.730> you

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
p and will enforce his minions so you

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.980 
p and will enforce his minions so you
need<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.270> avoid<00:02:18.570> that<00:02:18.900> now<00:02:19.350> how<00:02:19.680> this<00:02:19.920> works<00:02:20.250> is

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
need to avoid that now how this works is

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.990 
need to avoid that now how this works is
you<00:02:21.990> need<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.260> do<00:02:22.650> certain<00:02:23.070> amount<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.520> damage

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
you need to do certain amount of damage

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.770 
you need to do certain amount of damage
to<00:02:24.240> him<00:02:24.420> so<00:02:24.750> if<00:02:25.650> would<00:02:26.250> if<00:02:26.460> you<00:02:26.850> will<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.480> will

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
to him so if would if you will it will

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.370 
to him so if would if you will it will
prevent<00:02:28.260> his<00:02:28.680> special<00:02:29.520> attack<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.170> that<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.350> a

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
prevent his special attack and that is a

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.350 
prevent his special attack and that is a
good<00:02:31.620> thing<00:02:31.830> obviously<00:02:32.070> or<00:02:32.700> else<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.210> could

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
good thing obviously or else you could

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.690 
good thing obviously or else you could
be<00:02:33.570> stuck<00:02:33.870> here<00:02:33.930> forever<00:02:34.350> also<00:02:35.220> if<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.520> want

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
be stuck here forever also if you want

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.630 
be stuck here forever also if you want
you<00:02:36.180> can<00:02:36.360> use<00:02:36.420> dwarf<00:02:37.050> multi<00:02:37.830> cannon<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.460> you

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
you can use dwarf multi cannon and you

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.640 
you can use dwarf multi cannon and you
can<00:02:38.820> place<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.270> between<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.750> table<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.380> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
can place it between the table and the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.370 
can place it between the table and the
throne<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.520> would<00:02:42.030> help<00:02:42.570> you<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.110> kill<00:02:43.350> him

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
throne this would help you to kill him

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.690 
throne this would help you to kill him
and<00:02:43.740> if<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.610> get<00:02:45.210> if<00:02:46.140> you<00:02:46.200> lose<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.920> during<00:02:47.459> the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
and if you get if you lose it during the

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.610 
and if you get if you lose it during the
fight<00:02:48.000> because<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.660> die<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.260> leave<00:02:49.470> it

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
fight because you die and you leave it

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.980 
fight because you die and you leave it
there<00:02:49.800> you<00:02:50.280> can<00:02:50.310> go<00:02:50.700> back<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:50.970> edgeville<00:02:51.600> to

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
there you can go back to edgeville to

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.480

back for free from the dude that sells
the<00:02:58.680> cannons<00:02:59.130> so<00:02:59.610> as<00:03:00.240> you<00:03:00.300> can<00:03:00.570> see<00:03:00.870> yeah

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
the cannons so as you can see yeah

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.710 
the cannons so as you can see yeah
pretty<00:03:01.770> much<00:03:01.890> like<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.459> but<00:03:03.180> other<00:03:03.510> than

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
pretty much like that but other than

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.580 
pretty much like that but other than
that<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.040> best<00:03:05.220> tactic<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:05.910> I've

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
that this is the best tactic that I've

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.680 
that this is the best tactic that I've
found<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:07.860> far<00:03:07.890> because<00:03:08.310> I've<00:03:08.790> died<00:03:09.150> quite

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
found so far because I've died quite

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.640 
found so far because I've died quite
many<00:03:10.230> times<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:11.190> this<00:03:11.760> one<00:03:11.970> worked<00:03:12.270> out<00:03:12.480> just

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
many times and this one worked out just

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.760 
many times and this one worked out just
well<00:03:13.650> and<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:14.640> suppose<00:03:15.330> this<00:03:15.810> is<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.170> best<00:03:16.380> so

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
well and I suppose this is the best so

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.729 
well and I suppose this is the best so
using<00:03:17.670> arranged<00:03:18.150> on<00:03:18.330> him<00:03:18.630> is<00:03:19.050> obviously<00:03:19.650> the

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
using arranged on him is obviously the

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.780 
using arranged on him is obviously the
best<00:03:19.890> and<00:03:20.430> he<00:03:21.360> will<00:03:21.540> use<00:03:21.810> a<00:03:22.170> mage<00:03:23.070> on<00:03:23.340> you<00:03:23.550> which

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
best and he will use a mage on you which

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.860 
best and he will use a mage on you which
is<00:03:23.970> quite<00:03:24.390> easy<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.890> counter<00:03:26.550> counter<00:03:27.209> defense

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
is quite easy to counter counter defense

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.560 
is quite easy to counter counter defense
with<00:03:28.230> your<00:03:28.470> prayer<00:03:29.010> so<00:03:29.400> don't<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.150> don't<00:03:30.300> have

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
to worry about that that's pretty much

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.840
