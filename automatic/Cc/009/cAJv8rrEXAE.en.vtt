that<00:01:15.829> the<00:01:15.920> career<00:01:16.189> isn't<00:01:16.340> what<00:01:16.579> it<00:01:16.670> wasn't<00:01:16.850> so

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
that the career isn't what it wasn't so

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.519 
that the career isn't what it wasn't so
he<00:01:17.209> actually<00:01:17.359> might<00:01:17.779> have<00:01:17.929> to<00:01:18.079> play<00:01:18.289> him<00:01:18.409> a

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:18.529 
he actually might have to play him a

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:20.050 
he actually might have to play him a
little<00:01:18.709> bit<00:01:18.799> might<00:01:19.369> have<00:01:19.399> to<00:01:19.609> practice<00:01:19.969> a

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
little bit might have to practice a

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.660 
little bit might have to practice a
little<00:01:20.179> bit<00:01:20.389> so<00:01:20.719> I<00:01:20.959> like<00:01:21.770> I<00:01:22.039> think<00:01:22.310> it's<00:01:22.429> fine

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
little bit so I like I think it's fine

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.679 
little bit so I like I think it's fine
to<00:01:22.700> have<00:01:22.880> a<00:01:22.969> guy<00:01:23.119> you<00:01:23.240> know<00:01:23.270> why<00:01:23.450> they<00:01:23.569> just

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
to have a guy you know why they just

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:24.849 
to have a guy you know why they just
want<00:01:23.899> another<00:01:24.049> guy<00:01:24.200> can<00:01:24.380> shoot<00:01:24.499> that's<00:01:24.740> what

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:24.859 
want another guy can shoot that's what

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:26.620 
want another guy can shoot that's what
they<00:01:24.920> want<00:01:25.069> to<00:01:25.130> score<00:01:25.279> that's<00:01:25.789> all<00:01:25.969> but<00:01:26.389> doc

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
they want to score that's all but doc

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.999 
they want to score that's all but doc
likes<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.990> way<00:01:27.079> he<00:01:27.109> shewed<00:01:27.409> supports<00:01:27.799> another

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
likes the way he shewed supports another

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:29.739 
likes the way he shewed supports another
option<00:01:28.429> and<00:01:28.609> I<00:01:28.849> think<00:01:29.060> if<00:01:29.149> you<00:01:29.270> don't<00:01:29.389> put<00:01:29.599> any

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:29.749 
option and I think if you don't put any

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:31.480 
option and I think if you don't put any
pressure<00:01:29.959> on<00:01:30.200> ito<00:01:30.409> just<00:01:30.679> put<00:01:31.099> him<00:01:31.189> up<00:01:31.279> put<00:01:31.459> him

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
pressure on ito just put him up put him

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.010 
pressure on ito just put him up put him
up<00:01:31.639> put<00:01:31.759> him<00:01:31.789> up<00:01:31.969> then<00:01:32.509> I<00:01:32.539> think<00:01:32.779> he<00:01:32.840> might<00:01:32.959> be

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
up put him up then I think he might be

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.440 
up put him up then I think he might be
okay<00:01:33.319> here's<00:01:33.679> my<00:01:33.859> thinking<00:01:34.159> Chris<00:01:34.999> Paul's<00:01:35.270> out

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
both the nights while that but all the

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.420 
both the nights while that but all the
nights<00:02:28.360> lobby<00:02:28.780> yeah<00:02:29.350> where<00:02:29.590> he<00:02:29.680> took<00:02:30.040> people's

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
nights lobby yeah where he took people's

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.180 
nights lobby yeah where he took people's
cameras<00:02:30.940> away<00:02:31.060> from<00:02:31.390> them<00:02:31.530> but<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.830> year<00:02:33.100> in

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
cameras away from them but that year in

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.350

the<00:02:33.280> finals<00:02:33.460> with<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.880> Orlando<00:02:34.330> Magic

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
the finals with the Orlando Magic

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.450 
the finals with the Orlando Magic
Figueroa<00:02:35.020> ball<00:02:35.230> where<00:02:35.470> he<00:02:35.500> just<00:02:36.010> got<00:02:36.130> hot<00:02:36.430> from

kind<00:03:53.860> of<00:03:53.950> slow<00:03:54.160> each<00:03:54.310> other<00:03:54.520> down<00:03:54.730> so<00:03:55.000> I<00:03:55.030> do
