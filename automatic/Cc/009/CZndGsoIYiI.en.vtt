back into the 3d now here's something

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:12.149 
back into the 3d now here's something
cool<00:04:08.759> this<00:04:09.759> little<00:04:10.000> button<00:04:10.209> down<00:04:10.419> there<00:04:11.159> let's

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 
cool this little button down there let's

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:18.170 
cool this little button down there let's
meet<00:04:12.430> edit<00:04:12.790> the<00:04:12.970> panels<00:04:14.970> so<00:04:15.970> say<00:04:16.479> I<00:04:16.509> want<00:04:17.049> to

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180

meet edit the panels so say I want to
let's<00:04:19.180> see<00:04:19.359> I<00:04:19.389> can<00:04:19.599> move<00:04:20.079> that<00:04:20.289> one<00:04:20.500> down<00:04:20.680> there

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
let's see I can move that one down there

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:23.040 
let's see I can move that one down there
so<00:04:21.759> that's<00:04:21.940> going<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.180> be<00:04:22.240> odd<00:04:22.509> out<00:04:22.780> of<00:04:22.930> my

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
so that's going to be odd out of my

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.230 
so that's going to be odd out of my
circle<00:04:25.440> this<00:04:26.440> one<00:04:26.710> is<00:04:26.860> a<00:04:26.889> extra<00:04:27.610> miscellaneous

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
circle this one is a extra miscellaneous

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.320 
circle this one is a extra miscellaneous
ones<00:04:28.270> I<00:04:28.570> can<00:04:28.630> put<00:04:28.870> that<00:04:28.990> back<00:04:29.169> up<00:04:29.289> there<00:04:29.500> I<00:04:30.330> can

ones I can put that back up there I can

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.270 
ones I can put that back up there I can
put<00:04:31.509> more<00:04:31.780> up<00:04:31.930> there<00:04:32.229> I<00:04:34.289> can<00:04:35.289> put<00:04:35.500> like<00:04:35.770> tons<00:04:36.099> of

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
put more up there I can put like tons of

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.100 
put more up there I can put like tons of
them<00:04:36.400> up<00:04:36.580> there<00:04:37.349> and<00:04:39.120> i<00:04:40.120> can<00:04:40.300> rearrange<00:04:40.599> them

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
and I hit this and we're back to the 3d

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:15.310 
and I hit this and we're back to the 3d

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.800 

so<00:05:16.320> that's<00:05:16.500> pretty<00:05:16.710> cool<00:05:20.390> everything<00:05:21.390> else<00:05:21.600> is

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
so that's pretty cool everything else is

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.860 
so that's pretty cool everything else is
pretty<00:05:22.050> standard<00:05:22.440> fare<00:05:22.980> all<00:05:23.760> these<00:05:24.000> icons<00:05:24.570> go

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
pretty standard fare all these icons go

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.130 
pretty standard fare all these icons go
to<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.050> native<00:05:25.380> programs<00:05:26.810> calendar<00:05:27.810> goes<00:05:28.020> to

to the native programs calendar goes to

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:34.690 
to the native programs calendar goes to
