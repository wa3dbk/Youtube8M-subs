00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.260
 hello we are on the stand 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:10.629
 hercules dj music but this 2015 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:13.269
 I am FranÃ§ois Garay responsible for 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:16.299
 controller development dj dear that 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:20.050
 I will tell you about the dj control 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.300
 jack vision who is this controller who 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.940
 is aimed at DJs who want to make 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.350
 performance or scratch on 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:32.320
 pc or mac computer that comes with 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.810
 the digi intro software is compatible 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.480
 with software serato dj 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.470
 particularities of this controller 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.680
 it's on the one hand it's jog wheels 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.760
 have an animated screen that allows 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.130
 to show two simultaneous information 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.899
 on the one hand the reading speed that is 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:58.510
 represented by a re by the rotation 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.899
 of a blue crown and on the other hand the 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.989
 position in the piece that represented 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.149
 by the speaking position of the lighting 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.329
 in in a white crown 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.429
 in fact and in scratch mode both are 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:15.189
 in scratch mode es2 informs both 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:17.979
 information is matched so that 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:19.569
 that the user does not have 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.649
 disturbances to read two screens 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:23.700
 simultaneously 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:28.630
 the other particularity of this controller 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.479
 cer control so it's a sensor of 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.850
 proximity which detects therefore to what 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:38.819
 distance is the hand compared to 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:42.609
 a window here and that works with 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:44.679
 a switch for each tray and 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:47.439
 on which m calls the function 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:50.200
 the water passes filter so the interest is 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:53.800
 that it allows to make show in 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.920
 having a control that so 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.220
 the public sees and the public sees 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:04.570
 the impact immediately on the music 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.700
 Moreover there are pad of paws 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.790
 detection is not heading or pasta 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.130
 tactile devices that allow you to play 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:17.110
 place kew paint or play 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:22.270
 samples this device with view m on 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:25.240
 each on each tray he also has a 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.390
 feature audio side is an audio 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.340
 24-bit 96 kg is obviously there 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.930
 also works in 16 bits and 44 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:37.600
 healers it is endowed in addition to its output 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.560
 master of a booth outing with a 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.390
 volume control and for the public who 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.080
 would like in the late evening 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.220
 broadcast music from a service of 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.220
 streaming via an auxiliary input
