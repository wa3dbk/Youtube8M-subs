mantel at home that sand out trophy man
I<00:00:20.279> think<00:00:20.520> Mansell<00:00:21.180> maybe<00:00:21.449> not<00:00:21.630> on<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.840> mantel

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.099 
I think Mansell maybe not on the mantel
but<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:23.010> think<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.490> do<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.699> lot<00:00:23.850> more<00:00:24.119> better

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
but I think I can do a lot more better

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.000 
but I think I can do a lot more better
good<00:00:25.470> with<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:27.170> with<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.199> elsewhere<00:00:28.560> than<00:00:28.830> on

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
good with it with it elsewhere than on
