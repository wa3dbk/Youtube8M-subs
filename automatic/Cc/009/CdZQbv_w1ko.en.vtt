00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.880
 against the rsc darmstadt wanted the 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.770
 ig remscheid in the roller hockey 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.090
 bundesliga for the slack from the 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.700
 return the favor 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.080
 however , there were still three before it started 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.930
 to clarify questions 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.010
 Question number one was the goalkeeper question 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.260
 answered quickly 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.520
 moritz chalk wolf was on this 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.010
 afternoon the box 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.750
 the other two should ask that 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.970
 team of andreas reinhardt during the 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.610
 50 minutes of playing time answer 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.580
 On the one hand, whether the tour exploits the opportunities 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.180
 on the other hand, whether the 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.680
 team of 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.040
 referee decisions again 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.600
 would let go of the concept and 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.900
 At the beginning, the remscheider sat 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.810
 quite the accents Julian Peinke met 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.970
 in the 15 minute to the leadership but the 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.210
 was only two minutes later from 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.070
 Darmstadt number 2 balanced 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.350
 the remscheider but were good in the game 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.350
 and so scored fabian seelbach in the 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.720
 21 minutes the deserved leadership with the 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.130
 it also went to break 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.490
 and most came with the Remscheid 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.040
 another mood of play 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.380
 fabian seelbach be in the 29 minute 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.350
 second goal this afternoon and 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.420
 at the same time the 3 2 1 leadership then 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.010
 however, the idea seemed to be player 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.350
 to remind the two questions 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.970
 in a 3 2 connection hit the 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.870
 darmstÃ¤dter still seemed to plan everything 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.790
 to run 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.310
 but as the referee 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.950
 let up and the idea back around 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.250
 chance vergab called it five minutes ago 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.600
 the end suddenly 3 to 3 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.450
 with him, both teams gave themselves 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.010
 satisfied if so if not the 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.820
 referee something against the 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.769
 had had only five 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.989
 Seconds before the end marcel received 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.930
 Weigher according to any one of alleged foul 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.360
 the blue card and as darmstadt number 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.430
 he forgave two of the direct 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.040
 give the impartial a second chance 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.830
 because moritz chalk wolf allegedly 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.870
 had moved too early a second time 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.900
 the darmstadt did not ask 3 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.430
 to 4 lost the idea with only one 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.950
 drive back home 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.910
 the worse team was on 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.910
 not this afternoon
