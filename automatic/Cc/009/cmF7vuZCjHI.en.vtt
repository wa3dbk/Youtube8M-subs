00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
like that so this weapon is the hbra3 an

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.619 
like that so this weapon is the hbra3 an
assault<00:00:52.190> rifle<00:00:52.249> that<00:00:52.670> fires<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.030> first<00:00:53.329> two

assault rifle that fires the first two
bullets<00:00:53.870> faster<00:00:54.499> than<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:54.739> rest<00:00:54.980> of<00:00:55.159> them<00:00:55.309> I

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
bullets faster than the rest of them I

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.459 
bullets faster than the rest of them I
don't<00:00:55.969> know<00:00:56.120> the<00:00:56.300> exact<00:00:56.629> numbers<00:00:56.989> but<00:00:57.229> it's

don't know the exact numbers but it's

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.290 
don't know the exact numbers but it's
probably<00:00:57.710> very<00:00:57.829> similar<00:00:58.190> to<00:00:58.460> the<00:00:58.550> a<00:00:58.579> 94<00:00:59.210> from

probably very similar to the a 94 from

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.209 
probably very similar to the a 94 from
black<00:00:59.510> ops<00:00:59.719> 2<00:01:00.050> where<00:01:00.559> the<00:01:00.620> first<00:01:00.829> two<00:01:00.949> bullets

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
black ops 2 where the first two bullets

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.369 
black ops 2 where the first two bullets
came<00:01:01.399> out<00:01:01.519> around<00:01:01.670> 900<00:01:02.269> rpm<00:01:02.629> and<00:01:02.749> the<00:01:03.109> rest<00:01:03.289> of

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
came out around 900 rpm and the rest of

came out around 900 rpm and the rest of
them<00:01:03.469> come<00:01:03.679> out<00:01:03.800> around<00:01:03.920> in<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:04.280> 600's<00:01:05.089> now

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
generally in this game my first

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.300 
generally in this game my first
impressions<00:01:08.210> were<00:01:08.390> it's<00:01:08.659> crazy<00:01:09.140> fast<00:01:09.620> loads

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
impressions were it's crazy fast loads

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.100 
impressions were it's crazy fast loads
of<00:01:10.460> fun<00:01:10.640> boosting<00:01:11.120> around<00:01:11.390> and<00:01:11.540> I<00:01:11.570> expected

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
of fun boosting around and I expected

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.200 
of fun boosting around and I expected
nothing<00:01:12.260> but<00:01:12.560> fast<00:01:12.890> gameplay<00:01:13.250> and<00:01:13.670> I<00:01:13.970> was

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
nothing but fast gameplay and I was

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.430 
nothing but fast gameplay and I was
playing<00:01:14.510> like<00:01:14.600> that<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:14.960> that<00:01:15.080> was<00:01:15.229> a<00:01:15.260> lot<00:01:15.409> of

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
playing like that and that was a lot of

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.000 
playing like that and that was a lot of
fun

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
fun

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.400 
fun
however<00:01:16.580> after<00:01:17.000> I've<00:01:17.300> used<00:01:17.660> all<00:01:17.870> the<00:01:18.080> weapons

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
however after I've used all the weapons

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.840 
however after I've used all the weapons
for<00:01:18.560> quite<00:01:18.830> a<00:01:18.860> while<00:01:19.100> like<00:01:19.370> Maul<00:01:19.640> ready

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
for quite a while like Maul ready

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.000 
for quite a while like Maul ready
halfway<00:01:20.540> through<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:20.960> first<00:01:21.140> press<00:01:21.470> stage<00:01:21.740> I

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
halfway through the first press stage I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.190 
halfway through the first press stage I
tended<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:22.970> find<00:01:23.240> that<00:01:23.420> it's<00:01:23.570> a<00:01:23.690> lot<00:01:23.840> better<00:01:23.990> to

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
tended to find that it's a lot better to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.720 
tended to find that it's a lot better to
use<00:01:24.410> the<00:01:24.590> assault<00:01:24.830> rifles<00:01:25.160> and<00:01:25.220> play<00:01:25.400> a<00:01:25.430> bit

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
use the assault rifles and play a bit

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.730 
use the assault rifles and play a bit
more<00:01:25.850> defensively<00:01:26.480> which<00:01:26.720> is<00:01:26.900> strange<00:01:27.230> we've

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
more defensively which is strange we've

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.410 
more defensively which is strange we've
all<00:01:27.890> this<00:01:28.010> fast<00:01:28.250> moving<00:01:28.550> it<00:01:28.760> tempts<00:01:29.090> you<00:01:29.180> into

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
all this fast moving it tempts you into

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.420 
all this fast moving it tempts you into
like<00:01:29.540> playing<00:01:29.840> a<00:01:29.930> rushing<00:01:30.260> game<00:01:30.440> style<00:01:30.800> but

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
like playing a rushing game style but

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.950 
like playing a rushing game style but
the<00:01:31.520> submachine<00:01:31.940> gun<00:01:32.150> just<00:01:32.360> feels<00:01:32.600> so<00:01:32.780> weak

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
the submachine gun just feels so weak

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.660 
the submachine gun just feels so weak
they<00:01:33.140> really<00:01:33.440> do<00:01:33.650> let<00:01:33.860> me<00:01:33.890> know<00:01:34.010> in<00:01:34.340> the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
on the submachine guns because I've been

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.760 
on the submachine guns because I've been

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.310 
feel like they are taking a lot of
bullets<00:01:41.480> to<00:01:41.600> kill<00:01:41.780> people

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
bullets to kill people

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.260 
bullets to kill people
whereas<00:01:42.710> this<00:01:42.950> weapon<00:01:43.400> just<00:01:43.550> dropped<00:01:43.910> people

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
whereas this weapon just dropped people

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.150 
whereas this weapon just dropped people
really<00:01:44.810> quickly<00:01:44.930> those<00:01:45.320> first<00:01:45.650> two<00:01:45.830> bullets

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
really quickly those first two bullets

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.040 
really quickly those first two bullets
coming<00:01:46.670> out<00:01:46.820> extra<00:01:47.150> fasting<00:01:47.630> from<00:01:47.720> really

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
coming out extra fasting from really

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.810 
coming out extra fasting from really
work<00:01:48.230> for<00:01:48.380> me<00:01:48.440> you<00:01:48.920> can<00:01:49.070> see<00:01:49.220> in<00:01:49.280> this<00:01:49.370> gameplay

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
work for me you can see in this gameplay

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.730 
work for me you can see in this gameplay
there<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:50.180> just<00:01:50.360> absolutely<00:01:50.540> melts<00:01:51.290> people

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
there it just absolutely melts people

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.700 
there it just absolutely melts people
most<00:01:52.340> of<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.670> time<00:01:52.840> so<00:01:53.840> as<00:01:54.050> the<00:01:54.320> submachine

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
most of the time so as the submachine

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.230 
most of the time so as the submachine
guns<00:01:54.950> are<00:01:55.190> so<00:01:55.430> weak<00:01:55.580> I'm<00:01:55.790> really<00:01:56.030> drawn

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
guns are so weak I'm really drawn

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.480 
guns are so weak I'm really drawn
towards<00:01:56.540> this<00:01:56.720> one<00:01:56.960> but<00:01:57.380> a<00:01:57.440> k-12<00:01:58.010> is<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.160> novel

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
towards this one but a k-12 is a novel

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.580 
towards this one but a k-12 is a novel
weapon<00:01:58.790> I'm<00:01:58.880> quite<00:01:59.150> liking<00:01:59.660> but<00:02:00.320> in<00:02:00.470> all

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
weapon I'm quite liking but in all

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.140 
weapon I'm quite liking but in all
honesty<00:02:00.950> nothing<00:02:01.280> is<00:02:01.370> really<00:02:01.490> comparing<00:02:02.030> to

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
honesty nothing is really comparing to

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.880 
honesty nothing is really comparing to
this<00:02:02.240> thing<00:02:02.480> at<00:02:02.660> the<00:02:02.870> moment<00:02:03.260> every<00:02:03.470> time<00:02:03.650> I<00:02:03.680> go

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
this thing at the moment every time I go

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.740 
this thing at the moment every time I go
to<00:02:03.920> you<00:02:04.130> something<00:02:04.340> else<00:02:04.640> I<00:02:04.850> just<00:02:05.390> don't<00:02:05.570> like

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
to you something else I just don't like

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.480 
to you something else I just don't like
it<00:02:05.960> as<00:02:06.080> much<00:02:06.110> he<00:02:06.530> doesn't<00:02:06.830> kill<00:02:07.040> people<00:02:07.070> as

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
it as much he doesn't kill people as

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.910 
it as much he doesn't kill people as
quickly<00:02:07.790> and<00:02:08.149> I<00:02:08.810> almost<00:02:08.929> feel<00:02:09.259> like<00:02:09.470> it<00:02:09.679> might

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
quickly and I almost feel like it might

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.290 
quickly and I almost feel like it might
be<00:02:10.069> something<00:02:10.250> to<00:02:10.459> do<00:02:10.580> with<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.759> connections

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
be something to do with the connections

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.270 
be something to do with the connections
on<00:02:11.480> release<00:02:11.810> day<00:02:12.050> because<00:02:12.409> I<00:02:12.620> honestly<00:02:13.099> think

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
on release day because I honestly think

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.770 
on release day because I honestly think
that<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.519> submachine<00:02:13.940> guns<00:02:14.180> shouldn't<00:02:14.569> take

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
that the submachine guns shouldn't take

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.600 
that the submachine guns shouldn't take
so<00:02:15.019> long<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.319> kill<00:02:15.530> people<00:02:15.709> at<00:02:16.040> close<00:02:16.280> range

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
so long to kill people at close range

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.460 
so long to kill people at close range
and<00:02:16.760> they<00:02:17.390> are<00:02:17.599> which<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:17.900> forcing<00:02:18.260> me<00:02:18.379> into

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
and they are which is forcing me into

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.080 
and they are which is forcing me into
using<00:02:18.890> this<00:02:19.010> damage<00:02:19.400> without<00:02:19.519> this<00:02:19.819> gun<00:02:19.970> is

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
using this damage without this gun is

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.180 
using this damage without this gun is
great<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.630> think<00:02:21.020> I've<00:02:21.380> now<00:02:21.590> played<00:02:21.920> like<00:02:22.160> a

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
great I think I've now played like a

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.070 
great I think I've now played like a
whole<00:02:22.550> prestige<00:02:23.090> with<00:02:23.300> this<00:02:23.450> weapon<00:02:23.660> and

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
whole prestige with this weapon and

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.720 
whole prestige with this weapon and
there<00:02:24.590> it'd<00:02:24.710> be<00:02:24.800> nice<00:02:24.980> to<00:02:25.130> get<00:02:25.220> a<00:02:25.280> bit

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
there it'd be nice to get a bit

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.030 
there it'd be nice to get a bit
right<00:02:25.940> in<00:02:26.120> there<00:02:26.360> so<00:02:27.260> now<00:02:27.440> here<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:27.680> see<00:02:27.800> me

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
right in there so now here you see me

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.280 
right in there so now here you see me
calling<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.400> care<00:02:28.819> package<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:29.390> get<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.840> Paladin

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
calling a care package I get the Paladin

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.890 
calling a care package I get the Paladin
here<00:02:30.500> which<00:02:30.650> is<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.980> top<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:32.090> top<00:02:32.299> killstreak

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
here which is the top the top killstreak

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.089 
here which is the top the top killstreak
apart<00:02:33.200> from<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.379> finger<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.709> fact<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.040> you

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
apart from the finger the fact that you

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.009 
apart from the finger the fact that you
could<00:02:34.220> add<00:02:34.370> more<00:02:34.640> things<00:02:34.879> to<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.209> this<00:02:35.690> is<00:02:35.750> the

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
could add more things to it this is the

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.140 
could add more things to it this is the
top<00:02:36.200> killstreak<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.010> is<00:02:37.099> quite<00:02:37.370> decent<00:02:37.610> at

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
top killstreak and it is quite decent at

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.430 
top killstreak and it is quite decent at
first<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:38.480> didn't<00:02:38.690> think<00:02:38.750> it<00:02:38.959> was<00:02:39.049> that<00:02:39.110> great

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
first I didn't think it was that great

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.740 
first I didn't think it was that great
overheats<00:02:40.129> which<00:02:40.940> makes<00:02:41.209> it<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:41.450> little<00:02:41.540> bit

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
overheats which makes it a little bit

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.420 
overheats which makes it a little bit
difficult<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:42.170> use<00:02:42.290> sometimes<00:02:42.950> but<00:02:43.190> what<00:02:43.310> you

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
difficult to use sometimes but what you

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.920 
difficult to use sometimes but what you
need<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:43.640> do<00:02:43.879> is<00:02:44.000> when<00:02:44.120> you<00:02:44.209> see<00:02:44.390> someone<00:02:44.750> just

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
need to do is when you see someone just

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.020 
need to do is when you see someone just
fire<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.470> few<00:02:45.830> bullets<00:02:46.129> off<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.640> then<00:02:46.819> that

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
fire a few bullets off and then that

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.520 
fire a few bullets off and then that
would<00:02:47.180> probably<00:02:47.390> kill<00:02:47.720> them<00:02:47.930> don't<00:02:48.049> just<00:02:48.319> hold

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
would probably kill them don't just hold

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.089 
would probably kill them don't just hold
it<00:02:48.680> down

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
it down

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.559 
it down
otherwise<00:02:49.519> it<00:02:49.700> will<00:02:49.790> overheat<00:02:50.209> it<00:02:50.330> will<00:02:50.420> take

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
otherwise it will overheat it will take

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.030 
otherwise it will overheat it will take
your<00:02:50.750> ages<00:02:51.019> too<00:02:51.140> you<00:02:51.230> can<00:02:51.379> fire<00:02:51.560> again<00:02:51.890> and

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
your ages too you can fire again and

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.250 
your ages too you can fire again and
that's<00:02:52.579> a<00:02:52.760> problem<00:02:52.970> now<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:53.660> cube<00:02:53.930> streaks

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
that's a problem now the cube streaks

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.170 
that's a problem now the cube streaks
that<00:02:54.410> I'm<00:02:54.500> using<00:02:54.680> in<00:02:54.950> this<00:02:55.129> game<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:55.909> the<00:02:56.000> ones

I<00:03:05.900> put<00:03:06.109> support<00:03:06.590> on<00:03:06.739> all<00:03:06.980> of<00:03:07.220> them<00:03:07.430> now<00:03:07.819> it<00:03:07.910> does

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
I put support on all of them now it does

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.880 
I put support on all of them now it does
make<00:03:08.269> them<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.540> lot<00:03:08.780> more<00:03:09.019> expensive<00:03:09.349> I<00:03:09.650> think

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
make them a lot more expensive I think

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.559 
make them a lot more expensive I think
you<00:03:09.950> have<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.160> end<00:03:10.250> up<00:03:10.370> getting<00:03:10.519> like<00:03:10.760> 700

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
you have to end up getting like 700

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.780 
you have to end up getting like 700
points<00:03:11.870> just<00:03:12.379> to<00:03:12.470> coin<00:03:12.680> your<00:03:12.890> UAV<00:03:13.220> if<00:03:13.489> you<00:03:13.609> put

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
points just to coin your UAV if you put

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.970 
points just to coin your UAV if you put
support<00:03:14.209> on<00:03:14.359> it<00:03:14.510> however<00:03:15.109> I<00:03:15.230> feel<00:03:15.500> like<00:03:15.680> having

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
support on it however I feel like having

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.289 
support on it however I feel like having
all<00:03:16.099> of<00:03:16.129> those<00:03:16.250> things<00:03:16.549> support<00:03:16.970> means<00:03:17.180> I'm

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
all of those things support means I'm

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:18.610 
all of those things support means I'm
definitely<00:03:17.750> gonna<00:03:17.840> get<00:03:18.049> all<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.410> them<00:03:18.530> at

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
definitely gonna get all of them at

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.619 
definitely gonna get all of them at
least<00:03:18.799> once<00:03:19.160> you<00:03:19.670> can<00:03:19.819> actually<00:03:19.970> put<00:03:20.359> a<00:03:20.390> thing

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
least once you can actually put a thing

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:22.119 
least once you can actually put a thing
on<00:03:20.750> your<00:03:20.900> care<00:03:21.260> package<00:03:21.410> it<00:03:21.709> means<00:03:21.859> you<00:03:21.950> get<00:03:22.069> a

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:22.129 
on your care package it means you get a

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:23.949 
on your care package it means you get a
better<00:03:22.400> odds<00:03:22.609> of<00:03:22.819> getting<00:03:23.239> something<00:03:23.599> good

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
better odds of getting something good

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.720 
better odds of getting something good
which<00:03:24.200> is<00:03:24.230> why<00:03:24.500> I've<00:03:24.590> got<00:03:24.709> this<00:03:24.859> paladin<00:03:25.370> here

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
which is why I've got this paladin here

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.970 
which is why I've got this paladin here
so<00:03:26.269> although<00:03:26.629> you<00:03:26.840> only<00:03:27.049> get<00:03:27.349> everything<00:03:27.590> once

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
so although you only get everything once

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.619 
so although you only get everything once
you<00:03:28.280> are<00:03:28.370> pretty<00:03:28.670> much<00:03:28.760> guaranteed<00:03:29.090> as<00:03:29.540> long

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
you are pretty much guaranteed as long

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:30.819 
you are pretty much guaranteed as long
as<00:03:29.720> you're<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:29.840> decent<00:03:30.019> player<00:03:30.380> can<00:03:30.590> get<00:03:30.680> around

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
as you're a decent player can get around

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.860 
as you're a decent player can get around
13<00:03:31.370> kills<00:03:31.669> at<00:03:32.060> least<00:03:32.120> in<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.540> game<00:03:32.720> you're

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
guaranteed to get all of those things at

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.520 
guaranteed to get all of those things at
least<00:03:35.239> once<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:35.750> I<00:03:35.780> find<00:03:36.019> that<00:03:36.109> a<00:03:36.169> lot<00:03:36.349> more

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
least once and I find that a lot more

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.229 
least once and I find that a lot more
useful<00:03:36.739> cuz<00:03:37.069> I'm<00:03:37.160> not<00:03:37.370> going<00:03:37.609> on<00:03:37.730> big<00:03:37.940> streaks

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
useful cuz I'm not going on big streaks

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.030 
useful cuz I'm not going on big streaks
in<00:03:38.389> this<00:03:38.480> game<00:03:38.690> so<00:03:38.930> far<00:03:38.959> I've<00:03:39.530> only<00:03:39.680> had<00:03:39.859> like

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
in this game so far I've only had like

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.550 
in this game so far I've only had like
three<00:03:40.489> merciless<00:03:41.090> medals<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:41.630> you<00:03:42.380> know<00:03:42.470> I've

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
three merciless medals and you know I've

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.140 
three merciless medals and you know I've
had<00:03:42.680> of<00:03:42.799> quite<00:03:42.980> a<00:03:43.010> few<00:03:43.220> bloodthirsty<00:03:43.880> but

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
had of quite a few bloodthirsty but

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.879 
had of quite a few bloodthirsty but
nothing<00:03:44.569> really<00:03:44.720> more<00:03:44.959> can't<00:03:45.319> get<00:03:45.470> anywhere

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889
