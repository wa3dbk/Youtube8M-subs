apart<00:06:42.550> and<00:06:42.849> then<00:06:43.240> a<00:06:43.270> nest<00:06:43.509> egg<00:06:43.659> goes<00:06:43.870> on<00:06:44.050> they

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
apart and then a nest egg goes on they

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.629 
apart and then a nest egg goes on they
look<00:06:44.680> at<00:06:44.770> closer<00:06:45.099> and<00:06:45.310> closer<00:06:45.460> together

look at closer and closer together
eventually<00:06:46.599> there<00:06:46.719> will<00:06:46.870> be<00:06:46.930> a<00:06:47.050> time<00:06:47.319> it'll<00:06:47.590> be

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:47.650 
eventually there will be a time it'll be

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.499 
eventually there will be a time it'll be
a<00:06:47.710> standoff<00:06:48.099> where<00:06:48.340> someone<00:06:48.580> might<00:06:48.729> land<00:06:49.180> next

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:49.509 
a standoff where someone might land next

a standoff where someone might land next
to<00:06:49.569> another<00:06:49.779> one<00:06:50.050> and<00:06:50.080> you<00:06:50.469> know<00:06:50.919> we'll<00:06:51.069> see

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:51.099 
to another one and you know we'll see

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:52.260 
to another one and you know we'll see
what<00:06:51.370> happens<00:06:51.669> we'll<00:06:51.849> work<00:06:52.000> on<00:06:52.150> the

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 
what happens we'll work on the

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.249 
what happens we'll work on the
situations<00:06:52.750> as<00:06:52.870> they<00:06:52.900> arise

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:53.259 
situations as they arise

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:55.320 
situations as they arise
but<00:06:53.979> for<00:06:54.159> now<00:06:54.340> things<00:06:54.550> are<00:06:54.669> promising<00:06:55.090> that<00:06:55.210> at

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
but for now things are promising that at

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.879 
but for now things are promising that at
least<00:06:55.449> the<00:06:55.599> birds<00:06:55.810> can<00:06:55.990> be<00:06:56.020> out<00:06:56.440> and<00:06:56.710> seeing

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:56.889 
least the birds can be out and seeing

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:59.999 
least the birds can be out and seeing
them<00:06:57.009> together<00:06:57.159> supervised<00:06:57.729> with<00:06:57.969> me<00:06:58.180> and<00:06:59.009> so

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:00.009 
them together supervised with me and so

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:01.409 
them together supervised with me and so
this<00:07:00.129> is<00:07:00.279> the<00:07:00.430> technique<00:07:00.759> that<00:07:00.819> I'm<00:07:01.000> using<00:07:01.029> to

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:01.419 
this is the technique that I'm using to

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:03.269 
this is the technique that I'm using to
teach<00:07:02.020> my<00:07:02.169> birds<00:07:02.379> to<00:07:02.590> get<00:07:02.800> along<00:07:03.039> with<00:07:03.219> each

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:03.279 
teach my birds to get along with each

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:05.459 
teach my birds to get along with each
