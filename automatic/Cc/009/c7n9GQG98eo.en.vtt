00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
like that as well as I will be able to

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.819 
like that as well as I will be able to
fly<00:01:51.590> so<00:01:52.590> there's<00:01:52.860> creative<00:01:53.250> mode<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:54.680> if<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.740> go

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
fly so there's creative mode and if I go

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.469 
fly so there's creative mode and if I go
ahead<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.009> land<00:01:56.369> here<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:58.939> will<00:01:59.939> turn<00:02:00.119> creative

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
ahead and land here I will turn creative

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.179 
ahead and land here I will turn creative
mode<00:02:00.630> back<00:02:00.810> off<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:01.890> see<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.070> don't

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
mode back off and you can see I don't

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.179 
mode back off and you can see I don't
have<00:02:02.399> any<00:02:02.670> rain<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.619> so<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.680> can<00:02:04.920> go<00:02:05.009> ahead<00:02:05.070> and

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
have any rain on so I can go ahead and

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.719 
have any rain on so I can go ahead and
turn<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.549> rain<00:02:05.729> on<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:07.190> this<00:02:08.190> works<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.550> same

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
turn the rain on and this works the same

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.460 
turn the rain on and this works the same
for<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.090> snow<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:09.629> if<00:02:09.750> you're<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.020> like<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.200> snow

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
for the snow so if you're in like a snow

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.380 
for the snow so if you're in like a snow
biome<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:11.009> will<00:02:11.099> make<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.340> start<00:02:11.550> snowing

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
biome it will make it start snowing

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.690 
biome it will make it start snowing
and<00:02:13.070> then<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.130> can<00:02:14.220> go<00:02:14.280> ahead<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.490> turn<00:02:14.550> it

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
and then you can go ahead and turn it

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.610 
and then you can go ahead and turn it
back<00:02:14.820> off<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:17.280> rain<00:02:17.490> will<00:02:17.700> stop<00:02:18.620> then

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
back off and the rain will stop then

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.620 
back off and the rain will stop then
like<00:02:19.800> I<00:02:19.920> said<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.220> can<00:02:20.370> change<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.820> sunrise

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
like I said you can change it to sunrise

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.800 
like I said you can change it to sunrise
so<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.560> Sun<00:02:22.770> will<00:02:22.890> be<00:02:23.010> rising<00:02:23.190> over<00:02:23.760> there<00:02:23.970> and

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
so the Sun will be rising over there and

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.720 
so the Sun will be rising over there and
I<00:02:24.900> can<00:02:25.080> change<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.470> noon<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:26.280> where<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.520> Sun

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
I can change it to noon to where the Sun

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.270 
I can change it to noon to where the Sun
will<00:02:26.910> be<00:02:27.000> directly<00:02:27.330> above<00:02:27.660> us<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.050> then<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.100> can

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
will be directly above us and then I can

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.790 
will be directly above us and then I can
change<00:02:29.460> it<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.670> sunset<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.170> Sun<00:02:31.440> will<00:02:31.620> be

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
change it to sunset so the Sun will be

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.610 
change it to sunset so the Sun will be
falling<00:02:32.280> over<00:02:32.550> there<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.260> then<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.320> can<00:02:34.470> change

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
falling over there and then I can change

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.230 
falling over there and then I can change
it<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.800> midnight<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.550> moon<00:02:35.880> will<00:02:36.120> be

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
it to midnight so the moon will be

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.560 
it to midnight so the moon will be
directly<00:02:36.660> in<00:02:36.900> this<00:02:37.110> middle<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.680> sky<00:02:38.570> so

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
directly in this middle of the sky so

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.150 
directly in this middle of the sky so
that<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.080> pretty<00:02:40.320> much<00:02:40.440> everything<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:41.040> you
