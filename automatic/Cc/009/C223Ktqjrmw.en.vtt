00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.190 

particular<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.179> that<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> veteran<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.990> end

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
particular is that a veteran the end

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.049 
particular is that a veteran the end
this<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.590> this<00:00:10.889> is<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.099> wrong<00:00:11.400> number<00:00:11.610> so<00:00:11.910> it's

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
this is this is a wrong number so it's

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.030 
this is this is a wrong number so it's
actually<00:00:12.450> in<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.630> millions<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.650> what<00:00:13.920> that

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
actually in the millions is what that

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:22.269 
actually in the millions is what that
would<00:00:14.219> be<00:00:14.250> so<00:00:15.179> that's<00:00:15.299> like<00:00:15.450> 2.5<00:00:16.320> million

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.429 

so<00:00:23.279> where<00:00:23.460> do<00:00:23.519> we<00:00:23.550> end<00:00:23.640> up<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.720> ended<00:00:24.990> up<00:00:25.109> would

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
so where do we end up we ended up would

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.999 
so where do we end up we ended up would
be<00:00:25.470> 03<00:00:25.859> about<00:00:26.429> 4<00:00:27.060> million<00:00:27.739> then<00:00:29.720> 1.2<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.680> all

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
be 03 about 4 million then 1.2 and all

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.259 
be 03 about 4 million then 1.2 and all
that<00:00:32.189> that's<00:00:32.399> all<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.730> stuff<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:32.970> we're

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:33.269 
that that's all the stuff that we're

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:37.880 
that that's all the stuff that we're
breathing<00:00:33.480> right<00:00:33.780> now<00:00:36.590> both<00:00:37.590> your<00:00:37.739> breath

notice<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.640> in<00:00:56.909> the<00:00:57.059> design<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.629> machine

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
notice is in the design of the machine

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.480 
notice is in the design of the machine
air<00:00:59.460> was<00:00:59.640> flowing<00:00:59.820> out<00:01:00.150> of<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.330> top<00:01:00.630> position

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.490 
air was flowing out of the top position

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.870 
air was flowing out of the top position
it's<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:03.090> blowing<00:01:03.360> out<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.080> back<00:01:04.700> on<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
it's not blowing out the back on the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.270 
it's not blowing out the back on the
side<00:01:06.170> but<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.230> was<00:01:07.440> that<00:01:07.770> will<00:01:07.950> do<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.220> that

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
side but that was that will do is that

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.940 
side but that was that will do is that
was<00:01:08.640> rustle<00:01:09.120> up<00:01:09.240> all<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.720> fine<00:01:09.990> dust<00:01:10.230> that's

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
was rustle up all the fine dust that's

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.740 
was rustle up all the fine dust that's
either<00:01:11.160> behind<00:01:11.550> the<00:01:11.730> machine<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.450> floor

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
either behind the machine on the floor

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.190 
either behind the machine on the floor
on<00:01:13.440> the<00:01:13.470> side<00:01:14.060> some<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> uprights<00:01:15.690> bent

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
on the side some of the uprights bent

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.990 
on the side some of the uprights bent
down<00:01:16.410> forward<00:01:16.950> they're<00:01:17.370> actually<00:01:17.700> pushing

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
down forward they're actually pushing

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.810 
down forward they're actually pushing
pushing<00:01:18.510> a<00:01:18.720> lot<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> dirt<00:01:19.350> away<00:01:19.620> before<00:01:20.520> it

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
pushing a lot of the dirt away before it

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.620 
pushing a lot of the dirt away before it
even<00:01:20.940> gets<00:01:21.140> etc<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.220> go<00:01:23.880> up<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> air<00:01:24.360> coming

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
even gets etc so we go up the air coming

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.600 
even gets etc so we go up the air coming
out<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.900> here<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.260> pure<00:01:25.530> air<00:01:25.800> so<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.370> should<00:01:26.580> be

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
out of here is pure air so it should be

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.760 
out of here is pure air so it should be
going<00:01:26.880> straight<00:01:27.330> up<00:01:27.360> into<00:01:27.690> the<00:01:27.810> room<00:01:28.170> then<00:01:28.620> you

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
going straight up into the room then you

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.849 
going straight up into the room then you
don't<00:01:28.950> rustle<00:01:29.460> up

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:32.859
