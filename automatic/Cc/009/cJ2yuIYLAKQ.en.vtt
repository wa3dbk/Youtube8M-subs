lollipop sticks down in the cupcake so

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.680 
lollipop sticks down in the cupcake so
these<00:00:41.340> cupcakes<00:00:41.610> right<00:00:42.030> now<00:00:42.180> are<00:00:42.450> completely

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
these cupcakes right now are completely

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.400 
these cupcakes right now are completely
frozen<00:00:43.410> as<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.890> can<00:00:44.100> see<00:00:44.750> but<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> lollipop

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
frozen as you can see but the lollipop

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.350 
frozen as you can see but the lollipop
sticks<00:00:46.710> literally<00:00:47.430> are<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.670> only<00:00:47.850> thing<00:00:48.120> that

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
sticks literally are the only thing that

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.520 
sticks literally are the only thing that
saves<00:00:48.899> these<00:00:49.789> from<00:00:50.789> not<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:52.110> everywhere

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
saves these from not going everywhere

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.880 
saves these from not going everywhere
and<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.250> reason<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.600> lollipop<00:00:54.930> sticks<00:00:55.440> is

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
and the reason of the lollipop sticks is

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.290 
and the reason of the lollipop sticks is
because<00:00:56.460> once<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.899> put<00:00:57.930> your<00:00:58.170> top<00:00:58.620> down<00:00:59.300> the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
because once you put your top down the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.170 
because once you put your top down the
lollipop<00:01:00.870> stick<00:01:01.320> hits<00:01:02.449> the<00:01:03.449> top<00:01:03.979> so<00:01:04.979> when<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
lollipop stick hits the top so when the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.750 
lollipop stick hits the top so when the
mail<00:01:06.450> carrier<00:01:07.020> or<00:01:07.380> FedEx<00:01:08.070> or<00:01:08.280> whatever<00:01:08.549> is

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
mail carrier or FedEx or whatever is

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.820 
mail carrier or FedEx or whatever is
being<00:01:08.970> rough<00:01:09.390> with<00:01:09.689> our<00:01:09.869> packages<00:01:10.290> which<00:01:10.650> we

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
being rough with our packages which we

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.090 
being rough with our packages which we
all<00:01:10.979> know<00:01:11.220> they<00:01:11.369> are<00:01:12.260> when<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.409> cupcakes<00:01:13.920> are

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
all know they are when the cupcakes are

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.660 
all know they are when the cupcakes are
turned<00:01:14.400> upside<00:01:14.580> down<00:01:14.790> or<00:01:15.210> whatever<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:17.340> stick

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
turned upside down or whatever the stick

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.929 
turned upside down or whatever the stick
hits<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.360> top<00:01:18.600> instead<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.590> actual

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
hits the top instead of the actual

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.390 
hits the top instead of the actual
cupcake<00:01:20.939> hitting<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.930> top<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.560> them<00:01:23.130> going
