so<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.240> leaves<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:31.369> what<00:00:32.369> happens<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.090> if<00:00:33.780> you

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
so it leaves and what happens is if you

so it leaves and what happens is if you
move<00:00:34.170> into<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.590> tunnel<00:00:34.980> at<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> slow<00:00:35.550> speed

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
move into the tunnel at a slow speed

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.549 
move into the tunnel at a slow speed
like<00:00:36.989> this<00:00:37.290> if<00:00:37.739> you're<00:00:37.950> walking<00:00:38.480> or<00:00:39.559> you're

crouching the person who killed you most

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.860 
crouching the person who killed you most
likely<00:00:44.399> see<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.760> first<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.360> shoot<00:00:45.660> you

likely see you first and shoot you

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.080 
likely see you first and shoot you
before<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.620> can<00:00:46.829> do<00:00:46.950> anything<00:00:47.190> about<00:00:47.489> it

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
before you can do anything about it

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.290 
before you can do anything about it
same<00:00:48.899> goes<00:00:49.230> if<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.680> are<00:00:49.860> going<00:00:50.579> like<00:00:51.059> this

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
same goes if you are going like this

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.500

like<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:34.009> lesson<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.250> smoke<00:01:36.030> em<00:01:36.240> if<00:01:36.420> you

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
like that lesson to smoke em if you

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.440 
like that lesson to smoke em if you
gottem<00:01:37.310> smoke<00:01:38.310> grenades<00:01:38.700> can<00:01:38.939> provide<00:01:39.270> an

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
gottem smoke grenades can provide an

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.569 
gottem smoke grenades can provide an
excellent<00:01:39.930> offensive<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:40.950> defensive

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
excellent offensive and defensive

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.460 
excellent offensive and defensive
tactical<00:01:42.090> advantage<00:01:42.600> I'll<00:01:42.899> get<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.380> an

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
tactical advantage I'll get to an

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.230 
tactical advantage I'll get to an
example<00:01:43.799> first<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.430> then<00:01:44.579> talk<00:01:44.820> about<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
example first and then talk about the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.870 
example first and then talk about the
theory<00:01:45.600> behind<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.500> let's<00:01:47.310> say<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.759> are<00:01:47.850> a

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
theory behind it so let's say we are a

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.670 
theory behind it so let's say we are a
should<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.360> like<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.840> last<00:01:49.049> clip<00:01:49.320> there<00:01:49.590> is

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
should be like in the last clip there is

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.160 
should be like in the last clip there is
somebody<00:01:49.890> waiting<00:01:50.189> at<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.670> crates<00:01:50.960> so<00:01:51.960> maybe

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
somebody waiting at the crates so maybe

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.840 
somebody waiting at the crates so maybe
before<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.560> -<00:01:52.860> then<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.220> get<00:01:53.369> your<00:01:53.520> smoke

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
before you - then you get your smoke

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.300 
before you - then you get your smoke
ready<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.329> throw<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.659> over<00:01:54.930> there<00:01:55.170> wait<00:01:56.130> for

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
ready you throw it over there wait for

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.560 
ready you throw it over there wait for
it<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.490> pop<00:01:56.640> obviously<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.450> now<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
it to pop obviously and now the

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.110 
it to pop obviously and now the
the<00:01:58.690> defender<00:01:59.650> at<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.190> crates<00:02:00.490> cannot<00:02:00.909> do

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
the defender at the crates cannot do

the defender at the crates cannot do
anything<00:02:01.360> they<00:02:01.659> can't<00:02:01.870> see<00:02:02.080> you<00:02:02.260> you<00:02:02.470> have<00:02:02.800> the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
think they are and you have to be

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.970 
think they are and you have to be
careful<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.180> popping<00:02:13.510> smoke<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:14.500> don't<00:02:14.740> want

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
careful and popping smoke you don't want

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.360 
careful and popping smoke you don't want
to<00:02:15.130> for<00:02:15.310> example<00:02:15.340> pop<00:02:15.940> up<00:02:16.709> because<00:02:17.709> you'll

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
to for example pop up because you'll

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.340 
to for example pop up because you'll
have<00:02:18.610> to<00:02:18.760> run<00:02:18.970> through<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.360> smoke<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:20.020> enemy

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
have to run through the smoke the enemy

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.320 
have to run through the smoke the enemy
will<00:02:20.560> see<00:02:20.800> you<00:02:20.920> first<00:02:21.250> as<00:02:21.490> you<00:02:21.610> come<00:02:21.820> out<00:02:22.000> of<00:02:22.030> it

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
will see you first as you come out of it

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.780 
will see you first as you come out of it
and<00:02:22.540> then<00:02:23.170> you<00:02:23.290> screw<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.620> devil<00:02:24.100> always<00:02:24.340> kill

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
and then you screw the devil always kill

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:25.140 
and then you screw the devil always kill
you

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
you

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.720 
you
the<00:02:25.780> basic<00:02:26.170> theory<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:26.680> using<00:02:27.010> smoke<00:02:27.280> means<00:02:27.550> is

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
the basic theory of using smoke means is

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.180 
the basic theory of using smoke means is
simple<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.810> use<00:02:29.020> it<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.320> get<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.500> tactical

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
simple you use it to get the tactical

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.729 
simple you use it to get the tactical
advantage<00:02:30.670> on<00:02:30.880> your<00:02:31.000> enemy<00:02:31.480> maybe<00:02:32.260> you<00:02:32.530> want

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
advantage on your enemy maybe you want

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.640 
advantage on your enemy maybe you want
to<00:02:32.890> cast<00:02:33.160> doubt<00:02:33.640> into<00:02:34.239> their<00:02:34.420> actions<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.260> if

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
to cast doubt into their actions and if

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.140 
to cast doubt into their actions and if
anything<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.430> will<00:02:36.580> at<00:02:36.700> least

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
anything you will at least

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
anything you will at least
delaying<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.200> enemy<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:39.610> one<00:02:40.570> example<00:02:40.900> of<00:02:41.020> the

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
delaying the enemy so one example of the

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.290 
delaying the enemy so one example of the
line<00:02:41.350> would<00:02:41.560> be<00:02:41.620> if<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:42.010> are<00:02:42.610> tel<00:02:42.880> aviv's<00:02:43.150> you

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
line would be if you are tel aviv's you

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.630 
line would be if you are tel aviv's you
plan<00:02:43.510> to<00:02:43.690> be<00:02:43.930> you<00:02:44.530> set<00:02:44.770> up<00:02:44.950> shop<00:02:45.190> here

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
plan to be you set up shop here

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.610 
plan to be you set up shop here
maybe<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.300> throw<00:02:46.570> smoke<00:02:46.870> here<00:02:47.140> at<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.380> doors

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
maybe you throw smoke here at the doors

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.210 
maybe you throw smoke here at the doors
and<00:02:47.950> now<00:02:48.940> if<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.870> 50<00:02:50.320> is<00:02:50.440> dumb<00:02:50.650> enough<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.950> rush

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
and now if the 50 is dumb enough to rush

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.890 
and now if the 50 is dumb enough to rush
through<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.519> smoke<00:02:51.790> you<00:02:52.030> just<00:02:52.360> pick<00:02:52.570> him<00:02:52.750> off

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
through the smoke you just pick him off

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.830 
through the smoke you just pick him off
as<00:02:53.170> he<00:02:53.290> comes<00:02:53.530> out<00:02:53.970> if<00:02:54.970> he<00:02:55.120> doesn't<00:02:55.570> if<00:02:55.690> he

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
as he comes out if he doesn't if he

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.540 
as he comes out if he doesn't if he
waits<00:02:56.050> then<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:56.800> know<00:02:56.920> you're<00:02:57.160> just<00:02:57.370> cutting

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
waits then you know you're just cutting

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.710 
waits then you know you're just cutting
down<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:58.030> timer<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.750> that's<00:02:59.350> in<00:02:59.560> your<00:02:59.769> favor

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720

if you guys want I can do a smoke guy

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.810 
if you guys want I can do a smoke guy

is<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.130> key<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:12.670> immortality<00:03:14.190> when<00:03:15.190> you're

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
is the key to immortality when you're

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.130 
is the key to immortality when you're
playing<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.790> defensive<00:03:16.390> side<00:03:16.600> on<00:03:16.810> a<00:03:16.930> map

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
playing the defensive side on a map

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.020 
playing the defensive side on a map
there<00:03:17.470> is<00:03:17.590> no<00:03:17.739> need<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.010> rush<00:03:18.370> because<00:03:18.640> the

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
there is no need to rush because the

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.270 
there is no need to rush because the
enemy<00:03:19.390> can<00:03:19.600> only<00:03:19.840> win<00:03:20.170> by<00:03:20.560> killing<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:21.160> entire

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
enemy can only win by killing the entire

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.490 
enemy can only win by killing the entire
opposition<00:03:21.880> team<00:03:22.420> or<00:03:22.660> completing<00:03:23.380> the

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
opposition team or completing the

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.710 
opposition team or completing the
objective<00:03:24.040> so<00:03:24.790> for<00:03:25.000> example<00:03:25.480> if<00:03:25.570> you're

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
objective so for example if you're

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.900 
objective so for example if you're
playing<00:03:25.959> dust2<00:03:26.440> in<00:03:26.680> your<00:03:26.829> city<00:03:27.280> don't<00:03:27.610> rush

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
playing dust2 in your city don't rush

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.300 
playing dust2 in your city don't rush
this<00:03:28.120> catwalk<00:03:28.500> instead<00:03:29.500> lock<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:30.070> down<00:03:30.250> with

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
this catwalk instead lock it down with

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.490 
this catwalk instead lock it down with
some<00:03:30.730> of<00:03:31.000> your<00:03:31.090> teammates<00:03:31.510> maybe<00:03:31.750> one<00:03:32.049> guy<00:03:32.230> can

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
some of your teammates maybe one guy can

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.280 
some of your teammates maybe one guy can
stand<00:03:32.769> here<00:03:33.040> he<00:03:33.640> can<00:03:33.850> get<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.030> shot<00:03:34.690> here<00:03:34.959> or

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
stand here he can get a shot here or

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.530 
stand here he can get a shot here or
maybe<00:03:36.010> over<00:03:36.190> here<00:03:36.370> this<00:03:36.730> is<00:03:36.880> my<00:03:37.030> favorite<00:03:37.420> spot

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
maybe over here this is my favorite spot

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.340 
maybe over here this is my favorite spot
they<00:03:37.870> usually<00:03:38.019> don't<00:03:38.489> expect<00:03:39.489> me<00:03:39.730> to<00:03:39.760> be<00:03:40.090> there

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
they usually don't expect me to be there

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.940 
they usually don't expect me to be there
so<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.970> same<00:03:43.209> applies<00:03:43.570> if<00:03:43.959> if<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.470> bomb<00:03:44.680> gets

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
so the same applies if if the bomb gets

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.979 
so the same applies if if the bomb gets
dropped<00:03:45.040> so<00:03:45.640> if<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.090> bomb<00:03:46.239> gets<00:03:46.510> dropped<00:03:46.630> up

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
dropped so if the bomb gets dropped up

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.050 
dropped so if the bomb gets dropped up
the<00:03:47.110> catwalk<00:03:47.620> here<00:03:47.860> it'll<00:03:48.340> light<00:03:48.519> up<00:03:48.549> on<00:03:48.910> your

the catwalk here it'll light up on your

the catwalk here it'll light up on your
mini-map<00:03:49.480> at<00:03:49.810> least<00:03:50.049> for<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:50.260> brief<00:03:50.350> amount<00:03:50.739> of

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:30.140 
good something like this it's very

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.279 
good something like this it's very

simple and when you start fighting with
bursts<00:05:33.770> you<00:05:33.800> will<00:05:34.070> automatically<00:05:34.700> get<00:05:34.910> more

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
bursts you will automatically get more
