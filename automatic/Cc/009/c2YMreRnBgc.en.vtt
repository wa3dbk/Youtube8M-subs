00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.180 

okay<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.880> bridge<00:01:19.530> make<00:01:20.530> it<00:01:20.650> easy<00:01:20.799> to<00:01:20.950> explain

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
okay the bridge make it easy to explain

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.430 
okay the bridge make it easy to explain
not<00:01:21.430> i'll<00:01:21.909> say<00:01:22.150> it<00:01:22.240> has<00:01:22.360> four<00:01:22.810> for<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.290> right

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
not i'll say it has four for the right

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.810 
not i'll say it has four for the right
hand<00:01:23.650> there<00:01:23.830> are<00:01:23.860> four<00:01:24.130> different<00:01:24.280> patterns

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
hand there are four different patterns

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
hand there are four different patterns
the<00:01:25.600> first<00:01:25.840> pattern<00:01:26.050> sounds<00:01:26.979> like<00:01:27.040> this<00:01:27.250> C<00:01:27.840> D

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
the first pattern sounds like this C D

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.830 
the first pattern sounds like this C D
flat<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.470> flat<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.770> let's<00:01:32.920> just<00:01:33.130> see<00:01:33.399> D<00:01:34.299> flat<00:01:34.570> E

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
flat a flat so let's just see D flat E

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.380 
flat a flat so let's just see D flat E
flat<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:36.430> when<00:01:36.580> you<00:01:36.640> start<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:36.970> bridge<00:01:37.149> you're

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
flat so when you start the bridge you're

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.969 
flat so when you start the bridge you're
going<00:01:37.509> to<00:01:37.570> repeat<00:01:37.899> that<00:01:38.140> same<00:01:38.380> pattern<00:01:38.740> four

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
going to repeat that same pattern four

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.180 
going to repeat that same pattern four
times

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.330 

Oh

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.880 

okay<00:01:49.020> that's<00:01:50.020> that<00:01:50.229> you<00:01:50.320> go<00:01:50.409> to<00:01:50.469> the<00:01:50.590> second

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
okay that's that you go to the second

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.370 
okay that's that you go to the second
pattern<00:01:51.189> or<00:01:51.399> a<00:01:51.460> second<00:01:51.789> phrase<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:52.810> it's<00:01:53.079> it's

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
pattern or a second phrase and it's it's

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.340 
pattern or a second phrase and it's it's
a<00:01:53.740> flat<00:01:54.990> F<00:01:55.990> B<00:01:56.729> flat<00:01:57.729> and<00:01:58.659> you're<00:01:59.170> going<00:01:59.289> to

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
a flat F B flat and you're going to

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.789 
a flat F B flat and you're going to
repeat<00:01:59.590> that<00:01:59.740> three<00:01:59.979> times<00:02:00.159> one<00:02:01.090> two<00:02:01.840> three

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
one two okay after that the third phrase

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:17.360 
one two okay after that the third phrase
sounds<00:02:11.110> like<00:02:11.290> f<00:02:12.129> e<00:02:12.760> flat<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.840> E<00:02:14.110> flat

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.399 

okay<00:02:18.030> so<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.360> go<00:02:18.480> through<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:18.720> first<00:02:19.049> set

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
okay so to go through that first set

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:37.540 
okay so to go through that first set
sound<00:02:20.310> like<00:02:20.430> this

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.030 

okay<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.930> second<00:02:39.230> set<00:02:39.380> in<00:02:39.470> the<00:02:39.560> bridge<00:02:39.740> starts

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
okay the second set in the bridge starts

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.460 
okay the second set in the bridge starts
the<00:02:40.220> same<00:02:40.430> start<00:02:41.240> with<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.420> CD<00:02:41.930> flat<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.440> flat

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
the same start with the CD flat a flat

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.040 
the same start with the CD flat a flat
phrase<00:02:43.180> you're<00:02:44.180> gonna<00:02:44.270> do<00:02:44.390> that<00:02:44.450> first<00:02:44.750> phrase

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
phrase you're gonna do that first phrase

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:53.200 
phrase you're gonna do that first phrase
four<00:02:45.350> times

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.850 

but<00:02:54.210> here's<00:02:54.360> where<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.630> changes<00:02:54.990> you're<00:02:55.830> going

but here's where it changes you're going
to<00:02:56.010> go<00:02:56.100> E<00:02:56.370> flat<00:02:57.110> D<00:02:58.110> flat<00:02:58.880> G<00:02:59.880> flat<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.870> get<00:03:01.020> out

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
to go E flat D flat G flat you get out

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:09.560 
to go E flat D flat G flat you get out
twice<00:03:05.960> so<00:03:06.960> that<00:03:07.080> you're<00:03:07.200> going<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.380> go<00:03:07.470> F<00:03:08.570> D

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
twice so that you're going to go F D

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:16.340 
twice so that you're going to go F D
flat<00:03:09.950> G<00:03:10.950> flat<00:03:10.980> and<00:03:11.520> then<00:03:12.510> G<00:03:13.290> flat<00:03:13.790> D<00:03:14.790> flat<00:03:15.350> G

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
flat G flat and then G flat D flat G

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.480 
flat G flat and then G flat D flat G
flat<00:03:16.940> ok<00:03:17.940> so<00:03:18.360> that<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:19.230> second<00:03:19.620> part<00:03:19.860> of<00:03:20.130> the

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
flat ok so that the second part of the

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:39.650 
flat ok so that the second part of the
bridge<00:03:20.970> again<00:03:21.720> sounds<00:03:22.260> like<00:03:22.350> this

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
okay that's the right hand of the bridge

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.600 
okay that's the right hand of the bridge
okay<00:03:43.350> for<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.620> left<00:03:43.800> hand<00:03:44.010> of<00:03:44.070> the<00:03:44.190> bridge<00:03:44.400> I

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
okay for the left hand of the bridge I

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.690 
okay for the left hand of the bridge I
kept<00:03:44.820> it<00:03:44.940> relatively<00:03:45.300> simple<00:03:45.840> it's<00:03:46.680> just<00:03:46.980> one

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
kept it relatively simple it's just one

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.900 
kept it relatively simple it's just one
note<00:03:47.940> each<00:03:48.210> time<00:03:48.540> first<00:03:49.230> note<00:03:49.440> is<00:03:49.470> G<00:03:49.620> flat

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.750 

second<00:03:53.910> notice<00:03:54.120> a<00:03:54.270> flat

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:19.009 
ok and then asked to see it goes back to
G<00:04:09.310> flat<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:11.549> flat<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:15.299> then<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:16.509> goes<00:04:16.600> to<00:04:16.660> be<00:04:18.000> and

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
G flat a flat and then it goes to be and

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.340 
G flat a flat and then it goes to be and
then<00:04:20.019> be<00:04:20.229> again

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
okay that's left hand of the bridge all

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.590 
okay that's left hand of the bridge all
right<00:04:27.190> here's<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.520> bridge<00:04:27.790> plate<00:04:28.390> at<00:04:28.510> a

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
right here's the bridge plate at a

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:40.110 
right here's the bridge plate at a
slower<00:04:28.930> tempo

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:05:00.370
