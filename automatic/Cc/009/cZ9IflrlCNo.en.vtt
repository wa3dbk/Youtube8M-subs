to do a lesson on how to connect the
scales<00:00:20.310> together<00:00:20.669> the<00:00:20.849> modes<00:00:21.200> today<00:00:22.200> we're

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
scales together the modes today we're

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.950 
scales together the modes today we're
going<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.500> be<00:00:22.590> looking<00:00:22.919> at<00:00:23.329> Ionian<00:00:24.329> Andorian

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
going to be looking at Ionian Andorian

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.690 
going to be looking at Ionian Andorian
and<00:00:26.869> you<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:28.050> do<00:00:28.169> this<00:00:28.380> between<00:00:28.919> all<00:00:29.399> of<00:00:29.430> the

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.700 
and you can do this between all of the

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.979 
and you can do this between all of the
difference<00:00:30.000> get<00:00:30.300> all<00:00:30.450> of<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.689> different

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:30.989 
difference get all of the different

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.810 
difference get all of the different
modes<00:00:31.140> because<00:00:31.290> when<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:32.070> way<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.669> like

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
modes because when the way that I like

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.770 
modes because when the way that I like
to<00:00:32.850> play<00:00:33.030> them<00:00:33.180> they're<00:00:33.300> three<00:00:33.510> notes<00:00:33.660> per

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
to play them they're three notes per

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.400 
to play them they're three notes per
string<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.530> notes<00:00:34.850> two<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.059> three<00:00:36.480> are<00:00:36.780> notes

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
string so notes two and three are notes

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.350 
string so notes two and three are notes
one<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.890> two<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> next<00:00:38.520> position<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.180> so

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
one and two of the next position and so

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.630 
one and two of the next position and so
on<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:39.840> forth<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:41.190> anyhow<00:00:41.400> in<00:00:41.520> this

the way through the first position of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.440 
the way through the first position of
Ionian<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.040> then<00:00:50.520> we're<00:00:50.640> going<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.790> shift<00:00:50.880> up

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
or the second position of Ionian

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.550 
or the second position of Ionian
whichever<00:01:48.689> way<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.840> want<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.049> look<00:01:49.170> at<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.439> and

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
I'm going to descend this sequence so on

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.249 
I'm going to descend this sequence so on
the<00:01:53.009> first<00:01:53.220> string<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:53.640> have<00:01:53.670> twelve<00:01:54.600> ten<00:01:54.960> nine

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the first string we have twelve ten nine

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.320 
the first string we have twelve ten nine
and<00:01:55.500> we're<00:01:56.009> gonna<00:01:56.100> do<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.310> same<00:01:56.520> thing<00:01:56.580> on<00:01:57.030> the

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
then we're going to shift down a half of

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.930 
then we're going to shift down a half of

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.280 
a step and we're going to go 11 9 7 on
the<00:02:08.900> 3rd<00:02:09.260> 4th<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.040> 5th<00:02:10.130> string<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:14.150> then<00:02:14.990> when

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
the 3rd 4th and 5th string and then when

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.800 
the 3rd 4th and 5th string and then when
we<00:02:15.350> go<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.680> 6th<00:02:15.980> string<00:02:16.190> it's<00:02:17.030> 10<00:02:17.540> 9<00:02:18.050> 7<00:02:19.810> why

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
we go to the 6th string it's 10 9 7 why

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:21.780 
we go to the 6th string it's 10 9 7 why
your<00:02:20.990> first<00:02:21.260> finger

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
your first finger

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.850 
your first finger
by

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
by

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:35.540 
by
we<00:02:24.370> are<00:02:24.490> back<00:02:24.640> at<00:02:24.790> your<00:02:24.940> routing

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.690 

all<00:02:36.550> right<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:36.880> that's<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.150> great<00:02:37.540> way<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:38.700> kind

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
all right so that's a great way to kind

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.089 
all right so that's a great way to kind
of<00:02:39.730> see<00:02:39.940> how<00:02:39.970> they<00:02:40.209> overlap<00:02:40.510> each<00:02:40.900> other<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.500> a

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
of see how they overlap each other and a

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.710 
of see how they overlap each other and a
good<00:02:42.340> way<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:42.550> that<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:42.849> can<00:02:43.030> make<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:43.420> so<00:02:43.660> you

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
good way to that you can make it so you

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.960 
good way to that you can make it so you
just<00:02:44.020> you<00:02:44.500> really<00:02:44.650> understand<00:02:45.220> how<00:02:45.400> they<00:02:45.790> work

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
just you really understand how they work

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.000 
just you really understand how they work
together<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.020> cool<00:02:47.440> thing<00:02:47.470> about<00:02:47.709> how

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
together so the cool thing about how

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.199 
together so the cool thing about how
they<00:02:48.160> hook<00:02:48.340> together<00:02:48.700> is<00:02:48.880> if<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.120> were

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
they hook together is if you were

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.910 
they hook together is if you were
improvising<00:02:49.660> something<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:50.380> know<00:02:50.500> your<00:02:50.770> your

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
improvising something you know your your

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.350 
improvising something you know your your
soul<00:02:52.950> now<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.010> can<00:02:54.340> shift<00:02:54.790> up<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.209> next

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
soul now you can shift up to the next

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.089 
soul now you can shift up to the next
position<00:02:55.540> just<00:02:55.989> by<00:02:56.110> simply<00:02:56.440> sliding<00:02:56.709> this

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
position just by simply sliding this

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:08.890 
position just by simply sliding this
finger<00:02:57.459> up

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.170 

something<00:03:09.770> like<00:03:09.920> that<00:03:10.130> anyway<00:03:10.700> as<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:11.090> can

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
something like that anyway as you can

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.350 
something like that anyway as you can
see<00:03:12.069> you<00:03:13.069> can<00:03:13.250> incorporate<00:03:13.550> that<00:03:13.819> you<00:03:14.240> know

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
see you can incorporate that you know

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.900 
see you can incorporate that you know
that<00:03:14.780> idea<00:03:14.990> into<00:03:15.620> your<00:03:15.950> improvising<00:03:16.670> so<00:03:16.850> you

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
that idea into your improvising so you

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.910 
that idea into your improvising so you
can<00:03:17.120> like<00:03:17.330> cover<00:03:17.510> you<00:03:17.870> know<00:03:17.959> a<00:03:17.990> bigger<00:03:18.470> area<00:03:18.830> of

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
can like cover you know a bigger area of

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.309 
can like cover you know a bigger area of
the<00:03:19.040> fretboard<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:19.780> be<00:03:20.780> sure<00:03:20.990> to<00:03:21.140> practice

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
the fretboard and be sure to practice

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.979 
the fretboard and be sure to practice
this<00:03:21.830> doing<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:22.400> between<00:03:22.700> all<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.600> positions

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
this doing it between all the positions

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.260 
this doing it between all the positions
so<00:03:24.140> you<00:03:24.170> can<00:03:24.319> do<00:03:24.410> with<00:03:24.560> Ionian<00:03:25.130> to<00:03:25.550> Dorian<00:03:26.000> and

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
so you can do with Ionian to Dorian and

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.890 
so you can do with Ionian to Dorian and
the<00:03:26.450> Dorian<00:03:26.840> to<00:03:26.959> Phrygian<00:03:28.810> Phrygian<00:03:29.810> to

Lydian Lydian to mixolydian mixolydian

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.120 
Lydian Lydian to mixolydian mixolydian
aeolian<00:03:32.750> alien<00:03:33.110> to<00:03:33.170> LA<00:03:33.319> Korean<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:33.830> then<00:03:33.920> lock

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
aeolian alien to LA Korean and then lock

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.400 
aeolian alien to LA Korean and then lock
her<00:03:34.250> in<00:03:34.340> back<00:03:34.520> to<00:03:34.640> Ionian<00:03:35.150> again<00:03:35.420> and<00:03:35.630> be<00:03:36.230> sure

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
her in back to Ionian again and be sure

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.530 
her in back to Ionian again and be sure
that<00:03:36.440> you<00:03:36.680> practice<00:03:37.459> going<00:03:37.850> both<00:03:38.120> directions

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
that you practice going both directions

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.020 
that you practice going both directions
so<00:03:39.050> after<00:03:39.980> you're<00:03:40.130> good<00:03:40.310> at<00:03:40.459> starting<00:03:40.760> you

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
know a sinning Ionian and descending

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.040 
know a sinning Ionian and descending
