00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.160
 this is the third time I see him 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.110
 and with 3 different horses and 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.540
 every time it's a big frenzy with 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.400
 little means and a good job at 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.810
 solder these these plasters of purchase 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.619
 prehistory works of art for these 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.619
 fabulous 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.790
 it's a two horses it's all done 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.720
 with pieces of two horses was 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.050
 inspired rhodes 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.200
 after an old horse hood before 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:09.680
 1960 the rear part of the bodywork 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.420
 is made with a roof of 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.110
 of two horses that was turned from a 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.820
 kart tour the cap is done with 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.190
 rear doors of horses kits 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.930
 and that from where he had his wrists 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.400
 the back is very high because I 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.010
 wanted this together a bunch of 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.590
 20-30 years that seen from afar we have 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.750
 the impression that it is a square box 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.820
 were at the level of the front line 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.460
 this line is a bit like a 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.050
 fin formula 1 so moments I 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.590
 say it's done to hit the car 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.590
 great speed 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.869
 on this car 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.460
 the body was upside down 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.740
 on the chassis the bodywork 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.539
 normally on origin exposed in 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.189
 the other meaning already that the engine he stands 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.259
 found in the front and I have the steering wheel 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.850
 near where I'm like a clown here the 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.740
 only thing I had to do 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.299
 it is at the level of the gearbox 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.850
 as I end up with four walking 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:10.019
 back and a step forward it took 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.280
 that I go back the big pinion we do not 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.810
 falls from a cardboard back to 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.319
 antwerp and it changes the direction of the speeds 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.549
 so I end up with three steps 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.549
 before and marshall islands 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.540
 the idea is to make sure of movements 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.700
 rhodes and dresses in the united states it's 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.329
 with ford 32 30 it was cars 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.890
 very popular 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.629
 and if we in France were two shows 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.019
 so I said to myself I want to do the 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.920
 two horses 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.750
 I work with milk drawings 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.109
 techniques with goals facing view of 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.060
 side to scale I make photocopies 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:53.310
 and after with a pair of scissors I 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.950
 cut them out and he disassemble me 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.639
 this is the aesthetic study shown that one 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.639
 can see things differently
