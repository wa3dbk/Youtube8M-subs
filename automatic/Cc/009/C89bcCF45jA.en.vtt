this it's called the inspiron 3800 it's
the<00:04:19.229> one<00:04:19.380> that<00:04:19.500> I<00:04:19.560> liked<00:04:19.830> so<00:04:20.190> much<00:04:20.220> last<00:04:20.729> year

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
the one that I liked so much last year

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.360 
the one that I liked so much last year
it<00:04:21.479> doesn't<00:04:22.020> have<00:04:22.140> as<00:04:22.320> big<00:04:22.500> of<00:04:22.560> a<00:04:22.740> battery<00:04:23.100> it

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
it doesn't have as big of a battery it

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.120 
it doesn't have as big of a battery it
doesn't<00:04:24.060> have<00:04:24.300> some<00:04:24.870> of<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.710> bells<00:04:25.950> and

whistles that
this<00:04:26.870> has<00:04:27.080> on<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.320> consumer<00:04:27.650> side<00:04:27.800> but<00:04:28.010> it<00:04:28.610> is

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
this has on the consumer side but it is

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.600 
this has on the consumer side but it is
a<00:04:28.970> business<00:04:29.720> laptop<00:04:30.260> that<00:04:30.500> runs<00:04:30.530> even<00:04:30.980> faster

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
a business laptop that runs even faster

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.129 
a business laptop that runs even faster
because<00:04:31.760> it<00:04:32.000> has<00:04:32.150> a<00:04:32.180> better<00:04:32.540> video<00:04:32.810> card

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
because it has a better video card

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.379 
because it has a better video card
that's<00:04:33.830> another<00:04:34.190> con<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:34.610> that<00:04:34.730> is<00:04:34.880> that<00:04:35.270> they

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
that's another con and that is that they

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.240 
that's another con and that is that they
put<00:04:35.630> a<00:04:35.660> video<00:04:35.960> chipset<00:04:36.380> in<00:04:36.710> here<00:04:36.889> which<00:04:37.100> is

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
put a video chipset in here which is

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.580 
put a video chipset in here which is
nice<00:04:37.400> because<00:04:37.610> it's<00:04:37.850> discreet<00:04:38.350> but<00:04:39.350> they

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
nice because it's discreet but they

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.170 
nice because it's discreet but they
could<00:04:39.950> have<00:04:40.070> put<00:04:40.250> something<00:04:40.550> much<00:04:40.700> faster

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
could have put something much faster

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.400 
could have put something much faster
that<00:04:41.330> it<00:04:41.389> would<00:04:41.510> have<00:04:41.600> turned<00:04:41.960> this<00:04:42.200> from

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
that it would have turned this from

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.470 
that it would have turned this from
being<00:04:42.590> just<00:04:42.830> a<00:04:42.919> desktop<00:04:43.310> replacement<00:04:43.480> to

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.790 
seriously look at this look at that
viewing<00:05:05.570> angle<00:05:05.960> that<00:05:06.110> is<00:05:06.290> this<00:05:06.440> so<00:05:06.590> nice

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
that the 3800 might be a slightly better

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.180 
that the 3800 might be a slightly better
notebook<00:05:20.000> for<00:05:20.120> those<00:05:20.240> people<00:05:20.540> on<00:05:20.660> a<00:05:20.690> budget

I'd<00:05:22.190> have<00:05:22.430> to<00:05:22.460> say<00:05:22.820> that<00:05:23.390> the<00:05:23.600> Dell<00:05:23.810> XPS<00:05:23.889> 15<00:05:24.889> is

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
I'd have to say that the Dell XPS 15 is

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.810 
I'd have to say that the Dell XPS 15 is
a<00:05:26.120> by<00:05:26.479> now<00:05:27.139> we<00:05:27.500> will<00:05:27.800> compare<00:05:28.250> this<00:05:28.520> to<00:05:28.790> a

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
a by now we will compare this to a

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.980 
a by now we will compare this to a
couple<00:05:29.150> of<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.270> other<00:05:29.389> notebooks<00:05:29.600> that<00:05:29.810> we've

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
couple of the other notebooks that we've

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.620 
couple of the other notebooks that we've
got<00:05:30.229> in<00:05:30.440> house<00:05:30.830> to<00:05:31.160> see<00:05:31.340> if<00:05:31.490> it<00:05:31.940> compares<00:05:32.240> well

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:32.630 
got in house to see if it compares well

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.219 
got in house to see if it compares well
to<00:05:32.870> say<00:05:33.050> I<00:05:33.080> don't<00:05:33.260> know<00:05:33.470> an<00:05:33.770> acer<00:05:34.610> v15<00:05:35.570> which

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
to say I don't know an acer v15 which

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:38.050 
to say I don't know an acer v15 which
goes<00:05:36.440> for<00:05:36.650> a<00:05:36.680> thousand<00:05:37.130> dollars<00:05:37.370> less<00:05:37.610> we<00:05:37.729> also

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
goes for a thousand dollars less we also

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.600 
goes for a thousand dollars less we also
want<00:05:38.450> to<00:05:38.540> get<00:05:38.690> the<00:05:38.810> inspiron<00:05:39.350> 3800<00:05:40.100> to<00:05:40.400> put

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
want to get the inspiron 3800 to put

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.420 
want to get the inspiron 3800 to put
them<00:05:40.820> side<00:05:41.120> by<00:05:41.150> side<00:05:41.390> and<00:05:41.930> see<00:05:42.229> if<00:05:42.470> the<00:05:42.979> design

them side by side and see if the design

them side by side and see if the design
changes<00:05:43.940> are<00:05:44.150> significant<00:05:45.050> enough<00:05:45.080> to

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
changes are significant enough to

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.900 
changes are significant enough to
warrant<00:05:46.610> one<00:05:46.880> or<00:05:47.360> the<00:05:47.870> other
