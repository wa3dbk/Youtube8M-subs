00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
know what they are so this is what they

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.310 
know what they are so this is what they
look<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.039> here<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.820> outside<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.899> see<00:00:58.170> it

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
look like here on the outside and see it

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.740 
look like here on the outside and see it
says<00:00:58.530> Zelda<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.430> has<00:00:59.579> figure<00:01:00.449> collection
