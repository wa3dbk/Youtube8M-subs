for 95 k listening up 410 k then there's
a<00:04:18.470> Podolski<00:04:19.100> here<00:04:19.340> for<00:04:19.810> 70,000<00:04:20.810> that<00:04:20.900> we're

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
a Podolski here for 70,000 that we're

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.800 
a Podolski here for 70,000 that we're

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
I believe it is the first in form as

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.510 
I believe it is the first in form as
well<00:04:26.420> so<00:04:27.050> there<00:04:27.200> you<00:04:27.230> go<00:04:27.320> Podolski<00:04:28.250> getting

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
to be thirty thousand coins profit that

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.080 
to be thirty thousand coins profit that
is<00:04:44.690> absolutely<00:04:45.260> amazing<00:04:45.970> it's<00:04:46.970> very

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
is absolutely amazing it's very

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.880 
is absolutely amazing it's very
difficult<00:04:47.360> to<00:04:47.600> get<00:04:47.780> over<00:04:47.930> 10k<00:04:48.380> profit<00:04:48.680> in<00:04:48.770> one

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
difficult to get over 10k profit in one

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.470 
difficult to get over 10k profit in one
player<00:04:49.070> so<00:04:49.310> to<00:04:49.370> be<00:04:49.550> hitting<00:04:49.790> 30<00:04:49.970> k<00:04:50.210> on<00:04:50.360> one

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
player so to be hitting 30 k on one

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.690 
player so to be hitting 30 k on one
player<00:04:50.690> is<00:04:50.920> absolutely<00:04:51.920> mental<00:04:52.430> and<00:04:52.580> it's

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
player is absolutely mental and it's

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.890 
player is absolutely mental and it's
often<00:04:52.820> those<00:04:53.090> players<00:04:53.330> in<00:04:53.630> the<00:04:53.690> wrong

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
often those players in the wrong

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.200 
often those players in the wrong
positions<00:04:54.440> so<00:04:54.920> for<00:04:55.220> example<00:04:55.250> Mandzukic<00:04:56.030> is<00:04:56.180> a

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
positions so for example Mandzukic is a

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.690 
positions so for example Mandzukic is a
striker<00:04:56.630> fact<00:04:57.590> these<00:04:57.710> in<00:04:57.890> can<00:04:58.130> people<00:04:58.520> aren't

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
striker fact these in can people aren't

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.250 
striker fact these in can people aren't
going<00:04:58.850> to<00:04:58.940> be<00:04:59.030> looking<00:04:59.270> at<00:04:59.450> him<00:04:59.600> taking<00:05:00.170> as

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
going to be looking at him taking as

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260 
going to be looking at him taking as
much<00:05:00.380> notice<00:05:00.680> and<00:05:01.040> you<00:05:01.490> can<00:05:01.730> make<00:05:02.000> a<00:05:02.030> lot<00:05:02.210> of

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
much notice and you can make a lot of

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.150 
much notice and you can make a lot of
profit<00:05:02.480> on<00:05:02.720> those<00:05:02.900> cards<00:05:03.350> so<00:05:03.500> maybe<00:05:03.710> that<00:05:04.010> you

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
profit on those cards so maybe that you

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.500 
profit on those cards so maybe that you
should<00:05:04.340> develop<00:05:04.730> that<00:05:04.940> into<00:05:05.210> a<00:05:05.240> search

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
should develop that into a search

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.330 
should develop that into a search
technique<00:05:05.990> looking<00:05:06.560> for<00:05:06.710> players<00:05:06.890> out<00:05:07.190> of

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:54.730 
unfortunately in that last game I did
feel<00:06:52.909> a<00:06:53.150> little<00:06:53.419> bit<00:06:53.719> aggrieved<00:06:54.110> I<00:06:54.379> felt<00:06:54.620> I

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:54.740 
feel a little bit aggrieved I felt I

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.010 
feel a little bit aggrieved I felt I
should<00:06:54.800> have<00:06:55.639> potentially<00:06:56.599> what<00:06:56.779> I<00:06:56.810> was

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:57.020 
should have potentially what I was

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.300 
should have potentially what I was
definitely<00:06:57.229> should<00:06:57.560> have<00:06:57.590> won<00:06:57.770> that<00:06:57.800> game<00:06:58.099> as

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.310 
definitely should have won that game as

definitely should have won that game as
you'll<00:06:58.759> see<00:06:58.939> from<00:06:58.969> the<00:06:59.270> stats<00:06:59.539> that<00:06:59.659> are

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.350 
you'll see from the stats that are
coming<00:07:00.110> up<00:07:00.199> in<00:07:00.349> a<00:07:00.529> second<00:07:01.099> you<00:07:01.819> can<00:07:01.969> see<00:07:02.150> that

ya<00:07:16.340> you're<00:07:16.520> going<00:07:16.669> to<00:07:16.729> lose<00:07:16.819> games<00:07:17.120> you<00:07:17.300> don't

00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:17.449 
ya you're going to lose games you don't

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:19.749 
ya you're going to lose games you don't
really<00:07:17.599> want<00:07:17.870> to<00:07:17.930> and<00:07:18.289> we<00:07:19.219> have<00:07:19.430> managed<00:07:19.699> to

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 
really want to and we have managed to

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:21.969 
really want to and we have managed to
take<00:07:19.909> seven<00:07:20.240> points<00:07:20.569> now<00:07:20.750> so<00:07:21.080> we<00:07:21.469> have<00:07:21.710> managed

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:21.979 
take seven points now so we have managed

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:23.890 
take seven points now so we have managed
to<00:07:22.069> take<00:07:22.279> a<00:07:22.310> drawdown<00:07:22.639> which<00:07:23.120> could<00:07:23.389> prove

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:23.900 
to take a drawdown which could prove

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.899 
to take a drawdown which could prove
crucial<00:07:24.259> because<00:07:24.710> if<00:07:24.919> we<00:07:25.009> draw<00:07:25.339> two<00:07:25.610> more<00:07:25.639> and

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:25.909 
crucial because if we draw two more and

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:29.230 
crucial because if we draw two more and
win<00:07:26.089> one<00:07:26.300> we<00:07:27.229> can<00:07:27.379> also<00:07:27.620> end<00:07:28.159> up<00:07:28.729> staying<00:07:29.029> in

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240 
win one we can also end up staying in

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.730 
win one we can also end up staying in
the<00:07:29.330> division<00:07:29.750> rather<00:07:30.080> than<00:07:30.259> having<00:07:30.469> to<00:07:30.560> win

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:30.740 
the division rather than having to win

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.070 
the division rather than having to win
both<00:07:30.979> are<00:07:31.190> two<00:07:31.339> remaining<00:07:31.639> games<00:07:31.909> so<00:07:32.509> yeah

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.080 
both are two remaining games so yeah

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.240 
both are two remaining games so yeah
