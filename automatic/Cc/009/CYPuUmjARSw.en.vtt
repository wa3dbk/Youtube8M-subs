00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
introduced because of uh you know he

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.949 
introduced because of uh you know he
surfaces<00:04:08.760> after<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.150> whole<00:04:09.269> world<00:04:09.540> engine

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
surfaces after the whole world engine

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.750 
surfaces after the whole world engine
thing<00:04:10.170> because<00:04:10.530> let's<00:04:11.040> face<00:04:11.100> it<00:04:11.250> that<00:04:11.400> one

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
thing because let's face it that one

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.580 
thing because let's face it that one
world<00:04:12.360> engine<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:12.870> was<00:04:12.989> in<00:04:13.079> like<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.290> Indian

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
world engine that was in like the Indian

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.430 
world engine that was in like the Indian
Ocean<00:04:13.680> ends<00:04:14.130> up<00:04:14.220> sinking<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:15.660> I<00:04:15.690> guess<00:04:16.019> to<00:04:16.049> the

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
Ocean ends up sinking to I guess to the

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.099 
Ocean ends up sinking to I guess to the
I<00:04:16.829> guess<00:04:17.040> it<00:04:17.190> uh<00:04:17.359> messes<00:04:18.359> up<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.720> city<00:04:18.959> of

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
I guess it uh messes up the city of

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.449 
I guess it uh messes up the city of
Atlantis<00:04:19.590> so<00:04:19.799> there<00:04:20.010> you<00:04:20.130> go<00:04:20.250> right<00:04:20.400> there

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
Atlantis so there you go right there

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.010 
Atlantis so there you go right there
that's<00:04:20.789> how<00:04:20.880> they<00:04:21.030> introduced<00:04:21.390> him<00:04:21.450> which<00:04:21.930> I
