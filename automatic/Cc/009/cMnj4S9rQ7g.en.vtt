00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.350
 dining varhammera for example in a very 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.900

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.990
 elementals that or ice drove who 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.420
 it is more difficult here but nevertheless it 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.070
 also an opportunity but go though all by 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.250
 about the fact that there is little left 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.040
 so that everybody makes a fool 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.110
 hats snowman piling and because they 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.440
 snowmen shoot again and 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.040
 elemental also snowman does not seem 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.590
 especially there will be no them and the knife 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.840
 I took armed and dangerous to me again 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.630

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.530
 little by little because it's Christmas time 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.750
 general, we all need to kill and 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.890
 this pie is faster to take again as well 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.350

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.510

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.120
 like these things online, too, among others in 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.820
 networks can take quite cool when 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.560
 sometimes the arena is really full 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.500

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.170
