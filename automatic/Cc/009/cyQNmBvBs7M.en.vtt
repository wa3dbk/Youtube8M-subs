00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
that point on and we get to the meat of

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.760 
that point on and we get to the meat of
it<00:01:26.619> we<00:01:26.920> get<00:01:27.100> into<00:01:27.400> the<00:01:27.520> engine<00:01:27.640> itself<00:01:28.770> just

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
it we get into the engine itself just

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.800 
it we get into the engine itself just
simply<00:01:30.130> by<00:01:30.280> moving<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.910> Kalen<00:01:31.330> we<00:01:31.450> can<00:01:31.600> tell<00:01:31.780> a

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
simply by moving the Kalen we can tell a

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.330 
simply by moving the Kalen we can tell a
lot<00:01:32.880> dirt<00:01:33.880> daubers<00:01:34.120> are<00:01:34.750> very<00:01:35.530> prominent<00:01:36.040> in
