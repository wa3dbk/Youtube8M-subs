a couple of categories first and first
we're<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.470> take<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.590> look<00:01:07.770> at<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.159> the

we're going to take a look at is the

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.700 
we're going to take a look at is the
camera<00:01:09.000> flash<00:01:09.240> on<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> lot<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.260> cases<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.680> can

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
camera flash on a lot of cases you can

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.160 
camera flash on a lot of cases you can
get<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> little<00:01:11.130> um<00:01:11.400> kind<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:11.970> some-some<00:01:12.210> wash

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
get a little um kind of some-some wash

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.170 
get a little um kind of some-some wash
out<00:01:13.439> images<00:01:14.250> or<00:01:14.460> maybe<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.909> full

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
out images or maybe just a full

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.359 
out images or maybe just a full
reflection<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.020> flash<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:17.070> had<00:01:17.220> some

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
reflection of the flash and I had some

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.520 
reflection of the flash and I had some
issues<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.509> pixelskin<00:01:18.810> HD<00:01:18.869> and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
issues with the the pixelskin HD and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.760 
issues with the the pixelskin HD and
also<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.549> fitted<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.390> think<00:01:21.650> spec<00:01:22.650> has

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
also the fitted and I think spec has

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.200 
also the fitted and I think spec has
come<00:01:22.890> out<00:01:22.979> with<00:01:23.130> new<00:01:23.280> versions<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.820> these<00:01:24.000> I've

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
come out with new versions of these I've

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.030 
come out with new versions of these I've
seen<00:01:24.420> pictures<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.840> with<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.290> larger<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> little

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
seen pictures of with a larger a little

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.499 
seen pictures of with a larger a little
more<00:01:26.159> oval<00:01:26.520> shape<00:01:26.790> go<00:01:27.150> ahead<00:01:27.270> use<00:01:27.390> the

basically not changing the look of the
iphone<00:04:03.000> too<00:04:03.210> much<00:04:03.360> but<00:04:03.510> it<00:04:03.570> just<00:04:03.690> seems<00:04:03.840> it

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.620 
iphone too much but it just seems it
crowded<00:04:04.230> up<00:04:04.470> scratched<00:04:05.130> up<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.580> over<00:04:05.820> time<00:04:06.030> it

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
crowded up scratched up and over time it

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.940 
crowded up scratched up and over time it
just<00:04:06.810> doesn't<00:04:06.960> seem<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.290> look<00:04:07.440> too<00:04:07.650> great<00:04:07.830> so

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
just doesn't seem to look too great so

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.699 
just doesn't seem to look too great so
that's<00:04:08.880> just<00:04:09.030> generally<00:04:09.570> on<00:04:09.750> clear<00:04:10.110> cases<00:04:10.380> but

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
that's just generally on clear cases but

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.020 
that's just generally on clear cases but
specifically<00:04:11.190> on<00:04:11.340> this<00:04:11.459> one<00:04:11.580> at<00:04:11.700> some<00:04:11.820> issues

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
specifically on this one at some issues

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.790 
specifically on this one at some issues
watermarking<00:04:12.600> so<00:04:12.810> they<00:04:12.930> set<00:04:13.110> some<00:04:13.260> artifacts

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
watermarking so they set some artifacts

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.039 
watermarking so they set some artifacts
you'll<00:04:14.790> basically<00:04:14.910> as<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.450> case<00:04:15.630> pressed<00:04:15.900> up

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
you'll basically as the case pressed up

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.210 
you'll basically as the case pressed up
against<00:04:16.350> the<00:04:16.410> back<00:04:16.560> of<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.709> phone<00:04:16.890> that's<00:04:17.130> a

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
against the back of the phone that's a

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.800 
against the back of the phone that's a
bit<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.430> a<00:04:17.489> bummer<00:04:17.670> this<00:04:18.090> one<00:04:18.270> here<00:04:18.480> is<00:04:18.510> the

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
bit of a bummer this one here is the

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.590 
bit of a bummer this one here is the
etch<00:04:18.959> graphite<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.770> reveal<00:04:20.220> or<00:04:20.970> again<00:04:21.330> pretty

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
etch graphite the reveal or again pretty

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.240 
etch graphite the reveal or again pretty
nice<00:04:21.720> case<00:04:21.930> I<00:04:22.109> like<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.380> back<00:04:22.560> you<00:04:22.770> I<00:04:22.800> reviewed

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
nice case I like the back you I reviewed

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.620 
nice case I like the back you I reviewed
the<00:04:23.370> regular<00:04:23.700> reveal<00:04:24.060> that<00:04:24.180> has<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.419> clear

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
the regular reveal that has the clear

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.150 
the regular reveal that has the clear
back<00:04:24.810> kind<00:04:25.140> of<00:04:25.229> same<00:04:25.410> thing<00:04:25.590> with<00:04:25.740> this<00:04:25.860> gets

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
back kind of same thing with this gets

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.200 
back kind of same thing with this gets
scratched<00:04:26.430> up<00:04:26.640> you<00:04:26.850> can<00:04:26.970> see

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
scratched up you can see

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.340 
scratched up you can see
through<00:04:27.389> it<00:04:27.479> so<00:04:27.600> I<00:04:27.630> definitely<00:04:27.810> like<00:04:28.139> this

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
through it so I definitely like this

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.100 
through it so I definitely like this
sort<00:04:29.009> of<00:04:29.069> carbon<00:04:29.400> fiber<00:04:29.669> II<00:04:29.819> looking<00:04:30.360> you<00:04:31.080> know

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
sort of carbon fiber II looking you know

sort of carbon fiber II looking you know
material<00:04:31.740> on<00:04:31.919> it<00:04:31.949> the<00:04:32.430> only<00:04:32.639> thing<00:04:32.850> on<00:04:33.000> it<00:04:33.120> is

material on it the only thing on it is
you<00:04:33.810> know<00:04:33.900> this<00:04:33.990> is<00:04:34.050> just<00:04:34.169> on<00:04:34.680> the<00:04:34.800> borderline

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
you know this is just on the borderline

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.790 
you know this is just on the borderline
of<00:04:35.340> being<00:04:35.610> flabby<00:04:35.910> not<00:04:36.300> too<00:04:36.509> bad<00:04:36.720> but<00:04:37.259> it<00:04:37.680> does

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
of being flabby not too bad but it does

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.140 
of being flabby not too bad but it does
have<00:04:37.949> a<00:04:37.979> little<00:04:38.099> bit<00:04:38.220> of<00:04:38.250> a<00:04:38.310> flabby<00:04:38.550> feel<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:39.120> it

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
have a little bit of a flabby feel to it

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.520 
have a little bit of a flabby feel to it
down<00:04:39.479> here<00:04:39.630> it's<00:04:39.720> pretty<00:04:39.930> thin<00:04:40.139> you<00:04:40.410> know<00:04:40.470> I

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
down here it's pretty thin you know I

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.110 
down here it's pretty thin you know I
could<00:04:40.710> see<00:04:40.889> it<00:04:40.979> maybe<00:04:41.130> you<00:04:41.490> know<00:04:41.699> breaking

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
could see it maybe you know breaking

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.999 
could see it maybe you know breaking
over<00:04:42.419> time<00:04:42.690> but<00:04:43.380> overall<00:04:43.590> pretty<00:04:43.680> nice

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
over time but overall pretty nice

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.439 
over time but overall pretty nice
looking<00:04:44.160> case<00:04:44.460> I<00:04:44.699> think<00:04:44.970> I'm<00:04:45.270> yeah<00:04:45.419> I'm

putting this one in my other top 30 sir
probably<00:04:47.520> number<00:04:47.819> three<00:04:48.180> of<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.050> ones<00:04:49.229> that<00:04:49.289> I

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
probably number three of the ones that I

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.520 
probably number three of the ones that I
like<00:04:49.650> this<00:04:50.099> one<00:04:50.160> here<00:04:50.490> is<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:51.060> motif<00:04:51.530> pretty

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
like this one here is the motif pretty

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.110 
like this one here is the motif pretty
cool-looking<00:04:52.800> design<00:04:53.160> it<00:04:53.580> has<00:04:53.610> this<00:04:53.880> kind<00:04:54.030> of

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
cool-looking design it has this kind of

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.089 
cool-looking design it has this kind of
diamond<00:04:54.509> look<00:04:54.690> on<00:04:54.870> it<00:04:55.050> on<00:04:55.199> that<00:04:55.680> you<00:04:55.800> can<00:04:55.919> see

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
diamond look on it on that you can see

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.370 
diamond look on it on that you can see
overall<00:04:56.759> pretty<00:04:57.270> cool<00:04:57.509> case<00:04:57.720> it<00:04:57.780> is<00:04:58.020> a<00:04:58.050> TPU

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
overall pretty cool case it is a TPU

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:59.839 
overall pretty cool case it is a TPU
plastic<00:04:58.830> so<00:04:58.949> it's<00:04:59.069> similar<00:04:59.280> to<00:04:59.400> this<00:04:59.610> night

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
plastic so it's similar to this night

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.180 
plastic so it's similar to this night
and<00:05:00.780> that<00:05:00.960> quite<00:05:01.199> as<00:05:01.349> rigid<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:01.830> material

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
and that quite as rigid the material

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.640 
and that quite as rigid the material
isn't<00:05:02.310> as<00:05:02.520> thick<00:05:02.550> as<00:05:02.940> the<00:05:03.150> HD<00:05:03.630> but<00:05:04.440> same<00:05:04.620> idea

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
isn't as thick as the HD but same idea

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.310 
isn't as thick as the HD but same idea
not<00:05:05.160> to<00:05:05.360> not<00:05:06.360> not<00:05:06.509> flabby<00:05:06.780> or<00:05:06.990> anything<00:05:07.199> it'll

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
not to not not flabby or anything it'll

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.719 
not to not not flabby or anything it'll
hold<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:07.560> shape<00:05:07.740> pretty<00:05:07.949> well<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:08.639> only

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
hold the shape pretty well the only

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.010 
hold the shape pretty well the only
thing<00:05:08.849> I<00:05:09.000> like<00:05:09.180> about<00:05:09.210> it<00:05:09.419> is<00:05:09.599> it<00:05:09.720> has<00:05:09.840> that

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
thing I like about it is it has that

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.960 
thing I like about it is it has that
kind<00:05:10.169> of<00:05:10.289> jelly<00:05:10.620> kind<00:05:11.190> of<00:05:11.280> gummy<00:05:11.490> feel<00:05:11.759> to<00:05:11.940> it

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
kind of jelly kind of gummy feel to it

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.640 
kind of jelly kind of gummy feel to it
and<00:05:12.210> personally<00:05:12.449> I<00:05:12.690> just<00:05:12.870> don't<00:05:13.199> like<00:05:13.320> it<00:05:13.500> has

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
and personally I just don't like it has

a little bit tacky feel to it you can

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.029 
a little bit tacky feel to it you can
kind<00:05:15.810> of<00:05:15.900> catch<00:05:16.110> some<00:05:16.289> lint<00:05:16.530> a<00:05:16.620> little<00:05:16.830> bit<00:05:16.949> but

have with this one right here too it's a
little<00:05:27.630> bit<00:05:27.720> thin<00:05:27.990> on<00:05:28.169> this<00:05:28.440> side<00:05:28.620> but<00:05:28.889> if<00:05:29.250> you

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
little bit thin on this side but if you

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.370 
little bit thin on this side but if you
dig<00:05:29.610> this<00:05:29.789> you<00:05:30.240> know<00:05:30.330> a<00:05:30.360> little<00:05:30.599> cool<00:05:30.810> graphic

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
dig this you know a little cool graphic

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.200 
dig this you know a little cool graphic
it<00:05:31.500> is<00:05:31.620> pretty<00:05:31.860> cool<00:05:32.009> you'll<00:05:32.580> look<00:05:32.789> to<00:05:32.970> it<00:05:33.090> is

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
it is pretty cool you'll look to it is

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.670 
it is pretty cool you'll look to it is
it<00:05:33.599> kind<00:05:33.750> of<00:05:33.780> catches<00:05:33.930> the<00:05:34.199> light<00:05:34.380> and<00:05:34.560> if

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
it kind of catches the light and if

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.779 
it kind of catches the light and if
you're<00:05:34.770> okay<00:05:34.919> with<00:05:34.949> the<00:05:35.099> gummy<00:05:35.280> you're

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
you're okay with the gummy you're

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:36.920 
you're okay with the gummy you're
probably<00:05:36.000> you<00:05:36.330> know<00:05:36.360> will<00:05:36.570> like<00:05:36.720> this<00:05:36.870> one

probably you know will like this one

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.170 
probably you know will like this one
also<00:05:37.259> and<00:05:37.560> the<00:05:37.979> last<00:05:38.099> one<00:05:38.280> here<00:05:38.460> is<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:38.880> snap

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
also and the last one here is the snap

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.029 
also and the last one here is the snap
from<00:05:39.479> from<00:05:39.870> in<00:05:40.020> case<00:05:40.199> this<00:05:40.620> actually<00:05:40.919> pretty

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
from from in case this actually pretty

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
lightweight case this would probably all

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.890 
lightweight case this would probably all
of<00:05:44.669> these<00:05:45.210> here<00:05:45.419> this<00:05:45.630> is<00:05:45.690> the<00:05:45.780> one<00:05:45.870> I

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
of these here this is the one I

recommend it over the belkin here so

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.129 
recommend it over the belkin here so
this<00:05:50.520> one<00:05:50.699> here<00:05:50.880> is<00:05:50.909> the<00:05:51.330> the<00:05:51.630> smoke<00:05:51.900> I'd

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 
this one here is the the smoke I'd

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:53.300 
this one here is the the smoke I'd
probably<00:05:52.349> recommend<00:05:52.560> this<00:05:52.919> one<00:05:52.979> over<00:05:53.219> the

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
probably recommend this one over the

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.890 
probably recommend this one over the
clear<00:05:53.550> for<00:05:53.759> the<00:05:53.820> same<00:05:54.030> reason<00:05:54.060> I<00:05:54.449> talked<00:05:54.690> about

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
clear for the same reason I talked about

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.439 
clear for the same reason I talked about
clear<00:05:55.199> before<00:05:55.349> pretty<00:05:56.310> nice<00:05:56.460> look<00:05:56.940> on<00:05:57.180> this<00:05:57.389> as

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
clear before pretty nice look on this as

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.050 
clear before pretty nice look on this as
a<00:05:57.830> transparent<00:05:58.830> or<00:05:58.889> translucent<00:05:58.919> look<00:05:59.820> to<00:05:59.940> it

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
a transparent or translucent look to it

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.520 
a transparent or translucent look to it
so<00:06:00.150> you<00:06:00.180> can<00:06:00.330> still<00:06:00.539> see<00:06:00.690> the<00:06:00.719> phone<00:06:01.020> on<00:06:01.289> it

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
so you can still see the phone on it

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
snaps on to the back of the phone so

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.770
