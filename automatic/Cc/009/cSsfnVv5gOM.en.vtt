00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.830
 hello I am today with loïc 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.730
 wring deputy editor of the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.679
 french fisherman 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.599
 so if you want to spend a 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.450
 afternoon fishing but you do not 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.910
 do not know where to find loïc fish 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.310
 now explains how to choose 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.699
 its spot for fishing carnivores in 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.949
 pure water 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.140
 look good here we are on a 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.000
 channel so what's more difficult to 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.480
 read that channel because beats where everything goes 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.519
 looks like 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.260
 and yet and yet it will have to 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.830
 demonstrate a great sense of 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.130
 watching 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.170
 so the first thing to watch will be 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.730
 the presence or absence of forage fish 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.469
 what is called fish 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.809
 fodder it's all small 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.270
 fish that will best appear at 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.510
 carnivorous menu like pike the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.520
 perch the pikeperch or black bass then 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.289
 either we will see others is clear and 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.390
 we will see the fish or we will 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.800
 have a surface animation otherwise 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.600
 said the fish will come to feed themselves 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.680
 on the surface come swallow so what will 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.870
 to immediately identify the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.579
 presence of small fish bands in 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.320
 the opposite case if there really is not 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.100
 of activity will have to look for what 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.740
 we will do now 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.960
 the best evidence of activity 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.580
 carnivorous remains a hunt otherwise 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.380
 says like you have several little ones 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.600
 Fodder fish coming out of the water with 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.350
 a big swirl it's bingo there is a 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.030
 pike in any case there is a predator 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.700
 in the absence of the absence of 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.220
 evidence as tangible so I said 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.140
 we will mostly observe the bank and 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.759
 look for all the accidents otherwise 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.829
 says all that comes to break the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.420
 monotony of the riffs it will be for example 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.689
 this scale that we see just in 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.220
 face of us so the goal of the game is going 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.350
 to be precise in the throw is very 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.540
 accurate in the throw to fall face 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.549
 the ladder there is a potential post the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.439
 fish can hide at the sight of these 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.759
 two is cold and the weights go on without 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.439
 see it up to the final table 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.329
 to do this, we are going to target the other 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.259
 positions it involves having to launch very 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.259
 very very accurate 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.570
 so in this case so we have 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.640
 prospected a ladder but it can be 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.429
 also an exit from cluses as I 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.780
 just behind me it can be 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.550
 orientation changes on the shore 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.709
 like the caf on the wall opposite 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.310
 in short all that comes to break the 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.860
 monotony of the middle in a more medium 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.989
 natural ie rivers ponds where 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.239
 the act the logic remains the same one passes 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.769
 by the sense of observation 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.489
 systematically it can be in a 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.680
 natural environment 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.269
 a flooded wood that is to say a tree that 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.610
 fell into the water with its branches 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.299
 this is a post so it can be 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.010
 the vegetation 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.110
 it can be a gap in 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.910
 water lilies it can be all that 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.099
 is tributary so-called tribes 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.629
 earth are all these posts that he 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.450
 will have to systematically go 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.620
 combed with theirs because that's 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.489
 what carnivores will look for 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.349
 priority 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:49.260
 another very important element as well 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.989
 are the currents the current areas 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.640
 have a direct impact on 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.849
 positioning of fish in particular 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.900
 summer summer the fish batches get 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.010
 warming the fish will go 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.930
 look for cooler areas 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.459
 so where the water is brewed so the 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.150
 currents and especially where water and 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.040
 oxygenated reverse winter the fish 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.109
 will rather seek the men of calm 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.510
 and especially with enough water holes 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.200
 deep where the temperature drops 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.400
 so if you apply all these elements 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.739
 normally you have the right 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.579
 mapping to go look for our 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.579
 carnivorous friends
