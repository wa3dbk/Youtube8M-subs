15<00:00:33.750> we<00:00:34.750> looked<00:00:35.260> at<00:00:35.440> here<00:00:35.949> a<00:00:36.160> search<00:00:36.580> party<00:00:36.790> 15

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
15 we looked at here a search party 15

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.450 
15 we looked at here a search party 15
that<00:00:37.629> we<00:00:37.870> have<00:00:38.379> on<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:38.559> channel<00:00:38.860> as<00:00:39.070> well<00:00:39.400> as

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
that we have on the channel as well as

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.079 
that we have on the channel as well as
if<00:00:40.120> you've<00:00:40.360> got<00:00:40.690> an<00:00:40.960> HP<00:00:41.229> stream<00:00:41.650> 11<00:00:42.129> or<00:00:42.400> HP

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089 
if you've got an HP stream 11 or HP

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:51.869 
if you've got an HP stream 11 or HP
stream<00:00:43.589> 13<00:00:44.589> or<00:00:47.070> an<00:00:48.070> end<00:00:48.400> 28<00:00:48.850> 40<00:00:49.210> in<00:00:49.299> it<00:00:49.420> so<00:00:50.879> we'll

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
stream 13 or an end 28 40 in it so we'll

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.219 
stream 13 or an end 28 40 in it so we'll
take<00:00:52.089> a<00:00:52.119> look<00:00:52.330> at<00:00:52.420> some<00:00:52.600> of<00:00:52.690> the<00:00:52.750> populated

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:53.229 
take a look at some of the populated

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:56.070 
take a look at some of the populated
areas<00:00:53.350> here<00:00:53.769> and<00:00:53.949> see<00:00:54.190> how<00:00:54.720> the<00:00:55.720> framerate

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
areas here and see how the framerate

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.490 
areas here and see how the framerate
ranges<00:00:56.680> now<00:00:56.860> I<00:00:57.159> should<00:00:58.000> tell<00:00:58.750> you<00:00:58.780> that<00:00:59.229> this

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
ranges now I should tell you that this

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:06.300 
ranges now I should tell you that this
is<00:01:02.100> using<00:01:03.100> 1280<00:01:03.909> by<00:01:04.150> 720<00:01:04.659> and<00:01:05.110> we<00:01:05.770> are<00:01:05.920> at<00:01:06.100> the

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
is using 1280 by 720 and we are at the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.690 
is using 1280 by 720 and we are at the
low<00:01:06.610> setting<00:01:07.979> just<00:01:08.979> to<00:01:09.100> gets<00:01:09.310> us<00:01:09.429> the<00:01:09.549> highest

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
low setting just to gets us the highest

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.160 
low setting just to gets us the highest
framerate<00:01:10.179> on<00:01:10.359> this<00:01:10.600> again<00:01:10.869> this<00:01:11.020> is<00:01:11.079> a

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
framerate on this again this is a

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.980 
framerate on this again this is a
low-power<00:01:11.560> processor<00:01:12.280> so<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:13.689> don't<00:01:13.840> want<00:01:13.960> to

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
low-power processor so we don't want to

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.810 
low-power processor so we don't want to
crank<00:01:14.200> it<00:01:14.350> up<00:01:14.409> too<00:01:14.619> much<00:01:14.829> in<00:01:15.219> this<00:01:15.369> game<00:01:15.640> there

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
crank it up too much in this game there

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.149 
crank it up too much in this game there
is<00:01:15.939> there<00:01:16.179> can<00:01:16.210> be<00:01:16.359> a<00:01:16.479> lot<00:01:16.630> of<00:01:16.750> detail<00:01:17.159> and

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
is there can be a lot of detail and

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.849 
is there can be a lot of detail and
animations<00:01:18.670> going<00:01:18.820> on<00:01:19.030> in<00:01:19.179> some<00:01:19.390> of<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.539> areas

00:01:19.849 --> 00:01:19.859 
animations going on in some of the areas

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:22.679 
animations going on in some of the areas
but<00:01:20.859> overall<00:01:21.549> you<00:01:21.820> get<00:01:21.969> a<00:01:21.999> pretty<00:01:22.240> nice<00:01:22.390> look

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
but overall you get a pretty nice look

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:30.899 
but overall you get a pretty nice look
to<00:01:22.719> it<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.710> of<00:01:30.009> course<00:01:30.039> when<00:01:30.369> you<00:01:30.460> don't<00:01:30.700> have

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
to it and of course when you don't have

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.840 
to it and of course when you don't have
that<00:01:30.969> much<00:01:31.329> action<00:01:31.810> going<00:01:32.109> on<00:01:32.799> as<00:01:33.039> you<00:01:33.609> can<00:01:33.670> see

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
that much action going on as you can see

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.819 
that much action going on as you can see
the<00:01:33.969> frame<00:01:34.179> rate<00:01:34.240> does<00:01:34.630> climb<00:01:35.109> even<00:01:35.499> though<00:01:35.710> it

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
the frame rate does climb even though it

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.660 
the frame rate does climb even though it
would<00:01:36.009> look<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:37.030> be<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.689> we're<00:01:37.899> in<00:01:38.079> a<00:01:38.670> much

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
would look to be that we're in a much

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.849 
would look to be that we're in a much
more<00:01:40.499> complex<00:01:41.499> area<00:01:41.950> that's<00:01:42.789> just<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.149> way

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
more complex area that's just the way

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:50.879 
more complex area that's just the way
the<00:01:44.859> cold<00:01:45.130> is<00:01:45.310> written<00:01:45.609> I<00:01:45.700> guess<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:50.649> anyways

00:01:50.879 --> 00:01:50.889 
the cold is written I guess but anyways

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:53.219 
the cold is written I guess but anyways
let's<00:01:51.700> pause<00:01:51.969> this<00:01:52.179> is<00:01:52.359> kind<00:01:52.630> of<00:01:52.689> dark<00:01:52.929> this

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
let's pause this is kind of dark this

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.260 
let's pause this is kind of dark this
zone<00:01:53.469> and<00:01:53.740> we'll<00:01:54.639> pick<00:01:54.759> it<00:01:54.909> up<00:01:54.999> on<00:01:55.149> another

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
zone and we'll pick it up on another

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.099 
zone and we'll pick it up on another
area<00:01:55.719> right<00:01:56.649> here<00:01:56.679> we<00:01:57.009> are<00:01:57.130> in<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.429> dark<00:01:57.729> elf

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
area right here we are in the dark elf

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:02.340 
area right here we are in the dark elf
starting<00:01:59.109> area<00:01:59.289> and<00:02:00.630> what<00:02:01.630> I've<00:02:01.749> done<00:02:01.929> is<00:02:02.170> I've

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
starting area and what I've done is I've

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.840 
starting area and what I've done is I've
put<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:03.090> graphics<00:02:04.090> settings<00:02:04.920> up<00:02:05.920> to<00:02:06.429> fair<00:02:07.060> and

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
put the graphics settings up to fair and

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.340 
put the graphics settings up to fair and
reduce<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.000> shadow<00:02:10.240> quality<00:02:10.720> down<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:11.050> low<00:02:11.170> no

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
reduce the shadow quality down to low no

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.200 
reduce the shadow quality down to low no
we<00:02:11.470> did<00:02:11.620> this<00:02:11.740> test<00:02:11.980> looking<00:02:12.459> at<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.790> HP

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
we did this test looking at the HP

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.920 
we did this test looking at the HP
stream<00:02:13.360> in<00:02:13.600> e<00:02:13.630> PC<00:02:14.020> and<00:02:15.180> we<00:02:16.180> found<00:02:16.360> that<00:02:16.630> the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
stream in e PC and we found that the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.600 
stream in e PC and we found that the
shadow<00:02:17.440> quality<00:02:18.010> has<00:02:18.280> a

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
shadow quality has a

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.090 
shadow quality has a
impact<00:02:19.150> on<00:02:19.360> frame<00:02:19.630> rate<00:02:19.840> and<00:02:20.140> just<00:02:20.860> show<00:02:21.070> you

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
impact on frame rate and just show you

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.980 
impact on frame rate and just show you
will<00:02:21.400> go<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.670> fair<00:02:22.060> here<00:02:22.890> quiet<00:02:24.630> you<00:02:25.630> can<00:02:25.780> see

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
will go to fair here quiet you can see

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.770 
will go to fair here quiet you can see
it<00:02:26.080> really<00:02:26.290> knocks<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.860> down<00:02:26.890> so<00:02:27.630> just<00:02:28.630> by

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
it really knocks it down so just by

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.470 
it really knocks it down so just by
changing<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:29.760> insignificant<00:02:30.760> my<00:02:31.060> opinion

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
changing the insignificant my opinion

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.330 
changing the insignificant my opinion
anyways<00:02:31.950> shadow<00:02:32.950> quality<00:02:34.980> we<00:02:35.980> get<00:02:36.100> a<00:02:36.160> big

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
anyways shadow quality we get a big

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.820 
anyways shadow quality we get a big
boost<00:02:36.520> there<00:02:36.880> which<00:02:37.540> makes<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.350> infinitely

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
boost there which makes it infinitely

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.980 
boost there which makes it infinitely
more<00:02:39.250> playable<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:42.360> lot<00:02:43.360> nicer<00:02:43.570> looking

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
more playable and a lot nicer looking

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.930 
more playable and a lot nicer looking
too<00:02:44.170> if<00:02:44.290> we<00:02:44.410> got<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.220> fair<00:02:45.430> setting<00:02:45.820> up

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
too if we got the the fair setting up

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.620 
too if we got the the fair setting up
here<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.940> we'll<00:02:49.030> just<00:02:49.150> take<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.300> little<00:02:49.450> run

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
here and we'll just take a little run

00:02:49.630 --> 00:03:30.199 
here and we'll just take a little run
around

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:56.720 

so<00:03:30.750> overall<00:03:31.110> it<00:03:31.260> looks<00:03:31.409> pretty<00:03:31.590> nice

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.300 

and<00:03:57.140> okay<00:03:58.140> well<00:03:58.500> thanks<00:03:58.800> for<00:03:58.890> watching<00:03:59.040> what

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
and okay well thanks for watching what

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.190 
and okay well thanks for watching what
we'll<00:03:59.430> do<00:03:59.550> is<00:03:59.670> we'll<00:03:59.819> just<00:04:00.000> hit<00:04:00.180> one<00:04:00.690> more<00:04:00.840> area

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
we'll do is we'll just hit one more area

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.820 
we'll do is we'll just hit one more area
and<00:04:02.690> then<00:04:03.690> get<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:03.959> idea<00:04:04.170> to<00:04:04.379> see<00:04:04.530> with<00:04:04.650> frame

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
and then get the idea to see with frame

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.009 
and then get the idea to see with frame
rate<00:04:05.010> is<00:04:05.190> there<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:06.000> we'll<00:04:06.300> call<00:04:06.599> it<00:04:06.660> a<00:04:06.870> day

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
rate is there and we'll call it a day

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.089 
rate is there and we'll call it a day
all<00:04:07.319> right<00:04:07.379> thanks

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099

the<00:04:10.830> last<00:04:11.069> zone<00:04:11.459> this<00:04:11.849> is<00:04:12.090> uh<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.810> pinned<00:04:13.140> area

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
the last zone this is uh the pinned area

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:20.690 
the last zone this is uh the pinned area
area<00:04:14.510> kind<00:04:15.510> of<00:04:15.630> rhymes<00:04:15.870> there<00:04:16.350> and<00:04:19.340> once<00:04:20.340> again

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
area kind of rhymes there and once again

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.680 
area kind of rhymes there and once again
we've<00:04:21.060> got<00:04:21.090> the<00:04:21.660> low<00:04:22.500> settings<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:23.690> that's

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
we've got the low settings and that's

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:31.190 
we've got the low settings and that's
kind<00:04:24.930> of<00:04:24.960> a<00:04:25.020> nice<00:04:25.169> lush<00:04:25.979> looking<00:04:26.880> area<00:04:27.360> so<00:04:30.200> yeah

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
kind of a nice lush looking area so yeah

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.000 
kind of a nice lush looking area so yeah
I<00:04:31.229> look<00:04:31.470> quite<00:04:31.680> nice<00:04:31.830> our<00:04:32.070> frame<00:04:32.280> rate<00:04:32.490> is<00:04:32.729> very

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
I look quite nice our frame rate is very

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:40.790 
I look quite nice our frame rate is very
playable<00:04:35.010> it's<00:04:35.820> uh<00:04:36.000> it's<00:04:36.600> nice<00:04:39.470> nice<00:04:40.470> frames

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
playable it's uh it's nice nice frames

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.940 
playable it's uh it's nice nice frames
per<00:04:40.979> second<00:04:41.340> we're<00:04:41.430> getting<00:04:41.700> here<00:04:44.780> and<00:04:45.950> I

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
per second we're getting here and I

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.890 
per second we're getting here and I
think<00:04:47.070> what<00:04:47.250> I<00:04:47.310> can<00:04:47.580> say<00:04:47.880> too<00:04:47.940> is<00:04:48.120> overall

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
think what I can say too is overall

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.590 
think what I can say too is overall
we've<00:04:49.229> seen<00:04:49.889> an<00:04:50.040> improvement<00:04:50.460> on<00:04:50.940> this

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
we've seen an improvement on this

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.850 
we've seen an improvement on this
process<00:04:52.110> around<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.530> end

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
process around the end

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.830 
process around the end
28:40<00:04:53.639> then<00:04:53.820> we<00:04:53.970> have<00:04:54.150> when<00:04:54.300> we<00:04:54.419> did<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:54.660> test

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
28:40 then we have when we did the test

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.760 
28:40 then we have when we did the test
using<00:04:55.410> the<00:04:55.970> bait<00:04:56.970> rail<00:04:57.240> T<00:04:57.630> which<00:04:58.440> is<00:04:58.470> the

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
using the bait rail T which is the

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.879 
using the bait rail T which is the
tablet<00:04:59.280> version<00:04:59.310> of<00:04:59.930> HL<00:05:00.930> processor<00:05:01.530> the<00:05:01.710> quad

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
tablet version of HL processor the quad

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:07.820 
tablet version of HL processor the quad
core<00:05:02.190> that<00:05:02.370> we<00:05:02.580> found<00:05:02.820> in<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.150> asus<00:05:03.930> x201<00:05:06.830> sal

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
core that we found in the asus x201 sal

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.390 
core that we found in the asus x201 sal
it'll<00:05:08.010> better<00:05:10.100> probably<00:05:11.100> because<00:05:11.280> their

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
it'll better probably because their

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.590 
it'll better probably because their
clocks<00:05:11.639> be<00:05:11.850> tire<00:05:12.090> and<00:05:12.330> it's<00:05:12.450> not<00:05:12.889> using<00:05:14.600> four

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
clocks be tire and it's not using four

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.990 
clocks be tire and it's not using four
cores<00:05:16.020> so<00:05:16.440> we're<00:05:17.220> not<00:05:17.340> really<00:05:17.490> seeing<00:05:17.789> much

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
cores so we're not really seeing much

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.260 
cores so we're not really seeing much
them<00:05:18.240> of<00:05:18.450> a<00:05:18.840> a<00:05:20.840> hit<00:05:21.840> here<00:05:22.530> so<00:05:23.010> anyways<00:05:23.460> you<00:05:24.240> know

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
them of a a hit here so anyways you know

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.790 
them of a a hit here so anyways you know
what<00:05:24.510> just<00:05:24.900> because<00:05:24.930> we've<00:05:25.200> done<00:05:25.410> the<00:05:25.590> test

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
what just because we've done the test

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
what just because we've done the test
using<00:05:26.669> the<00:05:27.350> settings<00:05:28.350> let's<00:05:29.100> go<00:05:29.280> in<00:05:29.370> here

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
using the settings let's go in here

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.860 
using the settings let's go in here
you've<00:05:30.479> got<00:05:30.830> 720p<00:05:31.830> of<00:05:32.100> course<00:05:32.340> and<00:05:32.720> as<00:05:33.720> you'll

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
you've got 720p of course and as you'll

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.450 
you've got 720p of course and as you'll
notice<00:05:34.080> some<00:05:34.229> low<00:05:34.700> crank<00:05:35.700> it<00:05:35.850> up<00:05:35.940> to<00:05:36.120> fair

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
notice some low crank it up to fair

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.529 
notice some low crank it up to fair
frame<00:05:38.460> rate<00:05:38.700> goes<00:05:38.910> from<00:05:39.090> 30<00:05:39.419> up<00:05:40.050> and<00:05:40.260> quarter

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
frame rate goes from 30 up and quarter

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:45.290 
frame rate goes from 30 up and quarter
to<00:05:43.580> 12

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
to 12

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.980 
to 12
oh<00:05:45.419> that's<00:05:46.139> bad<00:05:47.550> let's<00:05:47.970> drop<00:05:48.210> this<00:05:48.419> down<00:05:48.690> to

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
oh that's bad let's drop this down to

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.110 
oh that's bad let's drop this down to
low<00:05:49.220> see<00:05:50.220> if<00:05:50.340> we<00:05:50.460> get<00:05:50.550> something<00:05:50.849> a<00:05:50.880> little

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
low see if we get something a little

00:05:51.120 --> 00:06:01.270 
low see if we get something a little
more<00:05:51.150> playable<00:05:51.599> we<00:05:51.780> should<00:05:54.590> not<00:05:55.590> much

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.920 

so<00:06:02.280> depending<00:06:02.669> on<00:06:02.759> the<00:06:02.910> area<00:06:03.120> you<00:06:03.539> might<00:06:03.720> want

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
so depending on the area you might want

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.680 
so depending on the area you might want
to<00:06:04.020> play<00:06:04.199> with<00:06:04.699> your<00:06:05.699> configuration<00:06:06.419> as<00:06:06.570> you

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
to play with your configuration as you

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.450 
to play with your configuration as you
saw<00:06:06.810> that<00:06:06.960> blood<00:06:07.229> elf<00:06:07.410> area<00:06:07.770> was<00:06:08.039> quite

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
saw that blood elf area was quite

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.900 
saw that blood elf area was quite
playable<00:06:08.729> with<00:06:09.289> their<00:06:10.289> settings<00:06:10.800> but<00:06:11.580> here

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
playable with their settings but here

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.689 
playable with their settings but here
it's<00:06:12.330> taken<00:06:12.660> too<00:06:12.780> much<00:06:12.930> of<00:06:13.139> a<00:06:13.229> hit<00:06:13.470> we'll<00:06:14.460> go

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:14.699 
it's taken too much of a hit we'll go

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:15.999 
it's taken too much of a hit we'll go
right<00:06:14.970> back

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:16.009 
right back

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:19.760 
right back
change<00:06:17.009> it<00:06:17.250> to<00:06:17.430> low<00:06:18.180> now<00:06:19.080> of<00:06:19.259> course<00:06:19.410> you<00:06:19.650> might

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
change it to low now of course you might

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.110 
change it to low now of course you might

be able to play around with this and get
a<00:06:21.479> mixture<00:06:21.990> of<00:06:22.139> you<00:06:23.009> know<00:06:23.130> better<00:06:23.639> visual

a mixture of you know better visual

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:32.600 
a mixture of you know better visual
quality<00:06:24.330> versus<00:06:27.080> framerate<00:06:29.930> but<00:06:30.930> I<00:06:31.520> think<00:06:32.520> the

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
quality versus framerate but I think the

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.749 
quality versus framerate but I think the
place<00:06:32.789> looks<00:06:33.030> quite<00:06:33.240> nice<00:06:33.389> as<00:06:33.660> it<00:06:33.840> is<00:06:34.610> maybe<00:06:35.610> a

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 
place looks quite nice as it is maybe a

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:37.159 
place looks quite nice as it is maybe a
little<00:06:35.880> bit<00:06:36.060> draw<00:06:36.240> distance<00:06:36.720> would<00:06:36.870> be<00:06:36.900> nice

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:37.169 
little bit draw distance would be nice
