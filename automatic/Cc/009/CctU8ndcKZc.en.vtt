00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
we wanted to have a boat that is

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.920 
we wanted to have a boat that is
autonomous<00:00:37.130> working<00:00:38.130> with<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.550> Sun<00:00:38.930> using

not<00:00:40.410> fossil<00:00:41.220> fuels<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.960> to<00:00:42.960> show<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:44.100> can

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
not fossil fuels and to show that we can

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.910 
not fossil fuels and to show that we can
cross<00:00:44.580> the<00:00:44.850> Atlantic<00:00:45.470> exclusively<00:00:46.470> with

oh<00:00:51.320> I<00:00:52.320> think<00:00:52.800> at<00:00:53.519> the<00:00:53.760> devil<00:00:54.239> there<00:00:54.629> was<00:00:54.750> one

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
oh I think at the devil there was one

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.770 
oh I think at the devil there was one
great<00:00:55.530> moment<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.550> one<00:00:57.239> morning<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.140> sea<00:00:58.440> was

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
great moment a one morning the sea was

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:07.330 
great moment a one morning the sea was
completely<00:01:02.690> like<00:01:03.690> oil<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:06.150> silence<00:01:06.780> were

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
completely like oil and the silence were

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:16.670 
completely like oil and the silence were
absolutely<00:01:08.870> like<00:01:09.870> in<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.170> church

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.470 

here<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.580> concept<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.060> quite<00:01:18.270> different

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
here the concept is quite different

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.320 
here the concept is quite different
because<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.500> are<00:01:19.530> no<00:01:19.710> more<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.820> lake

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
because we are no more in a lake

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.080 
because we are no more in a lake
we've<00:01:21.570> got<00:01:21.870> to<00:01:22.260> live<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.800> that<00:01:22.830> ship<00:01:23.430> we've<00:01:23.790> got

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
we've got to live on that ship we've got

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.980 
we've got to live on that ship we've got
to<00:01:24.390> spend<00:01:25.110> more<00:01:25.380> time<00:01:25.440> and<00:01:26.090> we've<00:01:27.090> got<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.690> mean

to spend more time and we've got I mean

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.410 
to spend more time and we've got I mean
the<00:01:28.260> idea<00:01:28.530> was<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.740> cross<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.160> Atlantic<00:01:29.610> dr.
