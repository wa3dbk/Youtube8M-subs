know the culture there's a perhaps a

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.510 
know the culture there's a perhaps a
more<00:02:14.600> frightening<00:02:14.870> aspect<00:02:15.280> namely<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.310> know

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
more frightening aspect namely I know

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.490 
more frightening aspect namely I know
just<00:02:16.940> how<00:02:17.060> big<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.420> clybourn<00:02:17.660> is<00:02:18.050> because

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
just how big the clybourn is because

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.620 
just how big the clybourn is because
I've<00:02:18.680> heard<00:02:19.400> media<00:02:19.730> reports<00:02:20.150> about<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.510> i've

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
I've heard media reports about it i've

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.020 
I've heard media reports about it i've
seen<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:20.930> covered<00:02:21.260> on<00:02:21.470> TV<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.190> in<00:02:22.340> radio<00:02:22.670> and

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
seen it covered on TV and in radio and

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.660 
seen it covered on TV and in radio and
newspaper<00:02:24.020> so<00:02:24.380> perhaps<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.860> has<00:02:25.040> an<00:02:25.310> even

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
newspaper so perhaps it has an even

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.190 
newspaper so perhaps it has an even
larger<00:02:25.850> than<00:02:26.570> life<00:02:26.870> existence<00:02:27.710> in<00:02:27.860> my<00:02:27.980> mind
