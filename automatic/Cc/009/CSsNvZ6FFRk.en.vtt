00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.460
 there everything good that is the fall of canada to 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.130
 Brazilians and today I 'm here in the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.320
 of Cuba in the western region. 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.490
 a residential area that is in the center 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.259
 of the city 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.539
 but the reason is that the video process to 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:31.919
 you see the arrival of autumn as 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.950
 the leaves are falling as is getting 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.690
 in the city 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.830
 and I think the camera is a bit 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.830
 pie are second 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.130
 Good, I think it's okay going on now. 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.710
 Excuse of the year for Paul 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.270
 I have here an extension that is an area 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.420
 home so if you're coming 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.880
 study English and one is in some 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.860
 school here from the center of the stage to leave 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.740
 or stay deep 10 15 minutes to 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.140
 of the schools is dependent on the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.210
 School location but it is the main 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.990
 reason you see the trees and the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.790
 sheets 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.220
 the yoguland arrival of the good time not 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.310
 live and still gonna get worse 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.050
 enough because all this is going to fall so 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.840
 city ​​hall has a very large work 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.150
 and the people themselves are the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.610
 maintenance of the buildings have a 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.840
 too large to remove these leaves from the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.930
 on the street then just so you have a notion 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.690
 of values ​​in this intention to live here 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.420
 in the center and I came back to have you 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:53.870
 idea here the new apartment by a 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:58.409
 room they are there around from 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.270
 950 US dollars to us by amounts to thousand 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.610
 300 dollars 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.979
 I have a friend that he does not pay 180 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:11.040
 dollars although the treatment of a room 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:13.260
 and my parents also live in the region 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.640
 he their apartment I think if not 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:21.780
 I'm mistaken one thousand and three hundred a month. 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:25.050
 the flat is basic there concludes 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.100
 on the river is furnished but the stove 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.110
 refrigerator 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.240
 then this price may vary slightly 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.510
 depending on the condition of the apartment 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:38.420
 apartment type but it is more or less 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.420
 that you would not be paying here 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:47.610
 now if you do not mind dating 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.160
 in downtown approximately 20 minutes 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.420
 Metro Nene here them today 20:30 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.730
 months you'd be paying is less or 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.140
 by that same value in the range of 200 and 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:04.530
 could be evil and is more spacious 24 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:10.170
 apartment is newer and here we are 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:12.990
 It's coming in the davis done that has another 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.970
 beautiful to show that there are some 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:20.990
 apartments that I can take a step 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.990
 across the street to give you an idea of ​​the price 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:29.130
 crossing the dave these apartments 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.720
 team for this better behavior 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.810
 in this block 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.650
 The one you see is costing 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.740
 around thousand and 100 thousand to two hundred thousand 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.090
 $ 200 per month 

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.090
 completely a pact 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.069
 and here is also a very close region 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.660
 of the mirror she falls 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.130
 if I'm not mistaken, I've already been there 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.340
 Street 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.720
 in another video I did here downtown 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.930
 I will not turn left here to change 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:04.450
 a bit and also to show that the 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.450
 Autumn trees 90 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:11.600
 certainly are in the range of that 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:16.430
 The value I just spoke of is a 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:19.579
 Very good place if you do not mind 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:25.880
 in paying a little more the better place 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:28.010
 is a very popular region here in my 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.979

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.330
