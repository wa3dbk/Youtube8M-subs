00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.990 
setting OS X scales it back to fit the
retina<00:02:02.759> display<00:02:03.119> output<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.140> MacBook<00:02:04.409> Pro

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
retina display output of the MacBook Pro

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.449 
retina display output of the MacBook Pro
but<00:02:06.000> basically<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.500> at<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> highest<00:02:08.009> 4k

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
but basically it is at the highest 4k

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.900 
but basically it is at the highest 4k
setting<00:02:08.869> 3840<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.929> believe<00:02:10.170> by<00:02:10.319> 2160<00:02:10.819> but<00:02:11.819> it

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
setting 3840 I believe by 2160 but it

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.990 
setting 3840 I believe by 2160 but it
scales<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.480> text

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
scales the text

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.470 
scales the text
up<00:02:13.120> so<00:02:13.720> it's<00:02:13.870> easier<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.200> read<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:16.330> that's

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
up so it's easier to read so that's

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.060 
up so it's easier to read so that's
basically<00:02:16.840> it<00:02:16.930> guys<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.410> haven't<00:02:17.680> set<00:02:17.800> up<00:02:17.830> there
