and<00:01:43.400> you<00:01:43.730> want<00:01:43.940> to<00:01:44.000> make<00:01:44.120> sure<00:01:44.150> that<00:01:44.360> you've

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
and you want to make sure that you've

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.960 
and you want to make sure that you've
got<00:01:44.630> enough<00:01:44.750> slack<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:46.160> your<00:01:46.340> cable<00:01:46.520> so<00:01:46.850> that

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
got enough slack and your cable so that

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.310 
got enough slack and your cable so that
you're<00:01:47.090> not<00:01:47.180> running<00:01:47.360> across<00:01:47.630> your<00:01:47.750> fan<00:01:48.110> or

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
you're not running across your fan or

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.750 
you're not running across your fan or
even<00:01:48.500> stretching<00:01:48.860> across<00:01:49.130> your<00:01:49.310> motherboard

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
even stretching across your motherboard

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.149 
even stretching across your motherboard
so<00:01:50.330> placement<00:01:50.840> is<00:01:50.930> super<00:01:51.260> super<00:01:51.440> important<00:01:51.980> so

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
so placement is super super important so

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.070 
so placement is super super important so
definitely<00:01:52.909> like<00:01:53.090> you<00:01:53.120> know<00:01:53.330> what's<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.960> old

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
definitely like you know what's the old

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.710 
definitely like you know what's the old
adage<00:01:54.440> I<00:01:54.710> measure<00:01:55.640> measure<00:01:56.090> twice<00:01:56.330> cut<00:01:56.390> once

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
adage I measure measure twice cut once

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.580 
adage I measure measure twice cut once
right<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:57.380> sort<00:01:57.560> of<00:01:57.590> apply<00:01:57.890> that<00:01:58.070> to<00:01:58.280> this<00:01:59.590> so

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
right so sort of apply that to this so

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.899 
right so sort of apply that to this so
now<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.740> lights<00:02:00.980> that<00:02:01.100> I<00:02:01.220> actually<00:02:01.430> picked

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
now the lights that I actually picked

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.640 
now the lights that I actually picked
were<00:02:02.120> the<00:02:02.180> cathode<00:02:02.960> lighting<00:02:03.290> and<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.440> reason

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
were the cathode lighting and the reason

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.680 
were the cathode lighting and the reason
I<00:02:03.740> did<00:02:03.920> that<00:02:03.950> was<00:02:04.729> just<00:02:04.760> because<00:02:05.090> they

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
I did that was just because they

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.850 
I did that was just because they
actually<00:02:05.960> went<00:02:06.170> with<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.350> placement<00:02:06.740> that<00:02:06.770> I

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
actually went with the placement that I

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.889 
actually went with the placement that I
had<00:02:07.040> in<00:02:07.159> my<00:02:07.190> head<00:02:07.430> for<00:02:07.670> this<00:02:07.790> pimp<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.209> the

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
had in my head for this pimp and the

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.740 
had in my head for this pimp and the
installation<00:02:09.769> was<00:02:10.129> amazingly<00:02:10.909> easy<00:02:11.150> a<00:02:11.269> super

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
installation was amazingly easy a super

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.940 
installation was amazingly easy a super
super<00:02:12.019> doug<00:02:12.170> --it<00:02:12.319> and<00:02:12.530> they<00:02:12.680> were<00:02:12.739> really

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
super doug --it and they were really

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.809 
super doug --it and they were really
affordable<00:02:13.489> as<00:02:13.610> well

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
affordable as well

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:14.979 
affordable as well
so<00:02:14.180> let<00:02:14.300> me<00:02:14.360> show<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.659> ones<00:02:14.810> that<00:02:14.870> I

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
so let me show you the ones that I

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.180 
so let me show you the ones that I
picked<00:02:15.260> out<00:02:15.409> now<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.680> first<00:02:15.920> thing<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.129> can

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
picked out now the first thing you can

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.979 
picked out now the first thing you can
see<00:02:16.310> is<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:16.940> they<00:02:17.120> are<00:02:17.269> long<00:02:17.599> and<00:02:17.810> green

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
see is that they are long and green

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.240 
see is that they are long and green
which<00:02:18.200> is<00:02:18.379> really<00:02:18.620> important<00:02:19.069> for<00:02:19.190> this

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
which is really important for this

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.369 
which is really important for this
particular<00:02:19.400> green<00:02:19.940> lantern<00:02:20.360> pin<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:21.349> other

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
particular green lantern pin the other

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:22.839 
particular green lantern pin the other
thing<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.799> consider<00:02:21.950> is<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.310> fact<00:02:22.610> that<00:02:22.700> these

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
thing to consider is the fact that these

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.880 
thing to consider is the fact that these
particular<00:02:23.180> lights<00:02:23.569> have<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:23.900> power<00:02:24.470> adapter

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
particular lights have a power adapter

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.589 
particular lights have a power adapter
that<00:02:25.040> come<00:02:25.190> with<00:02:25.370> them<00:02:25.549> it's<00:02:26.269> this<00:02:26.390> little

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
that come with them it's this little

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.059 
that come with them it's this little
blue<00:02:26.750> box<00:02:26.959> that<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:27.260> see<00:02:27.440> right<00:02:27.620> here<00:02:27.650> and

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
blue box that you see right here and

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.770 
blue box that you see right here and
that's<00:02:28.909> really<00:02:29.060> important<00:02:29.480> to<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.690> you're

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
that's really important to is you're

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.000 
that's really important to is you're
gonna<00:02:29.840> have<00:02:29.990> to<00:02:30.110> place<00:02:30.319> that<00:02:30.530> inside<00:02:30.860> your

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
gonna have to place that inside your

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.750 
gonna have to place that inside your
system<00:02:31.310> as<00:02:31.520> well

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
system as well

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.860 
system as well
the<00:02:32.940> other<00:02:33.060> thing<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.269> consider<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.840> fact

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
the other thing to consider is the fact

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.509 
the other thing to consider is the fact
that<00:02:34.110> you<00:02:34.290> have<00:02:34.409> these<00:02:34.530> switches<00:02:35.010> these

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
that you have these switches these

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.949 
that you have these switches these
particular<00:02:35.819> lights<00:02:36.180> have<00:02:36.360> switches<00:02:36.810> that

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
particular lights have switches that

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.140 
particular lights have switches that
resemble<00:02:37.349> sort<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.650> just<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.549> know<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.700> PCI

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
resemble sort of just you know the PCI

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.520 
resemble sort of just you know the PCI
card<00:02:39.480> slots<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.870> have<00:02:39.989> on<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.170> back<00:02:40.290> your

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
card slots you have on the back your

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.009 
card slots you have on the back your
machine<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.159> looks<00:02:41.519> just<00:02:41.760> like<00:02:41.909> the<00:02:42.269> the<00:02:42.750> plate

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
machine it looks just like the the plate

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.809 
machine it looks just like the the plate
of<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.290> video<00:02:43.830> card<00:02:44.099> or<00:02:44.220> even<00:02:44.400> a<00:02:44.459> sound<00:02:44.670> card

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
of a video card or even a sound card

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:45.979 
of a video card or even a sound card
that<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.150> would<00:02:45.299> that<00:02:45.599> you<00:02:45.659> would<00:02:45.810> install

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
that you would that you would install

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.630 
that you would that you would install
they're<00:02:46.290> very<00:02:46.650> similar<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.099> that<00:02:47.310> so<00:02:47.549> that

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
they're very similar to that so that

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.280 
they're very similar to that so that
installation<00:02:47.909> is<00:02:48.209> actually<00:02:48.330> you've<00:02:49.049> done<00:02:49.200> it

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
installation is actually you've done it

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.600 
installation is actually you've done it
a<00:02:49.349> hundred<00:02:49.440> times<00:02:49.739> before<00:02:49.890> so<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.400> won't<00:02:50.549> have

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
a hundred times before so you won't have

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.309 
a hundred times before so you won't have
any<00:02:50.670> trouble<00:02:51.000> there<00:02:51.120> at<00:02:51.239> all<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:52.080> those<00:02:52.230> are

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
any trouble there at all so those are

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.229 
any trouble there at all so those are
the<00:02:52.379> lights<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.769> I<00:02:52.950> picked<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:54.030> now<00:02:54.180> that

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
the lights that I picked so now that

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.580 
the lights that I picked so now that
we've<00:02:54.450> we've<00:02:54.780> talked<00:02:54.959> about<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.260> lights<00:02:55.440> we

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
we've we've talked about the lights we

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.869 
we've we've talked about the lights we
talked<00:02:55.799> about<00:02:55.920> what<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.190> need<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.430> do<00:02:56.640> let's

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
talked about what you need to do let's

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.180 
talked about what you need to do let's
talk<00:02:57.030> about<00:02:57.360> installing<00:02:57.959> them<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:58.860> now<00:02:58.980> what<00:02:59.160> I

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
talk about installing them so now what I

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.650 
talk about installing them so now what I
had<00:02:59.400> planned<00:02:59.670> on<00:02:59.790> mine<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.209> since<00:03:00.360> this<00:03:00.450> was<00:03:00.629> a

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
had planned on mine is since this was a

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.839 
had planned on mine is since this was a
plexiglass<00:03:01.200> case<00:03:01.500> I<00:03:01.799> wanted<00:03:02.129> to<00:03:02.250> put<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.579> the

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
plexiglass case I wanted to put the the

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.030 
plexiglass case I wanted to put the the
tube<00:03:03.060> lighting<00:03:03.299> going<00:03:03.690> around<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.409> the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
tube lighting going around the the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.009 
tube lighting going around the the
inside<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.879> Plexiglas<00:03:06.030> because<00:03:06.930> I

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
inside of the Plexiglas because I

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.449 
inside of the Plexiglas because I
thought<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.410> would<00:03:07.530> just<00:03:07.560> make<00:03:07.799> it<00:03:07.950> pop<00:03:08.160> and

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
thought that would just make it pop and

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.550 
thought that would just make it pop and
you'll<00:03:09.390> see<00:03:09.569> that<00:03:09.660> I<00:03:09.720> was<00:03:09.870> bang<00:03:10.049> on<00:03:10.230> here<00:03:10.440> in<00:03:10.500> a

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
you'll see that I was bang on here in a

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.740 
you'll see that I was bang on here in a
second<00:03:10.950> last<00:03:11.879> so<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.239> first<00:03:12.420> thing<00:03:12.510> we<00:03:12.569> want

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
second last so the first thing we want

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.690 
second last so the first thing we want
to<00:03:12.780> do<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.109> once<00:03:13.950> we<00:03:14.010> know<00:03:14.250> where<00:03:14.400> we<00:03:14.459> want<00:03:14.489> to

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
to do is once we know where we want to

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.490 
to do is once we know where we want to
put<00:03:14.849> it<00:03:15.000> we<00:03:15.150> basically<00:03:15.299> take<00:03:15.690> our<00:03:15.900> velcro

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
put it we basically take our velcro

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.589 
put it we basically take our velcro
these<00:03:17.069> particular<00:03:17.370> lights<00:03:17.760> come<00:03:18.030> with<00:03:18.060> with

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
these particular lights come with with

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:19.940 
these particular lights come with with
all<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.840> pieces<00:03:19.019> of<00:03:19.230> velcro<00:03:19.379> that<00:03:19.650> you<00:03:19.799> need

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
all the pieces of velcro that you need

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.280 
all the pieces of velcro that you need
to<00:03:20.160> not<00:03:20.459> only<00:03:20.489> attach<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.209> tubes<00:03:21.450> but<00:03:22.049> also

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
to not only attach the tubes but also

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.460 
to not only attach the tubes but also
attach<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.709> power<00:03:22.950> adapter<00:03:23.430> as<00:03:23.549> well<00:03:23.579> and

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
attach that power adapter as well and

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.569 
attach that power adapter as well and
again<00:03:25.470> I'm<00:03:25.680> going<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.829> harp<00:03:26.129> on<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.370> placement

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
again I'm going to harp on the placement

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.670 
again I'm going to harp on the placement
thing<00:03:26.970> because<00:03:27.239> as<00:03:27.390> I<00:03:27.510> found<00:03:27.750> out<00:03:27.959> that<00:03:28.440> power

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
thing because as I found out that power

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.500 
thing because as I found out that power
adapter<00:03:29.099> can<00:03:29.370> keep<00:03:29.640> your<00:03:29.819> case<00:03:29.970> from<00:03:30.180> closing

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
adapter can keep your case from closing

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.140 
adapter can keep your case from closing
if<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.140> don't<00:03:31.319> have<00:03:31.500> it<00:03:31.620> placed<00:03:31.890> properly<00:03:32.250> so

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
if you don't have it placed properly so

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.610 
if you don't have it placed properly so
as<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.390> can<00:03:33.480> see<00:03:33.540> I<00:03:33.690> had<00:03:33.900> actually<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.290> couple

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
as you can see I had actually a couple

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.170 
as you can see I had actually a couple
of<00:03:34.709> pair<00:03:34.859> of<00:03:34.920> hands<00:03:35.099> my<00:03:35.370> associate<00:03:35.819> producer

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
of pair of hands my associate producer

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.000 
of pair of hands my associate producer
Michael<00:03:36.540> was<00:03:36.780> was<00:03:37.290> jumping<00:03:37.560> in<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.769> help<00:03:37.919> me

Michael was was jumping in to help me

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.159 
Michael was was jumping in to help me
get<00:03:38.130> that<00:03:38.250> placement<00:03:38.489> properly<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.900> make<00:03:40.019> sure

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
get that placement properly to make sure

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:41.569 
get that placement properly to make sure
that<00:03:40.260> we<00:03:40.380> had<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.620> power<00:03:40.799> adapter<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:41.459> the

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
that we had the power adapter and the

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.339 
that we had the power adapter and the
tubes<00:03:41.819> velcroed<00:03:42.389> in<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.569> right<00:03:42.690> places<00:03:42.959> so<00:03:43.260> I

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
tubes velcroed in the right places so I

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.809 
tubes velcroed in the right places so I
could<00:03:43.470> finally<00:03:43.650> get<00:03:43.859> that<00:03:43.950> case<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.370> close<00:03:44.459> I

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
could finally get that case to close I

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.370 
could finally get that case to close I
think<00:03:45.389> he<00:03:45.450> just<00:03:45.569> got<00:03:45.690> tired<00:03:45.959> of<00:03:46.019> watching<00:03:46.109> me

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669 
those power switches in and now it's

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.670 
those power switches in and now it's
time<00:04:14.790> to<00:04:14.849> get<00:04:15.060> these<00:04:15.150> bad<00:04:15.329> boys<00:04:15.540> power<00:04:15.930> so

they're going to get power directly from

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.539 
they're going to get power directly from
the<00:04:18.239> power<00:04:18.419> supply<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:19.109> it's<00:04:19.620> just<00:04:19.889> it's<00:04:20.430> just

the power supply and it's just it's just

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:21.860 
the power supply and it's just it's just
a<00:04:20.639> matter<00:04:20.789> of<00:04:20.880> plugging<00:04:21.090> them<00:04:21.359> in<00:04:21.510> you<00:04:21.630> can<00:04:21.690> see
