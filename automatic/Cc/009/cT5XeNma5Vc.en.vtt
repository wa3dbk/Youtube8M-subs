that<00:02:25.980> space<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.090> we<00:02:27.269> can<00:02:27.659> increase<00:02:28.019> our

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
that space so that we can increase our

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.559 
that space so that we can increase our
reliance<00:02:28.650> on<00:02:28.859> ourselves<00:02:29.430> much<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.150> our<00:02:30.299> growth

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
reliance on ourselves much of our growth

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.110 
reliance on ourselves much of our growth
is<00:02:30.810> organic<00:02:31.319> but<00:02:31.859> a<00:02:32.159> lot<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.519> it<00:02:32.639> comes<00:02:32.909> from

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
is organic but a lot of it comes from

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.789 
is organic but a lot of it comes from
new<00:02:33.239> products<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.989> we'll<00:02:34.230> be<00:02:34.260> doing<00:02:34.650> those

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
new products and we'll be doing those

new products and we'll be doing those
new<00:02:35.040> products<00:02:35.430> in<00:02:35.609> the<00:02:35.700> house<00:02:35.819> as<00:02:36.030> much<00:02:36.060> as

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
new products in the house as much as

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:39.110 
new products in the house as much as
possible<00:02:36.540> we'll<00:02:37.079> be<00:02:37.260> able<00:02:37.409> to<00:02:37.760> produce<00:02:38.760> with<00:02:39.060> a

possible we'll be able to produce with a

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.530 
possible we'll be able to produce with a
lot<00:02:39.329> of<00:02:39.450> flexibility<00:02:40.079> great<00:02:40.950> quality<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.639> be

machining capability Haas has been a
great<00:02:50.310> partner<00:02:50.730> for<00:02:50.760> us<00:02:51.049> we<00:02:52.049> reached<00:02:52.290> out<00:02:52.530> to

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
great partner for us we reached out to

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.770 
great partner for us we reached out to
Haas<00:02:52.859> about<00:02:53.189> five<00:02:53.430> years<00:02:53.639> ago<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.419> we<00:02:54.629> decided

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
Haas about five years ago and we decided

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.920 
Haas about five years ago and we decided
that<00:02:55.260> we<00:02:55.379> wanted<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:55.739> standardize<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.930> stick

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
that we wanted to standardize and stick

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.110 
that we wanted to standardize and stick
with<00:02:58.079> one<00:02:58.319> manufacturer<00:02:59.099> and<00:02:59.400> Haas<00:02:59.760> stepped

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
with one manufacturer and Haas stepped

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.050 
with one manufacturer and Haas stepped
up<00:03:00.299> to<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.569> plate<00:03:00.719> and<00:03:01.500> has<00:03:01.680> been<00:03:01.919> a

up to the plate and has been a

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.290 
up to the plate and has been a
tremendous<00:03:03.060> partner<00:03:03.090> for<00:03:03.840> tor<00:03:04.019> labs
