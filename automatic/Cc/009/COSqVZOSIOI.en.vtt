we<00:04:07.100> mix<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:07.459> match<00:04:07.580> tires<00:04:07.880> GX<00:04:08.360> has<00:04:08.810> been<00:04:08.989> very

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
we mix and match tires GX has been very

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.390 
we mix and match tires GX has been very
good<00:04:09.380> about<00:04:09.440> letting<00:04:09.860> me<00:04:09.890> try<00:04:10.130> out<00:04:10.190> some

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
good about letting me try out some

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.050 
different tires and so we do a lot of
tire<00:04:12.170> testing<00:04:12.620> that<00:04:12.769> way<00:04:12.980> but<00:04:13.610> this<00:04:13.760> bike<00:04:13.940> has

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060

blast what am I going to different well
that's<00:04:28.880> a<00:04:28.970> good<00:04:29.120> question<00:04:29.510> because<00:04:29.810> now<00:04:30.140> it's

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
that's a good question because now it's

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.469 
that's a good question because now it's
truly<00:04:30.979> time<00:04:31.160> to<00:04:31.310> turn<00:04:31.520> this<00:04:31.669> into<00:04:31.880> a<00:04:32.030> hardcore

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
truly time to turn this into a hardcore

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.540 
truly time to turn this into a hardcore
enduro<00:04:32.780> bike<00:04:33.050> and<00:04:33.260> here's<00:04:33.710> what<00:04:33.860> I<00:04:33.890> propose

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
enduro bike and here's what I propose

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.920 
enduro bike and here's what I propose
first<00:04:34.940> of<00:04:35.060> all<00:04:35.120> I'm<00:04:35.270> gonna<00:04:35.390> get<00:04:35.570> rid<00:04:35.780> of<00:04:35.810> this

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
first of all I'm gonna get rid of this

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.190 
first of all I'm gonna get rid of this
Fox<00:04:36.260> Fork<00:04:36.740> well<00:04:37.190> it<00:04:37.310> perform<00:04:37.790> pretty<00:04:38.540> well<00:04:38.690> it

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
Fox Fork well it perform pretty well it

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.710 
Fox Fork well it perform pretty well it
doesn't<00:04:39.500> have<00:04:39.770> a<00:04:40.040> high<00:04:40.940> speed<00:04:41.240> compression

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
doesn't have a high speed compression

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.000 
doesn't have a high speed compression
adjustment<00:04:42.169> which<00:04:42.260> used<00:04:42.470> to<00:04:42.530> bother<00:04:42.740> me

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
adjustment which used to bother me

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.469 
adjustment which used to bother me
because<00:04:43.370> you<00:04:43.640> couldn't<00:04:43.820> adjust<00:04:44.120> it<00:04:44.300> for<00:04:44.419> the

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
because you couldn't adjust it for the

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.510 
because you couldn't adjust it for the
chatter<00:04:44.720> bumps<00:04:44.960> and<00:04:45.290> the<00:04:45.770> other<00:04:45.890> thing<00:04:46.040> is<00:04:46.190> it

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
chatter bumps and the other thing is it

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.240 
chatter bumps and the other thing is it
takes<00:04:46.880> it<00:04:47.870> only<00:04:48.020> goes<00:04:48.260> 30<00:04:48.650> hours<00:04:49.010> is<00:04:49.160> the

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
takes it only goes 30 hours is the

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.100 
takes it only goes 30 hours is the
recommended<00:04:49.669> ride<00:04:50.060> time<00:04:50.300> between<00:04:50.450> rebuilds

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
recommended ride time between rebuilds

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.590 
recommended ride time between rebuilds
and<00:04:51.260> it<00:04:51.650> barely<00:04:51.950> gets<00:04:52.280> you<00:04:52.430> 30<00:04:52.669> hours<00:04:53.030> I<00:04:53.210> had<00:04:53.510> to

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
and it barely gets you 30 hours I had to

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.840 
and it barely gets you 30 hours I had to
rebuild<00:04:53.960> this<00:04:54.080> fork<00:04:54.350> twice<00:04:54.620> myself<00:04:54.890> which<00:04:55.669> I

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
rebuild this fork twice myself which I

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.400 
rebuild this fork twice myself which I
highly<00:04:56.000> recommend<00:04:56.570> learning<00:04:56.930> how<00:04:56.990> to<00:04:57.020> do<00:04:57.229> it's

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
highly recommend learning how to do it's

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
have to rebuild this a lot and I didn't

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.150 
have to rebuild this a lot and I didn't
like<00:05:06.050> the<00:05:06.200> fact<00:05:06.380> that<00:05:06.530> all<00:05:06.650> you<00:05:06.890> get<00:05:07.039> is<00:05:07.130> a

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
like the fact that all you get is a

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.430 
like the fact that all you get is a
cartridge<00:05:07.550> in<00:05:07.789> here<00:05:08.090> and<00:05:08.780> not<00:05:08.990> a<00:05:09.050> lot<00:05:09.200> of<00:05:09.260> your

ride you don't like to fiddle with your

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.490 
ride you don't like to fiddle with your
suspension<00:05:14.300> it'll<00:05:14.900> be<00:05:14.990> fine

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
suspension it'll be fine

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.740 
suspension it'll be fine
because<00:05:15.890> it<00:05:16.039> works<00:05:16.280> really<00:05:16.640> well<00:05:16.910> but<00:05:17.510> the

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
because it works really well but the

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
window that it works really well it is

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.250 
window that it works really well it is

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
only about that wide as soon as it goes

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.190 
only about that wide as soon as it goes
out<00:05:21.470> small<00:05:22.340> bump<00:05:22.580> compliance<00:05:23.120> goes<00:05:23.300> away<00:05:23.600> the

out small bump compliance goes away the
one<00:05:24.380> thing<00:05:24.530> the<00:05:24.650> fork<00:05:24.920> did<00:05:25.100> do<00:05:25.310> though<00:05:25.520> it

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
one thing the fork did do though it

one thing the fork did do though it
always<00:05:26.240> always<00:05:26.870> worked<00:05:27.110> well<00:05:27.380> in<00:05:27.650> big<00:05:28.190> hits<00:05:28.460> so

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
always always worked well in big hits so

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.890

if you're doing some gnarly stuff you'll

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.010 
if you're doing some gnarly stuff you'll
just<00:05:31.970> give<00:05:32.120> up<00:05:32.270> some<00:05:32.420> of<00:05:32.450> the<00:05:32.570> small<00:05:32.810> bump

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
to the bike for sure but I think it's

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.140 
to the bike for sure but I think it's
also<00:05:51.860> gonna<00:05:52.100> make<00:05:52.340> it<00:05:52.490> that<00:05:52.610> much<00:05:52.669> more<00:05:53.090> fun
