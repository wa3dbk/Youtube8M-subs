00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 somehow it happened that the school dockers 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.790
 still there was no guide on the trucks 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.680
 and to some others my show may seem 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.900
 sexist because still it 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.639
 there were only schoolchildren so I decided 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.130
 kill two birds with one release and 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.820
 Today, a schoolgirl will teach us to play 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.820
 by taxi 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.920
 Good day to all of you before 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.559
 pepper 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.670
 that a friend will read this for sure your nickname is they 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:49.000
 epilepsy attack 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:50.739
 I am today, I do not exclude that in the 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.629
 certain circumstances your guide 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.329
 would be useful for example if in dota 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.280
 there was a zero level but it is not exactly 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.289
 same as the meaning in your guide it too 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.030
 no, you know, the opinion is that 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.070
 Some characters are not guides at all 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.869
 we need we can figure out how to 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.610
 play on the river or on zeus but i'm with this 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.259
 don't quite agree because when playing 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.300
 for any character have any 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.460
 tricks whether non-standard procurement 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.500
 you might not know but your mother than 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.630
 a schoolchild can teach me which 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.670
 dota 1 level between legs 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.470
 vagina and in which inventory on 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.600
 start as empty as I have in bed 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.610
 and at night despite the fact that this woman 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.920
 twelve years old she even remains in dota 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.020
 a woman not stopping her useless 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.690
 empty chatter she managed to be late 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.250
 late for the start of creeps stupid manda from 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.020
 you just needed to click 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.789
 right click on the line on which 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.649
 you are going to go well you are not even with this 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.180
 could handle in time if you 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.070
 think she is late because she 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.200
 spent a whole minute choosing which set to take by taxi 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.909
 will look better then you are mistaken 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.310
 she just stood at the base of parole 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:54.369
 some nonsense about he should go to mid 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:58.180
 zeus no principle way and zeus leaders yes 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:01.740

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.740

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.239

 only two people are enough for normal people 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.650

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.209

 sick and you bitch who are you at all for 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:51.260
 the computer started up what is next desirable 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.090

 additional damage from your dexterity 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.340
 oh no no no I understood the cunning plan 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.170
 is to throw them 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.120
 the most extra agility from ults 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.130

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.349

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.880
 12 year old vagina which for some 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.880
 misunderstanding turned up in dota 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.820

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.560
 the end of the guide, a young woman 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.460
 finally go crazy and starts 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.700
 call any random numbers not on 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:15.740

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.620
 what is this thing we don't even know why 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.620
 she first on 55 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.670
 although 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.670
 do what you want 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:16.380
 and our not permanent music rubric 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:18.930
 pause and end up just sap the whole game 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:25.650

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.510
 I did not understand that she is strong onions 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.490
 sadness that her place has ears not in the kitchen 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.960
 it is certainly not in dota perhaps 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.850
 the only question left for me 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.680
 after this match, so this is what planned 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.720

 protection and white stone and although you know 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.020

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:50.880
