00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.770
 Lukas Lukas commuter of seven games 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.490
 undefeated how could there be such a 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.340
 great series 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.350
 I believe that we just work out 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.090
 have arrears and exclusions 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.620
 short work that team and us 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.090
 deserves the points wanted the last 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.129
 games and now is just important 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.809
 that you land again from the previous success 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.620
 three points and that goes on the weekend 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.620
 implement 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.440
 already speaks the weekend to the 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.990
 meet abroad on the roßberger 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.270
 tell us we have to go around there 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.130
 points with his new job it will not be 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.900
 easy game sets from the very for both 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.800
 teams a direct competitor 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.020
 values ​​and that was hugely important when 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.360
 13 points lead and climate protection 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.490
 with europe but as I said it 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.420
 also focus on the special that 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.420
 enormously important trends 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.850
 you only extended this week what 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.000
 in another goal with the sk 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.459
 puntigamer storm graz is just that 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.370
 I play the storm European next 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.350
 Seasonal goal before each game and the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.910
 Pan-European game and that's it 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.440
 whole club again and I wish 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.550
 that we go out that covert 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.550

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.180

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.590

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.420
