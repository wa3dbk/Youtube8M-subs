00:00:00.408 --> 00:00:07.914
We returned on a tuesday morning
to reoccupy the land

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:17.302
and we constructed the hut of resistance 
from the Farmers` Movement of Córdoba.

00:00:17.212 --> 00:00:19.976
The land!

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:28.129
We demand that they return the land to us. 

00:00:28.129 --> 00:00:31.895
The land is ours!

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.681
We are the farmers, 
the owners of this land. 

00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:51.972
We are the grandchildren of the indigenous, 
who were killed by these fucking people.

00:00:51.973 --> 00:00:57.206
They killed many of them and misappropriated our land

00:00:57.207 --> 00:01:01.907
but they never got along with nature.

00:01:01.908 --> 00:01:10.609
We don`t need the lights and comforts of the city.

00:01:17.523 --> 00:01:22.018
We´ve got strong hopes and don´t stop fighting.

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:27.180
We know what we need to, 
no one is going to rule over us.

00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:32.261
We live thanking the earth 
for what she provides us with. 

00:01:32.262 --> 00:01:45.018
And we will stay here
to globalize this fight.

00:01:59.127 --> 00:02:09.537
If we reach something now, 
they have to save it in the future and keep on fighting. 

00:02:09.537 --> 00:02:18.986
Also for the sake of their children...
until everyone can live in freedom. 

00:02:18.987 --> 00:02:22.162
