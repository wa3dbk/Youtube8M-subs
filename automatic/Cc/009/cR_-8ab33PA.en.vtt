00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.020
 According to the GGD, there are two types of people who cause home pollution 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.370
 people who cannot take care of themselves and collectors choose me 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.759
 a collector 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.429
 I'm always looking for beauty 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:18.980
 on the things that bother me 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.939
 and I take it with them, they want both of them as it were 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.189
 feel at home in i feel clear 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.449
 with childish harmony 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.089
 I feel at home at ease 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:31.849
 m calm 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.849
 I have many perpetrators for that myself 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.020
 kees' collective desire began in the early years and has continued to grow 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.020
 The house is full of mole for you and for me but Kees has every one 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.720
 tank a story 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.870
 I was able to collect those cans in the there 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.060
 and that we see life as design halting beauty 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.660
 that often says that in the studio designer 9 Dec came through the 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.350
 police in contact with Christmas but could not detect any inconvenience 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.280
 mister legislation has odor nuisance with just termont with 2 geer 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.310
 and the only problem is that it is currently very full but you can 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.659
 still do everything he can not yet in the kitchen can make my big neat little 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.659
 he can still touch sleep 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.600
 in that sense 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.180
 is it still going very well 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.390
 know how it is that the number of reports of home pollution has doubled 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.580
 no cd no 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.220
 it is possible that she is increasingly known to our care and nuisance reporting point 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.480
 and all healthcare networks that are in all cities 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.240
 that makes people faster m 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.510
 say, coming out of the water 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.760
 years actually do not know well 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.720
 once in his collection no problem m he sometimes gives something 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.560
 away 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.160
 he also needs quite a bit 4 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.920

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.450
