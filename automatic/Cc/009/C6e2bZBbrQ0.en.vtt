00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
any loose ends and begin putting the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.930

as<00:01:53.030> well<00:01:53.240> in<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:54.110> oil<00:01:55.180> looks<00:01:56.180> like<00:01:56.479> I<00:01:56.720> still

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
as well in the oil looks like I still

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.520 
as well in the oil looks like I still
need<00:01:57.409> to<00:01:57.649> tighten<00:01:58.460> up<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:59.509> exhaust<00:01:59.780> manifold

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
need to tighten up the exhaust manifold

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.590 
need to tighten up the exhaust manifold
make<00:02:01.280> sure<00:02:01.429> that<00:02:01.610> sealed<00:02:01.880> up<00:02:02.030> real<00:02:02.210> nice<00:02:02.390> and

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
make sure that sealed up real nice and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.139 
make sure that sealed up real nice and
tight<00:02:02.750> but<00:02:03.289> other<00:02:03.770> than<00:02:03.920> that<00:02:03.979> I<00:02:04.670> think<00:02:04.759> we're

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
tight but other than that I think we're

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.420 
tight but other than that I think we're
looking<00:02:05.240> good
