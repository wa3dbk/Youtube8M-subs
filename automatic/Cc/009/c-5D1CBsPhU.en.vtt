00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
to the phone's innards and look exactly

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.410 
to the phone's innards and look exactly
the<00:00:45.989> same<00:00:46.110> as<00:00:46.469> its<00:00:46.649> predecessor<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.550> fanboys

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the same as its predecessor the fanboys

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.779 
the same as its predecessor the fanboys
on<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> internet<00:00:49.170> practically<00:00:49.789> exploded

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
on the internet practically exploded

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.750 
on the internet practically exploded
that<00:00:51.000> there<00:00:51.180> wasn't<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.690> fresh<00:00:52.110> look<00:00:52.760> Apple

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
that there wasn't a fresh look Apple

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.600 
that there wasn't a fresh look Apple
which<00:00:53.969> prides<00:00:54.480> itself<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:55.230> design<00:00:55.710> must

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
which prides itself on design must

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.810 
which prides itself on design must
deliver<00:00:57.210> something<00:00:57.629> new<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.649> time<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
deliver something new this time so the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.720 
deliver something new this time so the
big<00:01:00.000> speculation<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.199> bigger<00:01:01.649> screen<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
big speculation is a bigger screen the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.189 
big speculation is a bigger screen the
three<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> half<00:01:03.239> inch<00:01:03.629> screen<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
three and a half inch screen of the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.440 
three and a half inch screen of the
current<00:01:04.650> iphone<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.430> becoming<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.060> shrimp

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
current iphone is becoming a shrimp

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.910 
current iphone is becoming a shrimp
compared<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.960> some<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.320> Android

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
compared to some of the Android

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.910 
compared to some of the Android
competition<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> four-inch<00:01:09.720> screen<00:01:10.020> yeah

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
competition so a four-inch screen yeah

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.719 
competition so a four-inch screen yeah
probably<00:01:11.460> but<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.530> 4.6<00:01:13.530> inch<00:01:13.860> screen<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.400> some

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
probably but a 4.6 inch screen is some

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.840 
probably but a 4.6 inch screen is some
have<00:01:14.880> speculated<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.810> doubt<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.530> now<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
have speculated I doubt it now for the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.719 
have speculated I doubt it now for the
body<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> phone<00:01:19.070> previous<00:01:20.070> patents<00:01:20.520> led

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
body of the phone previous patents led

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.640 
body of the phone previous patents led
us<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.880> think<00:01:21.150> Apple<00:01:21.479> might<00:01:21.659> use<00:01:21.869> carbon<00:01:22.350> fiber

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
us to think Apple might use carbon fiber

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.450 
us to think Apple might use carbon fiber
for<00:01:23.070> strength<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.670> maybe<00:01:24.180> color<00:01:25.250> but<00:01:26.250> now<00:01:26.400> the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
for strength and maybe color but now the

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.580 
for strength and maybe color but now the
thinking<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.060> they'll<00:01:27.240> use<00:01:27.450> liquid<00:01:27.750> metal<00:01:28.350> for

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
thinking is they'll use liquid metal for

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.710 
thinking is they'll use liquid metal for
