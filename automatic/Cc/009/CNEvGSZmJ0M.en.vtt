you think we feel there are plenty of
you<00:00:51.780> guys<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.260> voices<00:00:52.440> opinion<00:00:52.980> all<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
you guys that voices opinion all the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.689 
you guys that voices opinion all the
time<00:00:54.079> that<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:55.500> not<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.800> same<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.399> you

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
time that it's just not the same and you

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.680 
time that it's just not the same and you
don't<00:00:56.850> really<00:00:56.969> like<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> direction<00:00:57.570> that

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
don't really like the direction that

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.110 
don't really like the direction that
it's<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.520> end<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.789> guess<00:00:59.940> my

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
it's going and in the end I guess my

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.580 
it's going and in the end I guess my
honest<00:01:00.420> opinion<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.050> feel<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.289> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
honest opinion is that I feel like the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.009 
honest opinion is that I feel like the
emphasis<00:01:02.070> has<00:01:02.309> shift<00:01:02.640> from<00:01:02.940> chef<00:01:03.510> shifted

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
emphasis has shift from chef shifted

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.960 
emphasis has shift from chef shifted
from<00:01:04.229> creativity<00:01:04.979> fun<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.519> kick<00:01:05.760> ass

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
from creativity fun and kick ass

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.330 
from creativity fun and kick ass
gameplay<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.439> money<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.340> status<00:01:10.130> really<00:01:11.130> when

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
gameplay to money and status really when

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.800 
gameplay to money and status really when
I<00:01:11.369> think<00:01:11.610> about<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.180> bottom<00:01:12.479> line<00:01:12.630> is

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
I think about it like the bottom line is

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.120 
I think about it like the bottom line is
for<00:01:13.020> me<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.530> not<00:01:13.650> being<00:01:13.890> fun<00:01:14.100> a

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
for me is that it's not being fun a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.340 
for me is that it's not being fun a
little<00:01:14.280> bit<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.020> sense<00:01:16.229> your

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
little bit and I can sense your

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.770 
little bit and I can sense your
frustration<00:01:16.920> hutchins<00:01:17.450> that's<00:01:18.450> because

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
frustration hutchins that's because

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.719 
frustration hutchins that's because
that's<00:01:18.930> something<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.229> ice<00:01:19.500> I've<00:01:19.950> seen<00:01:20.400> in

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
something that I think a lot of people

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.510 
something that I think a lot of people
have<00:04:04.690> lost<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:05.380> it's<00:04:05.500> sad<00:04:05.650> to<00:04:05.710> see<00:04:06.010> and<00:04:06.220> she's

something<00:04:06.790> I've<00:04:06.910> never<00:04:07.090> experienced<00:04:07.780> in<00:04:07.840> all

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
something I've never experienced in all

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.050 
something I've never experienced in all
the<00:04:08.050> years<00:04:08.140> I've<00:04:08.380> gained<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:08.970> something<00:04:09.970> i

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
the years I've gained and something i

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.220 
the years I've gained and something i
looked<00:04:10.210> at<00:04:10.300> my<00:04:10.360> brother's<00:04:10.660> a<00:04:10.750> good<00:04:10.870> example<00:04:11.200> so

looked at my brother's a good example so

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.600 
looked at my brother's a good example so
what<00:04:11.380> do<00:04:11.440> you<00:04:11.500> think<00:04:11.680> is<00:04:11.770> a<00:04:11.800> flaw<00:04:12.040> people<00:04:12.370> have

the<00:04:13.120> whole<00:04:13.300> idea<00:04:13.870> of<00:04:13.960> status<00:04:14.740> being<00:04:15.130> in<00:04:15.310> it

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
the whole idea of status being in it

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.460 
the whole idea of status being in it
being<00:04:15.760> an<00:04:15.940> issue<00:04:16.030> or<00:04:16.239> a<00:04:16.450> factor<00:04:16.870> is<00:04:17.050> just<00:04:17.260> like

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
being an issue or a factor is just like

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.320

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
playing and that is again something I

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.540 
playing and that is again something I
definitely<00:04:37.000> am<00:04:37.150> NOT<00:04:37.890> supporting<00:04:38.890> of<00:04:39.220> and<00:04:39.460> I

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
definitely am NOT supporting of and I

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.430 
definitely am NOT supporting of and I
don't<00:04:39.760> I<00:04:40.000> think<00:04:40.510> it<00:04:40.600> definitely<00:04:40.720> affects<00:04:41.200> the

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
don't I think it definitely affects the

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.220 
don't I think it definitely affects the
game<00:04:41.680> plays<00:04:41.980> we<00:04:42.160> see<00:04:42.430> and<00:04:42.790> I<00:04:42.970> know<00:04:43.900> you're

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
game plays we see and I know you're

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:45.990 
game plays we see and I know you're
talking<00:04:44.590> more<00:04:44.800> of<00:04:45.040> what<00:04:45.280> directors<00:04:45.820> are

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
talking more of what directors are

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.570 
talking more of what directors are
producing<00:04:46.750> and<00:04:46.990> why<00:04:47.620> they're<00:04:47.860> producing<00:04:48.430> it

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
producing and why they're producing it

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.610 
producing and why they're producing it
but<00:04:48.880> I<00:04:49.090> just<00:04:49.570> think<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:49.930> basics<00:04:50.320> are<00:04:50.410> getting

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
but I just think the basics are getting

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.070 
but I just think the basics are getting
back<00:04:50.770> to<00:04:50.890> the<00:04:50.980> basics<00:04:51.100> of<00:04:51.460> gaming<00:04:51.880> and<00:04:52.080> that

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
back to the basics of gaming and that

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.110 
back to the basics of gaming and that
will<00:04:53.260> help<00:04:53.440> just<00:04:54.010> be<00:04:54.130> foundation<00:04:54.820> I<00:04:54.940> think

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
will help just be foundation I think

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.430 
will help just be foundation I think
that's<00:04:55.240> the<00:04:55.360> foundation<00:04:55.510> of<00:04:56.020> a<00:04:56.260> good

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
that's the foundation of a good

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.490 
that's the foundation of a good
community<00:04:57.100> is<00:04:57.340> a<00:04:57.370> strong<00:04:57.790> love<00:04:58.600> and<00:04:58.960> joy<00:04:59.260> of

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
community is a strong love and joy of

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.880 
community is a strong love and joy of
gaming<00:04:59.980> and<00:05:00.130> not<00:05:00.850> having<00:05:01.660> those<00:05:02.170> attitudes<00:05:02.530> so

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
gaming and not having those attitudes so

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.400 
gaming and not having those attitudes so
what<00:05:03.520> do<00:05:03.580> you<00:05:03.640> think<00:05:03.760> it's<00:05:03.850> really<00:05:04.060> up<00:05:04.210> to<00:05:04.480> to
