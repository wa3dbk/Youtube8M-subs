one of these days again which hopefully

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.189 
one of these days again which hopefully
won't<00:03:19.940> be<00:03:20.090> too<00:03:20.239> much<00:03:20.389> further<00:03:20.540> you<00:03:20.930> know<00:03:21.019> maybe

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:21.199 
won't be too much further you know maybe

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:24.280 
won't be too much further you know maybe
just<00:03:21.440> a<00:03:21.530> month<00:03:21.709> or<00:03:21.799> so<00:03:22.299> but<00:03:23.299> then<00:03:23.480> we<00:03:23.660> will<00:03:23.900> do

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
just a month or so but then we will do

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.960 
just a month or so but then we will do
another<00:03:24.319> like<00:03:24.799> hundred<00:03:25.190> pack<00:03:25.370> opening<00:03:25.790> that's

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
another like hundred pack opening that's

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.150 
another like hundred pack opening that's
what<00:03:26.150> I'm<00:03:26.239> hoping<00:03:26.389> so<00:03:26.840> I'd<00:03:27.199> rather<00:03:27.530> instead<00:03:27.859> do

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160
