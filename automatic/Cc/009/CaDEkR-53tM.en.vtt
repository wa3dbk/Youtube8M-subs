use it to turn out with the merged
section<00:01:26.870> then<00:01:27.560> I'll<00:01:27.680> keep<00:01:27.860> on<00:01:27.950> creating<00:01:28.430> new

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
section then I'll keep on creating new

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.460 
section then I'll keep on creating new
knots<00:01:28.790> incorporating<00:01:29.540> extra<00:01:29.870> hair<00:01:30.080> from<00:01:30.290> the
