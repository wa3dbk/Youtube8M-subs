00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
was an alien transmission at the time of

was an alien transmission at the time of

death the estimated time of death from
the<00:05:34.159> coroner<00:05:34.550> matches<00:05:35.000> with<00:05:35.150> part<00:05:35.389> of<00:05:35.510> the

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
the coroner matches with part of the

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.080 
the coroner matches with part of the
recording<00:05:36.199> that<00:05:36.500> is<00:05:36.710> missing<00:05:37.220> in<00:05:37.370> time<00:05:37.669> the

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
recording that is missing in time the

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.700 
recording that is missing in time the
theory<00:05:38.449> is<00:05:38.479> that<00:05:38.570> the<00:05:38.840> transmission<00:05:39.409> was<00:05:39.560> at

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
theory is that the transmission was at

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.100 
theory is that the transmission was at
such<00:05:39.979> a<00:05:40.010> high<00:05:40.280> frequency<00:05:40.580> that<00:05:41.389> it<00:05:41.510> vibrated

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
such a high frequency that it vibrated

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.830 
such a high frequency that it vibrated
the<00:05:42.199> membranes<00:05:42.710> of<00:05:42.889> the<00:05:43.039> techs<00:05:43.310> brain<00:05:43.970> causing

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
the membranes of the techs brain causing

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.200 
the membranes of the techs brain causing
him<00:05:44.990> to<00:05:45.169> have<00:05:45.260> seizure-like<00:05:45.830> symptoms<00:05:46.210> very

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
him to have seizure-like symptoms very

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.390 
him to have seizure-like symptoms very
interesting<00:05:47.960> theory<00:05:48.380> here<00:05:48.650> but<00:05:48.860> again<00:05:49.190> the

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
interesting theory here but again the

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.920 
interesting theory here but again the
coroner

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
coroner

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.560 
coroner
just<00:05:50.169> says<00:05:50.410> a<00:05:50.680> seizure<00:05:51.250> is<00:05:51.550> a<00:05:51.580> seizure<00:05:51.910> if<00:05:52.449> you

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
just says a seizure is a seizure if you

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.570 
just says a seizure is a seizure if you
have<00:05:52.690> any<00:05:52.870> information<00:05:53.050> about<00:05:53.530> this<00:05:53.710> or<00:05:54.160> any

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
have any information about this or any

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.969 
have any information about this or any
of<00:05:54.820> the<00:05:54.940> cases<00:05:55.120> presented<00:05:55.539> here<00:05:56.139> leave<00:05:56.740> it<00:05:56.889> in

of the cases presented here leave it in

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:58.770 
of the cases presented here leave it in
the<00:05:57.039> comments<00:05:57.520> section<00:05:57.580> and<00:05:58.000> maybe<00:05:58.210> you<00:05:58.509> can

the comments section and maybe you can

the comments section and maybe you can
