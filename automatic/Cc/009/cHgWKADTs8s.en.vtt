basically<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> staggering<00:00:45.510> pattern<00:00:46.020> what<00:00:46.800> it

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
basically a staggering pattern what it

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.700 
basically a staggering pattern what it
is<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.250> see<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.550> part<00:00:47.879> here<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.690> then<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
is you see this part here and then the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.619 
is you see this part here and then the
next<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.280> kind<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.610> starts<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.480> middle

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
next one it kind of starts in the middle

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.200 
next one it kind of starts in the middle
of<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.050> part<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.610> hair<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.059> lay

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
of that part so that the hair can lay

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.750 
of that part so that the hair can lay
more<00:00:54.420> flat<00:00:54.719> or<00:00:54.989> not<00:00:55.170> more<00:00:55.500> flat<00:00:55.829> Ramon<00:00:56.219> natural
