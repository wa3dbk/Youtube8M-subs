heat<00:00:04.350> problem<00:00:04.920> for<00:00:05.190> my<00:00:05.279> electrical<00:00:05.879> dryer<00:00:06.230> the

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
heat problem for my electrical dryer the

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.470 
heat problem for my electrical dryer the
problem<00:00:08.809> is<00:00:09.809> now<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.230> motor<00:00:10.860> motor<00:00:11.309> runs<00:00:11.759> but

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
problem is now the motor motor runs but

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.570 
problem is now the motor motor runs but
there's<00:00:12.660> no<00:00:12.840> heat<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.710> first<00:00:13.950> thing<00:00:14.160> we<00:00:14.400> need

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
there's no heat the first thing we need

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.519 
there's no heat the first thing we need
to<00:00:14.610> test<00:00:14.940> whether<00:00:15.240> there's<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.870> power<00:00:16.109> here

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
to test whether there's a power here

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.730 
to test whether there's a power here
outlet<00:00:17.100> there<00:00:18.029> are<00:00:18.119> three<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.449> them<00:00:18.560> and<00:00:19.560> you

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
outlet there are three of them and you

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.910 
outlet there are three of them and you
need<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.010> test<00:00:20.250> whether<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.939> good

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
need to test whether is good

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.490 
need to test whether is good
228<00:00:23.420> 110<00:00:24.470> and<00:00:25.470> then<00:00:26.480> we<00:00:27.480> test<00:00:27.720> this<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.109> okay

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
228 110 and then we test this is okay

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.020 
228 110 and then we test this is okay
and<00:00:28.740> then<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.279> plug<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:31.309> back<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.700> then

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
and then we plug in this back and then

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.420 
and then we plug in this back and then
follow<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:34.050> wire<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.739> come<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.309> this

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
follow this wire and come to this

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.299 
follow this wire and come to this
terminal<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:36.840> terminal<00:00:36.920> supposed<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.129> be

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
terminal the terminal supposed to be

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.030 
terminal the terminal supposed to be
there<00:00:39.059> are<00:00:40.250> 220<00:00:41.250> between<00:00:41.790> those<00:00:42.030> two<00:00:43.040> between

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
there are 220 between those two between

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.660 
there are 220 between those two between
those<00:00:44.430> two<00:00:44.670> it's<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.090> 100-ton<00:00:46.370> between<00:00:47.370> those

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
those two it's a 100-ton between those

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.459 
those two it's a 100-ton between those
two<00:00:48.890> 110<00:00:49.890> again<00:00:50.250> if<00:00:50.520> everything<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.449> fine<00:00:51.750> then

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
two 110 again if everything is fine then

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.010 
two 110 again if everything is fine then
you<00:00:52.649> have<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.949> disconnect<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.969> remember<00:00:54.780> I

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
you have to disconnect this remember I

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.650 
you have to disconnect this remember I
don't<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.910> safety<00:00:57.300> safety

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
don't is this is a safety safety

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.930 
don't is this is a safety safety
disconnect<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.399> there's<00:00:59.670> no

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
disconnect this so there's no

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.410 
disconnect this so there's no
electricity<00:01:00.770> that<00:01:01.770> on<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.789> can<00:01:03.000> work<00:01:03.210> on

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
electricity that on this you can work on

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.800 
electricity that on this you can work on
that<00:01:03.719> safely<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.470> then<00:01:05.570> once<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.780> are

candles you remove you are going to see
there's<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:38.150> heating<00:01:39.150> coil<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:40.189> heating<00:01:41.189> coil

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
there's a heating coil and heating coil

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:49.940 
there's a heating coil and heating coil
is<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:44.750> part<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:47.430> way<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:48.770> take<00:01:49.770> it

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
is in this part and the way to take it

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.709 
is in this part and the way to take it
out<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.329> use

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:57.569 

and<00:01:55.719> take<00:01:56.049> this<00:01:56.200> screw<00:01:56.649> there's<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.100> score<00:01:57.429> on

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
and take this screw there's a score on

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.050 
and take this screw there's a score on
the<00:01:57.759> side<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.479> take<00:01:59.319> it<00:01:59.499> out<00:01:59.679> the<00:02:00.100> way<00:02:00.280> I<00:02:00.579> take

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
the side and take it out the way I take

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.609 
the side and take it out the way I take
it<00:02:01.179> out<00:02:01.359> and<00:02:01.600> use<00:02:01.810> this<00:02:02.079> one<00:02:02.609> to<00:02:03.609> take<00:02:04.030> it<00:02:04.179> out

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
it out and use this one to take it out

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.709 
it out and use this one to take it out
so<00:02:05.619> once<00:02:06.340> you<00:02:06.520> manage<00:02:06.909> to<00:02:07.030> take<00:02:07.209> the<00:02:07.390> screw<00:02:07.689> out

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
so once you manage to take the screw out

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:12.300 
so once you manage to take the screw out
this<00:02:08.140> will<00:02:09.539> select<00:02:10.539> out<00:02:10.929> easily<00:02:11.260> so<00:02:11.769> remember

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
this will select out easily so remember

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.479 
this will select out easily so remember
there<00:02:12.549> is<00:02:12.640> only<00:02:12.849> take<00:02:13.150> one<00:02:13.510> screw<00:02:14.099> so<00:02:15.099> this<00:02:15.310> is

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
there is only take one screw so this is

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.199 
there is only take one screw so this is
the<00:02:15.700> heating<00:02:15.970> coil<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.920> you<00:02:17.980> exam<00:02:18.549> the<00:02:18.790> heating

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
the heating coil so you exam the heating

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.380 
the heating coil so you exam the heating
coil<00:02:22.349> this<00:02:23.349> side<00:02:23.590> it<00:02:23.769> looks<00:02:23.799> fine<00:02:24.310> there's<00:02:25.150> no

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
coil this side it looks fine there's no

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.840 
coil this side it looks fine there's no
problem
