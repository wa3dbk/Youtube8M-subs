00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
do is use an acrylic silicon clock which

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.440 
do is use an acrylic silicon clock which
is<00:01:28.320> very<00:01:28.650> easy<00:01:28.890> it's<00:01:29.159> water-based<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:30.299> can

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
is very easy it's water-based you can

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.730 
is very easy it's water-based you can
just<00:01:30.630> squirt<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:30.990> out<00:01:31.140> with<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> caulk<00:01:31.710> gun

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
just squirt it out with a caulk gun

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.219 
just squirt it out with a caulk gun
around<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.460> whole<00:01:32.610> entire<00:01:33.030> base<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.600> normally

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
around the whole entire base I normally

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.200 
around the whole entire base I normally
use<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.439> sponge<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.009> push<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.490> as<00:01:35.820> tight<00:01:35.880> as

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
use a sponge and push it in as tight as

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.679 
use a sponge and push it in as tight as
I<00:01:36.270> can

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
I can

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.749 
I can
then<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.350> dampen<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.860> sponge<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.400> wipe<00:01:38.640> it

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
then I dampen the sponge and I wipe it

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.300 
then I dampen the sponge and I wipe it
one<00:01:38.939> time<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:40.170> dries<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.619> place<00:01:40.829> clear<00:01:41.159> and

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
one time and it dries in place clear and

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.639 
one time and it dries in place clear and
it's<00:01:41.460> very<00:01:41.670> easy<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.180> water<00:01:42.420> soluble<00:01:42.960> now

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
it's very easy it's water soluble now

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.899 
it's very easy it's water soluble now
we're<00:01:43.799> getting<00:01:43.950> ready<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.130> install<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.610> seat
