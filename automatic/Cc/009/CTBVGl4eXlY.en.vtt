00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.340
 At this time we will put together several 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.980
 concepts of phase 1 and make the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.689
 of a shorts using a cloth of 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.000
 decoration but can also replace 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.810
 for other fabrics having the same 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.369
 structure such as jean the denim and jeans 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.859
 Let's go to another class on our course. 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.200
 I'll start by making the pocket mount 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.930
 right and I suggest you 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.239
 that of the phase which explains the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.800
 Will of various types of pocket and go 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.140
 depending on the model you are going to 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.420
 You're using this one, I need to give you a 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.210
 stand on this corner because he has a 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.550
 different design but if it is a pocket 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.170
 Knife or round boy is just to study 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.850
 right with right and turns everything 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.590
 province then make 13 points to 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.649
 I'm using the width of the shoe to 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.489
 make 1 3 point as low as 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.489
 this way here 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:17.360
 Okay, now I'll get the bottom of my pocket and 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.369
 put right with the right to change the 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.469
 point of my engine produced zag and 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.259
 do a work in Schulle ado 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:38.780
 board in that pocket and then make the 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:40.700
 straight seam and the pro pocket ladinho 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.349
 do not stay open thus hinder the 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.819
 other assembly steps 

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:46.429
 I'll make a sewing holding 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.799
 end of the bag on the side and 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.179
 also at the top edge 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.189
 this will help the pocket look good 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.950
 fresh and does not disturb the rest of the 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.530
 sewing now I think the close of 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.450
 back and this will depend on whether 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.700
 your model will or will not have a part 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.380
 brings also have a class in phase 1 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.310
 showing how to close think 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.310
 perfectly well 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.390
 continuous has no secret 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.390
 think closed 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.220
 now I'll neither shorts on the sides 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.620
 back piece with front piece 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:32.440
 right makes a mixture of 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:35.080
 schulle adu and then straight and gets this 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.970
 so that a well reinforced posture 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.280
 I'm closing now between pen 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.860
 also with these two types of 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.290
 sewing now I 'm going to insert a piece 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.239
 inside the other one by the right another 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.480
 by placing the right 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.150
 right and also have a class only 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.040
 goose closure in phase 1 then you 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.959
 can attend all these classes to 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.849
 then watch the assembly of the part 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.709

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:03.569
 closing the hook as the seam of 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.569

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.180
 and this step is to mount the zip with the 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.310
