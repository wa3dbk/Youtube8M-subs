 These are the most beautiful puppies in the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.050
 world and these puppies are up for adoption 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.200

 to feed and soon I will give them to me 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.050
 It's going to hurt a lot because I love them so much 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.820
 but bread will be the option very soon the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.829
 little puppies the puppies 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.470

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.550

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.160

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.020

 and well, hopefully and you have 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.240
 unfortunately, not everything is 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.069
 nice in this video we already saw the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.869
 full of life puppies that are in 

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:16.509
 adoption and then there's always going to be 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.579
 someone to help is always going to see a 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.819
 puppy on this occasion I'm going to 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.619
 get help I will introduce the noé 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:25.750
 is called not now I explain why 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.959
 they call it or the miren is a puppy that 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.939
 I picked him up to rescue him there in San 

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:33.729
 Andrés tenejapan is a puppy that already 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.979
 has 15 days in this condition at 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.170
 it seems they were machetearon the leg walked 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.090
 wandering around she was wandering and 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.590
 we decided to go for it and help him 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.469
 So what you have to do 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.329
 so she consults is to amputate the 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:47.950
 leg you have to amputate the leg 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.110
 I want to tell you that this kind of 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.549
 situations in these places is very 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:57.520
 common people who suffer from alcoholism 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:01.149
 who suffers from many situations many 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:04.390
 circumstances as they always belittle 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.119
 a dog's life as a human being you 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.550
 I'm going to ask a question how long 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.890
 I would stand to be in this condition 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.330
 of his paw 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.330
 now imagine your arm 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.950
 he has been in this 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.860
 situation now see your hand from your foot and 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.290
 imagine the in the situation of the animal 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.930
 how long would it take to be so 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.819
 This dog carries more than a week so 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.500
 because it's called is not good I do not call you 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.060
 well because yesterday I saw the movie I did not know 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.709
 he made a movie with a very message 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.110
 pretty many people will say like new 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.510
 as you do not put a biblical name not 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.150
 you name him a human being he is 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.220
 a dog but let me tell you in that 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.379
 movie and a very important message I 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.840
 I'm not much of the bible and I do not 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:54.200
 Interested but a message that 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.660
 I learned well from this movie this I know 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.910
 I will comment very fast is supposed to 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.760
 the creator instructed not to build 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.620
 an ark in which I would save all 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.090
 innocent beings of the earth when the 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.950
 son of noah asked his father 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.340
 who are the innocent beings of the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.590
 land he answered the animals and 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.959
 said a very wise phrase the animals 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.109
 they are innocent beings and we have 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.030
 to take care of them and protect them and that is a 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.069
 very wise phrase and I think that's why I 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.739
 call 9 because it turns out that he 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.959
 god the ark commanded her to build for 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.359
 animals not for humans 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.040
 the creator sent a flood so that 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.620
 cleanse the earth of the human race 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.810
 now god should think about 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.030
 a second flood to clean the 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.489
 crap and the decline in which we 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.790
 we find ourselves humans this is 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.790
 An example 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.459
 or not 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.590
 please 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.290
 do not 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.290
 or not 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.129
 and when you see this type of case in the 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.810
 that the human being does not take care of his 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.909
 brother or in their living beings to the 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.890
 living beings that surround them is when I 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.689
 I'm thinking it should happen one 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.760
 second flood to clean the 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:20.729
 crap that is the human race then 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.539
 this little dog is called 9 so I think that 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.539
 I put a good name 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.189
 I think that if we are not in time to 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:33.189
 make up for all the damage we have done to him 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:36.560
 to mother nature to living beings 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:40.070
 that surround us I think that 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:44.210
 we could change ourselves I think 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.850
 that we could improve a lot before 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.040
 God think of a second of rain and 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.110
 let's all go where we have to 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.500
 be watching the movie is not a great 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.520
 movie do not see her by the side 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.280
 ecclesiastical do not see it from the side 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.340
 religious see it with a movie with a 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.950
 great message and they will see that they will go out with 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.900
 a great taste in the mouth of the cinema 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.240

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:12.160
