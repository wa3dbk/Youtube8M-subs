00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.560 
didn't manage to pull out a good game
apparently<00:00:07.919> I<00:00:08.130> think<00:00:09.000> Jason<00:00:09.330> might<00:00:09.360> have

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
apparently I think Jason might have

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.140 
apparently I think Jason might have
actually<00:00:09.840> been<00:00:09.960> in<00:00:10.110> this<00:00:10.200> match<00:00:10.469> let's<00:00:11.150> we'll

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
actually been in this match let's we'll

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.129 
actually been in this match let's we'll
check<00:00:12.420> real<00:00:12.660> quick

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
check real quick

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.369 
check real quick
Jason<00:00:14.009> was<00:00:14.309> on<00:00:14.759> my<00:00:15.450> team<00:00:15.509> from<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.139> match

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
Jason was on my team from this match

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.260 
Jason was on my team from this match
however<00:00:17.100> he<00:00:17.340> will<00:00:17.430> not<00:00:17.580> be<00:00:17.699> commentating

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
however he will not be commentating

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.460 
however he will not be commentating
because<00:00:18.449> he's<00:00:18.630> not<00:00:18.810> always<00:00:18.960> available<00:00:19.109> to

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
because he's not always available to

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.490 
because he's not always available to
commentate<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.880> it's<00:00:21.840> actually<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.170> my<00:00:22.260> team

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
commentate so it's actually on my team

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
killing two teammates before I get to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.459 
killing two teammates before I get to
put<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.250> final<00:00:41.850> bullet<00:00:42.000> into<00:00:42.270> him<00:00:42.360> I'm<00:00:43.290> not<00:00:43.410> sure

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
put a final bullet into him I'm not sure

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.650 
put a final bullet into him I'm not sure
if<00:00:43.770> my<00:00:43.950> tactics<00:00:44.460> had<00:00:44.610> completely<00:00:45.210> changed<00:00:45.570> by

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
if my tactics had completely changed by

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.900 
if my tactics had completely changed by
this<00:00:45.719> point<00:00:46.200> but<00:00:46.440> I'm<00:00:47.070> definitely<00:00:47.340> not<00:00:47.579> using

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
this point but I'm definitely not using

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.100 
this point but I'm definitely not using
scavenger<00:00:48.510> Pro<00:00:48.750> anymore<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:50.510> know<00:00:51.510> for<00:00:51.930> pretty

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
scavenger Pro anymore I know for pretty

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.930 
scavenger Pro anymore I know for pretty
much<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.440> fact<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:55.309> reload<00:00:56.309> cancel<00:00:56.699> did<00:00:56.789> not

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
much a fact that reload cancel did not

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.740 
much a fact that reload cancel did not
work<00:00:57.620> didn't<00:00:58.620> expect<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.100> guy<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.370> uh<00:00:59.750> to

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
work didn't expect that guy to uh to

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.630 
work didn't expect that guy to uh to
kill<00:01:00.960> me<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.230> act<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.620> guy's<00:01:01.770> reaction<00:01:02.250> time

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
kill me and act that guy's reaction time

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.009 
kill me and act that guy's reaction time
was<00:01:02.820> actually<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.300> slow<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.750> see<00:01:03.989> I

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
was actually really slow you see I

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.649 
was actually really slow you see I
watched<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.530> whole<00:01:04.619> kill<00:01:04.860> cam<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.659> I'm

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
watched the whole kill cam and I'm

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.170 
watched the whole kill cam and I'm
fairly<00:01:07.200> certain<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:08.159> didn't<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:09.000> to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
fairly certain that if I didn't have to

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.510 
fairly certain that if I didn't have to
try<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.479> reload<00:01:09.930> cancel<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.560> probably<00:01:11.340> would

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
try to reload cancel I probably would

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.190 
try to reload cancel I probably would
have<00:01:11.580> ended<00:01:11.700> up<00:01:12.000> killing<00:01:12.270> him<00:01:12.360> because<00:01:12.720> he

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
have ended up killing him because he

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.840 
have ended up killing him because he
definitely<00:01:13.560> took<00:01:13.920> his<00:01:14.070> free<00:01:14.250> time<00:01:14.280> trying<00:01:14.760> to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
definitely took his free time trying to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.740 
definitely took his free time trying to
shoot<00:01:15.030> me<00:01:15.860> no<00:01:16.860> offense<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.369> him<00:01:17.549> usually<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.390> can

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
shoot me no offense to him usually I can

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.840 
shoot me no offense to him usually I can
I<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.320> point<00:01:19.530> out<00:01:19.710> where<00:01:19.770> was<00:01:20.220> my<00:01:20.430> fault

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
I can point out where was my fault

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.920 
I can point out where was my fault
or<00:01:21.509> if<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.930> was<00:01:22.049> just<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.530> know<00:01:23.210> what<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:24.720> I

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
or if it was just you know what but I

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.240 
or if it was just you know what but I
think<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.170> was<00:01:25.229> both<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.830> shouldn't<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.130> been

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
think it was both I shouldn't have been

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.190 
think it was both I shouldn't have been
trying<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.640> reload<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.240> quick<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.750> he<00:01:28.080> was

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
trying to reload that quick and he was

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.840 
trying to reload that quick and he was
actually<00:01:28.380> really<00:01:28.650> slow<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.009> react<00:01:29.369> so<00:01:29.520> sorry

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
actually really slow to react so sorry

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.319 
actually really slow to react so sorry
but<00:01:30.090> but<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:31.070> don't<00:01:32.070> know<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.310> my<00:01:32.490> my<00:01:32.909> tactics

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
but but I don't know if my my tactics

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.390 
but but I don't know if my my tactics
had<00:01:33.450> changed<00:01:33.750> completely<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:34.470> I'll<00:01:35.159> go<00:01:35.310> ahead

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
had changed completely but I'll go ahead

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.080 
had changed completely but I'll go ahead
and<00:01:35.579> tell<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:35.909> how<00:01:36.780> I've<00:01:37.049> changed<00:01:37.130> I<00:01:38.130> get<00:01:38.939> rid

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
of scavenger Pro I'm pretty sure I'm

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.109 
of scavenger Pro I'm pretty sure I'm
still<00:01:42.360> using<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:43.610> don't<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.729> don't<00:01:44.790> know<00:01:44.939> what

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
still using I don't I don't know what

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.880 
still using I don't I don't know what
their<00:01:45.360> marathon<00:01:45.990> maybe<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.409> might<00:01:46.680> be<00:01:46.770> using

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
their marathon maybe I might be using

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.749 
their marathon maybe I might be using
marathon<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.450> got<00:01:48.630> tonight's<00:01:49.490> hardcore<00:01:50.490> I

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
marathon like I got tonight's hardcore I

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.359 
marathon like I got tonight's hardcore I
think<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.630> eventually<00:01:51.750> just<00:01:52.170> kind<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.409> sit<00:01:53.250> it

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
think I eventually just kind of sit it

hardline<00:06:56.610> Pro<00:06:56.790> was<00:06:56.970> useful<00:06:57.360> because<00:06:57.479> if<00:06:57.720> you

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
hardline Pro was useful because if you

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:59.360 
hardline Pro was useful because if you
have<00:06:57.990> a<00:06:58.020> teammate<00:06:58.410> that<00:06:58.470> has<00:06:58.830> a<00:06:58.860> care<00:06:59.190> package

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.370 
have a teammate that has a care package

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
and he gets an ammo and just leaves it

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.140 
and he gets an ammo and just leaves it
you<00:07:01.740> can<00:07:01.889> walk<00:07:02.070> over<00:07:02.100> there<00:07:02.490> change<00:07:02.789> it<00:07:02.970> and

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150 
you can walk over there change it and

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.540 
you can walk over there change it and
take<00:07:03.389> it<00:07:03.419> pretty<00:07:04.020> much<00:07:04.199> and<00:07:04.500> I've<00:07:05.070> gotten<00:07:05.400> some

pretty good stuff like that guy's got an
ammo<00:07:07.229> crate<00:07:07.500> it's<00:07:08.130> pretty<00:07:08.340> much<00:07:08.460> too<00:07:08.639> close<00:07:08.850> to

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:08.970 
ammo crate it's pretty much too close to

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:09.920 
ammo crate it's pretty much too close to
the<00:07:09.060> end<00:07:09.120> of<00:07:09.210> the<00:07:09.270> game<00:07:09.389> for<00:07:09.570> me<00:07:09.630> to<00:07:09.690> go<00:07:09.780> over
