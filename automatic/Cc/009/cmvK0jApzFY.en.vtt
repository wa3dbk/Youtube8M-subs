Stan<00:01:02.989> at<00:01:03.260> number<00:01:03.559> 10<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.010> that<00:01:04.190> is<00:01:04.400> resistance

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
Stan at number 10 and that is resistance

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.460 
Stan at number 10 and that is resistance
of<00:01:05.360> fate<00:01:05.600> this<00:01:06.530> is<00:01:06.680> a<00:01:06.710> gun<00:01:07.100> based<00:01:07.460> RPG<00:01:08.470> instead

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
of fate this is a gun based RPG instead

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.140 
of fate this is a gun based RPG instead
of<00:01:09.560> using<00:01:09.740> magic<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:10.280> swords<00:01:10.670> stuff<00:01:10.970> like

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
of using magic and swords stuff like

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.340 
of using magic and swords stuff like
that<00:01:11.300> you're<00:01:11.480> using<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.840> actual<00:01:12.110> guns

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
that you're using the actual guns

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.260 
that you're using the actual guns
machine<00:01:12.800> pistols<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:13.430> you<00:01:13.940> know<00:01:14.000> how<00:01:14.210> to

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
machine pistols and you know how to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.990

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
really good go right number 9 for me is

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.630 
really good go right number 9 for me is
an<00:01:37.730> infinite<00:01:38.180> undiscovered<00:01:39.310> when<00:01:40.310> it<00:01:40.460> first

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
an infinite undiscovered when it first

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.890 
an infinite undiscovered when it first
came<00:01:40.880> out<00:01:41.060> there<00:01:41.300> was<00:01:41.420> going<00:01:41.510> to<00:01:41.570> be<00:01:41.630> a<00:01:41.690> toss-up
