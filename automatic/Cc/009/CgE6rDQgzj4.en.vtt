00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
1195 but even when the power goes up to

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.569 
1195 but even when the power goes up to
42<00:00:51.180> 95<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.750> still<00:00:51.899> not<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> bad<00:00:52.320> deal<00:00:52.590> for<00:00:52.649> the
