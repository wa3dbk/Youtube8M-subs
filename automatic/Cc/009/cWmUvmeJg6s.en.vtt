00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
well we have a lot of new content so

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.710 
well we have a lot of new content so
there's<00:00:21.950> nine<00:00:22.310> new<00:00:22.580> civilizations<00:00:23.360> and<00:00:23.630> all

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.540 
there's nine new civilizations and all
sorts<00:00:23.990> of<00:00:24.020> new<00:00:24.080> building<00:00:24.530> some<00:00:24.680> units<00:00:25.010> but<00:00:25.310> we

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
sorts of new building some units but we

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.030 
sorts of new building some units but we
really<00:00:25.820> like<00:00:25.970> to<00:00:26.030> emphasize<00:00:26.810> the<00:00:27.620> new<00:00:27.770> game

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 
really like to emphasize the new game

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.180 
really like to emphasize the new game
systems<00:00:28.430> that<00:00:28.580> have<00:00:28.670> gone<00:00:28.790> on<00:00:28.850> so<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:30.500> biggest

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.190 
systems that have gone on so the biggest

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.070 
systems that have gone on so the biggest
one<00:00:31.400> of<00:00:31.490> those<00:00:31.580> is<00:00:31.760> probably<00:00:31.910> religion<00:00:32.510> right

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.080 
one of those is probably religion right

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.200 
one of those is probably religion right
at<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:33.260> beginning<00:00:33.530> of<00:00:33.560> the<00:00:33.650> game

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
at the beginning of the game

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.660 
at the beginning of the game
civilizations<00:00:35.210> can<00:00:35.540> start<00:00:36.350> to<00:00:36.520> worship<00:00:37.520> a

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
civilizations can start to worship a

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.460 
civilizations can start to worship a
pantheon<00:00:38.300> of<00:00:38.330> gods<00:00:38.630> which<00:00:38.930> gives<00:00:39.140> them<00:00:39.230> one

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
pantheon of gods which gives them one

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.740 
pantheon of gods which gives them one
new<00:00:39.680> gameplay<00:00:40.130> benefit<00:00:40.550> and<00:00:40.760> it<00:00:41.390> just<00:00:41.540> kind<00:00:41.690> of

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
new gameplay benefit and it just kind of

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.090 
new gameplay benefit and it just kind of
builds<00:00:41.989> from<00:00:42.140> there<00:00:42.200> throughout<00:00:42.950> the

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
builds from there throughout the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.010 
builds from there throughout the
medieval<00:00:43.340> and<00:00:43.610> renaissance<00:00:43.720> periods<00:00:44.720> we

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
medieval and renaissance periods we

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.450 
medieval and renaissance periods we
really<00:00:45.260> are<00:00:45.440> excited<00:00:45.590> about<00:00:45.890> that<00:00:46.010> system

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
really are excited about that system

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.280 
really are excited about that system
because<00:00:46.790> it<00:00:46.940> allows<00:00:47.180> players<00:00:47.809> to<00:00:48.110> customize

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
because it allows players to customize

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.200 
because it allows players to customize
their<00:00:48.800> strategies<00:00:49.250> when<00:00:49.790> we<00:00:49.910> released

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
their strategies when we released

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.150 
their strategies when we released
civilization<00:00:50.690> 5<00:00:50.930> we<00:00:51.440> had<00:00:51.620> completely

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
civilization 5 we had completely

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.530 
civilization 5 we had completely
rewritten<00:00:52.490> the<00:00:52.670> combat<00:00:53.000> system<00:00:53.210> we'd

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:53.540 
rewritten the combat system we'd

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.910 
rewritten the combat system we'd
completely<00:00:54.050> rewritten<00:00:54.290> the<00:00:54.470> diplomatic

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
completely rewritten the diplomatic

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.310 
completely rewritten the diplomatic
system<00:00:55.250> and<00:00:55.910> to<00:00:56.060> add<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.240> religion<00:00:56.900> system<00:00:57.260> at

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
system and to add the religion system at

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.200 
system and to add the religion system at
least<00:00:57.440> as<00:00:57.620> it<00:00:57.740> was<00:00:57.920> or<00:00:58.280> layered<00:00:58.850> on<00:00:59.000> top<00:00:59.030> of

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
least as it was or layered on top of

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.120 
least as it was or layered on top of
that<00:00:59.450> we<00:01:00.140> thought<00:01:00.350> would<00:01:00.470> be<00:01:00.500> a<00:01:00.620> little<00:01:00.950> bit<00:01:01.040> of

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
that we thought would be a little bit of

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.730 
that we thought would be a little bit of
overkill<00:01:02.090> so<00:01:02.630> when<00:01:02.750> Ed<00:01:02.930> really<00:01:03.110> attacked<00:01:03.470> us

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
overkill so when Ed really attacked us

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.930 
overkill so when Ed really attacked us
and<00:01:04.040> he<00:01:04.160> really<00:01:04.190> wanted<00:01:04.610> accomplish

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
and he really wanted accomplish

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.790 
and he really wanted accomplish
something<00:01:05.089> that<00:01:05.270> if<00:01:05.360> it<00:01:05.449> was<00:01:05.570> so<00:01:05.720> five<00:01:05.990> he

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
something that if it was so five he

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.170 
something that if it was so five he
really<00:01:07.070> dug<00:01:07.280> down<00:01:07.430> deep<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:07.880> can't<00:01:08.060> was

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
really dug down deep and can't was

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.060 
really dug down deep and can't was
something<00:01:08.450> that<00:01:08.479> we<00:01:08.660> think<00:01:08.810> is<00:01:08.960> really<00:01:09.650> really

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
something that we think is really really

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.530 
something that we think is really really
cool<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:10.550> I<00:01:10.580> want<00:01:10.790> this<00:01:10.880> to<00:01:11.000> be<00:01:11.060> a<00:01:11.119> game<00:01:11.300> that<00:01:11.330> I

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
cool and I want this to be a game that I

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.780 
cool and I want this to be a game that I
can<00:01:11.600> play<00:01:11.780> over<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:12.290> over<00:01:12.410> again<00:01:12.649> and<00:01:13.070> I<00:01:13.729> don't

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
can play over and over again and I don't

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.249 
can play over and over again and I don't
want<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:14.240> have<00:01:14.720> you<00:01:15.649> know<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:15.890> same<00:01:16.070> choices

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
want to have you know the same choices

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.749 
want to have you know the same choices
presented<00:01:18.259> to<00:01:18.680> me<00:01:18.830> without<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.550> lot<00:01:19.729> of

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
presented to me without a lot of

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.400 
presented to me without a lot of
variation<00:01:20.420> so<00:01:20.630> I<00:01:20.660> like<00:01:20.930> that<00:01:21.170> kind<00:01:21.290> of

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.410 
variation so I like that kind of

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.309 
variation so I like that kind of
customization<00:01:22.149> it's<00:01:23.149> great<00:01:23.420> now<00:01:23.929> that<00:01:24.229> we

00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:24.319 
customization it's great now that we

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:25.630 
customization it's great now that we
have<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.530> expansion<00:01:24.860> we<00:01:25.039> have<00:01:25.130> 34<00:01:25.580> different

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
have the expansion we have 34 different

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.059 
have the expansion we have 34 different
civilizations<00:01:26.509> to<00:01:26.720> play<00:01:26.960> so<00:01:27.530> that's<00:01:27.679> a<00:01:27.800> lot<00:01:27.950> of

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069 
civilizations to play so that's a lot of

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:29.800 
civilizations to play so that's a lot of
choice<00:01:28.280> right<00:01:28.550> there<00:01:28.850> when<00:01:29.179> you<00:01:29.360> start<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.780> new

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
choice right there when you start a new

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.749 
choice right there when you start a new
game<00:01:29.929> up<00:01:30.259> and<00:01:30.830> you<00:01:31.039> decide<00:01:31.369> you're<00:01:31.610> going<00:01:31.700> to

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
game up and you decide you're going to

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.609 
game up and you decide you're going to
go<00:01:31.880> down<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.119> religious<00:01:32.420> path<00:01:32.630> it<00:01:33.200> starts<00:01:33.530> in

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
go down the religious path it starts in

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.109 
go down the religious path it starts in
a<00:01:33.679> couple<00:01:33.710> ways<00:01:34.069> first<00:01:34.460> off<00:01:34.670> there's<00:01:34.819> faith

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
a couple ways first off there's faith

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.820 
a couple ways first off there's faith
faith<00:01:35.720> is<00:01:35.750> a<00:01:35.899> yield<00:01:36.140> in<00:01:36.259> the<00:01:36.350> game<00:01:36.500> just<00:01:36.740> like

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
faith is a yield in the game just like

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.410 
faith is a yield in the game just like
culture<00:01:37.310> sights<00:01:37.670> go<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:37.940> get<00:01:38.149> it<00:01:38.240> from

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
culture sights go to get it from

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.510 
culture sights go to get it from
buildings<00:01:38.869> like<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.740> shrine<00:01:39.979> of<00:01:40.009> the<00:01:40.130> temple

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
buildings like the shrine of the temple

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.520 
buildings like the shrine of the temple
you<00:01:40.550> might<00:01:40.729> find<00:01:40.940> it<00:01:41.149> among<00:01:41.330> like<00:01:41.750> ancient

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
you might find it among like ancient

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.590 
you might find it among like ancient
ruins<00:01:42.830> things<00:01:43.100> that<00:01:43.220> you<00:01:43.340> find<00:01:43.550> once<00:01:44.360> you<00:01:44.450> just

ruins things that you find once you just

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.270 
ruins things that you find once you just
get<00:01:44.720> up<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:44.869> that<00:01:44.990> little<00:01:45.170> bit<00:01:45.350> of<00:01:45.410> a<00:01:45.470> mound<00:01:45.679> you

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
get up to that little bit of a mound you

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.529 
get up to that little bit of a mound you
get<00:01:46.399> to<00:01:46.490> found<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:46.759> pantheon<00:01:47.090> of<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.209> gods<00:01:47.360> it

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
the naval units and now a naval invasion

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.310 
the naval units and now a naval invasion
just<00:04:39.090> doesn't<00:04:39.419> take<00:04:39.540> as<00:04:39.630> much<00:04:39.660> space<00:04:40.080> on<00:04:40.290> the

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
just doesn't take as much space on the

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.440 
just doesn't take as much space on the
map<00:04:40.560> we've<00:04:41.310> also<00:04:41.520> tried<00:04:41.880> to<00:04:42.060> fill<00:04:42.210> in<00:04:42.330> some

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
map we've also tried to fill in some

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:43.810 
map we've also tried to fill in some
holes<00:04:42.510> in<00:04:42.930> term

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
holes in term

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.970 
holes in term
of<00:04:43.970> nothing<00:04:44.750> between<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.170> trireme<00:04:45.440> and<00:04:45.920> the

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
of nothing between the trireme and the

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.030 
of nothing between the trireme and the
caravel<00:04:46.490> so<00:04:46.880> we<00:04:46.970> added<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.300> the<00:04:47.810> galius<00:04:48.290> which

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
caravel so we added to the galius which

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.180 
caravel so we added to the galius which
is<00:04:49.280> arranged<00:04:50.150> renaissance-era<00:04:51.080> ship<00:04:52.010> and

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
is arranged renaissance-era ship and

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.470 
is arranged renaissance-era ship and
that's<00:04:52.310> actually<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:52.670> first<00:04:52.880> ship<00:04:53.090> that<00:04:53.120> gets

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
that's actually the first ship that gets

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.420 
that's actually the first ship that gets
a<00:04:53.780> ranged<00:04:54.110> attack<00:04:54.470> capability<00:04:55.100> is<00:04:55.190> kind<00:04:55.370> of

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
a ranged attack capability is kind of

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.920 
a ranged attack capability is kind of
really<00:04:55.610> nice<00:04:55.760> when<00:04:56.000> you<00:04:56.090> get<00:04:56.210> to<00:04:56.330> that<00:04:56.450> one<00:04:56.660> but

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
really nice when you get to that one but

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.590 
really nice when you get to that one but
adds<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.170> lot<00:04:57.440> of<00:04:57.500> work<00:04:57.860> on<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:59.000> eye<00:04:59.030> it<00:04:59.150> takes

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
adds a lot of work on the eye it takes

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.150 
adds a lot of work on the eye it takes
to<00:04:59.810> actually<00:04:59.930> gather<00:05:00.320> these<00:05:00.530> fleets<00:05:00.800> together

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
to actually gather these fleets together

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.620 
to actually gather these fleets together
how<00:05:01.460> they're<00:05:01.670> grouped<00:05:01.910> how<00:05:02.120> they're<00:05:02.270> sent<00:05:02.510> out

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
how they're grouped how they're sent out

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.410 
how they're grouped how they're sent out
and<00:05:02.990> he's<00:05:03.980> made<00:05:04.190> it<00:05:04.340> efficient<00:05:04.880> by<00:05:04.970> probably

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
and he's made it efficient by probably

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.820 
and he's made it efficient by probably
over<00:05:05.660> a<00:05:05.690> hundred<00:05:05.750> percent<00:05:06.110> so<00:05:06.530> they're<00:05:06.650> doing

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
over a hundred percent so they're doing

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.380 
over a hundred percent so they're doing
it<00:05:06.950> twice<00:05:07.190> as<00:05:07.370> fast<00:05:07.520> as<00:05:07.700> they<00:05:07.760> were<00:05:07.850> before<00:05:08.000> the

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
it twice as fast as they were before the

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.460 
it twice as fast as they were before the
way<00:05:08.480> that<00:05:08.630> they're<00:05:08.750> grouping<00:05:09.080> their<00:05:09.230> fleets

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
way that they're grouping their fleets

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.170 
way that they're grouping their fleets
together<00:05:09.800> is<00:05:09.950> working<00:05:10.250> much<00:05:10.670> better<00:05:10.880> than<00:05:11.030> has

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
together is working much better than has

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.480 
together is working much better than has
before<00:05:11.540> but<00:05:12.320> that<00:05:12.440> kind<00:05:12.680> of<00:05:12.740> AI<00:05:12.890> work

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
before but that kind of AI work

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.950 
before but that kind of AI work
the<00:05:13.640> stray<00:05:13.940> great<00:05:14.180> generals<00:05:14.570> that<00:05:14.630> everybody

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
the stray great generals that everybody

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.240 
the stray great generals that everybody
would<00:05:15.110> notice<00:05:15.350> that<00:05:15.380> the<00:05:15.560> I<00:05:15.590> had<00:05:15.860> one<00:05:16.010> on<00:05:16.130> the

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
would notice that the I had one on the

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.040 
would notice that the I had one on the
open<00:05:16.520> easy<00:05:16.670> to<00:05:16.820> capture<00:05:16.970> a<00:05:17.390> lot<00:05:17.870> of<00:05:17.960> those

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
open easy to capture a lot of those

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.330 
open easy to capture a lot of those
things<00:05:18.260> were<00:05:18.350> really<00:05:18.380> trying<00:05:18.710> to<00:05:18.860> squash<00:05:19.130> to

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
things were really trying to squash to

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:37.239 
things were really trying to squash to
make<00:05:19.460> the<00:05:19.550> whole<00:05:19.670> experience<00:05:20.090> even<00:05:20.390> better
