we just fold it back up and what that's

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.670 
we just fold it back up and what that's
going<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.180> do<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:42.600> when<00:02:42.750> we<00:02:42.870> drop<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.260> origin

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
going to do is when we drop the origin

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.060 
going to do is when we drop the origin
it<00:02:43.800> on<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.430> going<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:45.000> allow<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:46.470> common

have a couple of little options we can
do<00:03:30.660> here<00:03:30.989> but<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.530> wanted<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.010> show<00:03:32.340> you<00:03:32.400> a

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
do here but I wanted to show you a

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.720 
do here but I wanted to show you a
close-up<00:03:33.360> of<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:34.350> helmet<00:03:34.980> because<00:03:35.370> that's

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
close-up of the helmet because that's

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.820 
close-up of the helmet because that's
really<00:03:36.000> interesting<00:03:36.360> but<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.620> only

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
really interesting but the only

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.130 
really interesting but the only
complaint<00:03:38.280> I<00:03:38.400> have<00:03:38.640> with<00:03:38.850> this<00:03:38.970> figure<00:03:39.330> is<00:03:39.540> the

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
complaint I have with this figure is the

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.350 
complaint I have with this figure is the
lack<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:40.410> paint<00:03:40.950> apps<00:03:41.160> now<00:03:41.489> I<00:03:41.550> realize<00:03:42.120> that's

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
lack of paint apps now I realize that's

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.330 
lack of paint apps now I realize that's
a<00:03:42.510> little<00:03:42.720> bit<00:03:42.810> odd<00:03:42.959> coming<00:03:43.440> from<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.709> fan<00:03:44.070> of

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
a little bit odd coming from a fan of

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.400 
a little bit odd coming from a fan of
Japanese<00:03:44.820> toys<00:03:45.390> I<00:03:45.690> mean<00:03:46.110> if<00:03:46.230> this<00:03:46.350> was

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
Japanese toys I mean if this was

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.930 
Japanese toys I mean if this was
released<00:03:46.800> in<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.100> u.s.<00:03:47.400> we<00:03:47.610> wouldn't<00:03:47.850> get

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
released in the u.s. we wouldn't get

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.990 
released in the u.s. we wouldn't get
anything<00:03:48.269> close<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:48.959> this<00:03:49.470> or<00:03:49.800> as<00:03:50.489> good<00:03:50.940> a

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
anything close to this or as good a

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.020 
anything close to this or as good a
quality<00:03:51.209> as<00:03:51.720> this<00:03:51.900> figure<00:03:52.290> but<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.800> wish<00:03:53.760> there

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
quality as this figure but I wish there

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.509 
quality as this figure but I wish there
was<00:03:54.150> some<00:03:54.420> more<00:03:54.630> paint<00:03:54.989> apps<00:03:55.230> on<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.950> orange

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
was some more paint apps on the orange

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.030 
was some more paint apps on the orange
just<00:03:57.269> like<00:03:57.690> there<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:58.019> in<00:03:58.050> the<00:03:58.230> show<00:03:58.440> oh<00:03:58.680> well<00:03:59.010> I

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
just like there is in the show oh well I

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.610 
just like there is in the show oh well I
guess<00:03:59.340> I'll<00:03:59.459> just<00:03:59.489> have<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.880> add<00:04:00.000> them<00:04:00.150> myself

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
guess I'll just have to add them myself

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.770 
guess I'll just have to add them myself
now<00:04:01.620> if<00:04:01.739> you<00:04:01.830> look<00:04:02.100> in<00:04:02.280> his<00:04:02.640> visor<00:04:02.970> you<00:04:03.600> will

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
now if you look in his visor you will

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.300 
now if you look in his visor you will
see<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.830> fact<00:04:05.100> that<00:04:05.280> he<00:04:05.580> has<00:04:05.820> orange<00:04:06.480> slices

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
see the fact that he has orange slices

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.580 
see the fact that he has orange slices
inside<00:04:08.310> his<00:04:08.610> visor<00:04:08.850> visor<00:04:09.420> or<00:04:09.780> one<00:04:10.019> big<00:04:10.200> orange

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
inside his visor visor or one big orange

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.850 
inside his visor visor or one big orange
slice<00:04:10.860> whenever<00:04:11.640> he<00:04:11.850> gets<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.269> new<00:04:12.450> arms<00:04:13.170> he

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
slice whenever he gets a new arms he

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.340 
slice whenever he gets a new arms he
gets<00:04:14.100> a<00:04:14.280> different<00:04:14.820> fruit<00:04:15.180> motif<00:04:15.720> on<00:04:15.989> his

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
gets a different fruit motif on his

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.979 
gets a different fruit motif on his
visor<00:04:16.560> I<00:04:16.979> think<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:17.700> is<00:04:17.850> a<00:04:17.880> very<00:04:18.359> nice<00:04:18.660> touch

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
visor I think that is a very nice touch

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.860 
visor I think that is a very nice touch
