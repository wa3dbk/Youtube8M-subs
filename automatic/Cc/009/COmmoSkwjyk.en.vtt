about to clean it and dress it again I
just<00:03:28.570> try<00:03:29.500> not<00:03:29.530> to<00:03:30.190> do<00:03:30.910> too<00:03:30.940> much<00:03:31.240> to<00:03:31.570> it<00:03:31.710> um<00:03:32.710> I

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
just try not to do too much to it um I

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.970 
just try not to do too much to it um I
might<00:03:33.730> start<00:03:34.450> making<00:03:34.540> this<00:03:34.990> routine<00:03:35.560> who

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
might start making this routine who

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.230 
might start making this routine who
knows<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:39.400> depends

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.060 

yeah<00:03:43.240> just<00:03:43.540> depends<00:03:43.960> because<00:03:44.350> every<00:03:44.860> time<00:03:45.040> I

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
yeah just depends because every time I

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.220 
yeah just depends because every time I
go<00:03:45.400> they're<00:03:46.150> talking<00:03:46.390> about<00:03:46.480> you<00:03:46.780> know<00:03:46.930> kind

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
go they're talking about you know kind

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.140 
go they're talking about you know kind
of<00:03:47.290> upping<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.890> setting<00:03:48.280> so<00:03:48.850> I'll<00:03:48.940> probably

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
of upping the setting so I'll probably

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.390 
of upping the setting so I'll probably
end<00:03:49.390> up<00:03:49.510> with<00:03:49.750> a<00:03:49.810> longer<00:03:50.260> healing<00:03:50.890> process

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
end up with a longer healing process

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.850 
end up with a longer healing process
longer<00:03:51.850> healing<00:03:52.180> time<00:03:52.420> so<00:03:53.230> next<00:03:53.440> time<00:03:53.620> I<00:03:53.680> might

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
longer healing time so next time I might

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.500 
longer healing time so next time I might
not<00:03:53.920> be<00:03:54.190> able<00:03:54.340> to<00:03:54.460> do<00:03:54.580> it<00:03:54.700> you<00:03:54.790> know<00:03:54.910> I'm<00:03:55.030> saying
