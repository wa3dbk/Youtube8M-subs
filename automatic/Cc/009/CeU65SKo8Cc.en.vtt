 paris is small and he has very little grip you can not be very pleasant 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.890
 to hold 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.380
 this is a 14 megapixel sensor and 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.950
 and a lens with a range of four of the seven to 23 years half a millimeter 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.300
 the five times optical zoom

 who is now a lot of group according to Samson dropout 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.810
 it is at least what is behind this and that is lcd touchscreen 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.690
 You are not very enthusiastic about what the work just isn't pleasant to do 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.390
 but that changed works is entering passwords also forget on 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.590
 For the final that you notice that the stylist is absolutely included 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.530
 yes is really necessary 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.680
 but the media what's out there you lose and it's been redirected for some time 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.320
 the camera wifi on board that offers of course possibilities you can do it 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.810
 stage and was made publish very quickly 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.810
 on a facebook profile picasa a video on youtube 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.640
 but what a pity that is not much 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.460
 the first are supported by nice example that I look good 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.799
 and what's also handy is ani 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.700
 it can make a little backup 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.549
 then you come home it is really looking almost full 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:40.700
 Press the button 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.970
 and he goes 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.830
 automatically introduce with your computer 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.830

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.540
 ned 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.180
 one of the things about this camera is a bit of luck 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.350
 and send ageas abandoned by the city 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.350
 after he looks like this 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:21.989
 true 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.109
 the 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.929
 6 we also want some options for the fun on the efta countries 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.809
 so you can take a photo in the context of a 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:37.319
 an old television screen on the side of the building or the side of a bus shelter 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:42.419
 it is an interesting camera for people who want to be connected all the time 

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:46.649
 can share everything they experience on Facebook or on YouTube 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.379
 and yes you do not belong to that group then you better a different buyer because this is 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.319
 shame there are better cheaper cameras available 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.609
 they don't have 3 March yet, so you don't need that
