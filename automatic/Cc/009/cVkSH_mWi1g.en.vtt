much<00:00:48.570> nicer<00:00:48.810> than<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.260> long<00:00:49.440> strike<00:00:49.770> scope

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:56.249 
bigger and longer it's also very heavy

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:58.699 
bigger and longer it's also very heavy
as<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.389> see<00:01:57.599> it's<00:01:57.779> still<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.169> his<00:01:58.289> package

I've<00:01:59.310> known<00:01:59.579> unboxed<00:01:59.999> it<00:02:00.060> yet<00:02:00.299> because<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.109> have

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
I've known unboxed it yet because I have

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:02.719 
I've known unboxed it yet because I have
no<00:02:01.469> idea<00:02:01.590> what<00:02:01.919> I<00:02:01.950> want<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.279> do<00:02:02.429> with<00:02:02.549> it

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
no idea what I want to do with it

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.879 
no idea what I want to do with it
actually<00:02:03.569> after<00:02:03.689> having<00:02:04.139> played<00:02:04.349> with<00:02:04.560> one<00:02:04.770> of

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:04.889 
actually after having played with one of

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:07.429 
actually after having played with one of
them<00:02:05.039> at<00:02:05.219> one<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.880> my<00:02:06.029> wars<00:02:06.329> or<00:02:06.899> one<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.109> the

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
them at one of my wars or one of the

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.219 
them at one of my wars or one of the
attendees<00:02:07.889> brought<00:02:08.250> one<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.640> use<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:09.119> did<00:02:10.110> not

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
attendees brought one to use I did not

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.050 
attendees brought one to use I did not
really<00:02:10.470> like<00:02:10.800> its<00:02:11.009> performance<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.700> felt

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
really like its performance so I felt

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.570 
really like its performance so I felt
that<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.750> took<00:02:12.900> quite<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.170> while<00:02:13.260> for<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.800> for

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
that it took quite a while for it for

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.910 
that it took quite a while for it for
the<00:02:14.640> tank<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.390> pressurize<00:02:15.960> because<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.800> the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
the tank to pressurize because of the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.980 
the tank to pressurize because of the
batteries<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.850> you're<00:02:18.090> based<00:02:18.360> off<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:18.630> I'm

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
batteries so you're based off that I'm

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.370 
batteries so you're based off that I'm
not

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
not

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.160 
not
too<00:02:19.850> enthusiastic<00:02:20.850> about<00:02:21.000> modifying<00:02:21.780> this

believe<00:02:31.800> in<00:02:32.550> my<00:02:32.700> opinion<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.270> is<00:02:33.300> extremely

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
believe in my opinion it is extremely

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.660 
believe in my opinion it is extremely
rare<00:02:34.230> I've<00:02:34.470> only<00:02:34.650> seen<00:02:34.950> maybe<00:02:35.190> two<00:02:35.490> or<00:02:35.520> three

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
rare I've only seen maybe two or three

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.480 
rare I've only seen maybe two or three
of<00:02:35.970> them<00:02:36.150> around<00:02:36.680> but<00:02:37.680> with<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:37.920> said<00:02:38.280> is

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
of them around but with that said is

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.760 
of them around but with that said is
it's<00:02:39.030> not<00:02:39.300> an<00:02:39.450> expensive<00:02:40.020> blaster<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.650> it's

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
it's not an expensive blaster and it's

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.470 
it's not an expensive blaster and it's
not<00:02:40.980> one<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.280> has<00:02:41.430> really<00:02:41.730> huge<00:02:41.970> potential

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
not one that has really huge potential

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.870 
not one that has really huge potential
but<00:02:43.050> like<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.350> said<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:43.620> think<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.340> is<00:02:44.370> very<00:02:44.490> rare

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
but like I said I think it is very rare

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.720 
but like I said I think it is very rare
and<00:02:45.060> I<00:02:45.420> could<00:02:45.660> be<00:02:45.810> really<00:02:46.050> wrong<00:02:46.320> but<00:02:46.730> that's

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
and I could be really wrong but that's

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.850 
and I could be really wrong but that's
just<00:02:47.910> what<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.120> feel<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:48.810> anyway<00:02:49.320> here<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.740> is

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
just what I feel so anyway here it is

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.610 
just what I feel so anyway here it is
it's<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.310> nuff<00:02:50.580> Firefly<00:02:51.420> I'm<00:02:51.720> an<00:02:52.140> addition

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620
