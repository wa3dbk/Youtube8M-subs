00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
want to scoop up just a small amount you

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.930 
want to scoop up just a small amount you
want<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.039> make<00:00:50.190> sure<00:00:50.340> again<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.670> you

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
want to make sure again that you

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.250 
want to make sure again that you
multiply<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.390> really<00:00:51.750> well<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:51.989> your<00:00:52.020> hands
