00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
just like this experiment is going to be

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.150 
just like this experiment is going to be
i<00:05:44.270> mean<00:05:44.419> this<00:05:44.690> might<00:05:45.229> be<00:05:45.410> publicity<00:05:46.070> or

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
i mean this might be publicity or

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.610 
i mean this might be publicity or
something<00:05:46.520> and<00:05:46.669> then<00:05:47.660> just<00:05:48.020> when<00:05:48.200> you<00:05:48.380> thought

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
something and then just when you thought

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.570 
something and then just when you thought
okay<00:05:49.190> this<00:05:49.220> is<00:05:49.669> not<00:05:50.180> going<00:05:50.360> to<00:05:50.450> work<00:05:50.510> out

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
okay this is not going to work out

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.430 
okay this is not going to work out
something<00:05:53.260> something<00:05:54.260> quick

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
something something quick

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.280 
something something quick
and<00:05:55.830> then<00:05:56.310> there<00:05:57.090> she<00:05:57.240> was<00:05:57.450> in<00:05:58.100> Kuala<00:05:59.100> Lumpur

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
and then there she was in Kuala Lumpur

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.810 
and then there she was in Kuala Lumpur
getting<00:06:01.290> a<00:06:01.380> gold<00:06:01.560> medal<00:06:01.920> so<00:06:02.280> I<00:06:02.310> don't<00:06:02.520> think

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
getting a gold medal so I don't think

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.520 
getting a gold medal so I don't think
she<00:06:02.970> consider<00:06:03.300> credit<00:06:03.630> for<00:06:03.780> that<00:06:03.840> anywhere
