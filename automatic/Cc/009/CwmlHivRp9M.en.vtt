00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 this is the lh yarn space and today 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.910
 I'm with see the cold came but it arrived 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.519
 see so we're going to cover with this 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.639
 beautiful ponchito see a beautiful ponchito 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.359
 that we are going to learn how to make a braid 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.900
 or eights in a triangular frame that does not 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.789
 is added is woven together 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.890
 content next to the shots and you see 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.029
 clear then that's what we're going to 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.180
 teach today are two triangles woven 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.700
 big together in the back is 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.000
 Lisa already explained several times how 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.579
 knit the card as it starts so 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.079
 People who are interested are looking for 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.750
 in the previous videos that in the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.899
 hello band u2 program of art this 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.730
 video of l8 yarns will find it 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.399
 today we are going to dedicate to explain how 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.980
 that testa braids is made good the point 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.100
 makes you so in a triangular frame 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.109
 it is always woven in outside mirrors 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.660
 inwards or what we have from a 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.550
 we have it on the other side we 're going 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.820
 weaving until you reach 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.910
 where from the average clavito 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.490
 we left 12 brads for one side and 12 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:19.120
 Brads for the other without knitting or not 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.130
 we finished the fabric at this point that 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.330
 we have to do I close it with 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.240
 crochet 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.640
 as usual as I already taught because 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.220
 it's much better to do it in the frame and 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.650
 not later so that it does not get 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.950
 we have arrived at this point what 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.780
 frame remove all tissue is 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.750
 that gives me a little fear people take it out 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.350
 fire but does not stay no longer attacks 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.690
 everything being in this case the only 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.610
 care that we have to have if it is in 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.640
 this part because as we have not 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.340
 finished weaving there if we can 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.090
 this is knitting 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.390
 but good 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.140
 We remove them out of the frame 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.500
 medium and what we do we stretch it in the 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.500
 table 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.400
 and so that we do not frown we're going to 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:16.060
 turn so I have more this facility 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.120
 to grab it we are taking small groups of 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.760
 5 great spinning because if it is not going to 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.550
 pucker everything then what do I do to 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.790
 first single turn 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.000
 to pretend to be weaving 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.560
 crochet with the fingers then took a 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.400
 little group of 5 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.800
 and he went inside and so I come to 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.830
 look for another group of five and I pass it 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.550
 by america another group of five and so 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.040
 I'm knitting like crochet with 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.569
 the fingers but they are forming 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:58.370
 Toast of the braid or others as 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:00.590
 we want to call then let's go like this 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.459
 is what makes also bail a 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.970
 little the fabric because this one is always going to 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:11.540
 have a difference with the back but very 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.810
 little proportion I already made the going as 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.970
 we make the return we pass it here and 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.670
 we go back to knitting exactly the same 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.510
 but going down we already have the 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:27.140
 piles are separated then not 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.910
 it will complicate us to wrap the 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.920
 weaving down then we're going 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.290
 accommodating because it seems here that we are 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.510
 it's going a lot other way but it's 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.820
 It is what we leave after 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.599
 accommodating now at this time not what 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:44.180
 I can stretch because 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:47.540
 I need him to be weak 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.409
 these little piles so that I can 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.519
 grab when we get down 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.519
 directly this is the last 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.150
 I do not stay together and we are accommodating 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.470
 all the fabric this that stays together what 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.150
 what I did here, notice that with a 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.150
 little pile of thread I made him like a fringe 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.000
 great then it holds it together and 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:17.140
 I was clear and so I have left 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.870
 all the bullfight done in the front and 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.720
 up here I later did a whole 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.790
 crochet completion to join it with the 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.450
 back and it looks like a kind of 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.150
 neckline 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.490
 in this case good is very small but 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.520
 do not frowns because you have left the 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.740
 guess something different to make it a 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.780
 detail that can be done in several 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.860
 sides I only did only in the center 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.320
 then crochet and this can be opened 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.210
 some details with clear buttons but 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.600
 you can open you have two garments in one 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.610
 because you have to be able to separate the part of 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.409
 forward and back and you have two 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.259
 different salts 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:59.259
 and if you do not join it and you have a garment 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:01.869
 It has multipurpose and you have to take advantage 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:03.939
 Now that amazes me with that braid 

00:05:01.869 --> 00:05:06.459
 I did not expect it so it must happen 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:09.369
 pass and then rome with the crochet with 

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:11.800
 hands but this on the frame 

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:14.860
 great i hope you like it 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.649
 practice to work is and apart a 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.110
 spinning these threads and mahler is that you 

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:22.899
 is going to say and we want to remind you of the 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.059
 magazine if the ice cream lh or for children 

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:26.649
 of tissues that is barbarous is to calculate 

00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:29.439
 and what good there are going to find a 

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:31.449
 lots of models and sides for 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:34.209
 work for the guys there are a lot 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:37.569
 of beautiful models so to weave and 

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:39.279
 With that runs abrigadita good idea to me 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:41.979
 we are approaching we see the 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:45.879
 next misfortunes of another voice we 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:48.579
 We continue spun and lazio guarantee 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:51.429
 quality production processes 

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:52.860
 advanced more than 50 kinds of yarn each 

00:05:51.429 --> 00:05:55.889
 season 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.580
 lh or a hundred percent company 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.389
