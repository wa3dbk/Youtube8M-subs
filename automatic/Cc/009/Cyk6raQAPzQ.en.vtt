00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.020
 hi people, how are you all? 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.170
 that very very well today I bring you my 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.300
 opinion about the 3m keratin kit 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.280
 it is supposed that thanks to its innovative 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.019
 active thermo technology this range te 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.820
 will allow to keep the hair straight without a 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.130
 treatment and much more manageable 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.080
 for a longer time its formula does not 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.090
 contains aggressive elements that can 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.220
 damage the hair now we will see if it is 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.230
 Certain first step to wash our hair 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.150
 with the shampoo that comes in the kit in my 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.090
 case I always wash it twice is to say 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.519
 shampoo rinse shampoo rinse then 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.370
 we use the conditioner and we go back 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:38.199
 to rinse this leave super soft hair 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.109
 then dry with a towel and 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.909
 we combed then the partitions come in 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:45.819
 my good case all that puts you in the 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:48.519
 box in my case are five partitions 

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:51.399
 having long, straight hair at each 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:54.579
 Division is allocated two beats 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.399
 of the treatment at first sight is how 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.409
 a light creamer and do not approach me 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.089
 too much to the root but work 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.290
 from a little bit above the 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.449
 means to the tips 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.430
 We use a dryer until the 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.960
 hair is completely dry yo 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.790
 normal when the days start like this 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.380
 heat or in summer and I never dry the 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.740
 hair with dried here I already noticed the 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.510
 heavier hair I chose 180 degrees to 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.060
 melt the product well inside the 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.700
 hair and tell you yes I noticed that the 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.550
 hair was felt as thicker not so 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.979
 fine as I had it before although it 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.610
 I noticed that I had lost a little bit of 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.830
 body of elasticity but if a little 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.960
 of movement the instructions specify 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.240
 that you have to pass them to the iron of 3 to 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.550
 5 times and the face you see me now is 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.740
 from my mother I 'm going to burn my mother 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.259
 it burns my mother I burn it and in 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.910
 effect I burned my hair solution if 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.950
 I have to pass the iron more than three 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.800
 times or more than twice put the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.110
 plate 150 even so I would not know 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.479
 what to say to you we are enlisting by tufts 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.740
 small ones are easier to cover 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.740
 although we take a little longer 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.909
 good to where soon when the 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.210
 product is freshly used is not 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.819
 bad but I like to feel very much 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.360
 that softness that movement that body 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.239
 what does hair look like when it's new 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.400
 washed when it's freshly cleaned and here 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.290
 I noticed that there was a product that 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.420
 weighed over the texture it could 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.030
 equate to when you throw yourself too much 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.250
 foam or too much serum or too much 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.860
 oil here was already the second day the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.900
 long fine but the texture was noticeable 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.360
 like when you put too much lacquer on and not 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.310
 you wash your hair because something like that does not 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.080
 like too much 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.560
 here the third day the frizz 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.709
 I had come back in the neck area and 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.630
 I was to wash this time I let it dry 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.810
 on the air yes I noticed a little more 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.780
 soft since I was not weighing this 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.940
 treatment above but if you 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.069
 I appreciated the little tips 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.870
 burned of the iron another thing 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.060
 It is also that the benefits had 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.640
 disappeared in the neck area of 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.190
 I agree that I tend to fuck 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.350
 pick up in the hair with one with a clip 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.810
 but still stays the whole long 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.079
 lawful and then you see the back of your neck so it's 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.170
 unsightly the day after washing 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.600
 they appreciate it yourselves hairstyle 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.030
 carefree and natural not just everything 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.880
 otherwise something like careless or 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.920
 look slovenly and clear as not 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.340
 I wanted to cheat and teach things 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.010
 as they are then to take it well 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.379
 the next day and freshly washed from 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.910
 done was not even dry you can still 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:38.400
 appreciate that the smooth is followed 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.849
 keeping at the tips but not at the 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.250
 rest of the hair and as I said 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:47.120
 how I wanted you to appreciate 6 the effects 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.400
 such and such are they do not even know that 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.620
 while me and brushed me 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.989
 pass the iron on nothing is totally 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.069
 to the natural and to finalize that 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.140
 history 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.670
 Well, obviously without ironing 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.940
 as I told you the day after 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.370
 wash it and then if a little bit more 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.440
 softer body but so still a 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.060
 little bit more than the iron 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.989
 As you can see, the effects had already 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.989
 totally disappeared 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.370
 he has not kept the frizz at bay 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.680
 as promised and he did not return it to 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.870
 use I must be from the few people to 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.600
 who this kit has not convinced given that 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.820
 I'm hearing wonderful reviews like that 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.410
 that you may do better 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.880
 similarly I will try later with 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.440
 the plate less quality delivered than 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.180
 I think the problem has come by air 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.250
 although I followed the instructions 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.780
 At the bottom of the letter it is also true that 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.640
 I did not buy me apart shampoo or 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.160
 mask as they recommend or 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.780
 they advise but well that also 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.580
 could translate into a draw money 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.040
 because if you buy a kit and you do not have 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.990
 why buy more products 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:51.690
 jointly it is now true that if 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.670
 from the second day you start using the 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.380
 iron again where you get 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.380
 returns to curl then 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.690
 phenomenal but then it is no longer what 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.600
 three and less promises since they 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.210
 they ensure that for seven days or four 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.860
 washed are you quiet conclusion a 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.620
 economic product that for two days 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.810
 goes well but does not try from the inside 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.670
 of the hair if you have tried it, leave me 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.180
 here below your comments thanks 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.460
 again 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.320
 up to here my personal opinion a little kiss 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.320
 huge and see you soon chao
