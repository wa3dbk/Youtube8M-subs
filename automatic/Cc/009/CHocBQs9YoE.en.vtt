00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.640
My name is Mounir.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.120
I've been breakdancing for 17 years.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.120
I've won nine world champion
titles with Vagabond Crew,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.920
and among them was the title of Red Bull BC One
World Champion in Rio in 2012.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.720
This year, I'll be taking care of the B-Boys
who qualified for the Red Bull BC One France Cypher.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.680
I'm going to their homes,
in their studios,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.400
in their daily lives.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.800
We are going to get ready and work out together.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.200
I'm back in Bordeaux,
but this time to see Doudou.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.800
He's selected for the French BC One cypher

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.160
which will take place in a few days in the capital
and brings together the best breakdancers.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.480
Doudou is a quiet B-Boy,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.720
always with a smile and always on his bike.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.720
He doesn't miss a chance to join his friends
on the docks to train.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.880
It's also part of breakdancing,
the sharing.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.480
We'll take a look back on his last battles,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.200
to analyze his strengths and weaknesses.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.760
One last moment of rest before the training.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.120
There, that was good. Then we feel you're a little hesitant.
Here it goes well again.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.960
There's a very good energy throughout.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.000
Your break is super fine, fluid.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.560
Unfortunately you don't have clear finishes.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.880
We will rework the toprocks,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.200
the execution and we will also discuss writing.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.960
Ok, I'm ready.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.120
I want to see your windmill

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.240
Ok, go ahead, stop !

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.440
So when I hit the start,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.440
the first arm comes here, okay.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.000
Almost not within arm's reach in fact,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Exactly, you have to reach far away.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.880
That's very good.
This is already much better.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.840
Now your second hand.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.240
I lay my left hand,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.920
it absorbs and above all it leads me.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.920
To me this is a very important phase
in breaking,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.960
so it's a point you should correct.
