00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.000

got a little pink hue to them so we what

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.830 
got a little pink hue to them so we what
we<00:00:43.710> do<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.219> try<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.030> carefully<00:00:45.600> pull

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
we do is we just try to carefully pull

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.880 
we do is we just try to carefully pull
them<00:00:45.960> apart<00:00:48.410> sometimes<00:00:49.410> we<00:00:49.559> leave<00:00:49.680> them<00:00:49.800> in

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
them apart sometimes we leave them in

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.000 
them apart sometimes we leave them in
clumps<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.489> don't<00:00:50.670> know<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.760> think<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:52.010> think

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
clumps but I don't know I think I think

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.279 
clumps but I don't know I think I think
I<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.250> them<00:00:53.430> pulled<00:00:53.640> apart<00:00:57.140> until<00:00:58.140> we're

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
I like them pulled apart until we're

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.450 
I like them pulled apart until we're
down<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.590> one<00:00:58.620> row<00:01:00.739> of<00:01:01.739> course<00:01:02.010> when<00:01:02.160> they<00:01:02.250> laid

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
down to one row of course when they laid

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.670 
down to one row of course when they laid
they<00:01:02.670> glue<00:01:02.910> themselves<00:01:03.149> together

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
they glue themselves together

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.830 
they glue themselves together
so<00:01:06.190> they<00:01:06.310> don't<00:01:06.400> roll<00:01:06.640> around<00:01:06.790> because<00:01:07.300> python

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
so they don't roll around because python

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.900 
so they don't roll around because python
eggs<00:01:08.080> can't<00:01:08.440> they're<00:01:09.010> not<00:01:09.190> like<00:01:09.370> chicken<00:01:09.670> eggs

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 
eggs can't they're not like chicken eggs

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.480 
eggs can't they're not like chicken eggs
they<00:01:10.660> need<00:01:10.870> to<00:01:10.960> be<00:01:11.080> left<00:01:11.410> in<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.740> same

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
they need to be left in the same

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.930 
they need to be left in the same
position<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.770> I<00:01:14.800> can<00:01:14.920> we<00:01:15.130> take<00:01:15.340> these<00:01:15.490> off<00:01:15.730> we

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
position so I can we take these off we

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.960 
position so I can we take these off we
always<00:01:16.270> put<00:01:16.510> them<00:01:16.600> straight<00:01:16.930> up<00:01:16.960> you<00:01:17.620> know<00:01:17.970> we

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
always put them straight up you know we

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.680 
always put them straight up you know we
don't<00:01:19.090> let<00:01:19.570> them<00:01:19.690> roll<00:01:23.970> up<00:01:24.970> so<00:01:25.330> there's<00:01:25.570> our

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
don't let them roll up so there's our

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.770 
don't let them roll up so there's our
culprit<00:01:25.930> that<00:01:26.170> got<00:01:26.410> the<00:01:26.530> eggs<00:01:26.740> dirty

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
culprit that got the eggs dirty

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.450 
culprit that got the eggs dirty
we<00:01:28.780> had<00:01:28.900> one<00:01:29.140> slug<00:01:30.120> that's<00:01:31.120> a<00:01:31.330> leaker<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:33.100> that

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
we had one slug that's a leaker and that

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.370 
we had one slug that's a leaker and that
made<00:01:33.700> that<00:01:34.030> made<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.420> made<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:34.930> eggs<00:01:35.260> a

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
made that made the made the eggs a

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.380 
made that made the made the eggs a
little<00:01:35.620> dirty<00:01:35.860> a<00:01:36.150> couple<00:01:37.150> of<00:01:37.270> them<00:01:37.420> I<00:01:39.390> think

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
little dirty a couple of them I think

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.719 
little dirty a couple of them I think
you<00:01:40.479> better<00:01:40.660> wipe<00:01:41.229> that<00:01:41.410> end<00:01:41.650> off<00:01:43.890> no<00:01:44.890> probably

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.030 

look<00:01:48.729> okay<00:01:49.320> there's<00:01:50.320> a<00:01:50.410> little<00:01:50.710> bit<00:01:50.860> on<00:01:50.950> the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
look okay there's a little bit on the

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.020 
look okay there's a little bit on the
bottom<00:01:51.220> of<00:01:51.460> that<00:01:51.580> one

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:06.969 

you<00:01:57.510> got<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.780> positioning

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.830 

very<00:02:07.700> nice<00:02:08.030> size<00:02:08.300> clutch<00:02:08.599> now<00:02:08.840> this<00:02:08.990> is<00:02:09.170> a

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
very nice size clutch now this is a

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.479 
very nice size clutch now this is a
anthrax<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:12.080> anthrax<00:02:12.650> in<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:14.630> huh<00:02:15.340> so<00:02:16.340> we

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
anthrax to anthrax in it so huh so we

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.790 
anthrax to anthrax in it so huh so we
should<00:02:16.760> get<00:02:17.050> we<00:02:18.050> should<00:02:18.290> get<00:02:18.410> some<00:02:18.620> really

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
should get we should get some really

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.250 
should get we should get some really
nice-looking<00:02:19.120> Anthrax's<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:20.510> guess<00:02:21.080> they

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
nice-looking Anthrax's and I guess they

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.949 
nice-looking Anthrax's and I guess they
should<00:02:21.290> throw<00:02:21.800> some<00:02:22.010> of<00:02:22.099> the<00:02:22.160> other<00:02:22.340> stuff<00:02:22.670> to

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
should throw some of the other stuff to

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.240 
should throw some of the other stuff to
some<00:02:23.959> of<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.140> anri's<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.920> all<00:02:25.069> that

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
some of the anri's and all that

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.400 
some of the anri's and all that
different<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:26.690> hopefully<00:02:27.110> we'll<00:02:27.260> get<00:02:27.350> to

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
different so hopefully we'll get to

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.199 
different so hopefully we'll get to
doubled<00:02:27.890> up<00:02:28.010> animals<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.819> single

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
doubled up animals and the single

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.410 
doubled up animals and the single
animals<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:30.100> so<00:02:31.100> I<00:02:31.430> guess<00:02:31.880> serve<00:02:32.060> them<00:02:32.209> in<00:02:32.300> all

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
animals and so I guess serve them in all

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.530 
animals and so I guess serve them in all
that<00:02:32.600> many<00:02:32.810> clutches<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.290> these<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:34.360> give<00:02:35.360> us<00:02:35.450> a

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
that many clutches of these so give us a

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:45.309 
that many clutches of these so give us a
count<00:02:35.780> Tim<00:02:36.080> start<00:02:36.440> counting<00:02:37.030> when<00:02:38.030> we<00:02:38.150> make<00:02:38.360> 55

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.140 

26<00:02:46.189> in<00:02:46.340> that<00:02:46.519> box

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.649 

we<00:02:49.720> got<00:02:49.870> 26<00:02:50.530> in<00:02:50.680> that<00:02:50.830> clutch<00:02:51.159> that<00:02:51.909> get<00:02:52.540> out

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:52.659 
we got 26 in that clutch that get out

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:58.660 
we got 26 in that clutch that get out
for<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.930> clutch

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.790 

we're<00:02:59.240> boxes<00:02:59.750> are<00:02:59.870> high<00:03:00.020> so<00:03:00.380> we<00:03:00.500> can<00:03:00.530> leave

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800
