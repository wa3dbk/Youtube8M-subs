to<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.250> tail<00:03:29.549> end<00:03:29.819> of<00:03:29.939> either<00:03:30.209> of<00:03:30.299> the<00:03:30.540> heads

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
to the tail end of either of the heads

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.569 
to the tail end of either of the heads
once<00:03:31.409> the<00:03:31.560> head<00:03:31.739> is<00:03:31.859> up<00:03:31.979> to<00:03:32.099> speed

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
once the head is up to speed

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.819 
once the head is up to speed
the<00:03:32.879> thinner<00:03:33.150> shooting<00:03:33.629> a<00:03:33.720> running<00:03:34.019> line<00:03:34.199> zips

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
the thinner shooting a running line zips

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.890 
the thinner shooting a running line zips
right<00:03:35.040> through<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.310> guides<00:03:35.489> easy<00:03:36.269> distance

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
right through the guides easy distance

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.330 
right through the guides easy distance
it's<00:03:37.650> that<00:03:37.889> simple

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
it's that simple

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.520 
it's that simple
so<00:03:38.549> with<00:03:38.699> that<00:03:38.819> line<00:03:39.120> system<00:03:39.659> now<00:03:40.049> we<00:03:40.109> can<00:03:40.409> go

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
so with that line system now we can go

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.189 
so with that line system now we can go
fishing<00:03:40.769> but<00:03:41.669> we<00:03:41.790> need<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.000> rod<00:03:42.269> that<00:03:42.900> allows

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
fishing but we need a rod that allows

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:46.849 
fishing but we need a rod that allows
delivery<00:03:43.889> of<00:03:44.159> those<00:03:44.310> heads<00:03:45.470> there's<00:03:46.470> lots<00:03:46.709> of

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
delivery of those heads there's lots of

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.319 
delivery of those heads there's lots of
rod<00:03:47.069> designs<00:03:47.459> out<00:03:47.669> there<00:03:47.699> under<00:03:48.120> different

rod designs out there under different
brands<00:03:48.659> in<00:03:48.870> series<00:03:49.319> most<00:03:49.979> rods<00:03:50.340> have<00:03:50.639> to<00:03:50.759> fall

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:50.939 
brands in series most rods have to fall

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.689

truck hey wouldn't it be cool if we

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.199 
truck hey wouldn't it be cool if we
could<00:03:58.079> build<00:03:58.319> a<00:03:58.469> rod<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:59.040> casts<00:03:59.430> both<00:03:59.909> heads

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
could build a rod that casts both heads

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.050 
could build a rod that casts both heads
well<00:04:00.959> we<00:04:01.049> did<00:04:01.229> it<00:04:01.379> it's<00:04:01.889> the<00:04:02.009> red<00:04:02.189> truck<00:04:02.519> diesel

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
well we did it it's the red truck diesel

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.899 
well we did it it's the red truck diesel

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
fact that it's a large arbor you can see

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:43.459 
fact that it's a large arbor you can see
that<00:05:42.539> for<00:05:42.719> yourself<00:05:43.110> there<00:05:43.259> are<00:05:43.379> some

that for yourself there are some

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:44.869 
that for yourself there are some
advantages<00:05:43.800> when<00:05:44.190> you<00:05:44.279> use<00:05:44.430> a<00:05:44.460> large<00:05:44.729> rubber

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:44.879 
advantages when you use a large rubber

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:46.700 
advantages when you use a large rubber
fly<00:05:45.150> reel<00:05:45.360> so<00:05:45.629> of<00:05:45.810> course<00:05:45.990> each<00:05:46.289> crank<00:05:46.560> of<00:05:46.680> the

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
fly reel so of course each crank of the

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.499 
fly reel so of course each crank of the
reel<00:05:46.919> brings<00:05:47.400> the<00:05:47.520> line<00:05:47.699> back<00:05:47.909> faster<00:05:48.360> that's

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:48.509 
reel brings the line back faster that's

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:49.999 
reel brings the line back faster that's
great<00:05:48.719> when<00:05:48.839> a<00:05:48.870> fish<00:05:49.080> turns<00:05:49.379> on<00:05:49.620> you're<00:05:49.860> just

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:50.009 
great when a fish turns on you're just

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:52.309 
great when a fish turns on you're just
reeling<00:05:50.460> in<00:05:50.580> at<00:05:50.669> the<00:05:50.759> end<00:05:50.909> of<00:05:51.000> the<00:05:51.060> day<00:05:51.319> that

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 
reeling in at the end of the day that

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:54.260 
reeling in at the end of the day that
larger<00:05:52.650> diameter<00:05:53.250> when<00:05:53.699> you<00:05:53.789> store<00:05:54.000> the<00:05:54.120> line

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
larger diameter when you store the line

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.300 
larger diameter when you store the line
also<00:05:54.479> keeps<00:05:54.810> the<00:05:54.930> fly<00:05:55.139> line<00:05:55.409> from<00:05:55.680> coiling

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
also keeps the fly line from coiling

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.459 
also keeps the fly line from coiling
it's<00:05:56.699> called<00:05:56.879> memory<00:05:57.180> and<00:05:57.659> when<00:05:57.779> you<00:05:57.870> cast<00:05:58.110> a

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469 
it's called memory and when you cast a

level fly line a straight fly aligns

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:02.420 
level fly line a straight fly aligns
much<00:06:00.719> easier<00:06:01.110> but<00:06:01.710> there's<00:06:01.830> also<00:06:02.009> a<00:06:02.129> hidden

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
much easier but there's also a hidden

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.100 
much easier but there's also a hidden

benefit to a large rubber fly reel the

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.619 
benefit to a large rubber fly reel the

that<00:06:13.259> issue

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
that issue

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.790 
that issue
speaking<00:06:14.759> of<00:06:14.879> drag<00:06:15.120> the<00:06:15.659> drag<00:06:15.930> is<00:06:16.169> fully

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 
speaking of drag the drag is fully

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.279 
speaking of drag the drag is fully

adjustable there's a knob on the back so

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:22.309 
adjustable there's a knob on the back so
