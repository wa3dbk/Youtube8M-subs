00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
uh what I do have to say as Perez the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.700 
uh what I do have to say as Perez the
hair<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.180> synthetic<00:00:37.020> hair<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
hair is that it is synthetic hair so the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.549 
hair is that it is synthetic hair so the
only<00:00:37.860> con<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:39.149> i<00:00:39.239> would<00:00:39.510> say<00:00:39.690> about<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:40.290> that

only con that i would say about is that

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.729 
only con that i would say about is that
you<00:00:40.860> cannot<00:00:41.579> nipple<00:00:42.120> ate<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.450> or<00:00:42.989> do<00:00:43.230> different

you cannot nipple ate it or do different

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.979 
you cannot nipple ate it or do different
styles<00:00:44.460> with<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.820> hair<00:00:45.000> because<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.360> comes<00:00:45.780> in

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
styles with the hair because it comes in

this<00:00:46.110> type<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.379> pattern<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.640> if<00:00:47.700> you

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
this type of pattern and if you

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.220 
this type of pattern and if you
straighten<00:00:48.239> my<00:00:48.420> hair<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.719> will<00:00:48.809> not<00:00:48.989> go<00:00:49.200> back

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
to this pattern that you're saying

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.910 
to this pattern that you're saying
because<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.680> synthetic<00:00:53.309> hair<00:00:53.750> and<00:00:54.920> another

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.740 
it mimics virgin hair as far as the wave
pattern<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:28.049> comes<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.680> but<00:01:29.579> hair<00:01:30.299> I<00:01:30.329> mean

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
pattern that it comes in but hair I mean

to<00:01:44.970> freetress<00:01:45.360> equal<00:01:45.390> bundle<00:01:46.049> wave<00:01:46.200> hair<00:01:46.640> but

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
to freetress equal bundle wave hair but

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.880 
to freetress equal bundle wave hair but
however<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.689> it's<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.770> nice<00:01:49.950> style<00:01:50.689> and<00:01:51.890> just

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
however it it's a nice style and just

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.330 
however it it's a nice style and just
comes<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.310> few<00:01:53.579> cons<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.890> if<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.189> leave

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
comes with a few cons and if you leave

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.100 
comes with a few cons and if you leave
it<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.670> pattern<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.540> problem<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.079> that

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
it in this pattern the problem is that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.080 
it in this pattern the problem is that
it<00:01:58.409> will<00:01:58.530> stay<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.979> pattern<00:01:59.399> it's<00:01:59.610> very

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
it will stay in this pattern it's very

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.999 
it will stay in this pattern it's very
it<00:02:00.329> didn't<00:02:00.659> really<00:02:00.930> get<00:02:01.079> frizzy<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.740> that's<00:02:01.920> a

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
it didn't really get frizzy so that's a

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.039 
it didn't really get frizzy so that's a
good<00:02:02.159> thing<00:02:02.219> about<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.850> heck<00:02:03.030> didn't<00:02:03.780> freeze

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
good thing about the heck didn't freeze

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.100 
good thing about the heck didn't freeze
anything<00:02:04.469> like<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.299> but<00:02:06.299> yeah<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.659> mean<00:02:06.869> this

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
anything like that but yeah I mean this

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.109 
anything like that but yeah I mean this
is<00:02:07.170> just<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.590> quick<00:02:07.710> final<00:02:08.340> review<00:02:08.640> on<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.030> I

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
really don't have much to say about it

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.910 
really don't have much to say about it
is<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:13.260> know

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920
