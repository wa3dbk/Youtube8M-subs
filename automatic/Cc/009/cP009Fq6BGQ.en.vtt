00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
and if so why well I think it's the

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.830 
and if so why well I think it's the
nature<00:03:58.280> of<00:03:58.430> our<00:03:58.640> business<00:03:58.700> these<00:03:59.330> days<00:03:59.390> you

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
nature of our business these days you

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.840 
nature of our business these days you

there's<00:04:02.030> been<00:04:02.120> a<00:04:02.239> franchise<00:04:02.720> that's<00:04:02.870> had<00:04:03.110> a

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
there's been a franchise that's had a

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.600 
there's been a franchise that's had a
lot<00:04:03.380> of<00:04:03.410> turnover<00:04:03.920> but<00:04:04.040> I<00:04:04.130> think<00:04:04.310> if<00:04:04.400> you<00:04:04.459> look

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
lot of turnover but I think if you look

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.910 
lot of turnover but I think if you look
around<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:04.940> league<00:04:05.320> and<00:04:06.320> that's<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.739> nature

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
around the league and that's the nature

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.440 
around the league and that's the nature
of<00:04:07.070> it<00:04:07.220> nowadays<00:04:07.519> and<00:04:07.820> somewhat<00:04:08.180> inevitable

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
of it nowadays and somewhat inevitable

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.850 
of it nowadays and somewhat inevitable
that<00:04:08.810> there's<00:04:08.959> going<00:04:09.049> to<00:04:09.140> be<00:04:09.200> changes<00:04:09.709> and

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
that there's going to be changes and

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.789 
that there's going to be changes and
usually<00:04:10.190> big<00:04:10.370> changes<00:04:10.760> how<00:04:11.690> does<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:12.350> loss<00:04:12.590> of

would say yo Alvin Gentry has a high
class<00:05:30.650> problem<00:05:31.070> because<00:05:31.220> he's<00:05:31.340> got<00:05:31.460> a<00:05:31.490> lot<00:05:31.640> of

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
class problem because he's got a lot of

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.100

they'll<00:05:35.450> make<00:05:35.600> the<00:05:35.780> playoffs<00:05:35.810> and<00:05:36.380> they're

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
they'll make the playoffs and they're

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.280 
they'll make the playoffs and they're
the<00:05:37.640> second<00:05:38.150> team<00:05:38.390> that<00:05:38.600> you<00:05:38.690> do<00:05:38.840> not<00:05:38.990> want<00:05:39.260> to
