on here we could see evil styles in this
episode<00:00:58.829> 2<00:00:59.190> and<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.359> seemed<00:01:00.629> like<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:01.050> don't<00:01:01.230> I

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
episode 2 and it seemed like I don't I

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.529 
episode 2 and it seemed like I don't I
not<00:01:01.980> sure<00:01:02.190> about<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.210> seems<00:01:03.449> like

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
not sure about this but it seems like

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.370 
not sure about this but it seems like
the<00:01:03.719> mother<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.409> Kira<00:01:05.450> was<00:01:06.450> hanging<00:01:07.200> out<00:01:07.320> with

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
the mother of Kira was hanging out with

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.620 
the mother of Kira was hanging out with
those<00:01:07.680> demons<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.460> think<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.360> could<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.570> been

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
those demons I think it could have been

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.240 
those demons I think it could have been
someone<00:01:09.869> else<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.320> kind<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.530> looks<00:01:10.590> similar<00:01:11.070> we

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
someone else it kind of looks similar we

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.130 
someone else it kind of looks similar we
saw<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> cure<00:01:11.640> his<00:01:11.760> mom<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.270> episode<00:01:12.570> maybe

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
saw a cure his mom in this episode maybe

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.320 
saw a cure his mom in this episode maybe
that's<00:01:13.500> why<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:14.010> might<00:01:14.790> be<00:01:14.909> wrong<00:01:15.060> about<00:01:15.210> that

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
that's why I might be wrong about that

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.109 
that's why I might be wrong about that
though<00:01:15.810> um<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:16.830> scene<00:01:17.130> like<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.939> we're

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
because of the tree and they kind of

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.420 
because of the tree and they kind of
like<00:03:12.030> totally<00:03:12.600> took<00:03:12.990> off<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.470> part<00:03:14.220> of<00:03:14.340> the
