 They are not free and they will walk around and nothing but what to know is that I like to 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.130
 my 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.130
 the same thing happens with witness matters 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.990

 frames 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.560
 this 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.820
 Extend would end in the early morning believe me 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.370
 that his hands were numb from so much being held in the book 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.760
 because they have a lot of weight 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.360
 despite selling some 550 pages 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.830
 criminal baldassi who initially opening 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.609
 - inside are prisoners 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:49.159
 he had said instead of rectifying the fringe recommends starting with efe the 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.290
 Belgian direct and is very well good father to start reading good 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.380
 really with this money I have run out of words 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.350
 If I have many words but we like to be 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.800
 my emotion 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.220
 read this book everything that made me feel 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.329
 and that by outselling ministry 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.659
 med made me feel many things outside 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:15.409
 It is a story 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.589
 how beautiful and touching 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:20.459
 I would dare to say 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.959
 the best book I've read 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.989
 in my short life 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.419
 of the reader 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:28.160
 it's just something else 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.949
 it is something amazing and to my surprise 

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:33.729
 we estimate account 

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:36.729
 nothing typical love story a romantic novel 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:42.840
 still account has not been established as this one should look no no no for nothing 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.449
 advent Annex 3 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:46.749
 a story tricks 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:51.059
 in real events develop in the time of the Second World War you 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:54.139
 shows on the other side the other side 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:58.299
 Deza Nazi Germany that many weapons abhor 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:04.400
 I do not want to tell you much about the story, I'm just going to tell you about 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.199
 scene 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:06.939
 omar one hundred 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.449
 1 a paragraph of the book 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:13.039
 that has been coming and I will tell you how it was developing 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:15.479
 huge integrity scene let's say 

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:18.829
 what I saw in that scene in my mind was 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:19.799
 to all 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.189
 children pere teenagers germany 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:28.069
 will be two pieces of bread german streets to tyrants the bits of panama street 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.289
 case they know that they very well 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:33.089
 food abc 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:35.959
 because there are rooms clear the cinema 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.239
 German social workers missed them 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.209
 to suffer as the Jews suffered they were watching the rates of bread 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.579
 down that street where a few minutes later 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.099
 Jews walking tennis and hungry 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:54.369
 and he wants to suddenly 

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:58.429
 with visibility despite being a weak weakness 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.559
 they ducked and quickly became angry bread shortage to the mouth 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:05.769
 bread toast that these only purposeful children have left in the 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:06.849
 ground 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.199
 the children hiding behind some bush to see us 

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:14.449
 a the die 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:16.069
 born does 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:19.589
 children run but that will reach a small 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:25.490
 which he realized were the ones who irrigate those who accept 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.529
 she was only mistreated 

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:28.650
 but let it go 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.340
 that was another gesture 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.689
 that really moved me because 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.069
 the truth is that those American children 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:38.050
 venice a punishment 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.110
 very little demand to exist 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.100
 of atmosphere with distinguished all tell that not all Germans were 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:50.879
 as to the liquid taha dedicated titus of ridicule not everyone shared their 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:52.309
 same ideals 

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:53.499
 but nevertheless 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:57.039
 there will be majorities, there is no other left but from time to time they were missing 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:59.870
 the life of a Jew 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.319
 through a minimum detail 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:05.379
 as to these children or like this one 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:06.559
 soldier 

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:08.309
 what 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:11.539
 practically saved the life of this line that is helping the culés 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.500
 I am really very moved with this book 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.979
 I must tell you that I do not know how I finished reading it 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.309
 since he had too many tears in his eyes and goods 

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:23.909
 It's true that I'm too squeaky 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:26.330
 written by ap mexico 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.779
 p too much like never 

00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:31.009
 as I had left with my other son 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.389
 a story like this 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:33.900
 maybe exaggerated 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.139
 or maybe not 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.009
 the challenges that are going to be dismissed 

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:42.449
 for those who want to know have already taken the hillside very well it is not about 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.949
 of a man who will play school 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:49.010
 a crop that drew and tell stories and a girl 

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.110
 who stole books while hitler ended with a craving 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.240
 it's amazing derek that a lot of the Germans did not have a good time 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.869
 there was poverty and a lot of hunger and ill-treatment frustration 

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:03.479
 and pain 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.969
 and well I tell you this because this does not come the books 

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:09.900
 of history of schools 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:10.979
 the truth that 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:12.180
 I recomend you 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.719

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.460
 Instantly 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.199
 a really rewarding experience and it feels very good to finish reading 

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:24.479
 his first book 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:27.159
 and then you can not stop 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:31.409
 I just blurted out a dressing room and notions of this one is going to be very many 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:34.039
 madrid josé maría also waits for other things 

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:35.210
 because neither canada 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.719

 and I'm leaving and there they are on facebook 

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:51.519
 you should avoid going to this Iranian video share us with your friends seriously 

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:52.710
 true truth 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.920
 that there is a littoral child that comes like this already gone out of fashion 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:59.110
 completely finished 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:00.259
 we do not want to be there
