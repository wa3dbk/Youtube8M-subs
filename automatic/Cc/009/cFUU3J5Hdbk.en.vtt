all<00:00:26.400> right<00:00:26.609> don't<00:00:26.880> start<00:00:27.240> big<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.840> might<00:00:28.199> be

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
all right don't start big I might be

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.140 
all right don't start big I might be
using<00:00:28.650> bigger<00:00:28.830> objects<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:29.519> it's<00:00:29.699> because

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
using bigger objects but it's because

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.269 
using bigger objects but it's because
it's<00:00:30.330> either<00:00:30.449> big<00:00:30.840> enough<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.560> it<00:00:31.710> helps<00:00:32.160> me

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
it's either big enough that it helps me

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.750 
it's either big enough that it helps me
show<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:33.059> movement<00:00:33.450> or<00:00:34.579> it's<00:00:35.579> just

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
show you the movement or it's just

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.490 
show you the movement or it's just
something<00:00:36.000> I'm<00:00:36.329> more<00:00:36.540> comfortable<00:00:36.750> with<00:00:36.989> so

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
something I'm more comfortable with so

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
tutorial then you know about physics and

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.680 
tutorial then you know about physics and
you<00:00:54.710> know<00:00:54.860> that<00:00:55.159> more<00:00:55.789> speed<00:00:56.120> I<00:00:56.149> have<00:00:56.390> coming

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
you know that more speed I have coming

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.180 
you know that more speed I have coming
into<00:00:56.809> this<00:00:56.989> wall<00:00:57.230> the<00:00:57.379> more<00:00:57.589> my<00:00:57.739> foots<00:00:58.039> gonna

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
into this wall the more my foots gonna

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.759 
into this wall the more my foots gonna
grip<00:00:58.489> and<00:00:58.969> the<00:00:59.659> most<00:00:59.839> common<00:01:00.199> mistake<00:01:00.559> I<00:01:00.710> would

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
grip and the most common mistake I would

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.340 
grip and the most common mistake I would
say<00:01:01.100> it<00:01:01.909> happens<00:01:02.299> when<00:01:02.449> people<00:01:02.690> try<00:01:02.899> to<00:01:02.930> do<00:01:03.110> cat

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
say it happens when people try to do cat

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.430 
say it happens when people try to do cat
grabs<00:01:03.620> is<00:01:04.610> that<00:01:05.119> they<00:01:05.509> reach<00:01:05.780> their<00:01:06.049> hands<00:01:06.229> out

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
grabs is that they reach their hands out

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.370 
grabs is that they reach their hands out
first<00:01:06.770> and<00:01:07.130> it's<00:01:07.520> not<00:01:07.729> good<00:01:08.630> technique<00:01:09.049> it's

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
first and it's not good technique it's

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.109 
first and it's not good technique it's
not<00:01:09.619> going<00:01:09.770> to<00:01:09.830> help<00:01:09.950> you<00:01:10.130> in<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.369> you<00:01:11.000> know

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
when you start doing bigger ones it's

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.490 
when you start doing bigger ones it's
actually<00:01:13.009> gonna<00:01:13.100> hurt<00:01:13.310> you<00:01:13.490> quite<00:01:13.850> a<00:01:13.880> bit<00:01:14.500> so

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
actually gonna hurt you quite a bit so

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.700 
actually gonna hurt you quite a bit so
the<00:01:15.619> movement<00:01:16.039> itself<00:01:16.990> you<00:01:17.990> should<00:01:18.229> be<00:01:18.350> coming

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
the movement itself you should be coming

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.630 
the movement itself you should be coming
in<00:01:18.970> feet<00:01:19.970> first<00:01:20.440> hit<00:01:21.440> with<00:01:21.560> one<00:01:21.800> foot

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.730 

the<00:01:25.060> other<00:01:25.300> hands<00:01:25.780> and<00:01:25.960> other<00:01:26.140> foot<00:01:26.380> on<00:01:26.410> may<00:01:26.710> be

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
the other hands and other foot on may be

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.480 
the other hands and other foot on may be
at<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.040> same<00:01:27.220> time<00:01:27.490> so<00:01:28.180> it's<00:01:28.330> boom-boom<00:01:28.750> okay

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
at the same time so it's boom-boom okay

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.880 
at the same time so it's boom-boom okay
now<00:01:30.490> this<00:01:30.670> trick<00:01:31.230> the<00:01:32.230> more<00:01:32.410> strength<00:01:32.710> you

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
now this trick the more strength you

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.380 
now this trick the more strength you
have<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:34.180> easier<00:01:34.480> it's<00:01:34.600> going<00:01:34.690> to<00:01:34.750> be<00:01:34.980> hold<00:01:35.980> on

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
have the easier it's going to be hold on

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.870 
have the easier it's going to be hold on
to<00:01:37.390> take<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.690> impact<00:01:37.990> of<00:01:38.230> your<00:01:38.380> movement<00:01:38.850> do<00:01:39.850> a

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
to take the impact of your movement do a

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.650 
to take the impact of your movement do a
climb<00:01:40.180> up<00:01:40.390> afterwards<00:01:45.150> so<00:01:46.150> let's<00:01:46.300> go<00:01:46.450> through

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
climb up afterwards so let's go through

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.950 
climb up afterwards so let's go through
taking<00:01:47.229> speed<00:01:47.650> into<00:01:47.979> the<00:01:48.070> wall<00:01:48.840> driving<00:01:49.840> my

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
taking speed into the wall driving my

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.810 
taking speed into the wall driving my
foot<00:01:50.290> out<00:01:50.320> hands<00:01:51.070> are<00:01:51.160> coming<00:01:51.340> on<00:01:52.620> come<00:01:53.620> on<00:01:53.820> now

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
foot out hands are coming on come on now

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.910 
foot out hands are coming on come on now
from<00:01:55.030> here<00:01:55.240> I'm<00:01:55.930> one<00:01:56.080> of<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.290> cats<00:01:56.770> of

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
from here I'm one of the cats of

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.830 
from here I'm one of the cats of
something<00:01:57.190> else<00:01:57.310> step<00:01:58.240> up<00:01:59.100> kick<00:02:00.100> off<00:02:00.840> spotting

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
something else step up kick off spotting

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.810 
something else step up kick off spotting
with<00:02:01.960> my<00:02:02.110> head<00:02:02.290> but<00:02:03.280> for<00:02:03.460> now<00:02:03.520> we're<00:02:03.670> just

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
with my head but for now we're just

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.170 
with my head but for now we're just
doing<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.000> cat<00:02:04.259> stick<00:02:05.259> that<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:06.910> great<00:02:07.150> way

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
doing the cat stick that so a great way

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.449 
doing the cat stick that so a great way
to<00:02:07.390> progress<00:02:07.660> with<00:02:07.960> this<00:02:08.170> is<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:09.009> start<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.369> be

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
to progress with this is to start to be

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.810 
to progress with this is to start to be
small<00:02:09.989> start<00:02:10.989> from<00:02:11.080> here<00:02:11.350> jump<00:02:12.070> to<00:02:12.250> it<00:02:12.400> ever

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
bigger the bigger the gap is you'll

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.490 
bigger the bigger the gap is you'll
actually<00:02:32.099> be<00:02:32.340> reaching<00:02:32.760> out<00:02:33.319> and<00:02:34.319> grabbing

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
actually be reaching out and grabbing

okay so just progress keep stepping back

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:45.300 
okay so just progress keep stepping back
stepping<00:02:40.439> back<00:02:40.700> bring<00:02:41.700> some<00:02:41.909> speed

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:51.260 

take<00:02:45.849> it<00:02:45.970> further

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270
