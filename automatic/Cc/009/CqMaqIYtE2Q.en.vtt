can make really nice music player and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.089 
can make really nice music player and
first<00:00:30.929> things<00:00:31.230> first<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.740> gotta<00:00:31.920> have<00:00:32.040> a

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
first things first you gotta have a

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.130 
first things first you gotta have a
circuit<00:00:32.550> if<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.910> had<00:00:33.239> kind<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.630> covered<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.020> my

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
circuit if I had kind of covered that my

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.680 
circuit if I had kind of covered that my
first<00:00:34.350> episode<00:00:34.969> so<00:00:35.969> what<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.239> whole<00:00:36.360> episode

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
was about but I made a circuit here so

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.040 
was about but I made a circuit here so
yes<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.360> see<00:00:40.190> very<00:00:41.190> well<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.550> then<00:00:42.329> what

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
yes you can see very well and then what

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.010 
yes you can see very well and then what
you're<00:00:43.170> gonna<00:00:43.230> do<00:00:44.239> is<00:00:45.239> I'm<00:00:45.690> going<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.899> go

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
you're gonna do is I'm going to go

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.470 
you're gonna do is I'm going to go
through<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.800> wiring<00:00:47.039> peril<00:00:47.579> I'm<00:00:47.879> gonna<00:00:48.180> give

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
through the wiring peril I'm gonna give

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.420 
through the wiring peril I'm gonna give
it<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.780> didn't<00:00:49.230> add<00:00:49.469> these<00:00:49.649> out<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.039> started

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
it it I didn't add these out and started

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.400 
it it I didn't add these out and started
episode<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.750> what<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.530> do<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.430> have<00:00:53.670> these

episode but on what I do is I have these

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.810 
episode but on what I do is I have these
holes<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.860> back<00:00:56.039> where<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.520> change

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
holes in the back where you can change

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.910 
holes in the back where you can change
the<00:00:56.969> block<00:00:57.270> because<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.379> different<00:00:58.680> blocks

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the block because the different blocks

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.260 
the block because the different blocks
change<00:00:59.510> the<00:01:00.510> sound<00:01:01.500> if<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.370> put<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> different

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
change the sound if you put a different

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.160 
change the sound if you put a different
block<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:04.280> quick<00:01:05.280> tip<00:01:05.489> up<00:01:05.670> sitting<00:01:06.049> usually<00:01:07.049> as

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
block a quick tip up sitting usually as

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.170 
block a quick tip up sitting usually as
like<00:01:07.380> really<00:01:07.740> heavy<00:01:07.920> bass<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:08.610> really<00:01:08.970> nice

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
like really heavy bass it's really nice

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.789 
like really heavy bass it's really nice
and<00:01:09.570> then<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:11.420> little<00:01:12.420> pee<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:12.869> another<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.380> car

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
and then a little pee is another a car

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
put a redstone repeater facing it based

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.429 
put a redstone repeater facing it based
in<00:01:33.479> note<00:01:33.750> block<00:01:34.020> every<00:01:35.009> block<00:01:36.110> and<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.229> what

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
in note block every block and then what

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.719 
in note block every block and then what
you're<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> do<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.340> you're<00:01:38.490> going<00:01:38.610> to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.810 
you're going to do is you're going to
skip<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.060> block<00:01:39.420> every<00:01:40.020> block<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:41.729> what

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
skip a block every block you see what

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.149 
skip a block every block you see what
I'm<00:01:41.939> doing<00:01:42.180> here<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:43.140> skip<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> block

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
I'm doing here you just skip a block

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.100 
I'm doing here you just skip a block
skip<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.000> block<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.360> doesn't<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
skip the block that doesn't have the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.950 
skip the block that doesn't have the
note<00:01:46.229> block<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.560> front<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.189> then<00:01:47.960> all

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
note block in front of it and then all

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.819 
note block in front of it and then all
you're<00:01:49.170> going<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.350> do<00:01:49.470> is<00:01:49.560> you're<00:01:49.680> just<00:01:49.710> going

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
you're going to do is you're just going

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.130 
you're going to do is you're just going
to<00:01:50.009> put<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> redstone<00:01:50.340> down<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.960> should

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
to put a redstone down and you should

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.350 
to put a redstone down and you should
have<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.680> L<00:01:52.920> shape<00:01:53.340> when<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.909> put<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.210> down

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
have like a L shape when you put it down

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.209 
have like a L shape when you put it down
well<00:01:55.200> I'm<00:01:55.950> gonna<00:01:56.070> change<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.670> back<00:01:58.219> alright
