a little bit of a kick which is pretty

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.990 
a little bit of a kick which is pretty
good<00:03:55.940> for<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.389> very<00:03:57.079> mild<00:03:57.440> sauce<00:03:57.829> and<00:03:58.160> for<00:03:58.880> the

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
good for a very mild sauce and for the

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
flavor I'm gonna go ahead and give it a

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.720 
flavor I'm gonna go ahead and give it a
high<00:04:02.000> three<00:04:02.620> out<00:04:03.620> of<00:04:03.680> five<00:04:03.919> because<00:04:04.370> it<00:04:04.579> is

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
high three out of five because it is

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.770 
high three out of five because it is
again<00:04:05.630> a<00:04:05.870> pretty<00:04:06.260> good<00:04:06.470> sauce<00:04:06.739> if<00:04:07.100> they<00:04:08.030> just

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
again a pretty good sauce if they just

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.659

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
dialed back the vinegar a little more I

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.479 
dialed back the vinegar a little more I
think<00:04:11.030> it<00:04:11.120> would<00:04:11.209> have<00:04:11.299> been<00:04:11.389> perfect<00:04:11.930> but<00:04:12.489> you

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
think it would have been perfect but you

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.270 
think it would have been perfect but you
