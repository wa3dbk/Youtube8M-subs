motives really didn't have motives but
we<00:02:00.600> learned<00:02:00.780> maybe<00:02:01.469> he's<00:02:01.740> lying<00:02:01.950> about<00:02:02.189> stuff

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
soldier type serum and that definitely

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.470

nonchalant<00:04:29.310> way<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.790> album<00:04:30.180> would<00:04:30.360> do<00:04:30.600> that

made a little bit stiff way I couldn't
really<00:04:34.170> tell<00:04:34.440> him<00:04:34.620> that<00:04:34.770> I<00:04:34.980> did<00:04:35.280> like<00:04:35.580> of

maybe<00:04:38.010> a<00:04:38.370> little<00:04:39.030> less<00:04:39.240> obvious<00:04:39.560> because<00:04:40.560> I

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
maybe a little less obvious because I

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.230 
maybe a little less obvious because I
feel<00:04:40.890> like<00:04:40.920> Felicity<00:04:41.190> is<00:04:41.400> very<00:04:41.610> obvious<00:04:42.060> with

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
feel like Felicity is very obvious with

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.480 
feel like Felicity is very obvious with
our<00:04:42.360> feelings<00:04:42.750> Oliver's<00:04:43.200> not<00:04:43.710> so<00:04:43.920> obvious<00:04:44.340> and

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
our feelings Oliver's not so obvious and

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.800 
our feelings Oliver's not so obvious and
that<00:04:44.580> makes<00:04:44.790> sense<00:04:44.910> for<00:04:45.120> his<00:04:45.240> character<00:04:45.570> so<00:04:45.780> I

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.320 
very curious about that and how he will
get<00:05:27.750> his<00:05:27.900> powers<00:05:28.640> yes<00:05:29.640> I'm<00:05:29.850> very<00:05:30.060> interested

get his powers yes I'm very interested
in<00:05:30.630> that<00:05:30.780> I<00:05:31.050> mean<00:05:31.620> if<00:05:31.770> he<00:05:31.890> does<00:05:32.040> have<00:05:32.220> his<00:05:32.430> own

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
in that I mean if he does have his own

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.860 
in that I mean if he does have his own
series<00:05:32.730> I<00:05:32.940> think<00:05:33.000> they<00:05:33.210> were<00:05:33.360> setting<00:05:33.690> that<00:05:33.810> up

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
series I think they were setting that up

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.450 
series I think they were setting that up
to<00:05:34.320> see<00:05:34.440> you<00:05:34.530> know<00:05:34.650> if<00:05:34.800> he<00:05:34.920> has<00:05:35.010> his<00:05:35.130> own<00:05:35.250> series

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
to see you know if he has his own series

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.790 
to see you know if he has his own series
we'll<00:05:35.700> find<00:05:35.880> out<00:05:36.060> more<00:05:36.090> about<00:05:36.240> his<00:05:36.540> mother<00:05:36.800> and

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.440 
we'll find out more about his mother and
I<00:05:37.860> don't<00:05:37.920> think<00:05:38.310> he's<00:05:38.460> gonna<00:05:38.640> beam<00:05:38.790> up<00:05:38.910> so<00:05:39.090> 20<00:05:39.420> I

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
I don't think he's gonna beam up so 20 I

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:40.580 
I don't think he's gonna beam up so 20 I
don't<00:05:39.750> think<00:05:39.930> they're<00:05:40.050> doing<00:05:40.260> a<00:05:40.320> backdoor

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
don't think they're doing a backdoor

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.350 
don't think they're doing a backdoor
pilot<00:05:40.710> anymore<00:05:41.340> they're<00:05:41.520> just<00:05:41.550> gonna<00:05:41.790> do<00:05:41.970> a

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
pilot anymore they're just gonna do a

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.780 
pilot anymore they're just gonna do a
pilot<00:05:42.900> for<00:05:43.020> him<00:05:43.200> and<00:05:43.500> I<00:05:43.890> think<00:05:44.370> grant<00:05:44.610> did

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
pilot for him and I think grant did

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.550 
pilot for him and I think grant did
actually<00:05:45.000> a<00:05:45.180> very<00:05:45.480> good<00:05:45.660> job<00:05:45.870> with<00:05:46.080> him<00:05:46.260> I

narrow you know this episode was on a

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.170 
narrow you know this episode was on a
little<00:06:13.680> bit<00:06:13.830> of<00:06:13.950> the<00:06:14.100> slower<00:06:14.550> side<00:06:14.910> there

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
little bit of the slower side there

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.580 
little bit of the slower side there
wasn't<00:06:15.450> anything<00:06:15.600> that<00:06:15.750> like<00:06:16.140> humongous

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
wasn't anything that like humongous

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.230 
wasn't anything that like humongous
happening<00:06:17.160> which<00:06:17.250> I<00:06:17.370> kind<00:06:17.610> of<00:06:17.700> wish<00:06:17.850> it<00:06:17.880> did

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
happening which I kind of wish it did

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.440 
happening which I kind of wish it did
but<00:06:19.200> this<00:06:19.320> is<00:06:19.500> just<00:06:19.650> a<00:06:19.800> big<00:06:20.100> set<00:06:20.430> up<00:06:20.580> episode

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
but this is just a big set up episode

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.750 
but this is just a big set up episode
going<00:06:21.900> into<00:06:22.230> the<00:06:22.770> mid-season<00:06:23.190> finale<00:06:23.550> which

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
going into the mid-season finale which

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.190 
going into the mid-season finale which
I'm<00:06:23.910> sure<00:06:24.030> there'll<00:06:24.270> be<00:06:24.300> a<00:06:24.420> lot<00:06:24.630> of<00:06:24.750> explosive

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
I'm sure there'll be a lot of explosive

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.230 
I'm sure there'll be a lot of explosive
things<00:06:25.440> with<00:06:25.620> all<00:06:25.860> characters<00:06:26.370> they're

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
things with all characters they're

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.000 
things with all characters they're
setting<00:06:27.510> up<00:06:27.630> a<00:06:27.750> lot<00:06:28.110> of<00:06:28.140> stuff<00:06:28.680> like<00:06:28.980> even

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
setting up a lot of stuff like even

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.730 
setting up a lot of stuff like even
Colton<00:06:29.640> getting<00:06:29.910> hit<00:06:30.180> on<00:06:30.360> Colton<00:06:30.900> even<00:06:31.530> Roy

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
Colton getting hit on Colton even Roy

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.700 
Colton getting hit on Colton even Roy
again<00:06:32.040> hit<00:06:32.370> with<00:06:32.640> the<00:06:33.150> arrow<00:06:33.360> I<00:06:33.780> think<00:06:34.560> that's

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
again hit with the arrow I think that's

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.399

even<00:06:34.830> setting

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:35.409 
even setting

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:37.499 
even setting
for<00:06:35.559> something<00:06:35.769> and<00:06:36.580> then<00:06:36.759> him<00:06:37.029> saying<00:06:37.269> I<00:06:37.479> am

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:37.509 
for something and then him saying I am

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:40.350 
for something and then him saying I am
my<00:06:37.719> own<00:06:37.749> team<00:06:38.189> could<00:06:39.189> that<00:06:39.309> be<00:06:39.459> like<00:06:39.639> feet<00:06:40.179> up

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
my own team could that be like feet up

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.969 
my own team could that be like feet up
pushing<00:06:40.659> her<00:06:40.779> away<00:06:40.869> to<00:06:41.019> be<00:06:41.289> in<00:06:41.409> the<00:06:41.529> team<00:06:41.739> and

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:41.979 
pushing her away to be in the team and

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:44.759 
pushing her away to be in the team and
sin<00:06:42.279> and<00:06:42.550> really<00:06:42.819> just<00:06:42.999> like<00:06:43.379> being<00:06:44.379> a<00:06:44.559> team

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:44.769 
sin and really just like being a team

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:46.859 
sin and really just like being a team
not<00:06:45.069> be<00:06:45.219> pretty<00:06:45.429> interesting<00:06:45.969> I<00:06:46.059> really<00:06:46.419> think

00:06:46.859 --> 00:06:46.869 
not be pretty interesting I really think

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:49.919 
not be pretty interesting I really think
honestly<00:06:47.909> Malcolm<00:06:48.909> is<00:06:49.089> gonna<00:06:49.300> confront<00:06:49.659> the

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:49.929 
honestly Malcolm is gonna confront the

00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:52.489 
honestly Malcolm is gonna confront the
end<00:06:50.110> somehow<00:06:50.439> like<00:06:50.709> kidnap<00:06:51.099> her<00:06:51.279> and<00:06:51.489> keep<00:06:51.999> her

00:06:52.489 --> 00:06:52.499 
end somehow like kidnap her and keep her

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:54.959 
end somehow like kidnap her and keep her
to<00:06:53.499> himself<00:06:53.649> and<00:06:54.099> that<00:06:54.219> could<00:06:54.399> grow<00:06:54.610> Thea's

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:54.969 
to himself and that could grow Thea's

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:58.199 
to himself and that could grow Thea's
character<00:06:55.389> a<00:06:55.419> lot<00:06:56.519> maybe<00:06:57.519> becoming<00:06:57.849> more<00:06:58.149> of

00:06:58.199 --> 00:06:58.209 
character a lot maybe becoming more of

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:59.699 
character a lot maybe becoming more of
an<00:06:58.330> action<00:06:58.629> character<00:06:59.050> that<00:06:59.169> we<00:06:59.319> don't<00:06:59.499> really

00:06:59.699 --> 00:06:59.709 
an action character that we don't really

00:06:59.709 --> 00:07:01.469 
an action character that we don't really
see<00:06:59.979> right<00:07:00.249> now<00:07:00.429> and<00:07:00.669> you<00:07:00.969> know<00:07:01.089> something<00:07:01.419> I

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 
see right now and you know something I

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:02.820

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:39.729 
well Oliver was and I thought was a good

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:41.189 
well Oliver was and I thought was a good
cliffhanger<00:07:40.329> wasn't<00:07:40.689> a<00:07:40.719> shocking

00:07:41.189 --> 00:07:41.199 
cliffhanger wasn't a shocking

00:07:41.199 --> 00:07:42.239 
cliffhanger wasn't a shocking
cliffhanger<00:07:41.679> I<00:07:41.740> don't<00:07:41.949> think<00:07:42.099> there's

00:07:42.239 --> 00:07:42.249 
cliffhanger I don't think there's

00:07:42.249 --> 00:07:44.100 
cliffhanger I don't think there's
anything<00:07:42.519> too<00:07:42.969> shocking<00:07:43.240> in<00:07:43.509> this<00:07:43.659> episode

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:44.110 
anything too shocking in this episode

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.279 
anything too shocking in this episode
but<00:07:44.949> this<00:07:45.039> is<00:07:45.189> a<00:07:45.249> very<00:07:45.429> good<00:07:45.669> setup<00:07:46.659> lead<00:07:47.079> up<00:07:47.259> to

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:47.289 
but this is a very good setup lead up to

00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:48.869 
but this is a very good setup lead up to
the<00:07:47.559> mid-season<00:07:47.889> finale<00:07:48.279> which<00:07:48.459> I<00:07:48.610> think<00:07:48.789> is

00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:48.879 
the mid-season finale which I think is

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:51.119
