00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.030
 christoph my name is walter koren vom 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.379
 styrian music house musika i want 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.840
 give you some tips with this video 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.160
 given the topic done buy that 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.450
 means what should they look for when they are 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.779
 buy a concert guitar 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.550
 A key point in buying is like 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.079
 This guitar is easy to play 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.300
 that is the playability of a 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.500
 Guitar is mostly on the left hand 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.809
 an important factor is perhaps 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.820
 can be grasped 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:32.520
 there is an important ingredient and 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.930
 Parts of the neck of the guitar must be on 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.879
 On the one hand, it has a very stable construction 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.679
 because, of course, he is on the side of 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.539
 namely to withstand about 50 kilos namely 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:40.800
 still tilt in advance because that 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.839
 happens when the neck is gone forwards 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.219
 gives the lateral position rises and the 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:46.260
 Guitar becomes very difficult to play 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.969
 on the other hand, you should be slim 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.620
 Worked enough that he was light 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.269
 So tangible is that I'm not now 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.079
 Giant fingers need to get around it 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.030
 come and to ensure this 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.399
 doing sensible things was the following 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.569
 and build three-piece necks that is 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.460
 you can see it very nice on this 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:03.929
 dark this dark line that one 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.210
 dark piece of wood incorporated 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:08.070
 that means this has done is in itself 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.530
 glued against and thereby it is yes 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.720
 stable and keeps the train loose and 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.770
 also does not bend itself 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.810
 Cheap manufacturers can of course 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.060
 not so expensive the neck construction but 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.760
 It just makes a piece of wood 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.590
 the neck and use it mostly one 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.650
 very massive piece of wood that is 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.780
 thick piece of it so that really 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.860
 pressure lasts longer and keeps what 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.720
 of course a very big one again 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.590
 disadvantage is just about the topic 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.840
 to play the topic 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.860
 just for beginners are such done 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.900
 good as unfit 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.090
 a second key point is this 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.380
 Wood from the digital is done now 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.660
 still one or the other say the wood 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.480
 wood which is not so once it goes 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.660
 to the quality of the wood and that of 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.400
 how was this wood dried? 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.290
 done good manufacturers use off 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.390
 wood dried over years of air 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.710
 that is when the very gentle the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.510
 moisture is removed and very 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.620
 slowly 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.480
 Cheap manufacturers can get that 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.040
 do not afford more and more fresh wood 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.530
 and dry in very quickly 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.940
 dry plants then get to 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.800
 process dry wood meets 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.509
 disadvantage is if from this wood then 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.939
 a guitar was then takes this 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.069
 the same time honestly the guitar 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:15.280
 Humidity again by giving her 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.410
 previously withdrawn 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.160
 and then put wood and a guitar 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.240
 which moves and deforms 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.069
 this is of course no vote 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.590
 stability the thought that the done 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.880
 are incessantly and it is 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.569
 Of course, neither for beginners nor 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.040
 advanced really very pleasant 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.480
 also a point a mechanical one 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.160
 point means as well as the quality of 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.910
 mechanics there are also big ones 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.220
 differences 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.540
 And these mechanics contribute to it 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.020
 Stable at the mood 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.800
 your guitar is or will remain 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.330
 In summary, one can say very much 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.090
 It would always be important to have a guitar 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.530
 to choose personally 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.510
 because different woods are used 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.040
 You can stick wood spruce 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.870
 counter there is for a corpus 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.800
 different types of wood and every wood 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.690
 sounds different 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.130
 and sound is also out again what 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.959
 matter of taste is that would mean that would be 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.160
 very good if you have your guitar 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.319
 personally choose if you already 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.670
 you can try by playing though 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.170
 they still can not play anybody 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.670
 There is enough sales 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.069
 earn the different done 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.080
 For example, they can perform 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.300
 it's behind me and we help you too 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.700
 like doing our selection for the 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.630
 optimally matching guitar then 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.100
 out 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.989
 a key point when it comes to 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.790
 That means, if you 're looking for a child 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.860
 child to buy the guitar then it would be 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.510
 very important to come with the child because 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.160
 There are children in different sizes 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.860
 they are available in different sizes 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.560
 and here really the right one from 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.730
 to find camouflaged size for children size 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.299
 It would be the easiest child 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.390
 take 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.680
 and then you can do it the easiest 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.930
 determine 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.940
 a point still if you have a guitar 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.010
 could also acquire somewhere in private 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.329
 that happens more often then it is quite 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.549
 Very important that you get all these points 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.049
 note he is still just now he is 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.670
 maybe made up of three parts 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.130
 important is the holder is the guitar 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.130
 easily do they already grab any 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.160
 left rest stops there is still behind 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.019
 All these things you should check 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.340
 buy at the wheel if you yourself 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.049
 can not judge and also 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.579
 Nobody has it helping them 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.989
 Can use this guitar before you get it 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.350
 of course also like to buy to us 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.700
 come 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.650
 we do a free 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.660
 non-binding purchasing and can 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.940
 Tell them how high the value of these 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.580
 guitar is still to be quantified 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.670
 Well that was actually it in the big and 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:26.220
 disguised on the subject 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.330
 Summing up number clearly 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.580
 playability so easily that something 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.380
 it's just for beginners 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.850
 Of course always great when they are 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.340
 already a guitar did not forget 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.990
 Also a guitar needs care 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.400
 at least once a year, the pages 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.940
 get changed even if they are not 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.950
 to travel 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.300
 then you will be given opportunity to the corpus 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.640
 clean it is suitable 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.980
 care products there is a care product 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.420
 also for the fingerboard this increases the 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.850
 life of your guitar and the 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.400
 thought, of course , then happy
