over<00:05:39.030> I<00:05:39.180> think<00:05:39.540> basically<00:05:40.260> if<00:05:40.650> you<00:05:40.770> wanted<00:05:41.070> to

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
over I think basically if you wanted to

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.510 
over I think basically if you wanted to
build<00:05:41.970> a<00:05:42.270> pool<00:05:42.480> or<00:05:43.040> change<00:05:44.040> some<00:05:44.340> of<00:05:44.370> the

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
build a pool or change some of the

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.580 
build a pool or change some of the
layout<00:05:44.790> here<00:05:45.180> I<00:05:45.390> think<00:05:45.630> you<00:05:46.140> know<00:05:46.230> you've<00:05:46.440> got

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
layout here I think you know you've got

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.190 
layout here I think you know you've got
plenty<00:05:46.770> of<00:05:46.920> room<00:05:47.100> to<00:05:47.280> do<00:05:47.400> so<00:05:47.720> but<00:05:48.720> it<00:05:48.870> is<00:05:48.990> like

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
plenty of room to do so but it is like

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.860 
plenty of room to do so but it is like
that<00:05:49.380> that<00:05:49.440> this<00:05:50.040> is<00:05:50.100> included<00:05:50.750> in<00:05:51.750> the

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
that that this is included in the

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.600 
that that this is included in the
premium<00:05:52.140> size<00:05:52.410> lot<00:05:52.680> if<00:05:53.100> you<00:05:53.250> were<00:05:53.340> to<00:05:53.460> build

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
would basically end at the where the

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.540 
would basically end at the where the
house<00:05:57.960> ends<00:05:58.320> here<00:05:59.420> so<00:06:00.420> that<00:06:01.080> is<00:06:01.380> the<00:06:01.770> designer
