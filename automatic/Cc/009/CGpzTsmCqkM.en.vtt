Batman symbol underneath there but I

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.100 
Batman symbol underneath there but I
think<00:01:38.729> that's<00:01:38.909> how<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.060> was<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.479> comic<00:01:39.869> so

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
think that's how it was in the comic so

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.980 
think that's how it was in the comic so
the<00:01:40.650> ring<00:01:40.860> right<00:01:41.070> there<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.640> pretty<00:01:42.240> small<00:01:42.630> not

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
the ring right there is pretty small not

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.990 
the ring right there is pretty small not
much<00:01:43.140> detail<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.710> ring<00:01:43.890> but<00:01:44.189> that's<00:01:44.729> how

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
much detail in the ring but that's how

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.270 
much detail in the ring but that's how
it<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.570> guess<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.840> build<00:01:46.229> looks<00:01:46.439> very<00:01:46.710> cool

good scale you can see how much bigger

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.210 
good scale you can see how much bigger
it<00:03:54.340> is<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:54.879> then<00:03:55.060> DC<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:56.079> see<00:03:56.409> being<00:03:56.680> a<00:03:56.829> Batman

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
awesome figures even though both these

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.479 
awesome figures even though both these
guys<00:04:01.840> are<00:04:01.900> only<00:04:02.230> white<00:04:02.500> lanterns<00:04:02.980> for<00:04:03.190> a<00:04:03.220> short

time<00:04:03.640> each<00:04:04.000> you<00:04:04.599> know<00:04:04.629> they're<00:04:05.319> really<00:04:05.590> cool

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739

variants<00:04:06.340> of<00:04:06.610> you<00:04:07.329> know<00:04:07.480> Batman<00:04:08.049> and<00:04:08.260> flash<00:04:08.409> I

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
variants of you know Batman and flash I

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.650 
variants of you know Batman and flash I
mean<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.610> flash<00:04:09.819> does<00:04:10.180> have<00:04:10.390> more

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
mean the flash does have more

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.900 
mean the flash does have more
articulation<00:04:11.230> but<00:04:11.709> I<00:04:11.920> have<00:04:12.160> to<00:04:12.310> say<00:04:12.489> I<00:04:12.519> like

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
articulation but I have to say I like

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.550 
articulation but I have to say I like
the<00:04:13.090> Batman<00:04:13.510> in<00:04:13.780> sculpt<00:04:14.140> a<00:04:14.170> little<00:04:14.230> better<00:04:14.470> it

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
the Batman in sculpt a little better it

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.099 
the Batman in sculpt a little better it
looks<00:04:14.709> more<00:04:14.890> dynamic<00:04:15.489> and<00:04:15.700> more<00:04:16.209> awesome<00:04:16.750> but

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
looks more dynamic and more awesome but

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.960 
looks more dynamic and more awesome but
if<00:04:17.530> you<00:04:17.709> want<00:04:17.889> articulation<00:04:18.579> more<00:04:18.789> than

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
if you want articulation more than

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.120 
if you want articulation more than
sculpt<00:04:19.389> and<00:04:19.630> definitely<00:04:19.930> get<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.169> flash<00:04:20.380> but

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
sculpt and definitely get the flash but
