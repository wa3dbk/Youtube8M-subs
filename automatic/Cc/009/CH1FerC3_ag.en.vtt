00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.790
 it is time to evaluate the week with 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.790
 benÃ© gomes 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.710
 the chevrolet promised a deep 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.270
 renew your vehicle line here 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.130
 in brazil and did not fail 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.529
 you remember there were several releases 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.540
 during the year and yet she created 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.689
 a certain expectation for the two 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.760
 last to arrive at 31 the blazer that arrives 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.090
 before the end of the year and for your 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.820
 expected new compact onyx hatch 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.309
 we checked this week the unix is 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.040
 one that translates well the new face of the 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.379
 brand in Brazil and in this case with more 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.750
 project truth refinement 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.680
 to the package of 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.260
 comfort 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.360
 The expectation is that the bus has 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.629
 Brazilian streets as happened with the 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.420
 corsa in the 90's because he 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.789
 will compete 5 brand new compact 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.340
 that just arrived but will poking 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:07.050
 even the leading models in this segment 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.050
 the goal and the pallium 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.770
 even because you see the onyx it has a visual 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.500
 very imposing is greater than its new 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.210
 competitors as ethical or hb 20 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.130
 in fact he even has a pint of 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.409
 especially if you 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.510
 notes that the front of it is short 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.380
 and there is a breeze that quite 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.990
 inclined 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.790
 the on -axes of the onyx is not so great 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.369
 but still the design of the body 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.750
 including good internal space 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.759
 for who goes after 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.460
 even with the lowest ceiling design 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.710
 on the back end but see that the 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.840
 finish is careful and has a 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.090
 floor above we see in the Couto 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.979
 for example thorn in here 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.050
 we quickly realize that it brings 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.750
 some items already well known of these 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.509
 other cars but nothing that compromises the 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.220
 exclusive air here onyx because 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.070
 the panel for example I see it has a 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.570
 well-designed drawing and even being all 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.360
 made of plastic does not even bother 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.850
 but it is here that you have a great point 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.070
 which proves this rejuvenation of the 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.890
 chevrolet models translated by this 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.230
 small screen that will incorporate the panel is 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.840
 That's even a compact onyx. 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.670
 considered at the moment is the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.209
 first to offer an exquisite 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.880
 multimedia system mylink that has up to 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.400
 touch commands on screen serial item 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.220
 in the top version is available as 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.610
 optional in the intermediate version to lt 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.310
 with 1.0 mylink engine has all those 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.010
 very common operations today from the 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.820
 connection with your smartphone including 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.820
 navigation system 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.180
 here's a compliment to the onyx 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.430
 already be a standard item from the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.740
 first version the height adjustment of the 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.360
 driver's seat and also the steering wheel 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.360
 now what caught my attention 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.610
 here is the highest condition for the 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.980
 driver who, in fact, reminds 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.160
 condition of who drives a minivan 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.470
 but it is only because in the perception here 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.470
 Is the shuttle wheel of the bus is very positive 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.680
 the modernity of the project to 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.110
 much more rigid body this guarantees 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.820
 more firmness for the moving car to 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.550
 revenue includes a suspension hit 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.490
 that left the onyx very delicious to guide 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.360
 and safe at high speeds and 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.190
 detail 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.620
 inside noise the external noise is well 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.209
 absorbed, you can listen to 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.209
 talk without raising your voice 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:52.190
 and that has the help of the good engines 1.0 and 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.590
 1.4 already known from the chevrolet line and 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.780
 which are available here on Onyx 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.580
 they have not yet received an evolution 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.770
 as well as a valve control 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.230
 variable but still gained 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.120
 important changes that have brought 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.370
 more power for these engines and 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.660
 mainly assist in the issue of 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.660
 fuel consumption 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:20.989
 in the case of the 1.4 flex engine teaming is 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.930
 this version at ltz power has risen from 98 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.100
 for 106 horses with ethanol and the torque 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.620
 also improved 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.680
 in practice it has the competent authority to 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.360
 the weight of the onyx and will only disappoint in 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.200
 conditions that the car is too 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.290
 loaded 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.810
 already the 1.0 engine that won only two 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.510
 horsepower the result on time 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.040
 faster and more modest of course but with 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:47.570
 the guarantee of more economy of 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.970
 with a good package 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.010
 interesting since the first version the 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.140
 onyx can yes put the brand chevrolet 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.960
 back to the top in the 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:59.000
 compact so if you like the car 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.980
 pay attention to the most 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.980
 content and price 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.599
 the compact segment is the most 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:12.059
 played here in Brazil and so 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:14.159
 even benefited the most this year 

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:16.409
 with regards to launches the bus 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:18.719
 represents this good moment for those who 

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:20.939
 buy car here in brazil that goes 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:24.589
 gaining more options and the better 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:24.589
 most exquisite models
