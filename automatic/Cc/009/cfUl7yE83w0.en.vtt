okay<00:00:00.930> everyone<00:00:01.140> here's<00:00:01.260> another<00:00:01.770> project<00:00:02.100> I'm

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
okay everyone here's another project I'm

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.140 
okay everyone here's another project I'm
working<00:00:02.370> on<00:00:02.790> it's<00:00:03.179> my<00:00:03.980> one<00:00:04.980> of<00:00:05.009> my<00:00:05.100> NES<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:05.910> and

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
working on it's my one of my NES is and

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.570 
working on it's my one of my NES is and
what<00:00:06.299> I've<00:00:06.390> done<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.750> I've<00:00:06.930> disconnected<00:00:07.859> pin

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
what I've done is I've disconnected pin

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.749 
what I've done is I've disconnected pin
4<00:00:08.970> on<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.410> lockout<00:00:10.410> chip<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.920> by<00:00:11.429> doing<00:00:11.490> that

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
4 on the lockout chip and by doing that

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.629 
4 on the lockout chip and by doing that
you<00:00:12.240> disable<00:00:13.019> lockout<00:00:13.980> which<00:00:14.160> causes<00:00:14.549> the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
you disable lockout which causes the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.990 
you disable lockout which causes the
flashing<00:00:15.120> when<00:00:15.480> any<00:00:15.870> cartridges<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.130> dirty

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
flashing when any cartridges is dirty

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.939 
flashing when any cartridges is dirty
and<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.390> connection<00:00:18.810> isn't<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.170> great<00:00:19.289> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
and the connection isn't so great the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.429 
and the connection isn't so great the
idea<00:00:20.189> behind<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.760> modification<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:22.050> it

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
idea behind this modification is it

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.800 
idea behind this modification is it
makes<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.279> games<00:00:23.580> will<00:00:23.760> play<00:00:24.000> even<00:00:24.630> if

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
makes it so games will play even if

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.040 
makes it so games will play even if
they're<00:00:24.990> semi<00:00:25.320> dirty<00:00:26.539> the<00:00:27.539> only<00:00:27.660> problem<00:00:27.900> is

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
they're semi dirty the only problem is

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.780 
they're semi dirty the only problem is
is<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:29.000> the<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:31.199> NES<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:31.830> old<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.219> fact

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
is that the the NES is so old in fact

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.190 
is that the the NES is so old in fact
that<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.270> mod<00:00:33.510> doesn't<00:00:33.899> even<00:00:34.020> really

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
that this mod doesn't even really

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.740 
that this mod doesn't even really
particularly<00:00:34.800> helped<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.100> lot<00:00:35.280> so<00:00:36.059> I'll<00:00:36.510> turn

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
particularly helped a lot so I'll turn

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.970 
particularly helped a lot so I'll turn

lightly browned screen if i take the

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.439 
lightly browned screen if i take the
clutches<00:00:45.210> out<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.780> put<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.170> few<00:00:46.350> times

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449

if<00:00:51.449> i<00:00:51.600> hold<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.899> down<00:00:52.050> let's<00:00:52.379> see<00:00:52.440> what<00:00:52.559> happens

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
if i hold it down let's see what happens

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.720 
if i hold it down let's see what happens
nothing<00:00:54.120> there<00:00:54.890> I've<00:00:55.890> got<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> gray<00:00:56.610> screen

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
there we go still requires contact and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.000 
there we go still requires contact and
look<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.910> lost<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.480> already<00:01:06.320> so<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.560> doesn't<00:01:07.710> fix

a dirty cartridge or a bad connector

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.859 
a dirty cartridge or a bad connector
years<00:01:12.900> ago<00:01:13.170> i<00:01:13.200> actually<00:01:13.680> bought<00:01:14.869> replacement

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
years ago i actually bought replacement

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.929 
years ago i actually bought replacement
chinese<00:01:16.229> connectors<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:16.920> any<00:01:17.159> SS<00:01:17.549> if<00:01:17.850> you

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
chinese connectors for any SS if you

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.940 
chinese connectors for any SS if you
look<00:01:18.030> at<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.240> one<00:01:18.360> right<00:01:18.479> here<00:01:18.650> plus<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.830> not

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
look at this one right here plus is not

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.270 
look at this one right here plus is not
it

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.410 

there's<00:01:24.280> another<00:01:24.430> one<00:01:24.520> I've<00:01:24.700> been<00:01:24.730> working<00:01:25.300> on

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
there's another one I've been working on

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.190 
there's another one I've been working on
I<00:01:25.860> also<00:01:26.860> disconnected<00:01:27.430> pin<00:01:28.390> for<00:01:28.420> in<00:01:28.750> this<00:01:28.870> one

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.190 

and<00:01:34.050> if<00:01:35.050> you<00:01:35.140> look<00:01:35.320> at<00:01:35.410> this<00:01:35.560> one<00:01:35.830> this<00:01:36.040> has<00:01:36.490> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
and if you look at this one this has a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.380 
and if you look at this one this has a
replacement<00:01:38.200> connector<00:01:38.590> in<00:01:38.710> it<00:01:38.830> and<00:01:39.390> the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
replacement connector in it and the

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.609 
replacement connector in it and the
difference<00:01:40.720> being<00:01:40.900> is<00:01:41.080> when<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.260> slide<00:01:41.470> this

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
difference being is when you slide this

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.310 
difference being is when you slide this
cartridge<00:01:42.130> in<00:01:42.570> there's<00:01:43.570> a<00:01:43.660> lot<00:01:43.690> of<00:01:43.840> there's<00:01:44.260> a

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
cartridge in there's a lot of there's a

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.070 
cartridge in there's a lot of there's a
lot<00:01:44.410> of<00:01:44.470> horse<00:01:44.950> back<00:01:45.220> on<00:01:45.490> it<00:01:45.900> will<00:01:46.900> try

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
lot of horse back on it will try

00:01:47.080 --> 00:02:02.940 
lot of horse back on it will try
plugging<00:01:47.290> this<00:01:47.530> one<00:01:47.740> in<00:02:01.590> maybe<00:02:02.590> just<00:02:02.800> get<00:02:02.860> a

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
plugging this one in maybe just get a

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.190 
plugging this one in maybe just get a
blue<00:02:03.100> screen<00:02:03.310> on<00:02:03.460> this<00:02:03.580> one<00:02:03.759> and<00:02:07.080> even<00:02:08.080> with

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
blue screen on this one and even with

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.020 
blue screen on this one and even with
extra<00:02:08.560> tight<00:02:08.770> cartridge<00:02:09.220> slot<00:02:09.520> that<00:02:09.789> doesn't

extra tight cartridge slot that doesn't
seem<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.360> solve<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.230> problem<00:02:11.680> now<00:02:12.580> these

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
seem to solve the problem now these

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.340 
seem to solve the problem now these
Vulcans<00:02:13.030> nes<00:02:13.480> is<00:02:13.600> a<00:02:13.630> functional<00:02:14.140> if<00:02:14.200> I<00:02:14.290> took

Vulcans nes is a functional if I took

slot with this one over here this is an

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:34.650 
slot with this one over here this is an
NES<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:29.070> put<00:02:30.070> an<00:02:30.160> n64<00:02:30.640> case<00:02:32.400> here<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:34.330> I

NES that I put an n64 case here and I

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.600 
NES that I put an n64 case here and I
was<00:02:34.720> actually<00:02:34.930> rewiring<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.950> up<00:02:36.070> this<00:02:36.459> was

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
was actually rewiring it up this was

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.000 
was actually rewiring it up this was
just<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.910> test<00:02:37.630> NE<00:02:38.080> SS<00:02:38.320> doing<00:02:38.470> for<00:02:38.769> one<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:38.980> my

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
just a test NE SS doing for one of my

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.850 
just a test NE SS doing for one of my
portables<00:02:39.519> and<00:02:39.989> in<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.140> process<00:02:41.290> of<00:02:41.530> rewiring

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
portables and in the process of rewiring

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.060 
portables and in the process of rewiring
it<00:02:42.130> actually<00:02:42.519> fried<00:02:42.820> it<00:02:43.380> but<00:02:44.380> as<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:44.590> see<00:02:44.769> here

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
it actually fried it but as you see here

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.070 
it actually fried it but as you see here
what<00:02:45.220> I've<00:02:45.310> done<00:02:45.430> is<00:02:45.580> I've<00:02:45.700> soldered<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.390> new

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
what I've done is I've soldered a new

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.759 
what I've done is I've soldered a new
edge<00:02:47.290> connector<00:02:47.799> on<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:48.250> in<00:02:48.970> doing<00:02:49.540> that

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
edge connector on it and in doing that

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.030 
edge connector on it and in doing that
it<00:02:50.769> actually<00:02:51.120> works<00:02:52.120> really<00:02:52.209> well<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:53.170> so<00:02:53.769> I

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
it actually works really well and so I

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.729 
it actually works really well and so I
guess<00:02:54.760> I<00:02:55.060> really<00:02:55.450> want<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.720> play<00:02:55.840> in<00:02:55.989> NES<00:02:56.200> these

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
guess I really want to play in NES these

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.100 
guess I really want to play in NES these
days<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.610> only<00:02:57.790> way<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:57.910> do<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.299> is<00:02:58.510> either<00:02:58.810> by

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
days the only way to do it is either by

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.800 
days the only way to do it is either by
a<00:02:59.140> top<00:02:59.410> loader<00:02:59.709> or<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.850> make<00:03:01.060> them<00:03:01.239> into<00:03:01.540> some

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
a top loader or to make them into some

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.340 
a top loader or to make them into some
kind<00:03:02.049> of<00:03:02.170> top<00:03:03.160> loader<00:03:03.459> I<00:03:03.870> mean<00:03:04.870> there<00:03:04.989> are<00:03:05.110> some

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
kind of top loader I mean there are some

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.890 
kind of top loader I mean there are some
games<00:03:05.560> that<00:03:05.650> will<00:03:05.799> work<00:03:05.980> in<00:03:06.160> this<00:03:06.280> but<00:03:06.900> I've

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
games that will work in this but I've

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.330 
games that will work in this but I've
cleaned<00:03:08.230> ever<00:03:08.440> whatever<00:03:08.799> one<00:03:08.980> of<00:03:09.070> these<00:03:09.160> games

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
cleaned ever whatever one of these games

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.789 
cleaned ever whatever one of these games
with<00:03:09.579> an<00:03:09.700> eraser<00:03:09.940> that's<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.450> pretty<00:03:10.799> intensive

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
with an eraser that's a pretty intensive

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.290 
with an eraser that's a pretty intensive
cleaning

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.520 

you'll<00:03:17.300> see<00:03:17.510> here<00:03:17.810> I<00:03:17.840> think<00:03:17.930> this<00:03:18.260> one<00:03:18.500> should

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
you'll see here I think this one should

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:27.940 
you'll see here I think this one should
work<00:03:23.170> there<00:03:24.170> you<00:03:24.290> go<00:03:26.170> it<00:03:27.170> all<00:03:27.290> runs<00:03:27.470> it<00:03:27.710> all

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
work there you go it all runs it all

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.400 
work there you go it all runs it all
comes<00:03:28.160> down<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.370> what<00:03:28.760> pins<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.720> corpses<00:03:30.080> uses

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
comes down to what pins the corpses uses

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.590 
comes down to what pins the corpses uses
wear<00:03:31.220> those<00:03:31.400> pins<00:03:31.640> are<00:03:31.880> clean<00:03:32.120> or<00:03:32.300> not<00:03:32.330> or

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
wear those pins are clean or not or

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.690 
wear those pins are clean or not or
