engineer 775 here with fighting fires

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.289 
engineer 775 here with fighting fires
with<00:00:08.780> your<00:00:08.990> pool<00:00:09.410> part<00:00:09.889> one<00:00:10.180> I've<00:00:11.180> been

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:11.299 
with your pool part one I've been

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:12.610 
with your pool part one I've been
thinking<00:00:11.600> about<00:00:11.809> how<00:00:11.959> I<00:00:11.990> could<00:00:12.230> get<00:00:12.350> all<00:00:12.500> the

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
thinking about how I could get all the

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.529 
thinking about how I could get all the
water<00:00:12.860> from<00:00:13.070> my<00:00:13.280> pool<00:00:13.520> about<00:00:14.059> nineteen

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:14.539 
water from my pool about nineteen

water from my pool about nineteen
thousand<00:00:14.930> gallons<00:00:15.320> how<00:00:15.529> could<00:00:15.709> I<00:00:15.799> use<00:00:16.070> that<00:00:16.690> to

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
thousand gallons how could I use that to

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.800 
thousand gallons how could I use that to
fight<00:00:18.560> fires<00:00:18.859> and<00:00:19.390> so<00:00:20.390> what<00:00:20.510> I've<00:00:20.600> done<00:00:20.750> just

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
fight fires and so what I've done just

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.200 
fight fires and so what I've done just
made<00:00:21.230> some<00:00:21.410> simple<00:00:21.619> modifications<00:00:22.460> to<00:00:22.910> my

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
made some simple modifications to my

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.980 
made some simple modifications to my
existing<00:00:23.689> plumbing<00:00:23.929> and<00:00:24.759> on<00:00:25.759> the<00:00:26.029> yeah<00:00:26.779> I<00:00:26.810> can

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
existing plumbing and on the yeah I can

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.689 
existing plumbing and on the yeah I can
either<00:00:27.169> pump<00:00:27.619> to<00:00:27.829> waste<00:00:28.099> if<00:00:28.429> you're<00:00:28.550> familiar

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
either pump to waste if you're familiar

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:30.700 
either pump to waste if you're familiar
with<00:00:28.939> these<00:00:29.179> there's<00:00:29.480> backwash<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:30.019> waste

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
with these there's backwash and waste

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.770 
with these there's backwash and waste
and<00:00:31.070> I'm<00:00:31.159> you<00:00:31.640> can<00:00:31.789> go<00:00:32.029> to<00:00:32.090> either<00:00:32.270> one<00:00:32.419> where

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
and I'm you can go to either one where

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.630 
and I'm you can go to either one where
it's<00:00:32.930> basically<00:00:33.350> taking<00:00:33.710> the<00:00:33.829> water<00:00:34.040> pumping

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
it's basically taking the water pumping

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.910 
it's basically taking the water pumping
the<00:00:34.760> water<00:00:34.790> out<00:00:35.170> through<00:00:36.170> your<00:00:36.290> waistline

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
the water out through your waistline

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.800 
the water out through your waistline
which<00:00:37.190> mines<00:00:37.430> buried<00:00:37.970> and<00:00:38.240> goes<00:00:38.360> out<00:00:38.540> in<00:00:38.720> the

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
which mines buried and goes out in the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.930 
which mines buried and goes out in the
woods<00:00:39.160> so<00:00:40.160> what<00:00:40.280> I'm<00:00:40.370> going<00:00:40.520> to<00:00:40.550> be<00:00:40.640> able<00:00:40.700> to<00:00:40.820> do

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
woods so what I'm going to be able to do

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.270 
woods so what I'm going to be able to do
is<00:00:41.090> use<00:00:41.540> these<00:00:41.720> valves<00:00:42.230> and<00:00:42.410> I'll<00:00:42.770> start<00:00:43.040> I'll

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
is use these valves and I'll start I'll

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.240 
is use these valves and I'll start I'll
open<00:00:44.000> the<00:00:44.150> fire<00:00:44.330> fighting<00:00:44.690> line<00:00:45.130> and<00:00:46.130> then

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
open the fire fighting line and then

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.630 
open the fire fighting line and then
start<00:00:46.520> feathering<00:00:46.940> this<00:00:47.630> one<00:00:47.810> off<00:00:48.460> and<00:00:49.460> then

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
start feathering this one off and then

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.220 
start feathering this one off and then
that'll<00:00:49.970> take<00:00:50.150> my<00:00:50.330> fire<00:00:50.540> hose<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:50.810> what<00:00:50.990> I<00:00:51.020> did

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
that'll take my fire hose and what I did

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.550 
that'll take my fire hose and what I did
is<00:00:51.350> I<00:00:51.440> just<00:00:51.470> put<00:00:51.770> one<00:00:52.100> of<00:00:52.580> those<00:00:52.700> quick<00:00:53.560> quick

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 
is I just put one of those quick quick

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.550 
is I just put one of those quick quick
coupler<00:00:54.950> connections<00:00:55.820> on<00:00:56.000> here<00:00:56.380> make<00:00:57.380> it<00:00:57.410> a

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:57.560 
coupler connections on here make it a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.870 
coupler connections on here make it a
little<00:00:57.680> easy<00:00:58.040> and<00:00:58.340> adapted<00:00:59.330> to<00:01:00.340> two<00:01:01.340> fire<00:01:01.640> hose

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
little easy and adapted to two fire hose

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.940 
little easy and adapted to two fire hose
fittings<00:01:02.420> here<00:01:02.960> so<00:01:03.170> I<00:01:03.200> got<00:01:03.380> a<00:01:03.410> regular<00:01:03.590> fire

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
fittings here so I got a regular fire

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.249 
fittings here so I got a regular fire
hose<00:01:04.220> thread<00:01:04.640> I<00:01:04.909> put<00:01:05.570> new<00:01:05.689> gaskets<00:01:06.200> and

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:06.259 
hose thread I put new gaskets and

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.630 
hose thread I put new gaskets and
everything<00:01:06.740> picked<00:01:07.460> up<00:01:07.610> some<00:01:07.759> fire<00:01:07.970> hose<00:01:08.270> and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
everything picked up some fire hose and

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.819 
everything picked up some fire hose and
also<00:01:10.640> picked<00:01:10.850> up<00:01:10.969> a<00:01:11.119> cool<00:01:11.329> old<00:01:11.719> brass<00:01:12.259> I<00:01:12.619> don't

00:01:12.819 --> 00:01:12.829 
also picked up a cool old brass I don't

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:14.679 
also picked up a cool old brass I don't
know<00:01:12.890> how<00:01:13.009> old<00:01:13.189> this<00:01:13.280> thing<00:01:13.340> is<00:01:13.520> 60<00:01:14.329> years<00:01:14.539> old

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
know how old this thing is 60 years old

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.649 
know how old this thing is 60 years old
or<00:01:14.840> some<00:01:15.020> old<00:01:15.259> brass<00:01:16.189> nozzle<00:01:16.999> so<00:01:17.119> this<00:01:17.270> is<00:01:17.420> very

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
or some old brass nozzle so this is very

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.139 
or some old brass nozzle so this is very
simple<00:01:18.079> this<00:01:18.259> isn't<00:01:18.590> a<00:01:18.649> I<00:01:18.920> could<00:01:19.729> get<00:01:19.939> a<00:01:19.969> better

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
simple this isn't a I could get a better

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.830 
simple this isn't a I could get a better
nozzle<00:01:21.020> or<00:01:21.170> fog<00:01:21.469> or<00:01:21.850> adjustable<00:01:22.850> but<00:01:23.030> you<00:01:23.749> know

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
nozzle or fog or adjustable but you know

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.989 
nozzle or fog or adjustable but you know
my<00:01:24.020> goal<00:01:24.200> is<00:01:24.409> to<00:01:24.530> get<00:01:24.679> as<00:01:24.770> much<00:01:24.950> water<00:01:25.219> from

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:25.999 
my goal is to get as much water from

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:27.880 
my goal is to get as much water from
that<00:01:26.119> swimming<00:01:26.390> pool<00:01:26.509> on<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.049> house<00:01:27.380> as<00:01:27.679> fast

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
that swimming pool on the house as fast

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.609 
that swimming pool on the house as fast
as<00:01:28.130> possible<00:01:28.609> so<00:01:28.759> I've<00:01:29.359> had<00:01:29.509> my<00:01:29.539> kids<00:01:29.899> out<00:01:30.289> here

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
as possible so I've had my kids out here

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.679 
as possible so I've had my kids out here
we<00:01:30.829> did<00:01:30.979> a<00:01:31.009> little<00:01:31.189> drill<00:01:31.670> last<00:01:31.909> night<00:01:32.299> see<00:01:32.569> how

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
we did a little drill last night see how

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.639 
we did a little drill last night see how
fast<00:01:33.189> we<00:01:34.189> could<00:01:34.909> do<00:01:35.119> this<00:01:35.389> because<00:01:35.749> at<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.109> at

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
fast we could do this because at the at

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.719 
fast we could do this because at the at
the<00:01:36.829> first<00:01:37.069> sign<00:01:37.280> of<00:01:37.310> a<00:01:37.520> fire<00:01:37.729> I<00:01:38.060> would<00:01:38.929> be

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
the first sign of a fire I would be

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.389 
the first sign of a fire I would be
besides<00:01:40.729> calling<00:01:41.210> for<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:41.630> fire<00:01:41.780> department

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
besides calling for the fire department

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.139 
besides calling for the fire department
I'd<00:01:43.399> be<00:01:43.579> taking<00:01:44.149> buckets<00:01:44.600> we<00:01:44.780> have<00:01:45.100> orange

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
I'd be taking buckets we have orange

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.209 
I'd be taking buckets we have orange
buckets<00:01:47.149> that<00:01:47.329> we<00:01:47.450> would<00:01:47.600> set<00:01:47.959> up<00:01:48.079> and<00:01:48.289> start

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
buckets that we would set up and start

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:50.620 
buckets that we would set up and start
throwing<00:01:49.280> that<00:01:49.700> water<00:01:49.880> that's<00:01:50.270> probably<00:01:50.569> the

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
throwing that water that's probably the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.849 
throwing that water that's probably the
quickest<00:01:50.990> thing<00:01:51.049> I<00:01:51.229> would<00:01:51.380> do<00:01:51.499> but<00:01:51.649> if<00:01:51.770> I

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
quickest thing I would do but if I

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.520 
quickest thing I would do but if I
really<00:01:52.189> needed<00:01:52.399> to<00:01:52.549> pump<00:01:52.909> a<00:01:53.030> lot<00:01:53.149> of<00:01:53.299> water<00:01:53.530> or

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
really needed to pump a lot of water or

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.370 
really needed to pump a lot of water or
if<00:01:54.740> had<00:01:54.889> I've<00:01:55.100> had<00:01:55.280> people<00:01:55.490> that<00:01:55.850> are<00:01:56.149> actually

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
if had I've had people that are actually

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.599 
if had I've had people that are actually
bucketing<00:01:57.380> water<00:01:57.649> at<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.039> same<00:01:58.219> time<00:01:58.459> we

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:58.609 
bucketing water at the same time we

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:01.300 
bucketing water at the same time we
could<00:01:58.759> get<00:01:58.880> our<00:01:59.109> fire<00:02:00.109> hose<00:02:00.350> set<00:02:00.590> up<00:02:00.740> so<00:02:01.009> that's

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
could get our fire hose set up so that's

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.679 
could get our fire hose set up so that's
kind<00:02:01.549> of<00:02:01.579> what<00:02:01.729> we<00:02:01.789> did<00:02:01.939> a<00:02:01.969> drill<00:02:02.240> on<00:02:02.270> last

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
kind of what we did a drill on last

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.739 
kind of what we did a drill on last
night<00:02:02.959> and<00:02:03.229> so<00:02:03.889> I'm<00:02:03.950> just<00:02:04.069> going<00:02:04.189> to<00:02:04.279> show<00:02:04.459> you

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749 
night and so I'm just going to show you

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.480 
night and so I'm just going to show you
it's<00:02:05.749> not<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:05.929> tremendous<00:02:06.590> amount<00:02:07.279> of<00:02:07.340> water

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
it's not a tremendous amount of water

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.710 
it's not a tremendous amount of water
but<00:02:07.700> what<00:02:07.850> I'm<00:02:07.939> going<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.149> be<00:02:08.270> doing<00:02:08.390> is<00:02:08.569> using

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
but what I'm going to be doing is using

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.800 
but what I'm going to be doing is using
the<00:02:08.929> existing<00:02:09.140> pool<00:02:09.560> pump<00:02:09.860> and<00:02:10.580> this<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.209> a<00:02:11.240> 220

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
the existing pool pump and this is a 220

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.960 
the existing pool pump and this is a 220
or<00:02:11.900> 110<00:02:12.080> volt<00:02:12.500> pump<00:02:12.770> I<00:02:12.890> have<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.099> on<00:02:13.189> 110<00:02:13.610> the

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
or 110 volt pump I have it on 110 the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.309 
or 110 volt pump I have it on 110 the
reason<00:02:14.360> I<00:02:14.450> did<00:02:14.599> that<00:02:14.629> because<00:02:14.870> if<00:02:15.110> there's<00:02:15.260> a

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
reason I did that because if there's a

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.589 
reason I did that because if there's a
fire<00:02:15.590> in<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:15.830> house<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.040> lot<00:02:16.340> of<00:02:16.370> times<00:02:16.599> what

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
fire in the house a lot of times what

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:18.640 
fire in the house a lot of times what
you'd<00:02:17.750> want<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:18.049> do<00:02:18.230> is

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
you'd want to do is

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.920 
you'd want to do is
shut<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.069> power<00:02:19.280> off<00:02:19.489> to<00:02:19.700> everything<00:02:20.450> not<00:02:20.900> to

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
shut the power off to everything not to

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.179 
shut the power off to everything not to
make<00:02:21.170> things<00:02:21.409> you<00:02:21.500> know<00:02:21.709> not<00:02:21.890> so<00:02:21.980> you<00:02:22.069> don't

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:22.189 
make things you know not so you don't

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:23.319 
make things you know not so you don't
make<00:02:22.250> things<00:02:22.400> worse<00:02:22.549> so<00:02:22.939> I'd<00:02:23.030> shut<00:02:23.239> the

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
make things worse so I'd shut the

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:27.910 
make things worse so I'd shut the
electricity<00:02:23.450> off<00:02:24.189> and<00:02:25.189> then<00:02:26.349> I've<00:02:27.349> wired<00:02:27.680> this

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
electricity off and then I've wired this

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.990 
electricity off and then I've wired this
110<00:02:28.489> my<00:02:28.730> pool<00:02:28.970> pump<00:02:29.209> that<00:02:29.510> way<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:29.750> can

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
110 my pool pump that way I can

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.729 
110 my pool pump that way I can
independent<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.120> house<00:02:32.269> plug<00:02:33.140> that<00:02:33.349> into

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
independent of the house plug that into

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.369 
independent of the house plug that into
a<00:02:33.920> small<00:02:34.340> generator<00:02:34.849> to<00:02:35.569> run<00:02:35.780> this<00:02:35.930> pump<00:02:36.260> to

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
a small generator to run this pump to

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.190 
a small generator to run this pump to
pump<00:02:36.650> all<00:02:36.920> this<00:02:37.099> water<00:02:37.400> on<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:38.060> house<00:02:38.239> so

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
pump all this water on the house so

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.899 
pump all this water on the house so
that's<00:02:39.530> what<00:02:39.709> I<00:02:39.739> did<00:02:39.829> that's<00:02:40.489> what<00:02:40.700> we<00:02:40.760> got

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
that's what I did that's what we got

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.670 
that's what I did that's what we got
stage<00:02:41.269> one<00:02:41.599> here<00:02:41.870> what<00:02:42.079> I'm<00:02:42.170> eventually<00:02:42.590> going

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
stage one here what I'm eventually going

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.300 
stage one here what I'm eventually going
to<00:02:42.739> do<00:02:42.829> I<00:02:42.890> put<00:02:43.099> another<00:02:43.310> 3-way<00:02:44.209> valve<00:02:44.239> on<00:02:44.810> here

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
to do I put another 3-way valve on here

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.170 
to do I put another 3-way valve on here
that<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.340> can<00:02:46.670> actually<00:02:47.799> plumb<00:02:48.799> to<00:02:49.310> like<00:02:50.150> a

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
that I can actually plumb to like a

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.009 
that I can actually plumb to like a
transfer<00:02:50.750> pump<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:53.450> would<00:02:53.540> be<00:02:53.599> a<00:02:53.720> gas

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
transfer pump and so that would be a gas

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.539 
transfer pump and so that would be a gas
pump<00:02:54.349> that<00:02:54.590> I<00:02:54.620> could<00:02:54.799> take<00:02:55.010> all<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.340> water

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
pump that I could take all the water

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.199 
pump that I could take all the water
from<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.269> bottom<00:02:56.629> of<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.810> pool<00:02:57.049> and<00:02:58.209> dump

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
from the bottom of the pool and dump

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.140 
from the bottom of the pool and dump
that<00:02:59.359> on<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.659> house<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.200> then<00:03:00.560> I<00:03:00.590> can

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
that on the house and then I can

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.250 
that on the house and then I can
obviously<00:03:02.150> I<00:03:02.209> got<00:03:02.329> some<00:03:02.480> more<00:03:02.629> control<00:03:03.049> here

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
obviously I got some more control here

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.050 
obviously I got some more control here
so<00:03:03.290> I'm<00:03:03.500> pulling<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.220> want<00:03:04.579> to<00:03:04.639> pull<00:03:04.760> any<00:03:04.909> of<00:03:04.970> the

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
so I'm pulling I want to pull any of the

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.399 
so I'm pulling I want to pull any of the
water<00:03:05.209> from<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.510> top<00:03:05.780> of<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.019> pool<00:03:06.139> I'm<00:03:06.260> going

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
water from the top of the pool I'm going

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.470 
water from the top of the pool I'm going
to<00:03:06.470> pull<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.620> all<00:03:06.889> from<00:03:07.129> the<00:03:07.280> drain<00:03:07.639> so<00:03:08.299> don't

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
to pull it all from the drain so don't

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.089 
to pull it all from the drain so don't
ever<00:03:08.659> suck<00:03:09.079> any<00:03:09.260> air<00:03:09.470> so<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:09.739> can<00:03:09.859> see<00:03:09.980> my

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
ever suck any air so you can see my

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.759 
ever suck any air so you can see my
drains<00:03:10.400> I<00:03:10.609> got<00:03:10.760> two<00:03:10.909> of<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.120> bottom<00:03:11.389> drains<00:03:11.769> in

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
drains I got two of the bottom drains in

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.550 
drains I got two of the bottom drains in
the<00:03:13.010> bottom<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.370> pool<00:03:13.549> and<00:03:14.409> again<00:03:15.409> just

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
the bottom of the pool and again just

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.589 
the bottom of the pool and again just
redid<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.099> liner<00:03:16.340> because<00:03:16.609> it<00:03:16.700> had<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:17.329> code

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
redid the liner because it had the code

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.420 
redid the liner because it had the code
now<00:03:17.810> is<00:03:17.959> can't<00:03:18.230> have<00:03:18.379> one<00:03:18.590> drain<00:03:18.889> get<00:03:19.129> out<00:03:19.250> too

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
now is can't have one drain get out too

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.479 
now is can't have one drain get out too
so<00:03:20.329> anyway<00:03:20.870> they<00:03:21.019> won't<00:03:21.170> clog<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:22.189> I<00:03:22.340> could

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
so anyway they won't clog and I could

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.159 
so anyway they won't clog and I could
take<00:03:22.699> all<00:03:22.879> this<00:03:23.000> water<00:03:23.269> and<00:03:23.389> dump<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:23.959> on<00:03:24.079> the

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169 
take all this water and dump it on the

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:27.099 
take all this water and dump it on the
house<00:03:24.519> I<00:03:25.519> don't<00:03:26.090> have<00:03:26.629> it<00:03:26.780> yet<00:03:26.810> but<00:03:27.019> I've

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
house I don't have it yet but I've

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.780 
house I don't have it yet but I've
ordered<00:03:27.410> some<00:03:27.440> extra<00:03:27.919> fire<00:03:28.129> hose<00:03:28.400> that<00:03:28.579> I<00:03:28.639> can

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
ordered some extra fire hose that I can

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.849 
ordered some extra fire hose that I can
add<00:03:28.970> on<00:03:29.000> this<00:03:29.329> and<00:03:29.690> my<00:03:30.169> goal<00:03:30.410> would<00:03:30.530> be<00:03:30.590> able<00:03:30.769> to

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
add on this and my goal would be able to

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.800 
add on this and my goal would be able to
be<00:03:31.220> able<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.400> walk<00:03:31.639> through<00:03:31.699> my<00:03:32.180> entire<00:03:32.480> house

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
be able to walk through my entire house

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.809 
be able to walk through my entire house
and<00:03:33.230> fight<00:03:33.470> a<00:03:33.500> fire<00:03:33.799> from<00:03:34.099> with<00:03:34.280> inside<00:03:34.669> the

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:34.819 
and fight a fire from with inside the

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.530 
and fight a fire from with inside the
house<00:03:35.109> if<00:03:36.109> I<00:03:36.379> had<00:03:36.560> to<00:03:36.799> or<00:03:37.190> fight<00:03:37.879> a<00:03:37.909> fire<00:03:38.180> from

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
house if I had to or fight a fire from

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.110 
house if I had to or fight a fire from
outside<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.139> house<00:03:39.319> so<00:03:39.680> maybe<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:40.730> fires<00:03:40.940> on

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
outside the house so maybe the fires on

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.210 
outside the house so maybe the fires on
the<00:03:41.150> other<00:03:41.329> side<00:03:41.599> and<00:03:41.989> now<00:03:42.260> you<00:03:42.290> have<00:03:42.530> to<00:03:42.650> go

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
the other side and now you have to go

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.860 
the other side and now you have to go
through<00:03:43.489> the<00:03:43.730> house<00:03:43.879> through<00:03:44.269> window<00:03:44.629> through

through the house through window through
doors<00:03:45.109> to<00:03:45.440> get<00:03:45.590> to<00:03:45.799> it<00:03:45.949> I'm<00:03:46.489> gonna<00:03:46.609> have<00:03:46.669> enough

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
doors to get to it I'm gonna have enough

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:48.640 
doors to get to it I'm gonna have enough
hose<00:03:47.120> to<00:03:47.359> reach<00:03:47.540> every<00:03:47.870> square<00:03:48.169> foot<00:03:48.229> of<00:03:48.500> the

unless you have a portable 220 pump so
and<00:04:11.629> I<00:04:11.810> think<00:04:12.109> what<00:04:12.260> am<00:04:12.349> i<00:04:12.440> doing

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
and I think what am i doing

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:18.240 
and I think what am i doing
it's<00:04:14.419> up<00:04:14.540> a<00:04:14.659> horse<00:04:14.900> and<00:04:15.079> a<00:04:15.139> half<00:04:15.319> so<00:04:15.590> I've<00:04:15.680> got

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.029 

it's<00:04:19.250> a<00:04:19.340> horse<00:04:19.579> and<00:04:19.760> a<00:04:19.789> half<00:04:20.000> pump<00:04:20.449> I<00:04:21.039> don't

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
it's a horse and a half pump I don't

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:24.670 
it's a horse and a half pump I don't
remember<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:23.020> plates<00:04:24.020> that<00:04:24.229> tell<00:04:24.440> me<00:04:24.560> the

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
remember the plates that tell me the

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.800 
remember the plates that tell me the
amperage<00:04:25.159> that<00:04:25.960> was<00:04:26.960> 14<00:04:27.320> amps

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.040 

anyway<00:04:31.810> max<00:04:32.500> am<00:04:32.830> 0-16<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.700> 16<00:04:34.150> amps<00:04:34.480> on<00:04:34.600> times

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050

anyway max am 0-16 the 16 amps on times
120<00:04:35.800> so<00:04:36.670> you<00:04:37.240> know<00:04:37.330> I'm<00:04:37.390> pushing<00:04:37.600> out<00:04:37.840> 1800

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
120 so you know I'm pushing out 1800

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
120 so you know I'm pushing out 1800
plus<00:04:38.910> watt<00:04:39.910> so<00:04:40.270> I<00:04:40.300> into<00:04:40.870> surge<00:04:41.410> I<00:04:41.650> need<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:41.890> 3000

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
plus watt so I into surge I need a 3000

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.930 
plus watt so I into surge I need a 3000
watt<00:04:42.790> generator<00:04:43.360> to<00:04:43.570> do<00:04:44.050> that<00:04:44.610> if<00:04:45.610> I<00:04:45.760> wasn't

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
watt generator to do that if I wasn't

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.000 
watt generator to do that if I wasn't
going<00:04:46.270> to<00:04:46.390> have<00:04:46.510> power<00:04:46.720> out<00:04:47.170> here<00:04:47.500> which<00:04:47.680> would

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
going to have power out here which would

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.640 
going to have power out here which would
probably<00:04:48.280> be<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.520> plant<00:04:48.850> so<00:04:49.510> right<00:04:50.470> now<00:04:50.620> I

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
probably be the plant so right now I

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.340 
probably be the plant so right now I
just<00:04:50.680> got<00:04:50.980> it<00:04:51.100> is<00:04:51.250> kind<00:04:51.550> of<00:04:51.610> wired<00:04:51.940> up

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
just got it is kind of wired up

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.870 
just got it is kind of wired up
temporarily<00:04:53.350> so<00:04:54.220> I'm<00:04:54.280> going<00:04:54.430> to<00:04:54.490> start<00:04:54.730> this

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
temporarily so I'm going to start this

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.300 
temporarily so I'm going to start this
thing<00:04:55.090> up<00:04:55.500> on<00:04:56.500> waste<00:04:57.540> this<00:04:58.540> is<00:04:58.600> off<00:04:59.310> slightly

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
thing up on waste this is off slightly

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.540 
thing up on waste this is off slightly
off<00:05:00.720> I'm<00:05:01.720> going<00:05:01.960> to<00:05:02.020> go<00:05:02.140> to<00:05:02.200> waste<00:05:02.470> and<00:05:02.800> pump

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
off I'm going to go to waste and pump

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.670 
off I'm going to go to waste and pump
some<00:05:03.610> water<00:05:05.460> so<00:05:06.460> if<00:05:06.520> there<00:05:06.640> was<00:05:06.760> a<00:05:06.790> fire<00:05:07.150> I

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
some water so if there was a fire I

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.000 
some water so if there was a fire I
would<00:05:08.680> turn<00:05:08.950> that<00:05:10.050> off<00:05:11.050> so<00:05:11.380> I'm<00:05:11.470> only<00:05:11.650> pulling

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
would turn that off so I'm only pulling

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.300 
would turn that off so I'm only pulling
water<00:05:12.280> from<00:05:12.460> my<00:05:12.730> bottom<00:05:13.090> drain<00:05:13.390> right<00:05:13.660> now

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
water from my bottom drain right now

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.350 
water from my bottom drain right now
I'm<00:05:15.790> pumping<00:05:16.210> water<00:05:16.360> to<00:05:16.570> waste

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.450 

start<00:05:19.990> pushing<00:05:20.289> some<00:05:20.470> water<00:05:20.680> out<00:05:20.889> to<00:05:20.919> my

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:33.340 

firefight<00:05:26.300> nozzle<00:05:26.810> here

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:39.380 

all<00:05:34.350> right<00:05:34.500> there<00:05:35.100> we<00:05:35.220> go<00:05:37.250> so<00:05:38.250> that's<00:05:39.120> pretty

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
all right there we go so that's pretty

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.060 
all right there we go so that's pretty
good<00:05:39.570> flow<00:05:39.840> it's<00:05:40.200> a<00:05:40.320> lot<00:05:40.470> faster<00:05:40.860> than<00:05:40.920> I<00:05:41.010> can

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
good flow it's a lot faster than I can

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.610 
good flow it's a lot faster than I can
carry<00:05:41.400> water<00:05:41.670> so<00:05:42.540> we<00:05:42.600> got<00:05:42.720> a<00:05:42.750> full<00:05:42.930> hose<00:05:43.200> here

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620
