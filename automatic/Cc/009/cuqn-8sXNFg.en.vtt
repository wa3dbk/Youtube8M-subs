00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:07.700
 Reforms made without supervision can cause damage to the structure of buildings, monitoring 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.090
 of architects and engineers is important to avoid scares like that of SÃ£o Paulo, 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.670
 and even tragedies like in Rio de Janeiro. 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.929
 The carpet of the suite gave way to the gravel, in the living room instead of furniture, 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:28.460
 building material, the break-break in the apartment added to the weight of cement, 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.050
 bricks and tiles results in a series of risks. 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.800
 The task of reforming is not easy, and the work can not be done in uncompromising ways, 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.680
 however small. 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.050
 The cleaner himself, the guy who does maintenance in the building, or, 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.300
 caretaker of the building, you can find a way. 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.140
 The last one they told me, the "way", the person was to make a modification in the hydraulics 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.140
 and unintentionally connected the cold water in the promised gas and water came out by the whole promises 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.050
 of building. 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:06.050
 The door no longer exists, the wall that was here ... It disappeared, and here that there was no wall, 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.299
 a gypsum board structure has been laid, this put-and-take game may seem simple 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.759
 but requires the accompaniment of specialized people. 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.170
 To avoid any structural damage, Fernanda decided to follow all the rules of responsibility, 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.369
 when renovating the apartment. 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:32.049
 I hired an architecture office to do the project, and a construction office 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.530
 civil engineer, where he has a responsible engineer to do the execution. 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.549
 It is law, in addition to notifying the condominium, the owner of the apartment needs the supervision of a 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.520
 architect or an engineer. 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.259
 We try to observe first the structure of the building so that people, in 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.880
 any proposed changes, in no way interfere with the structure of the building. It's basic 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.179
 it is fundamental. 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.929
 To avoid reforms when moving to an apartment, the builders created 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:04.499
 flexible, here is a white board, where the buyer can assemble the house as well 

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:05.409
 want. 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.759
 While in the last century, everyone tried to follow the tribes, to be equal, to be equal to all 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.989
 world, I think everyone today seeks to exercise their own identity. 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.629
 The designer Liliana decided to embrace the proposal 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:24.629
 Oh, I do not like it, I would not want a wall. You put glasses, canvases ... It's fantastic.
