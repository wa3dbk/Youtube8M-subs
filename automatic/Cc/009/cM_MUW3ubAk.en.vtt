00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.879
 about marvel aa marvel comics

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.559
 in comics 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.270
 marvel is one of the publishers of the genre of 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.100

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.129
 others 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.320
 marvel was founded in 1939 by martin 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.180
 gourmet on the name of team lag comics 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.039
 which would later become the atlas 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.960
 comics and more forward would only be 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.240
 the marvel as we know it well in 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.320
 beginning the publications at the time was still 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.880
 quiet economics 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.830
 Marquinhos Gomes decided to hire the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.750
 danger of his wife helper class of 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.760
 office for him this guy is nobody 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.110
 nobody but him is watching the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.240
 glorious is clean 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.490
 contrary to the well-established scheme 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.680
 from the rival comic books presented with 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.970
 insurmountable heroes are 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.280
 decided to create more 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.320
 humanized and complex problems and 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.299
 spider man 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.159
 incredible hulk iron man quartet 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.150
 fantastic captain america and still 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.729
 many others 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.960
 there as if it were not enough that the 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.060
 he joined the list of the ten 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.750
 most influential celebrities in the world 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.490
 nineth place 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.530
 because the market for 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.909
 marvel cinema is very popular and 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.570
 besides its creator of most of the 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.590
 characters 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.710
 with that he made small appearances 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.329
 in the movies so you have an idea and 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.890
 has also participated in more than 20 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.390
 films of superheroes and the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.049
 majority of them were a great success 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.930
 box office 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.500
 is the old man being able to and by 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.640
 movie theater 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.860
 You know the universe. 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.090
 I'll bet that only 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.770
 to hear this word of cinema in the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.460
 Marvel you think of movies like 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.460
 Spectacular Spiderman 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:22.390
 the idea is that amid the strong march 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:41.510
 wake up from the fantastic aa but it's not 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.570
 none of this 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.190
 In the middle of 2006, the 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.080
 brand had sold most of the 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.450
 rights of its millions to other 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.850
 the Spiderman companies had the 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.140
 sony and the ex nor with the fox but they 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.180
 still held the rights of some 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.800
 they decided to produce their own 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.480
 movies independently 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.310
 distributed by paramount to marvel 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.190
 began in 2008 with the movie Man of 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.140
 which raised 585 million euros 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.820
 dollars at the box office what put them 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.680
 on the film market quickly and 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.840
 then they saw movies like the incredible hulk 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.000
 thor captain america the first avenger 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.430
 and even an iron-proof sequence 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.410
 all set the stage for 2012 with 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.690
 the launch of the avengers 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.460
 the film was such a huge success 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.310
 which reached the third highest grossing 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.350
 of the cinema of history a billion and 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.060
 five hundred million dollars in profit 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.750
 getting behind only titanic and 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.430
 avatar 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.550
 adding all the marvel films that 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.250
 currently there are eight they profited 5 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.900
 billions of dollars in box office 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.420
 which places the marvel franchise on the 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.940
 cinema as the third largest in the world and 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.620
 surpassed only by harry potter in 007 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.750
 You know you deny jumps of joy. 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.570
 by the brand's success in the market 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.760
 to disney to so friends where to 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.580
 company bought marvel in 2009 by 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.840
 $ 4 billion worth of 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.460
 money and stocks 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.380
 what guarantees us is a value 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.240
 extremely fair because most 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.640
 of them developed much more profit from 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.780
 that this in your movies comics games 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.700
 etc 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.170
 It is also worth remembering that Disney is the 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.840
 largest conglomerate of media and 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:15.050
 planet earth entertainment then 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.880
 nor do they have as much money as in 2012 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.859
 they bought 100% of the shares of 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.660
 lucasfilm company responsible for 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.720
 gigantic franchise star wars 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.310
 again there are 4 billion 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.690
 dollars for the purchase they are already 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.270
 producing a seventh film franchise 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.830
 star wars is time so we talk about 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.900
 some curiosities of the marvel that 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.330
 maybe you do not know 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.830
 I think I know I'm never going to own it. 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.600
 of the word zombie 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.550
 after the tale of the zombie was published 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.350
 in 1973 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.360
 the marvel records the word gloomy for 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.040
 use in their comics in the future 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.420
 would change the domain to marvel mockery 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.330
 because the zombies were becoming 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:53.090
 very popular in all corners once 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.700
 the marvel dvd is great joins two great 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.680
 characters in one place, one of them was 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.920
 the demon the phantom biker while 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.270
 the other was the ghost comrade 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.640
 exactly the marvel wanted to join the 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.540
 ghost biker with the gasparzinho in 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.460
 one of his stories 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.400
 Can you imagine what a 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.120
 story of these serene even bezel here 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.390
 go another 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.100
 Originally the Hulk was not green of 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.320
 The first monstrengo comic was 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.670
 but there were problems at the time of 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.470
 because the machines do not 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.060
 50 shades of gray and 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.280
 consistency to solve the problem 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.690
 they changed to green and today 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.150
 that's how we met the giant 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.980
 emerald and last but certainly 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.770
 This is going to surprise you the most. 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.140
 did you know that in the 1990s the 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.000
 marvel was almost bought does not operate in 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.160
 grace to know for whom at the end of the years 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.220
 90 marvel was almost bought by 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.780
 michael jackson is my friends the king of 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.910
 pop had already met with him 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.290
 several times and even visited the marvel 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.040
 to assess whether it is worth the 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.510
 investment 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.970
 we all know that michael was a 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.490
 little megalomaniac but I think I went 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.780
 a little too far to find out that 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:58.130
 He wanted to buy the company. 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.210
 he dreamed of interpreting the man 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.370
 spider in a movie that he himself 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.970
 I would wonder what it would be like 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:17.810
 the michael jackson of old man spider 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:20.450
 and half livestock and in the program episodes 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.250
 seven minutes the galley has come to an end 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.330
 after just four months 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.160
 launch this series 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.660
 I decided to go back with her here in 2014. 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.520
 for his second season a little 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.680
 modified I think that 's how it went well 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.870
 It's better then what do you think about this new one? 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.730
