actually<00:00:20.880> it's<00:00:20.970> closer<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.300> 10<00:00:21.630> because<00:00:21.930> she

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
actually it's closer to 10 because she

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.859

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
infantry base and I think it's clever I

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.370 
infantry base and I think it's clever I
never<00:03:49.220> I<00:03:49.310> never<00:03:49.519> would<00:03:50.180> have<00:03:50.209> thought<00:03:50.299> of<00:03:50.780> the

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
never I never would have thought of the

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.819 
never I never would have thought of the
little<00:03:51.650> adapter<00:03:52.130> um<00:03:52.959> cuz<00:03:53.959> it<00:03:54.109> is<00:03:54.200> like<00:03:54.530> you<00:03:54.560> can

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
little adapter um cuz it is like you can

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.370 
little adapter um cuz it is like you can
use<00:03:54.950> a<00:03:54.980> space<00:03:55.400> for<00:03:55.760> Brendan<00:03:56.690> yeah<00:03:57.139> absolutely

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
use a space for Brendan yeah absolutely

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.500

so<00:05:29.919> dragons<00:05:30.460> for<00:05:31.000> both<00:05:31.120> of<00:05:31.300> them<00:05:31.419> had<00:05:31.600> one

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
so dragons for both of them had one

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.840 
so dragons for both of them had one
going<00:05:32.290> forward<00:05:32.650> one<00:05:32.860> going<00:05:33.190> back<00:05:33.460> and<00:05:33.729> it's

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
going forward one going back and it's

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.890 
going forward one going back and it's
like<00:05:34.090> melee<00:05:34.810> bite<00:05:35.110> melee<00:05:35.740> tail<00:05:36.040> yeah<00:05:36.850> here<00:05:37.630> he

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:45.640 
like she's both great the end there

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.250 
like she's both great the end there
before<00:05:46.000> word<00:05:46.150> and<00:05:46.360> so<00:05:46.510> the<00:05:46.600> arc<00:05:46.780> reflects<00:05:47.169> that

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
before word and so the arc reflects that

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.969 
before word and so the arc reflects that
just<00:05:48.190> to<00:05:48.310> compare<00:05:48.580> this<00:05:48.790> is<00:05:48.970> the<00:05:49.090> dragon<00:05:49.720> arc

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
just to compare this is the dragon arc

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:53.520 
just to compare this is the dragon arc
um<00:05:51.210> forward<00:05:52.210> and<00:05:52.330> back<00:05:52.479> we<00:05:53.020> can<00:05:53.169> see<00:05:53.380> that

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
um forward and back we can see that

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.860 
um forward and back we can see that
they're<00:05:53.830> very<00:05:53.860> easily<00:05:54.340> um<00:05:54.820> where<00:05:55.600> is<00:05:55.630> this

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
they're very easily um where is this

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.190 
they're very easily um where is this
this<00:05:56.460> arc<00:05:57.460> is<00:05:57.610> purely<00:05:58.000> forward<00:05:58.450> and<00:05:58.810> it's<00:05:59.050> cool

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
this arc is purely forward and it's cool

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.380 
this arc is purely forward and it's cool
like<00:05:59.229> that<00:05:59.410> I<00:05:59.650> know<00:05:59.950> I<00:06:00.220> really<00:06:01.060> like<00:06:01.240> these

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
like that I know I really like these

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.260 
like that I know I really like these
huge<00:06:01.810> basis<00:06:02.200> um<00:06:02.560> I'm<00:06:03.310> looking<00:06:03.460> towards<00:06:03.940> it<00:06:04.090> to

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
huge basis um I'm looking towards it to

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.600 
huge basis um I'm looking towards it to
trying<00:06:04.539> when<00:06:04.690> these<00:06:04.870> I<00:06:04.930> promise<00:06:05.320> he's<00:06:05.979> only<00:06:06.190> 35

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
trying when these I promise he's only 35

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.540 
trying when these I promise he's only 35
points<00:06:06.910> just<00:06:07.120> to<00:06:07.320> to<00:06:08.320> kind<00:06:08.919> of<00:06:09.100> match<00:06:09.250> on<00:06:09.430> the

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
points just to to kind of match on the

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.800 
points just to to kind of match on the
part<00:06:09.760> of<00:06:09.820> the<00:06:09.970> Dragon<00:06:10.360> and<00:06:10.450> I<00:06:10.570> like<00:06:10.780> that

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
part of the Dragon and I like that

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.510 
part of the Dragon and I like that
because<00:06:11.200> even<00:06:11.560> real<00:06:11.740> there<00:06:12.039> is<00:06:12.160> like<00:06:12.400> the

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
because even real there is like the

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.810
