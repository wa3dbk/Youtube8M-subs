he's<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> little<00:00:43.770> bit<00:00:43.860> out<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.100> his<00:00:44.220> element

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
he's a little bit out of his element

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.460 
he's a little bit out of his element
throughout<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.330> whole<00:00:45.480> movie<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.140> that's

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
throughout the whole movie and that's

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.689 
throughout the whole movie and that's
what<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.770> think<00:00:47.070> makes<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.430> bit<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:47.699 
what I think makes it a bit of a

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.070 
what I think makes it a bit of a
departure<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.330> it<00:00:48.390> brings<00:00:48.540> it<00:00:48.750> back<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:49.050> a

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
departure and it brings it back to a

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.760 
departure and it brings it back to a
nice<00:00:49.260> grounded<00:00:49.769> place<00:00:50.010> after<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> Avengers
