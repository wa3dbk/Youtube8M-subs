approaches and really the biggest

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.350

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
difference is that for an ILS you select

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.780 
difference is that for an ILS you select
a<00:00:39.480> frequency<00:00:39.719> wear<00:00:40.680> with<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> GPS<00:00:41.460> based

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
approach in your GPS receiver and then

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.770 
approach in your GPS receiver and then
fly<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:46.770> an<00:00:46.890> ILS<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:48.120> ultra<00:00:48.450> pilot

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
fly it just like an ILS the ultra pilot

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.680 
fly it just like an ILS the ultra pilot
will<00:00:48.870> also<00:00:49.230> fly<00:00:49.440> just<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:49.920> an<00:00:50.070> ILS<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:51.390> finer

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690
