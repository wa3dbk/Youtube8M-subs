process<00:02:45.989> this<00:02:46.169> gently<00:02:46.530> for<00:02:46.799> a<00:02:46.859> moment

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.620 

okay<00:03:27.980> now<00:03:28.190> this<00:03:28.430> is<00:03:28.490> blends<00:03:29.060> it<00:03:29.180> pretty<00:03:29.420> well

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
okay now this is blends it pretty well

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.809 
okay now this is blends it pretty well
the<00:03:30.170> idea<00:03:30.560> is<00:03:30.620> to<00:03:30.800> do<00:03:30.920> it<00:03:31.069> long<00:03:31.250> enough<00:03:31.430> so<00:03:31.790> that

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
the idea is to do it long enough so that

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.780 
the idea is to do it long enough so that
the<00:03:32.330> coconut<00:03:32.989> butter<00:03:33.200> doesn't<00:03:33.709> get<00:03:34.370> all<00:03:34.489> hard

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
the coconut butter doesn't get all hard

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.220 
the coconut butter doesn't get all hard
and<00:03:34.970> clumping<00:03:35.450> you<00:03:35.600> want<00:03:35.780> it<00:03:35.900> well

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
and clumping you want it well

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.570 
and clumping you want it well
