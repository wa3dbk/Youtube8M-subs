to use a cone like a lot of people like
to<00:02:40.010> use<00:02:40.070> the<00:02:40.370> reason<00:02:40.670> being<00:02:40.790> is<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:41.240> allows<00:02:41.720> too

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
to use the reason being is it allows too

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.630 
to use the reason being is it allows too
much<00:02:42.140> movement<00:02:42.440> and<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:43.130> numbers<00:02:43.430> might<00:02:43.610> be

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
much movement and the numbers might be
