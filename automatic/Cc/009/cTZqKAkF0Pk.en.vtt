00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.419
 troyes series here I am going to get there 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.529
 simply because this 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.089
 during the whites there were only three 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.739
 other weapons is not much so there 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.119
 I will present the series of 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.759
 stories of black and white series 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.050
 emerging power and noble victory 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.910
 here are three black and white series 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.560
 first three you do not have much 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.580
 a lot of ultra rare they are very 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.830
 beautiful but did not have much so I 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.860
 wanted to introduce now 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.090
 so we find reshiram pool art and 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.020
 try the crom scarf 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:51.620
 So that I will showing 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:53.750
 together so here is sealed that gist 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.310
 no nonsense yeah yeah that's the 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.170
 first crossroads where we exist and 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.190
 so is not the first to aix or 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.950
 their complexion is well scarves all 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.410
 simple that have existed and its very pretty 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:08.360
 therefore 113 114 and 114 74 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:12.320
 I have a preference for late 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.490
 think about saying it myself I 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.350
 do not know but frankly there I do not know 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.300
 I decide that sometimes there there clearly 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.840
 that it does that to me maybe both 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.909
 are really very beautiful me I do not know 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.190
 I can not say in this series 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.150
 there is a secret the pikachu so that's 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.890
 the one I found in flea markets 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:35.150
 here's 9 20 cents here it is 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.290
 bargain secret pikachu pokemon ya 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.650
 that the pokemon that is brilliant is 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.780
 super very pretty a bit like pokemon 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.710
 delta species how shine a 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.340
 not play but not of the type 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:51.030
 so here we go 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.100
 then emerging power we'll go 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.909
 three hours for the money it's the same 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.479
 thing there are only two ultras who are 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.469
 dazzling and edge and at this game there by 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.299
 against it's simple I have a preference 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.729
 for dazzling by already because I 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.590
 is prettier already this is the first 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.970
 reason and especially because the jobs 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.730
 day of it makes me think like 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.739
 of hab to a reference of mangas like 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.099
 usually with reference to the balls that 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.810
 hold holds hospitals and a little bit of everything 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.959
 what looks like oreco from cÃ©line in 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.099
 naruto and well it makes me think of it 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.989
 shot there were channels and if the 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.370
 chain so does the two little geniuses 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.709
 it's too bad they should have done 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.730
 of the farms in late 2013 could have 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.489
 to make three masters of the metaireau 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.860
 now they were stingy so 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.239
 then nine wins and a little bit 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.280
 more of the very good it's not even that 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.450
 we have the old man I 'll get off 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:50.090
 because in the end and not need 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:50.090
 of so much space that it attacks force 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.989
 we will find the vittini so I 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.700
 prefer to tell you now it's my 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.980
 favorite card two of the three series 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.299
 present 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.430
 it is too beautiful the colors are 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:03.690
 gorgeous he is in position for a 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.859
 times of viti is a little naughty I like 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.389
 well yes the pikachu time a little bit simple 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.970
 is the map is very pretty but the 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:14.959
 posture is a bit simple what I 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.730
 would like to largely victimize 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.799
 then the terrarium I had on 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.609
 my channel at my beginnings 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:26.250
 please do not go to see my 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:28.830
 videos from the beginning because it was not this 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:34.150
 what are the bins 1 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:36.640
 then cobalt m rather nice it 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.440
 rests on it's still so the 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.360
 old man terrarium copad young for 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.040
 complete the trio and there is more to 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.860
 show you this map n so the 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.020
 trainer and that's the first trainer 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.610
 crowd art that existed effect it took 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.220
 wait a long time for 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.180
 have other scarf trainers 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:58.000
 but she is the first who existed 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:59.200
 and at 101,105 he's pretty cool so 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.040
 here and in this series we find 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.360

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.800

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.800
 to the cover she is disgusting 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.340
 a better still 800 pouch we go 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.720
 much better 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.800
 that's a bit like the pikachu was going through 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.799
 not even a little bit like it 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.390
 pikachu the holographic effects 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.370

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.210
