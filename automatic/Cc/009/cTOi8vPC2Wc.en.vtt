detailed sonic figures i've ever seen
ever<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.820> my<00:00:54.780> entire<00:00:54.809> life<00:00:55.320> ever<00:00:56.250> seen<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:56.910> ad

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
that's weird I mean this was a good

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.410 
that's weird I mean this was a good
start<00:01:01.890> when<00:01:02.070> jazz<00:01:02.370> worse<00:01:02.609> was<00:01:02.820> making<00:01:03.210> their

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
start when jazz worse was making their

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.719 
start when jazz worse was making their
sonic<00:01:03.629> figures<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.110> mean<00:01:04.430> there's<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.580> much

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
sonic figures I mean there's so much

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.560 
sonic figures I mean there's so much
detail<00:01:06.090> inocula<00:01:07.549> articulation<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.450> know

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
detail inocula articulation and you know

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.590 
detail inocula articulation and you know
for<00:01:10.350> detail<00:01:10.850> he<00:01:11.850> gets<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:14.180> guess<00:01:15.180> I'm<00:01:15.360> going<00:01:15.450> to

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
for detail he gets a guess I'm going to

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.359 
for detail he gets a guess I'm going to
say<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.780> 10<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.229> detail<00:01:16.860> because<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.130> haven't

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
say a 10 on detail because I haven't

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.179 
say a 10 on detail because I haven't
really<00:01:17.610> seen<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.320> better<00:01:19.320> where<00:01:19.619> honk<00:01:19.860> figure

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
really seen a better where honk figure

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.260 
really seen a better where honk figure
than<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.549> um<00:01:21.950> yeah<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.340> know<00:01:23.369> they<00:01:23.670> put<00:01:23.880> you

straight<00:01:35.100> out<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.310> Sonic<00:01:35.729> Unleashed<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.509> know

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
straight out of Sonic Unleashed you know

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.990 
straight out of Sonic Unleashed you know
for<00:01:37.560> articulation<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.460> know<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.729> can<00:01:38.820> move

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
for articulation you know it can move

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.889 
for articulation you know it can move
his<00:01:39.210> head<00:01:39.560> it's<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.770> much<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.159> super<00:01:41.520> poser

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
his head it's so much of a super poser

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.109 
his head it's so much of a super poser
it's<00:01:42.899> very<00:01:43.259> similar<00:01:43.590> because<00:01:43.920> well<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.909> can't

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
it's very similar because well you can't

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.460 
it's very similar because well you can't
move<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.390> here's<00:01:45.630> but<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.899> can<00:01:46.049> move<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
move is here's but you can move the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:56.959 
move is here's but you can move the
quills<00:01:47.210> you<00:01:48.210> know<00:01:50.630> it's<00:01:51.630> really<00:01:51.899> good<00:01:52.579> um<00:01:55.969> so

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
quills you know it's really good um so

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.760 
quills you know it's really good um so
can<00:01:57.180> delay<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.960> know<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.350> legs<00:02:00.439> one<00:02:01.439> problem

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
can delay you know the legs one problem

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.859 
can delay you know the legs one problem
if<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.189> figure<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.880> can't<00:02:03.149> really<00:02:03.390> move

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
if this figure is you can't really move

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.280 
if this figure is you can't really move
you<00:02:04.259> can't<00:02:04.560> really<00:02:04.740> make<00:02:05.159> it<00:02:05.219> walk<00:02:05.759> cuz<00:02:06.329> it's

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
you can't really make it walk cuz it's

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.100 
you can't really make it walk cuz it's
like<00:02:07.469> really<00:02:07.740> hard<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.190> do<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.599> if<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.869> make

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
like really hard to do and if you make

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.780 
like really hard to do and if you make
them<00:02:10.229> walking<00:02:10.470> kind<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:10.950> looks<00:02:11.099> retarded<00:02:11.250> uh

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
them walking kind of looks retarded uh

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.250 
them walking kind of looks retarded uh
uh<00:02:12.050> yeah

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
uh yeah

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.899 
uh yeah
you<00:02:13.290> can<00:02:13.439> move<00:02:13.590> his<00:02:13.739> arms<00:02:14.989> full<00:02:16.400> 360<00:02:17.400> degrees

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
you can move his arms full 360 degrees

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:22.580 
you can move his arms full 360 degrees
I'm<00:02:18.510> guessing<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.739> can<00:02:19.920> move<00:02:20.129> his<00:02:21.140> elbows<00:02:22.140> and

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
I'm guessing you can move his elbows and

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.819 
I'm guessing you can move his elbows and
like<00:02:22.819> smash<00:02:23.819> stuff<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.659> can<00:02:24.810> actually<00:02:24.930> what's

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829
