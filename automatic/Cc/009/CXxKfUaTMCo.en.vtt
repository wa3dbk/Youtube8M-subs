this is an update on the great little

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.530 
this is an update on the great little
aquaponic<00:00:09.840> system<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:11.010> system<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:12.090> very

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
aquaponic system the system is a very

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.950 
aquaponic system the system is a very
simple<00:00:13.049> 2<00:00:13.559> barrel<00:00:14.549> system<00:00:14.790> one<00:00:15.269> barrel<00:00:15.599> cut<00:00:15.809> in

simple 2 barrel system one barrel cut in

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.859 
simple 2 barrel system one barrel cut in
half<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.379> create<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:17.070> grow<00:00:17.940> beds<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.600> another

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869

barrel up above cut differently to

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.320 
barrel up above cut differently to

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
create a flood drain cycle in this

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.950 
create a flood drain cycle in this
system<00:00:25.519> everything<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.849> see<00:00:27.060> growing<00:00:27.330> is

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
system everything you see growing is

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.780 
system everything you see growing is
being<00:00:28.439> fed<00:00:28.830> by<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.750> 11<00:00:30.750> koi<00:00:31.560> fish<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
being fed by the 11 koi fish in the

lower tank including that huge marigold

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.600 
lower tank including that huge marigold
which<00:00:38.940> has<00:00:39.290> we've<00:00:40.290> contemplated<00:00:40.680> tearing<00:00:41.460> out

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
which has we've contemplated tearing out

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.310 
which has we've contemplated tearing out
but<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.059> just<00:00:42.239> keeps<00:00:42.450> on<00:00:42.719> creating<00:00:43.290> great

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
but it just keeps on creating great

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.270 
but it just keeps on creating great
flowers<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:45.149> still<00:00:45.510> here<00:00:45.950> we're<00:00:46.950> into

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
flowers so it's still here we're into

day to do filming but what's interesting
is<00:00:57.840> how<00:00:58.050> well<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.770> system<00:00:58.829> is<00:00:59.430> doing<00:01:01.370> I<00:01:02.370> don't

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
is how well this system is doing I don't

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.820 
is how well this system is doing I don't
know<00:01:02.820> if<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.359> see<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.899> fish<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.350> here<00:01:04.650> or

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
know if we can see the fish in here or

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.850 
know if we can see the fish in here or
not

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.840

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
here's the napa cabbage all nice and big

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.730 
here's the napa cabbage all nice and big
and<00:01:34.800> full<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.840> some<00:01:36.840> kale<00:01:37.280> back<00:01:38.280> there<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.910> a

broccoli<00:01:40.740> head<00:01:41.070> starting<00:01:42.830> there<00:01:43.830> are<00:01:44.130> some

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
broccoli head starting there are some

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.570 
broccoli head starting there are some
deep<00:01:45.410> and<00:01:46.410> the<00:01:47.340> onions<00:01:47.820> are<00:01:49.070> getting<00:01:50.070> really

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
deep and the onions are getting really

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.440 
deep and the onions are getting really
huge<00:01:50.970> here<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:51.900> is<00:01:52.430> as<00:01:53.430> large<00:01:53.670> as<00:01:53.910> my<00:01:54.150> thumb

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
huge here this is as large as my thumb

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.840 
huge here this is as large as my thumb
and<00:01:55.250> they'll<00:01:56.250> get<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.490> lot<00:01:56.700> larger<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:59.310> here's

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
and they'll get a lot larger and here's

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.100 
and they'll get a lot larger and here's
a<00:01:59.910> nice<00:02:00.180> head<00:02:01.050> of<00:02:02.960> cauliflower<00:02:05.810> along<00:02:06.810> with

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
a nice head of cauliflower along with

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.050 
a nice head of cauliflower along with
some<00:02:07.350> beets

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.570 

more<00:02:10.660> beats<00:02:10.899> over<00:02:11.260> there<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:13.360> system<00:02:13.840> is

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
more beats over there so the system is

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.490 
more beats over there so the system is
doing<00:02:15.580> great<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.300> it's<00:02:16.450> actually<00:02:17.080> growing

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
doing great and it's actually growing

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.870 
doing great and it's actually growing
the<00:02:18.420> plants<00:02:19.420> better<00:02:19.840> than<00:02:20.320> our<00:02:20.740> larger<00:02:21.550> new

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
the plants better than our larger new

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.300 
the plants better than our larger new
system<00:02:22.480> which<00:02:23.020> is<00:02:23.050> not<00:02:23.410> surprising<00:02:24.160> because

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
system which is not surprising because

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.870 
system which is not surprising because
this<00:02:24.820> is<00:02:25.060> a<00:02:25.330> couple<00:02:25.870> year<00:02:26.080> old<00:02:26.880> aquaponic

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
this is a couple year old aquaponic

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.100 
this is a couple year old aquaponic
system<00:02:28.270> so<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.810> has<00:02:29.250> acquired<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.640> lot<00:02:30.820> of

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
system so it has acquired a lot of

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.160 
system so it has acquired a lot of
bacteria<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.200> microbes<00:02:32.709> that<00:02:33.160> are<00:02:34.170> helping

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
bacteria and microbes that are helping

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.340 
bacteria and microbes that are helping
it<00:02:35.320> perform<00:02:35.709> better<00:02:36.270> so<00:02:37.270> there's<00:02:37.540> an<00:02:37.959> update

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
it perform better so there's an update

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.170 
it perform better so there's an update
and<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:38.890> think<00:02:39.340> we<00:02:39.580> are<00:02:39.610> about<00:02:40.620> two<00:02:41.620> months

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
and I think we are about two months

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.630 
and I think we are about two months
after<00:02:43.290> planting<00:02:44.290> but<00:02:44.560> we've<00:02:44.709> had<00:02:44.920> about<00:02:45.220> three

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
after planting but we've had about three

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.780 
after planting but we've had about three
weeks<00:02:45.850> of<00:02:46.090> really<00:02:46.420> cold<00:02:46.980> sunless<00:02:47.980> weather<00:02:48.310> so

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
weeks of really cold sunless weather so

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.420 
weeks of really cold sunless weather so
it's<00:02:49.600> pretty<00:02:49.750> amazing<00:02:50.020> that<00:02:50.530> this<00:02:50.920> is<00:02:51.100> doing

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
it's pretty amazing that this is doing

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.300 
it's pretty amazing that this is doing
this<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:51.910> it's<00:02:52.120> even<00:02:52.660> more<00:02:52.840> amazing<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:53.530> the
