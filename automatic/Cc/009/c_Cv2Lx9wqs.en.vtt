overclock a nun o'clock if you are

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.420 
overclock a nun o'clock if you are
routed<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.380> reason<00:01:10.740> why<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:10.979> want<00:01:11.340> to

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
overclock a nun o'clock is that if you

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.830 
overclock a nun o'clock is that if you
overclock<00:01:14.189> your<00:01:14.310> device<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.119> will<00:01:15.390> make<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
overclock your device and will make it a

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.319 
overclock your device and will make it a
little<00:01:15.990> bit<00:01:16.140> faster<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:17.100> also<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:18.090> set

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
little bit faster and also you can set

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:21.010 
little bit faster and also you can set
it<00:01:18.360> for<00:01:18.720> on-demand<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.710> when<00:01:20.009> you're<00:01:20.130> using<00:01:20.340> it

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
it for on-demand so when you're using it

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.960 
it for on-demand so when you're using it
for<00:01:22.020> certain<00:01:22.470> applications<00:01:22.700> it<00:01:23.700> will<00:01:23.850> be

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
for certain applications it will be

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.910 
for certain applications it will be
really<00:01:24.240> fast<00:01:24.600> but<00:01:24.810> we're<00:01:24.960> not<00:01:25.200> using<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.770> it

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
really fast but we're not using it it

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.190 
really fast but we're not using it it
would<00:01:26.220> under<00:01:27.030> clock<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.810> save<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> lot

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
would under clock so we can save a lot

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.899 
would under clock so we can save a lot
of<00:01:28.259> battery<00:01:28.530> as<00:01:28.829> well<00:01:29.720> so<00:01:30.720> once<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.320> purchase

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
all the way up to 1.6 but i will get

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.940 
all the way up to 1.6 but i will get
overheating<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.000> also<00:01:45.689> my<00:01:46.229> battery<00:01:46.560> will<00:01:46.740> die
