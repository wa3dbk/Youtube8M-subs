blue marks that are on the back this is

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.300 
blue marks that are on the back this is
actually<00:01:46.020> where<00:01:46.170> it's<00:01:46.409> reacted<00:01:46.950> with<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
actually where it's reacted with the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.520 
actually where it's reacted with the
official<00:01:47.759> apple<00:01:47.970> case<00:01:48.329> now<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.049> did<00:01:49.439> actually

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
official apple case now I did actually

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.950 
official apple case now I did actually
put<00:01:49.920> like<00:01:50.310> just<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.670> test<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.060> did<00:01:51.329> put<00:01:51.450> my<00:01:51.570> iPad

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
put like just a test I did put my iPad

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.109 
put like just a test I did put my iPad
with<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.380> wraps<00:01:52.560> or<00:01:52.770> skin<00:01:53.009> on<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.490> could<00:01:54.000> just

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
with the wraps or skin on I could just

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.639 
with the wraps or skin on I could just
slide<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.479> into<00:01:54.600> my<00:01:54.750> apple<00:01:55.049> case<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.409> couple

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
slide it into my apple case for a couple

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.649 
slide it into my apple case for a couple
of<00:01:55.680> days<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.159> when<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.850> took<00:01:56.939> out<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.509> have

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
of days and when I took out and have

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.660 
of days and when I took out and have
this<00:01:57.780> horrible<00:01:58.020> horrible<00:01:58.619> blue<00:01:59.009> marks<00:01:59.490> all

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
this horrible horrible blue marks all

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.420 
this horrible horrible blue marks all
over<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.270> side<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:01.320> iPad<00:02:01.680> as<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.130> can<00:02:02.250> see

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
over the side of the iPad as you can see

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.060 
over the side of the iPad as you can see
here<00:02:02.869> now<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:03.930> don't<00:02:04.290> need<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.469> worry<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.920> is

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
here now you don't need to worry this is

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.010 
here now you don't need to worry this is
only<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:05.549> rap<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:05.909> let's<00:02:06.090> not<00:02:06.180> G<00:02:06.390> on<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.689> iPad

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
only on rap so let's not G on the iPad

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.080 
only on rap so let's not G on the iPad
itself<00:02:07.380> however<00:02:08.099> there<00:02:08.429> is<00:02:08.550> no<00:02:08.580> way<00:02:08.940> of

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
itself however there is no way of

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.059 
itself however there is no way of
getting<00:02:09.239> these<00:02:09.390> marks<00:02:09.750> office<00:02:09.959> almost<00:02:10.770> a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
getting these marks office almost a

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.820 
getting these marks office almost a
reaction<00:02:11.640> with<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.150> apple<00:02:12.390> case

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
reaction with the apple case

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.700 
reaction with the apple case
which<00:02:13.430> is<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.760> very<00:02:14.330> big<00:02:14.570> downside<00:02:15.050> to<00:02:15.260> wraps<00:02:15.470> or

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
which is a very big downside to wraps or

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.900 
which is a very big downside to wraps or
perhaps<00:02:16.070> that's<00:02:16.370> something<00:02:16.460> they<00:02:16.730> could

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
perhaps that's something they could

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.690 
perhaps that's something they could
change<00:02:17.180> in<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.390> solution<00:02:18.220> however<00:02:19.220> really

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
change in the solution however really

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.550 
change in the solution however really
not<00:02:19.850> too<00:02:19.970> much<00:02:20.060> of<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.240> big<00:02:20.390> deal<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:21.350> Turner

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
not too much of a big deal so Turner

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.190 
not too much of a big deal so Turner
wraps<00:02:21.800> all<00:02:21.950> over<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.460> it<00:02:23.060> looks<00:02:23.270> perfect<00:02:23.480> on

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
wraps all over and it looks perfect on

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.250 
wraps all over and it looks perfect on
the<00:02:24.740> top<00:02:24.950> here<00:02:25.130> we<00:02:25.250> do<00:02:25.400> actually<00:02:25.580> have<00:02:25.820> some

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
the top here we do actually have some

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.290 
the top here we do actually have some
wraps<00:02:27.260> and<00:02:27.470> skins<00:02:27.740> which<00:02:28.040> which<00:02:28.370> can<00:02:28.550> be<00:02:28.700> used

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
wraps and skins which which can be used

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.360 
wraps and skins which which can be used
for<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.570> sides<00:02:29.840> so<00:02:30.530> more<00:02:30.830> less<00:02:30.950> all<00:02:31.160> of<00:02:31.310> the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
for the sides so more less all of the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.430 
for the sides so more less all of the

is again the reaction that does have

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.060 
is again the reaction that does have
with<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.270> apple<00:03:02.570> case<00:03:02.720> and<00:03:03.050> perhaps<00:03:03.590> improve

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
with the apple case and perhaps improve

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.250 
with the apple case and perhaps improve
the<00:03:04.280> durability<00:03:04.700> because<00:03:05.360> I<00:03:05.570> mean<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.020> skin

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
the durability because I mean the skin

the durability because I mean the skin
is<00:03:06.410> all<00:03:06.530> right<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:06.860> know<00:03:06.980> it's<00:03:07.190> starting<00:03:07.640> to

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
is all right you know it's starting to

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.330 
is all right you know it's starting to
fade<00:03:08.180> already<00:03:08.570> in<00:03:08.780> these<00:03:08.930> corners<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:09.620> I

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
fade already in these corners and I

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.710 
fade already in these corners and I
started<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:10.730> get<00:03:10.820> a<00:03:10.880> bit<00:03:10.970> stretched<00:03:11.300> I<00:03:11.480> banish

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
you go see out there it kind of overlaps

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.790 
you go see out there it kind of overlaps
corners<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.270> bit<00:03:14.450> it's<00:03:15.380> starting<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:15.770> look
