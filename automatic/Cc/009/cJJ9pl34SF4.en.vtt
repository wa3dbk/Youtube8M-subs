hi<00:00:00.539> guys<00:00:00.840> this<00:00:01.439> is<00:00:01.500> my<00:00:01.920> minecraft<00:00:02.280> redstone

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
hi guys this is my minecraft redstone

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.400 
hi guys this is my minecraft redstone
rocket<00:00:04.400> first<00:00:05.400> let's<00:00:06.120> look<00:00:06.480> at<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.810> engines

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
rocket first let's look at the engines

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.560 
rocket first let's look at the engines
there's<00:00:08.340> four<00:00:08.700> side<00:00:09.330> engines<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.830> one<00:00:11.190> big

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
there's four side engines and one big

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.799 
there's four side engines and one big

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
Rasta

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.829 
Rasta
there's<00:00:13.110> no<00:00:13.469> fuel<00:00:13.920> in<00:00:14.040> them<00:00:14.309> at<00:00:14.549> first<00:00:15.059> for

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
there's no fuel in them at first for

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.029 
there's no fuel in them at first for
safety<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:17.100> switch<00:00:17.480> injects<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:19.260> fuel<00:00:19.680> into

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
safety this switch injects the fuel into

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.290 
safety this switch injects the fuel into
the<00:00:20.369> engines

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
the engines

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:30.080 
the engines
this<00:00:21.930> makes<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.560> rocket<00:00:22.830> faster

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.450 

that<00:00:30.720> should<00:00:31.050> be<00:00:31.260> enough<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:32.270> let's<00:00:33.270> test<00:00:33.720> it

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
that should be enough you let's test it

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.210 
that should be enough you let's test it
it's<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.700> place<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:37.050> see<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.320> pure<00:00:37.680> pushing

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
it's the place can see the pure pushing

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:46.460 
it's the place can see the pure pushing
flange<00:00:38.900> and<00:00:39.900> now<00:00:40.199> the<00:00:40.260> big<00:00:40.620> engine<00:00:45.260> takes<00:00:46.260> a

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470 
flange and now the big engine takes a

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.299 
flange and now the big engine takes a
little<00:00:46.680> time<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.430> stop

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
little time to stop

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.270 
little time to stop
I've<00:00:50.309> removed<00:00:50.610> side<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.650> see<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
I've removed side so you can see the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.540 
I've removed side so you can see the
inside<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:55.260> whole<00:00:55.470> tank<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.250> full<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:57.059> you

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.090 

it<00:01:01.210> turns<00:01:01.570> down<00:01:01.840> through<00:01:02.140> the<00:01:02.350> hoppers<00:01:02.829> and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
it turns down through the hoppers and

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.380 
it turns down through the hoppers and
into<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.150> engine

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
into the engine

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.470 
into the engine
the<00:01:06.600> pistons<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.530> launch<00:01:07.800> pad<00:01:08.330> do<00:01:09.330> you

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
the pistons in the launch pad do you

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.580 
the pistons in the launch pad do you
retract

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.430 

you

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.840 

you

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.560 

these<00:01:21.450> are<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.869> onboard<00:01:22.409> computers<00:01:23.360> this<00:01:24.360> is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
these are the onboard computers this is

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.030 
these are the onboard computers this is
the<00:01:24.720> communication<00:01:25.380> device<00:01:27.290> so<00:01:28.290> let's<00:01:28.650> try<00:01:29.009> a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the communication device so let's try a

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.530 
the communication device so let's try a
test<00:01:29.460> from<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> ground<00:01:30.470> mission<00:01:31.729> three<00:01:32.729> two

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
test from the ground mission three two

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.139 
test from the ground mission three two
one

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
one

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.789 
one
the<00:01:36.149> Pistons<00:01:36.659> retract

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the Pistons retract

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.630 
the Pistons retract
even<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> ground<00:01:38.909> shake<00:01:39.830> know<00:01:40.830> when<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.340> stop

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
even the ground shake know when to stop

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.520 
even the ground shake know when to stop
it

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.389 

the<00:01:46.530> Pistons<00:01:47.039> go<00:01:47.340> back<00:01:48.259> so<00:01:49.259> let's<00:01:49.619> go<00:01:49.920> inside

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
the Pistons go back so let's go inside

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.690 
the Pistons go back so let's go inside
this<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.210> capsule<00:01:55.130> it's<00:01:56.130> quite<00:01:56.369> tight

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
this is the capsule it's quite tight

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.630 
this is the capsule it's quite tight
inside<00:01:56.970> just<00:01:57.690> a<00:01:57.899> little<00:01:58.259> window<00:02:01.460> start<00:02:02.460> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
inside just a little window start the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.490 
inside just a little window start the
engines<00:02:04.130> here<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.369> go

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
engines here we go

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.499 
engines here we go
shaking

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
shaking

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.490 

by<00:02:10.509> our<00:02:11.170> best<00:02:12.040> entire<00:02:12.489> with<00:02:13.090> it's<00:02:13.299> not<00:02:13.690> spoiled

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
by our best entire with it's not spoiled

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.430 
by our best entire with it's not spoiled
or<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:17.620> now<00:02:17.890> we're<00:02:18.190> in<00:02:18.310> space<00:02:19.140> let's<00:02:20.140> go

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
or so now we're in space let's go

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.660 
or so now we're in space let's go
outside<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:23.400> new<00:02:24.400> we<00:02:24.700> are<00:02:24.900> floating<00:02:25.900> around<00:02:26.049> in

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
outside a new we are floating around in

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.130 
outside a new we are floating around in
space

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.050 

you<00:02:32.620> can<00:02:32.890> see<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.450> communications<00:02:34.450> for<00:02:36.060> now

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
you can see the communications for now

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.120 
you can see the communications for now
I'm<00:02:37.240> going<00:02:37.569> to<00:02:37.690> drop<00:02:38.020> down<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:41.130> nursed

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
I'm going to drop down a nursed

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:50.840 
I'm going to drop down a nursed
launchpad

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.170 

if<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.900> click<00:02:53.200> the<00:02:53.470> button<00:02:53.500> again<00:02:54.040> every<00:02:54.790> sets

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
if you click the button again every sets

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.110 
if you click the button again every sets
the<00:02:55.510> rocket

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.750 

I<00:03:00.629> left<00:03:01.629> a<00:03:01.840> redstone<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:03.040> command<00:03:03.430> block

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
I left a redstone and the command block

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.220 
I left a redstone and the command block
so<00:03:04.120> then<00:03:04.390> you<00:03:04.720> can<00:03:04.989> see<00:03:05.260> how<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:05.950> made<00:03:06.400> it

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
so then you can see how I made it

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.449 
so then you can see how I made it
