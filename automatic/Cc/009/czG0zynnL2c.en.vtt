00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.220
So how do you go about constructing the world's
tallest building?

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.750
The Burj Khalifa in Dubai is the world's tallest
building.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.160
At 828 meters tall, its 2.5 times the size
of the Eiffel tower, and the records don't

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.160
end there.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.600
It's got the world's longest elevator in terms
of distance to travel, the highest outdoor

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.199
observation deck, the most stories in any
building in the world and also the highest

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.589
occupied floor.

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:30.529
So how do you go about constructing the world's
tallest building?

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.540
Well the two main challenges are dealing with
the high winds and the earthquakes, so engineers

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.270
came up with this really clever design of
a buttress core with three wings set at 120

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.640
degrees from each other all set around a central
hub that's made of concrete so it acts a little

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.530
bit like an axel preventing the building from
twisting and turning.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.170
Now if the wind hits two of the wings, the
third wing actually braces against it and

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.260
resists the force.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.960
And if you look at the Burj Khalifa in profile
it's actually got a stepped appearance which

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.360
breaks up the wind flow and disrupts it.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.150
Now extreme weather and natural disasters
weren't the only challenges the designers

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.510
faced, they also had to work out how to ferry
hundreds and hundreds of people up and down

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.140
the building everyday and there are 57 lifts
in the whole building.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.790
A number go straight up to the sky lobby so
residents can peel off and go to their various

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.560
apartments, others take visitors up to the
outdoor observation deck in double decker

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.229
lifts that move 10 meters a second.

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.570
Now in the case of a fire, fortunately every
25 stories or so there are refuges so instead

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.900
of having to walk down 163 stories all in
one go, there is actually a place for people

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.540
to go to safety.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.170
Constructing the world's tallest building
didn't come cheap.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.710
It reportedly cost 1.5 billion US dollars
to construct.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.030
Give us a thumbs up if you wouldn't mind that
in your back pocket.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.080
Originally the project was going to be called
the Burj Dubai but during the recession they

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.510
ran out of a bit of money and they had to
call on the UAE President Mr Khalifa, to come

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.700
in and bail them out hence the name Burj Khalifa.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.540
And running and maintaining a skyscraper isn't
cheap either, at peak times 36 megawatts of

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.150
electricity are needed which is equivalent
to about 360,000 one hundred watt light bulbs

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.760
at any one time.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.190
Then you've got a million litres of water
that are needed every day, 10,000 tonnes of

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.830
ice to cool the whole building down, and in
Dubai's hot climate all that condensation

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.870
that builds up, all the water is actually
collected and farmed out to water the gardens

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.209
which is about 20 Olympic sized swimming pools
worth of water.

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.770
Then you've got the cleaning of the building
which is done by automated track mounted robots

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.110
which take about four months to go around
the whole building.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.160
So pretty much, by the time they finish, they
start again.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.440
Now, for the time being the Burj Khalifa is
the world's highest building.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.990
But there was talk of a mile high skyscraper
being built at the moment it's just talk,

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.709
but you never know so watch this space.

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:10.350
