basically<00:01:57.579> it's<00:01:58.030> snow<00:01:58.270> blocks<00:01:58.569> as<00:01:58.869> the

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
basically it's snow blocks as the

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.339 
basically it's snow blocks as the
branches<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:00.610> ice<00:02:01.360> blocks<00:02:01.810> as<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.140> leaves

00:02:02.339 --> 00:02:02.349 
branches and ice blocks as the leaves

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:04.559 
branches and ice blocks as the leaves
and<00:02:02.590> if<00:02:02.709> you<00:02:02.829> break<00:02:02.979> them<00:02:03.280> then<00:02:03.970> water<00:02:04.270> pours

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
and if you break them then water pours

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:11.430 
and if you break them then water pours
out<00:02:04.689> it's<00:02:04.959> just<00:02:05.140> like<00:02:05.200> regular<00:02:06.329> ice<00:02:10.380> okay<00:02:11.380> so

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
out it's just like regular ice okay so

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.289 
out it's just like regular ice okay so
this<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:11.799> why<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:11.980> get<00:02:12.250> if<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.459> put<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.790> TNT

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
this is why you get if you put a TNT

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.140 
this is why you get if you put a TNT
block<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:14.310> sapling<00:02:15.310> together<00:02:15.579> and<00:02:16.030> you'd

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
block and sapling together and you'd

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.780 
block and sapling together and you'd
vote<00:02:16.299> me<00:02:16.360> alone<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.810> so<00:02:17.400> basically<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.430> stack

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
vote me alone it so basically I stack

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.400 
vote me alone it so basically I stack
three<00:02:19.090> on<00:02:19.209> top<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.540> each<00:02:19.630> other<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:20.079> only<00:02:20.200> get

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
three on top of each other you only get

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.710 
three on top of each other you only get
one<00:02:20.440> if<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.160> use<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.549> I<00:02:21.760> just<00:02:22.209> wanted<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.540> show

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
one if you use it I just wanted to show

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.940 
one if you use it I just wanted to show
you<00:02:23.040> what<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:24.160> would<00:02:24.280> be<00:02:24.310> like

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.910 

okay<00:02:27.700> now<00:02:27.879> we<00:02:27.940> have<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.599> full<00:02:29.020> block<00:02:29.290> this<00:02:29.709> was

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
okay now we have the full block this was

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.619 
okay now we have the full block this was
an<00:02:30.099> orange<00:02:30.370> wool<00:02:30.550> block<00:02:30.849> and<00:02:31.090> then<00:02:31.180> I<00:02:31.239> put<00:02:31.480> down

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
an orange wool block and then I put down

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.290 
an orange wool block and then I put down
and<00:02:31.900> put<00:02:32.019> a<00:02:32.050> sapling<00:02:32.500> on<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.879> this<00:02:33.879> is<00:02:34.030> what<00:02:34.180> you

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
and put a sapling on it this is what you

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.460 
and put a sapling on it this is what you
get

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.020 

yeah<00:02:37.470> there<00:02:37.980> are<00:02:38.129> different<00:02:38.310> colors<00:02:38.640> will

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
yeah there are different colors will

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.990 
yeah there are different colors will
show<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.269> that<00:02:40.159> okay<00:02:41.159> so<00:02:41.220> now<00:02:41.489> as<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.819> can<00:02:41.939> see

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
I put every type of bull block in here

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.820 
I put every type of bull block in here
all<00:02:45.299> of<00:02:45.360> them

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
all of them

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.670 
all of them
put<00:02:47.490> a<00:02:47.520> sapling<00:02:47.970> on<00:02:48.090> top<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.420> them<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:49.470> now<00:02:49.620> you

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
put a sapling on top of them so now you

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.930 
put a sapling on top of them so now you
have<00:02:50.960> some<00:02:51.960> before<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.380> version<00:02:53.010> 1.3<00:02:53.460> you

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
have some before the version 1.3 you

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.580 
have some before the version 1.3 you
could<00:02:54.360> not<00:02:54.510> have<00:02:54.600> done<00:02:54.780> this<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:55.200> only<00:02:55.320> gave

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
could not have done this it only gave

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.270 
could not have done this it only gave
you<00:02:56.930> one<00:02:57.930> actually<00:02:58.410> looks<00:02:58.440> like<00:02:58.740> a<00:02:58.770> tree<00:02:59.010> over

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
you one actually looks like a tree over

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.930 
you one actually looks like a tree over
there<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.430> think<00:03:02.430> this<00:03:02.520> is<00:03:02.580> pretty<00:03:02.820> cool

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
this happen this is where you get if you

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.560 
this happen this is where you get if you
put<00:03:07.710> a<00:03:07.740> plank<00:03:08.160> block<00:03:08.460> and<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.850> sapling<00:03:09.300> together

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
put a plank block and a sapling together

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.200 
put a plank block and a sapling together
with<00:03:09.930> it<00:03:10.110> bone<00:03:10.320> meal<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:11.220> get<00:03:11.430> regular<00:03:12.000> wood

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
with it bone meal you get regular wood

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.350 
with it bone meal you get regular wood
as<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.900> branches<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:13.560> trunk<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.280> planks<00:03:15.210> as

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
as the branches and trunk and planks as

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.980 
as the branches and trunk and planks as
the<00:03:15.540> leaves<00:03:16.460> this<00:03:17.460> one<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:18.030> got<00:03:18.360> lucky<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.840> I

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
the leaves this one I got lucky and I

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.760 
the leaves this one I got lucky and I
got<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.640> trip<00:03:20.640> three<00:03:20.940> wide<00:03:21.620> don't<00:03:22.620> talk<00:03:22.740> about

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
got a trip three wide don't talk about

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.060 
got a trip three wide don't talk about
later<00:03:23.840> okay<00:03:24.840> so<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.140> is<00:03:25.290> what<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.590> get<00:03:25.800> if

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
later okay so this is what you get if

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.400 
later okay so this is what you get if
you<00:03:26.130> put<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.300> regular<00:03:27.750> wood<00:03:27.930> block<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.380> a

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
you put a regular wood block and a

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.380 
you put a regular wood block and a
regular<00:03:28.800> sappening<00:03:29.430> sapling<00:03:30.120> together

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
regular sappening sapling together

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.920 
regular sappening sapling together
basically<00:03:31.080> in<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.560> new<00:03:31.680> version<00:03:32.630> these<00:03:33.630> trees

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
basically in the new version these trees

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.510 
basically in the new version these trees
have<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:35.120> one-percent<00:03:36.120> no<00:03:36.900> point<00:03:37.890> one<00:03:38.070> percent

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
have a one-percent no point one percent

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.230 
have a one-percent no point one percent
chance<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:39.320> spawning<00:03:40.320> naturally<00:03:41.190> so<00:03:41.970> if<00:03:42.120> you

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
chance of spawning naturally so if you

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.699 
chance of spawning naturally so if you
world<00:03:42.480> generate<00:03:42.959> then<00:03:43.200> this<00:03:43.380> will<00:03:43.530> have<00:03:43.680> a

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
world generate then this will have a

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.390 
world generate then this will have a
point<00:03:44.040> one<00:03:44.840> chance<00:03:45.840> that's<00:03:46.170> fine<00:03:46.410> okay<00:03:47.190> as<00:03:47.250> you

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
point one chance that's fine okay as you

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.060 
point one chance that's fine okay as you
can<00:03:47.430> see<00:03:47.580> this<00:03:47.820> is<00:03:48.030> a<00:03:48.060> dark<00:03:48.390> wood<00:03:48.630> tree<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.200> new

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
can see this is a dark wood tree and new

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.500 
can see this is a dark wood tree and new
in<00:03:50.250> version<00:03:50.360> 1.4<00:03:51.360> you<00:03:51.810> get<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.320> hollow<00:03:52.800> trunk<00:03:53.510> so

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
in version 1.4 you get a hollow trunk so

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.360 
in version 1.4 you get a hollow trunk so
this<00:03:55.200> is<00:03:55.410> what<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.680> looks<00:03:55.860> like<00:03:56.010> on<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.250> inside

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
this is what it looks like on the inside

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.309 
this is what it looks like on the inside
it's<00:03:59.370> basically<00:03:59.730> just<00:03:59.880> a<00:04:00.209> hollow<00:04:00.420> trunk

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
it's basically just a hollow trunk

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.819 
it's basically just a hollow trunk
can<00:04:02.239> finally<00:04:03.239> do<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:03.810> it's<00:04:03.959> a<00:04:04.049> lot<00:04:04.200> bigger<00:04:04.379> so

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
can finally do and it's a lot bigger so

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.500 
can finally do and it's a lot bigger so
I'm<00:04:05.040> pretty<00:04:05.549> sure<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:05.999> there's<00:04:06.180> just<00:04:06.239> a

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
I'm pretty sure that there's just a

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.059 
I'm pretty sure that there's just a
chance<00:04:06.540> that<00:04:07.049> you<00:04:07.139> might<00:04:07.260> get<00:04:07.439> a<00:04:07.469> Hall<00:04:07.739> of<00:04:07.769> one

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
chance that you might get a Hall of one

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.289 
chance that you might get a Hall of one
or<00:04:08.480> just<00:04:09.480> not<00:04:10.079> a<00:04:10.109> hollow<00:04:10.379> one<00:04:10.650> so<00:04:11.040> it's<00:04:11.969> up<00:04:12.269> to

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
or just not a hollow one so it's up to

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.390 
or just not a hollow one so it's up to
the<00:04:12.840> game<00:04:13.049> really<00:04:13.319> this<00:04:13.859> is<00:04:14.010> where<00:04:14.159> we<00:04:14.280> have

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
the game really this is where we have

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.310 
the game really this is where we have
the<00:04:14.519> birch<00:04:14.730> tree<00:04:15.060> this<00:04:15.719> is<00:04:15.840> what<00:04:15.959> happens<00:04:16.259> when

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
the birch tree this is what happens when

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.650 
the birch tree this is what happens when
you<00:04:16.500> put<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.680> bird<00:04:16.949> slog<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.639> a<00:04:17.789> bird<00:04:18.090> sapling

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
you put a bird slog and a bird sapling

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.439 
you put a bird slog and a bird sapling
and<00:04:18.900> use<00:04:19.560> bone<00:04:19.769> meal<00:04:19.949> on<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:20.280> I'm<00:04:20.849> not<00:04:21.000> sure<00:04:21.060> if

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
and use bone meal on it I'm not sure if

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.689 
and use bone meal on it I'm not sure if
the<00:04:21.720> dark<00:04:21.989> wood<00:04:22.199> and<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.500> perch<00:04:22.919> actually

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
the dark wood and the perch actually

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.249 
the dark wood and the perch actually
spawn<00:04:24.030> now<00:04:24.240> normally<00:04:24.840> I<00:04:24.870> think<00:04:25.110> it's<00:04:25.199> just

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:25.259 
spawn now normally I think it's just

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.629 
spawn now normally I think it's just
this<00:04:26.030> but<00:04:27.030> on<00:04:27.210> that's<00:04:28.050> what<00:04:28.199> you<00:04:28.289> get<00:04:28.430> new<00:04:29.430> in

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
this but on that's what you get new in

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.659 
this but on that's what you get new in
version<00:04:29.669> 1.4<00:04:30.630> there<00:04:31.020> is<00:04:31.229> a<00:04:31.410> point<00:04:32.190> zero<00:04:32.580> zero

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
version 1.4 there is a point zero zero

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.300 
version 1.4 there is a point zero zero
zero<00:04:33.060> one<00:04:33.630> percent<00:04:34.050> chance<00:04:34.229> a<00:04:34.590> diamond<00:04:35.099> tree

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
zero one percent chance a diamond tree

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.070 
zero one percent chance a diamond tree
will<00:04:35.580> spawn<00:04:35.789> naturally<00:04:36.000> and<00:04:36.509> i<00:04:36.570> found<00:04:36.900> one

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
will spawn naturally and i found one

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.939 
will spawn naturally and i found one
here<00:04:37.410> it<00:04:37.979> took<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.250> while<00:04:38.430> but<00:04:38.820> there's<00:04:39.030> a<00:04:40.009> big

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
oh well yeah you get this huge diamond

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.249 
oh well yeah you get this huge diamond
tree<00:04:46.199> and<00:04:46.380> there's<00:04:46.530> one<00:04:46.710> torch<00:04:47.009> so<00:04:48.229> good<00:04:49.229> luck

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
tree and there's one torch so good luck

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.320 
tree and there's one torch so good luck
finding<00:04:49.590> that<00:04:49.830> this<00:04:50.759> is<00:04:50.910> where<00:04:51.030> you<00:04:51.090> get<00:04:51.210> if

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
finding that this is where you get if

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.029 
finding that this is where you get if
you<00:04:51.360> put<00:04:51.570> a<00:04:51.599> brick<00:04:51.900> block<00:04:52.139> with<00:04:52.410> a<00:04:52.440> sapling<00:04:52.919> on

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
you put a brick block with a sapling on

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:56.150 
you put a brick block with a sapling on
it<00:04:53.190> and<00:04:53.370> boom<00:04:54.210> meal<00:04:54.419> you<00:04:54.720> get<00:04:54.960> bricks<00:04:55.500> as<00:04:55.800> the

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
it and boom meal you get bricks as the

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:02.420 
it and boom meal you get bricks as the
branches<00:04:56.759> and<00:04:59.030> clay<00:05:00.030> as<00:05:00.360> the<00:05:00.900> leaves<00:05:01.250> okay<00:05:02.250> now

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
branches and clay as the leaves okay now

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.860 
branches and clay as the leaves okay now
I<00:05:02.490> wanted<00:05:02.820> to<00:05:02.940> show<00:05:03.180> you<00:05:03.210> guys<00:05:03.360> what<00:05:03.750> the

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
I wanted to show you guys what the

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.529 
I wanted to show you guys what the
explosion<00:05:04.410> of<00:05:04.530> these<00:05:04.740> four<00:05:05.300> Danty<00:05:06.300> trees

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
explosion of these four Danty trees

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:09.770 
explosion of these four Danty trees
would<00:05:07.050> be<00:05:07.229> so<00:05:08.130> I'll<00:05:08.340> go<00:05:08.520> ahead<00:05:08.550> and<00:05:09.030> set<00:05:09.630> these

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
would be so I'll go ahead and set these

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:27.140 
would be so I'll go ahead and set these
up<00:05:10.940> okay<00:05:11.940> now<00:05:12.120> we're<00:05:12.240> about<00:05:12.300> see<00:05:12.570> what<00:05:12.659> happens

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.230 

yea<00:05:28.439> I'm<00:05:29.439> guessing<00:05:29.500> this<00:05:29.979> is<00:05:30.159> the<00:05:30.340> bottom<00:05:30.819> one

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
yea I'm guessing this is the bottom one

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.700 
yea I'm guessing this is the bottom one
because<00:05:31.719> the<00:05:31.930> tops<00:05:32.169> probably<00:05:32.590> just<00:05:33.039> dispersed

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
because the tops probably just dispersed

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.760 
because the tops probably just dispersed
yeah<00:05:35.710> they<00:05:35.979> really<00:05:36.159> did<00:05:36.460> everywhere<00:05:36.969> else<00:05:37.030> um

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
yeah they really did everywhere else um

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.159 
yeah they really did everywhere else um
that's<00:05:38.770> what<00:05:38.979> happens<00:05:39.250> if<00:05:39.370> you<00:05:39.490> blow<00:05:39.639> one<00:05:39.819> up

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
that's what happens if you blow one up

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:44.719 
that's what happens if you blow one up
so<00:05:41.169> yeah<00:05:41.319> I<00:05:41.620> don't<00:05:42.580> I<00:05:42.669> guys<00:05:42.849> born<00:05:43.120> yeah<00:05:44.080> after
