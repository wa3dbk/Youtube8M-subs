technically now my sand King is over

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.210 
technically now my sand King is over
here<00:01:07.830> because<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.520> want<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:10.320> adder<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:11.100> be

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
here because I want the adder to be

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.130 
here because I want the adder to be
across<00:01:11.549> from<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.880> comment<00:01:12.330> which<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.780> and

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
across from the comment which it is and

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.859 
across from the comment which it is and
I<00:01:13.260> want<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.680> vaca<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.549> be<00:01:14.700> across<00:01:15.060> from<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
I want the vaca to be across from the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.340 
I want the vaca to be across from the
Infernus<00:01:16.350> because<00:01:17.189> they're<00:01:17.340> both<00:01:17.460> pegasi

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
Infernus because they're both pegasi

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.290 
Infernus because they're both pegasi
which<00:01:19.350> means<00:01:19.650> sadly<00:01:20.460> I'm<00:01:20.760> going<00:01:20.940> to<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.180> to

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
which means sadly I'm going to have to

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.090

get<00:01:21.450> rid<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.630> my<00:01:21.780> Meza<00:01:22.050> my<00:01:22.350> Merriweather<00:01:22.830> Meza

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100

and I think as well I might get rid of
my<00:01:25.500> algae<00:01:25.950> because<00:01:26.190> it's<00:01:26.490> free<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.120> I'm<00:01:27.240> like

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
my algae because it's free and I'm like

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.810 
my algae because it's free and I'm like
I<00:01:27.690> might<00:01:28.170> get<00:01:28.380> another<00:01:28.590> bike<00:01:29.070> again<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.760> get
