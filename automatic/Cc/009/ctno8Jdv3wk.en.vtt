come<00:02:25.030> around<00:02:25.330> and<00:02:25.660> that's<00:02:25.930> when<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.290> put<00:02:26.500> your

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
come around and that's when you put your

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.670 
come around and that's when you put your
front<00:02:26.950> foot<00:02:27.040> down<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:27.910> then<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.080> just<00:02:29.260> drop

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
front foot down and then you just drop

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.699 
front foot down and then you just drop
your<00:02:29.920> feet<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.489> then<00:02:31.270> put<00:02:31.450> them<00:02:31.540> both<00:02:31.690> on<00:02:31.959> so

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
your feet and then put them both on so

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.770 
your feet and then put them both on so
usually<00:02:33.160> your<00:02:33.340> front<00:02:33.610> foot<00:02:33.670> will<00:02:34.000> catch<00:02:34.269> the

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
usually your front foot will catch the

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.620 
usually your front foot will catch the
board<00:02:35.080> first<00:02:35.470> which<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:36.280> what<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.180> looks<00:02:37.390> like

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
board first which is what it looks like

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.870 
board first which is what it looks like
happened<00:02:38.470> with<00:02:38.680> your<00:02:38.860> board<00:02:39.160> especially<00:02:39.580> on

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
happened with your board especially on

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.300 
happened with your board especially on
that<00:02:40.030> one<00:02:40.239> where<00:02:40.420> you<00:02:40.450> landed<00:02:41.019> your<00:02:41.830> your

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
that one where you landed your your

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.910 
that one where you landed your your
board<00:02:42.519> wasn't<00:02:42.760> fully<00:02:43.269> rotated<00:02:43.959> on<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.380> 360

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
board wasn't fully rotated on the 360

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.530 
board wasn't fully rotated on the 360
which<00:02:45.190> is<00:02:45.340> why<00:02:45.489> you<00:02:45.550> stopped<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:46.090> little<00:02:46.390> bit

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
which is why you stopped a little bit

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.020 
which is why you stopped a little bit
and<00:02:46.810> obviously<00:02:47.260> you<00:02:47.470> were<00:02:47.800> kind<00:02:48.580> of<00:02:48.670> leaning

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
and obviously you were kind of leaning

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.530 
and obviously you were kind of leaning
sideways<00:02:49.600> on<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.290> trucks<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:50.830> that<00:02:51.010> also

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
sideways on the trucks so that also

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.509 
sideways on the trucks so that also
contributed<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.810> stopping<00:02:53.290> factor<00:02:53.709> but

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
contributed to the stopping factor but

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.220 
contributed to the stopping factor but
yeah<00:02:54.700> just<00:02:55.000> getting<00:02:55.300> that<00:02:55.420> scoop<00:02:55.720> down<00:02:55.870> really

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
yeah just getting that scoop down really

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.040 
yeah just getting that scoop down really
really<00:02:56.709> well<00:02:56.980> will<00:02:57.190> help<00:02:57.370> out<00:02:57.519> a<00:02:57.550> ton<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.269> then

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
really well will help out a ton and then

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.680 
really well will help out a ton and then
the<00:02:59.590> big<00:02:59.890> thing<00:03:00.190> that<00:03:00.730> I'm<00:03:01.030> going<00:03:01.239> to<00:03:01.300> give<00:03:01.570> you

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
the big thing that I'm going to give you

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.860 
the big thing that I'm going to give you
a<00:03:01.720> pointer<00:03:02.170> on<00:03:02.320> is<00:03:02.560> lean<00:03:03.519> back<00:03:03.790> get<00:03:04.480> your<00:03:04.600> upper

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
a pointer on is lean back get your upper

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.550 
a pointer on is lean back get your upper
body<00:03:05.019> leaning<00:03:05.709> back<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:07.300> if<00:03:07.660> you<00:03:07.840> were<00:03:07.989> to<00:03:08.050> draw

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
body leaning back so if you were to draw

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.190 
body leaning back so if you were to draw
a<00:03:08.800> line<00:03:09.190> on<00:03:09.519> your<00:03:10.090> body<00:03:10.330> it<00:03:10.810> would<00:03:10.959> be<00:03:11.170> a

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
a line on your body it would be a

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.059 
a line on your body it would be a
slanted<00:03:12.010> line<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:13.180> that<00:03:13.210> if<00:03:13.780> when<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:14.800> push

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
slanted line so that if when you push

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.220 
slanted line so that if when you push
weight<00:03:15.790> onto<00:03:16.060> your<00:03:16.300> foot<00:03:16.540> onto<00:03:16.720> your<00:03:16.960> board

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
weight onto your foot onto your board

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.390 
weight onto your foot onto your board
it'll<00:03:17.500> shove<00:03:17.830> your<00:03:17.980> board

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
it'll shove your board

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.149 
it'll shove your board
forward<00:03:19.000> so<00:03:19.959> a<00:03:19.989> common<00:03:20.500> mistake<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.860> that

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 
forward so a common mistake is that

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.670 
forward so a common mistake is that
people<00:03:21.610> will<00:03:21.790> kind<00:03:22.390> of<00:03:22.510> leaned<00:03:22.750> forward<00:03:23.409> and

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
people will kind of leaned forward and

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.130 
people will kind of leaned forward and
that<00:03:24.640> works<00:03:24.879> for<00:03:25.120> some<00:03:25.329> tricks<00:03:25.629> but<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:25.959> does

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
that works for some tricks but it does

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.720 
that works for some tricks but it does
not<00:03:26.530> work<00:03:27.010> for<00:03:27.069> the<00:03:27.400> 360<00:03:27.939> flip<00:03:28.299> because<00:03:29.250> on<00:03:30.250> the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
not work for the 360 flip because on the

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.210 
not work for the 360 flip because on the
360<00:03:31.239> flip<00:03:31.540> what<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:31.870> does<00:03:32.079> is<00:03:32.379> it<00:03:32.680> causes<00:03:32.860> your

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
360 flip what it does is it causes your

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.140 
360 flip what it does is it causes your
body<00:03:33.489> to<00:03:33.700> go<00:03:34.030> forward<00:03:34.599> and<00:03:34.810> then<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:35.650> can't

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
body to go forward and then you can't

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.789 
body to go forward and then you can't
extend<00:03:37.150> your<00:03:37.450> front<00:03:37.659> foot<00:03:37.840> out<00:03:38.170> catch<00:03:38.620> it

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
extend your front foot out catch it

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.440 
extend your front foot out catch it
properly<00:03:39.220> with<00:03:39.400> your<00:03:39.549> front<00:03:39.760> foot<00:03:39.879> and<00:03:40.180> then

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
properly with your front foot and then

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.830 
properly with your front foot and then
land<00:03:40.810> so<00:03:41.799> a<00:03:42.280> big<00:03:42.849> thing<00:03:43.120> that<00:03:43.299> I<00:03:43.329> think<00:03:43.659> would

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
land so a big thing that I think would

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.630 
land so a big thing that I think would
help<00:03:44.019> you<00:03:44.170> out<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.319> lot<00:03:44.560> is<00:03:44.829> the<00:03:45.010> practice

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
help you out a lot is the practice

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.580 
help you out a lot is the practice
stepping<00:03:46.329> off<00:03:46.450> with<00:03:46.659> your<00:03:46.780> back<00:03:47.019> foot<00:03:47.049> and

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
stepping off with your back foot and

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.349 
stepping off with your back foot and
then<00:03:48.010> just<00:03:48.250> catching<00:03:48.700> it<00:03:48.819> with<00:03:48.939> your<00:03:49.120> front

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.359 
then just catching it with your front

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.300 
then just catching it with your front
foot<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:49.930> think<00:03:50.560> that<00:03:50.709> will<00:03:50.829> help<00:03:50.980> you<00:03:51.159> out<00:03:51.280> a

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
foot I think that will help you out a

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.319 
foot I think that will help you out a
lot<00:03:51.579> so<00:03:52.569> yeah<00:03:52.750> practice<00:03:53.560> that<00:03:53.980> lean<00:03:54.700> back<00:03:55.000> and

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
lot so yeah practice that lean back and

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.720 
lot so yeah practice that lean back and
then<00:03:55.780> really<00:03:56.470> get<00:03:56.590> that<00:03:56.739> scoop<00:03:57.069> down<00:03:57.280> and

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
then really get that scoop down and

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.729 
then really get that scoop down and
after<00:03:58.420> a<00:03:58.450> while<00:03:58.659> you'll<00:03:58.930> just<00:03:59.139> get<00:03:59.290> these<00:03:59.470> and

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
after a while you'll just get these and

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.940 
after a while you'll just get these and
they'll<00:03:59.829> be<00:03:59.980> so<00:04:00.310> easy<00:04:00.670> and<00:04:01.090> then<00:04:01.650> after<00:04:02.650> you<00:04:02.739> do

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
they'll be so easy and then after you do

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.679 
they'll be so easy and then after you do
you'll<00:04:03.489> have<00:04:03.700> a<00:04:03.730> hard<00:04:03.909> time<00:04:04.090> with<00:04:04.299> burial

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:04.689
