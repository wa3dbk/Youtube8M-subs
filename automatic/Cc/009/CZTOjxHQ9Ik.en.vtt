00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
I find this to be the best thing because

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.160

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
really makes this one different

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.259 
really makes this one different
it's<00:00:31.150> from<00:00:31.510> mount<00:00:32.050> tech<00:00:32.349> and<00:00:33.059> they<00:00:34.059> have

like that really stands out actually
before<00:02:01.920> go<00:02:02.920> off<00:02:03.280> is<00:02:03.880> that<00:02:04.120> she's<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.510> screw<00:02:05.049> so

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
before go off is that she's a screw so

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.660 
before go off is that she's a screw so
I'm<00:02:05.440> gonna<00:02:05.560> take<00:02:05.770> it<00:02:05.920> off<00:02:06.040> so<00:02:06.220> you<00:02:06.310> can<00:02:06.400> see

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
I'm gonna take it off so you can see

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.149 
I'm gonna take it off so you can see
just<00:02:06.700> how<00:02:07.030> tightly<00:02:07.570> it<00:02:07.930> mounts<00:02:08.319> it<00:02:08.890> actually

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:09.159 
just how tightly it mounts it actually

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:12.059 
just how tightly it mounts it actually
the<00:02:09.280> screw<00:02:09.700> that<00:02:10.239> helps<00:02:10.629> it<00:02:10.810> so<00:02:11.560> that<00:02:11.770> it<00:02:11.920> will

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
the screw that helps it so that it will

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.270 
the screw that helps it so that it will
push<00:02:12.370> up<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.910> fit<00:02:13.300> your<00:02:13.750> CD<00:02:14.230> player<00:02:14.550> perfectly

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
I've got I've gone through a lot of CD

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.930 
I've got I've gone through a lot of CD
ones<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.710> they<00:02:19.070> just<00:02:19.220> used<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.580> like<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:19.820> know

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
ones and they just used it like you know

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.170 
ones and they just used it like you know
you<00:02:20.350> push<00:02:21.350> it<00:02:21.560> up<00:02:21.770> and<00:02:22.130> that's<00:02:22.490> it<00:02:22.790> kind<00:02:23.120> of

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
you push it up and that's it kind of

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.560 
you push it up and that's it kind of
thing<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:24.890> can<00:02:25.220> mess<00:02:25.730> up<00:02:25.910> your<00:02:25.970> CD<00:02:26.300> player

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
thing and it can mess up your CD player

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.290 
thing and it can mess up your CD player
for<00:02:26.690> one<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:27.350> this<00:02:28.280> makes<00:02:28.580> it<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.850> lot<00:02:29.030> easier

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
for one and this makes it a lot easier

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.660 
for one and this makes it a lot easier
so<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.780> just<00:02:30.050> turn<00:02:30.260> this<00:02:30.380> knob<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:31.100> it's

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
so you just turn this knob and it's

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.880 
so you just turn this knob and it's
actually<00:02:32.030> pushing<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:32.570> screw<00:02:32.900> so<00:02:33.590> that<00:02:33.620> you

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
actually pushing the screw so that you

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.220 
actually pushing the screw so that you
get<00:02:34.100> more<00:02:34.459> distance<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:35.750> get<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:35.959> better

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
get more distance and you get a better

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.410 
get more distance and you get a better
grip<00:02:36.530> on<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.920> so<00:02:37.459> it's<00:02:37.610> a<00:02:37.670> really<00:02:37.700> great<00:02:38.060> design
