00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
the fact that it's gonna be very

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
stability if you're hand holding it so I

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.170 
stability if you're hand holding it so I
would<00:00:43.230> always<00:00:43.379> recommend<00:00:43.680> when<00:00:44.100> possible<00:00:44.969> use

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
would always recommend when possible use

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.750 
would always recommend when possible use
a<00:00:45.210> tripod<00:00:45.870> or<00:00:45.899> some<00:00:46.350> type<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.760> stabilizing

a<00:01:04.229> very<00:01:04.470> tight<00:01:04.799> fit<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.790> with<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> case<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.750> it

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
a very tight fit but with the case on it

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.500 
a very tight fit but with the case on it
still<00:01:07.439> works<00:01:07.740> perfectly<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:09.299> I'd<00:01:09.390> like

to<00:01:09.570> do<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.560> few<00:01:10.710> minutes<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.070> go<00:01:11.340> over

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
to do here in a few minutes is go over

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.969 
to do here in a few minutes is go over
some<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> different<00:01:13.049> configurations

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
some of the different configurations

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.760 
some of the different configurations
that<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.460> would<00:01:14.640> use<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.720> many<00:01:16.439> of<00:01:16.619> you

that I would use this in and many of you
I'm<00:01:16.950> sure<00:01:16.979> would<00:01:17.250> use<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.610> similarly<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.420> if

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
I'm sure would use it similarly and if

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.300 
I'm sure would use it similarly and if
there's<00:01:18.750> any<00:01:19.080> other<00:01:19.290> ways<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.830> guys<00:01:19.979> can

this particular tripod mount is to take
into<00:01:42.150> consideration<00:01:42.180> how<00:01:42.990> it's<00:01:43.200> designed

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
into consideration how it's designed

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.969 
into consideration how it's designed
when<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:44.460> get<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.180> box<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:46.619> box<00:01:46.829> that

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
when you get it in the box the box that

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
it comes in it comes pretty much as you

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.660 
it comes in it comes pretty much as you
see<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.979> now<00:01:51.049> what<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.079> gives<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:54.200> the

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
see it now what that gives you is the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.340 
see it now what that gives you is the
compact<00:01:56.670> version<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.270> tripod<00:01:58.020> mount<00:01:58.259> and

the<00:02:45.940> hand<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:47.080> would<00:02:47.230> work<00:02:47.380> perfectly

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
the hand and it would work perfectly

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.470 
the hand and it would work perfectly
with<00:02:48.130> something<00:02:48.520> like<00:02:48.700> this<00:02:48.910> so<00:02:49.120> let<00:02:49.240> me<00:02:49.330> show

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
with something like this so let me show

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.360 
with something like this so let me show
you<00:02:49.540> how<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:49.810> would<00:02:49.960> utilize<00:02:50.410> that<00:02:50.680> so

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
you how I would utilize that so

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
basically what you would do is you would

00:02:52.570 --> 00:03:07.680 
basically what you would do is you would
just<00:02:52.690> take<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:54.190> base<00:02:54.370> of<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:55.590> square<00:02:56.590> jelly

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
very stable inside of the grip now I've

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.030 
very stable inside of the grip now I've
looked<00:03:42.060> at<00:03:42.240> a<00:03:42.270> number<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.660> others<00:03:42.930> one<00:03:43.830> in

looked at a number of others one in

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.270 
looked at a number of others one in
particular<00:03:44.220> was<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.270> istabilizer<00:03:45.840> and<00:03:46.560> I

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
particular was the istabilizer and I

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.040 
particular was the istabilizer and I
wasn't<00:03:47.520> a<00:03:47.670> big<00:03:47.820> fan<00:03:48.060> of<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.330> because<00:03:48.630> it<00:03:48.840> felt

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
wasn't a big fan of it because it felt

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.780 
wasn't a big fan of it because it felt
like<00:03:49.230> it<00:03:49.410> was<00:03:49.440> pinching<00:03:49.920> just<00:03:50.130> a<00:03:50.220> wee<00:03:50.400> bit<00:03:50.610> too

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
like it was pinching just a wee bit too

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.830 
like it was pinching just a wee bit too
much<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:52.130> in<00:03:53.130> many<00:03:53.430> shooting<00:03:53.880> situations<00:03:54.540> I

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
much and in many shooting situations I

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.100 
much and in many shooting situations I
found<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.830> it<00:03:56.730> would<00:03:56.940> be<00:03:57.090> so<00:03:57.390> tight<00:03:57.690> that<00:03:57.720> the

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
found that it would be so tight that the

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.520 
found that it would be so tight that the
phone<00:03:58.350> would<00:03:58.530> actually<00:03:58.890> pop<00:03:59.160> out<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.430> the

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
phone would actually pop out of the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.380 
phone would actually pop out of the
tripod<00:04:01.530> mount<00:04:01.770> so<00:04:02.370> again<00:04:02.700> like<00:04:02.910> I<00:04:03.030> said<00:04:03.090> this

the<00:05:07.600> one<00:05:07.840> thing<00:05:08.050> that<00:05:08.260> I<00:05:08.320> have<00:05:08.500> noticed<00:05:08.710> about

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
the one thing that I have noticed about

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.970 
the one thing that I have noticed about
this<00:05:09.370> one<00:05:09.640> it's<00:05:10.390> not<00:05:10.810> very<00:05:11.200> stable<00:05:11.530> it<00:05:11.800> does

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
this one it's not very stable it does

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.980 
this one it's not very stable it does
have<00:05:12.190> a<00:05:12.220> lot<00:05:12.400> of<00:05:12.430> give<00:05:12.700> in<00:05:12.880> it<00:05:13.030> and<00:05:13.210> I<00:05:13.900> think

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
have a lot of give in it and I think

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.480 
have a lot of give in it and I think
that's<00:05:14.320> just<00:05:14.650> to<00:05:14.770> do<00:05:14.920> with<00:05:15.070> the<00:05:15.160> fact<00:05:15.370> that

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
that's just to do with the fact that

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.300 
that's just to do with the fact that
it's<00:05:15.670> mostly<00:05:16.000> plastic<00:05:16.600> and<00:05:16.960> also<00:05:17.740> -<00:05:18.130> this

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
it's mostly plastic and also - this

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.910 
it's mostly plastic and also - this
would<00:05:18.670> be<00:05:19.170> the<00:05:20.170> manfrotto<00:05:20.920> mini<00:05:22.410> tripod<00:05:23.410> you

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
would be the manfrotto mini tripod you

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.200
