00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.709
 welcome to part 6 of our video report 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.820
 frankfurt 2013 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.900
 have loved you ever stress 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.310
 but a little up to you 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.320
 blood pressure thinking so now we really go 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.820
 best weird 'along 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.740
 I would rather though the quest of 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.990
 Alcantara sends me how do you think it is 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.000
 more here feel yes this is a good one 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.900
 way to start the day is really the 458 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.480
 special one 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.920
 more than 600 hp you have less than 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.520
 thirteen hundred kilos are always proud 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.590
 on 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.080
 see kilos per bhp this is something more 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.760
 than two kilos per hp and 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.360
 you are the successor of the feeder one 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.840
 study yes yes hair I really work my day 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.840
 can not go wrong 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.570
 is slowly getting better again and this 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.790
 kind and we will know that also look 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.799
 to this cadillac elmiraj 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.570
 buttons huge lap of a cars you 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.580
 thinks that's great he's based on 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.250
 the el dorado it 67 that was still a lot 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.320
 bigger what plus 5 meter 60 this is but 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.549
 at the meter 21 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.049
 You could say this is the ultimate 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.610
 competitor for the mercedes benz s 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.840
 class coupé things in the previous video 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.280
 saw with a difference 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.350
 that goes into production more or less like that 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.210
 this never a shame anywhere 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.869
 because these are statement boys really 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.869
 awesome 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.420
 and here on the standby we find Suzuki 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.520
 the ivy 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.930
 I leave a mark for a concept about technology 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.399
 remarkably little loose so don't know what 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.810
 maintenance is in other words degrees 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.720
 this one also does it just look at 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.220
 the design and mini suv and a bit the 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.149
 successive grand vitara 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.740
 that's where this actually will again 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.180
 derived for 2015 are likely 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.180
 and no production model or van see 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.840
 Hey 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.680
 and we are back on file from 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.090
 renault nl because the curtain is now 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.530
 advice from this car for an oh hey 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.990
 most important news of the turn 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.190
 it is initial paris concept it is 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.390
 hope things at once 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.400
 including a harbinger of a brand new one 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.840
 renault espace but not only those s 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.340
 fits the whole renault model one 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.260
 initials becomes kind 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.970
 super brand when it was without us 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.530
 owning leslie s series for example 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.690
 so your laurens from the battery 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.120
 registered once started with this 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.070
 here a lot of frills and yes 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.820
 strange shapes all you have to do 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.650
 to hold 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.850
 I secretly wonder a bit how the 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:57.650
 Christmas tree with the family of the battery 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:03:00.170
 looks the big news at lexus 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.420
 this lf-nx a study model for one 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.820
 new suv really an insanely beautiful thing 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.060
 very sharp drawn represents a little 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.350
 even the question is where should we get one 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.000
 places because I have my role in it 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.690
 discussion I would say emotionally and emotionally 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.180
 q5 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.580
 but yes now 5 stands opposite the rx and 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.470
 so in such a car under the rx and 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.400
 q3 so you looked like a big one again 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.170
 format 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.780
 anyway, of course, the very latest 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.220
 the latest generation of hybrid technology 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.350
 under a hood and which is very special 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.630
 the rear lights are kind of 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.340
 ears national project goes brakes than 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.470
 being the brake light we say on it 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.000
 road surface projected so that people are behind 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.709
 You see earlier that you have brakes and 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.010
 maria and the farther away it gets 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.010
 projected 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.270
 n-va lexus we continue to sister 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.120
 We as always this toyota toyota yaris 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.220
 hybrid-r quite a bomb because they have 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.650
 take sixty with 300hp in the front and I come 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.780
 another 120hp electro boost with if 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.010
 you want that okay with 16 as arrays village 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.150
 from watchmen not coming soon 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.640
 see their parents 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.230
 pure idea for the important 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.400
 content is that electro boost we go that 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.470
 not see back in those years server 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.150
 but who always want to exploit 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.560
 how can those offer make driving more enjoyable 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.220
 For example, make temporary 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.110
 120hp 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.460
 to give electro van extra and me 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.690
 buttons on the steering wheel structure needs 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.920
 and near the wonder what in the 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:21.049
 future go back to normal 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:22.610
 models if you have all those xhose for years 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.410
 it is nice to see how 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.960
 liquid that study models we through the 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.870
 years a career now make 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.160
 2007 had lemon or they study model 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.870
 from then on thought it was the next 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.310
 the show will be 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.410
 this is the successor the habit has 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.000
 just practical and deux chevaux sick 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.140
 really not in anymore 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.550
 yet it is a very important car 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.170
 was as it says here is one 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.640
 concept car but citroën has us 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.160
 assured that in Geneva 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.750

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.060
 the production version of this is 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.050
 shown and this will be the first version 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.840
 of a new line 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.030
 the c-line well think of the ds that is luxury 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.540
 that's premium that's all at the top 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.880
 rfc there is in the opposite direction 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.040
 ease of use comfort and favorable 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.110
 price and this will be the first of them 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.110
 parallel to the c4 hatchback 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.400
 scoring and simply clever is no nonsense 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.630
 marius a bit of an exception 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.970

 assistance systems in parking assistance that kind of 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.340
 things more than we go here to the 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.560
 back because it needs a bit 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.060
 become more family face from others 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.190
