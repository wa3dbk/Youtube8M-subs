00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
you can also pick see the cool thing

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.619 
you can also pick see the cool thing
about<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:49.980> if<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.059> selected

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
about it is that if you have selected

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.049 
about it is that if you have selected
previous<00:00:52.320> characters<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.010> creates<00:00:53.760> sort<00:00:53.910> of

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
previous characters it creates sort of

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.099 
previous characters it creates sort of
like<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.920> history<00:00:55.920> list<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:57.149> previously

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
like a history list so I previously

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.720 
like a history list so I previously
fought<00:00:58.379> with<00:00:58.739> sagathia<00:01:00.140> yoshimitsu<00:01:01.520> so<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.579> can

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
fought with sagathia yoshimitsu so I can

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.789 
fought with sagathia yoshimitsu so I can
just<00:01:02.879> click<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.899> would<00:01:04.500> save<00:01:04.680> you

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
just click on that and it would save you

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:05.960 
just click on that and it would save you
the<00:01:04.890> trouble<00:01:05.070> than<00:01:05.369> selecting<00:01:05.820> each

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the trouble than selecting each

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:16.000 
the trouble than selecting each
character<00:01:06.360> individual

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.240 

so<00:01:16.940> let's<00:01:17.360> pick<00:01:17.600> a<00:01:17.660> stage<00:01:19.990> see<00:01:20.990> I<00:01:21.230> like<00:01:22.040> this

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
so let's pick a stage see I like this

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.350 
so let's pick a stage see I like this
because<00:01:22.490> I<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.330> server<00:01:23.660> bought<00:01:23.930> head

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.610 

so<00:01:30.550> the<00:01:31.550> cool<00:01:31.760> thing<00:01:31.790> about<00:01:32.050> the<00:01:33.050> touchscreens

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
so the cool thing about the touchscreens

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.670 
so the cool thing about the touchscreens
is<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:34.250> because<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.330> PS<00:01:35.630> Vita<00:01:35.900> doesn't<00:01:36.530> have

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
is that because the PS Vita doesn't have

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.170 
is that because the PS Vita doesn't have
an<00:01:36.830> else<00:01:37.070> than<00:01:37.310> an<00:01:37.430> art<00:01:37.580> to<00:01:37.730> it<00:01:37.760> has<00:01:38.030> to

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
an else than an art to it has to

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.980 
an else than an art to it has to
compensate<00:01:38.510> so<00:01:39.080> if<00:01:40.040> you<00:01:40.280> want<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.550> do<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.990> hard

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
compensate so if you want to do a hard

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.380 
compensate so if you want to do a hard
punch<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:42.680> can<00:01:42.800> just<00:01:42.920> tap<00:01:43.040> here<00:01:43.370> is<00:01:43.880> our<00:01:44.090> punch

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390
