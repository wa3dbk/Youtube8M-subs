block<00:00:03.210> today<00:00:04.110> I've<00:00:04.410> been<00:00:04.500> reading<00:00:04.710> a<00:00:04.890> learning

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
block today I've been reading a learning

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.010 
block today I've been reading a learning
about<00:00:05.400> WCF<00:00:06.060> and<00:00:06.240> how<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.359> use<00:00:06.569> of<00:00:06.720> Windows

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
about WCF and how to use of Windows

Phone<00:00:07.170> 7<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.740> I<00:00:08.220> came<00:00:08.400> up<00:00:08.490> with<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.670> small

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
Phone 7 and I came up with a small

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.009 
Phone 7 and I came up with a small
application<00:00:09.330> which<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:09.570> think<00:00:09.780> might<00:00:09.870> be

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
application which I think might be

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.990 
application which I think might be
useful<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.679> developer<00:00:11.040> community<00:00:11.519> you

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
useful to the developer community you

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.270 
useful to the developer community you
can<00:00:12.120> download<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.480> source<00:00:12.660> code<00:00:12.750> for<00:00:13.019> this

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280

features<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.380> quite<00:00:19.590> tricky<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.939> have<00:00:21.060> to

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
features is quite tricky and you have to

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.660 
features is quite tricky and you have to
simulate<00:00:21.330> GPS<00:00:21.900> points<00:00:22.109> now<00:00:22.920> some<00:00:23.250> people<00:00:23.279> have

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
simulate GPS points now some people have

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.089 
simulate GPS points now some people have
downloaded<00:00:24.510> groups<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.199> GPS<00:00:25.590> points<00:00:25.769> and

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
downloaded groups of GPS points and

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.339 
downloaded groups of GPS points and
loaded<00:00:26.430> them<00:00:26.570> based<00:00:27.570> on<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.779> timer<00:00:28.050> to

loaded them based on the timer to

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.130 
loaded them based on the timer to
simulate<00:00:29.039> some<00:00:29.250> sort<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.490> movement<00:00:30.140> others

simulate some sort of movement others

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.990 
simulate some sort of movement others
are<00:00:31.289> just<00:00:31.320> randomly<00:00:31.740> generated<00:00:32.520> latitude<00:00:32.940> and

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
are just randomly generated latitude and

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.700 
are just randomly generated latitude and
longitude<00:00:33.329> values<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:34.230> these<00:00:34.320> methods<00:00:34.649> are

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
longitude values and these methods are

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.110 
longitude values and these methods are
fine<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.010> they<00:00:35.100> work<00:00:35.280> but<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.640> think<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.969> get

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
fine and they work but I think you get

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.720 
fine and they work but I think you get
more<00:00:36.329> accurate<00:00:36.840> results<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.620> readings<00:00:37.890> if

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
more accurate results and readings if

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.840 
more accurate results and readings if
you<00:00:38.879> combine<00:00:39.180> bing<00:00:40.170> maps<00:00:40.200> with<00:00:41.010> WCF<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.670> order

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
you combine bing maps with WCF in order

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.030 
you combine bing maps with WCF in order
to<00:00:41.940> retrieve<00:00:42.270> GPS<00:00:42.690> data<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.800> what

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
to retrieve GPS data so this is what

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.660 
to retrieve GPS data so this is what
this<00:00:44.460> application<00:00:44.940> does<00:00:45.090> now<00:00:46.280> as<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.489> see

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
this application does now as you can see

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.389 
this application does now as you can see
this<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> standard<00:00:49.079> winform<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> winform

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
this is a standard winform and a winform

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.250 
this is a standard winform and a winform
is<00:00:50.640> actually<00:00:50.879> hosting<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> service<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.629> WC

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
latitude/longitude very so your mouth

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.240 
latitude/longitude very so your mouth
actually<00:01:03.180> dictates<00:01:03.629> where<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.470> phone<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.739> so

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
actually dictates where the phone is so

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.960 
actually dictates where the phone is so
to<00:01:05.309> speak<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.299> if<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.420> zoom<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.750> read<00:01:06.900> closely

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
to speak so if we zoom in read closely

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.000 
to speak so if we zoom in read closely
you<00:01:08.970> get<00:01:09.210> off<00:01:09.330> see<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.780> pleasure<00:01:10.470> can<00:01:10.710> zoom<00:01:10.860> in

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
you get off see a pleasure can zoom in

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.740 
you get off see a pleasure can zoom in
the<00:01:11.130> more<00:01:11.280> realistic<00:01:11.760> chance<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.540> walking

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the more realistic chance of you walking

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.719 
the more realistic chance of you walking
along<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.110> road<00:01:13.260> would<00:01:13.439> be<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.580> can

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
along the road would be so you can

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.030 
along the road would be so you can
simulate<00:01:14.909> someone<00:01:15.299> walking<00:01:15.450> down<00:01:16.040> cuvee

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
simulate someone walking down cuvee

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.630 
simulate someone walking down cuvee
bundling<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.990> then<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.710> threshold<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.400> is

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
bundling and then the threshold is is

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.190 
bundling and then the threshold is is
something<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.390> still<00:01:21.689> working<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.110> not

something on still working it's not

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.719 
something on still working it's not
quite<00:01:22.409> perfected<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.159> does<00:01:23.340> were<00:01:23.549> two

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
quite perfected but it does were two

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.960 
quite perfected but it does were two
degree<00:01:24.080> what<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.170> does<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.740> returns<00:01:26.700> true

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
degree what it does it it returns true

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.030 
degree what it does it it returns true
after<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.570> mouse<00:01:27.750> cursor<00:01:28.200> has<00:01:28.380> moved<00:01:28.950> the

equivalent<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.579> 20<00:01:30.210> meters<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:31.320> obviously

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
equivalent of 20 meters so obviously

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.530 
equivalent of 20 meters so obviously
when<00:01:31.860> you're<00:01:31.950> zoomed<00:01:32.729> out<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.030> far<00:01:33.210> moving

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
when you're zoomed out this far moving

when you're zoomed out this far moving
20<00:01:33.780> metres<00:01:34.079> quite<00:01:34.320> easy<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> closer<00:01:35.610> you

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
20 metres quite easy but a closer you

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.620 
20 metres quite easy but a closer you
zoom<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.200> moving<00:01:37.200> 20<00:01:37.409> meters<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.829> not<00:01:38.070> as<00:01:38.250> easy

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
zoom in moving 20 meters is not as easy

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.410 
zoom in moving 20 meters is not as easy
within<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.659> set<00:01:39.900> time<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:42.119> can

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
within a set time so you can you can

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.210 
within a set time so you can you can
mess<00:01:42.659> around<00:01:42.689> with<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.200> determine<00:01:43.860> how

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
mess around with that to determine how

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.330 
mess around with that to determine how
far<00:01:44.430> someone's<00:01:44.729> moved<00:01:45.560> but<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.860> key<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.189> to

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
far someone's moved but the key is to

seconds<00:02:22.830> on<00:02:22.860> something<00:02:23.129> you<00:02:23.250> take<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.879> GPS

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
seconds on something you take the GPS

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.750 
seconds on something you take the GPS
coordinate<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.379> add<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.799> list<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.190> you

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
coordinate and add it to a list and you

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.820 
coordinate and add it to a list and you
automatically<00:02:27.269> then<00:02:27.569> have<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.810> list<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.319> GPS

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.289 
automatically then have a list of GPS
coordinates<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.519> can<00:02:29.670> mess<00:02:30.269> around

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
coordinates that you can mess around

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.559 
coordinates that you can mess around
with<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.720> way<00:02:30.840> in<00:02:30.989> your<00:02:31.110> application<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:32.569> it's

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
with the way in your application so it's

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.630 
with the way in your application so it's
quite<00:02:33.720> it's<00:02:33.900> quite<00:02:33.989> easy<00:02:34.349> way<00:02:34.709> now<00:02:34.890> to<00:02:34.920> get<00:02:35.459> all

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
quite it's quite easy way now to get all

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.250 
quite it's quite easy way now to get all
your<00:02:35.760> corners<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.180> want<00:02:36.390> of<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.989> certain

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
your corners you want of a certain

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.660 
your corners you want of a certain
location<00:02:37.349> you<00:02:37.769> want<00:02:37.890> without<00:02:38.250> having<00:02:38.430> to

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
location you want without having to

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.080 
location you want without having to
manually<00:02:38.970> try<00:02:39.299> and<00:02:39.450> find<00:02:39.660> information<00:02:40.700> so<00:02:41.700> I

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
manually try and find information so I

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.059 
manually try and find information so I
think<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:43.170> pretty<00:02:43.319> much<00:02:43.440> sums<00:02:43.650> up<00:02:43.769> the<00:02:43.860> video

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
think that pretty much sums up the video

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.100 
think that pretty much sums up the video
