00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
last week it was making it sound really

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.859 
last week it was making it sound really
difficult<00:00:21.630> but<00:00:23.180> spoon<00:00:24.180> lighting<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.570> not

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
difficult but spoon lighting is not

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.019 
difficult but spoon lighting is not
difficult<00:00:25.199> at<00:00:25.680> all<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.220> i<00:00:26.460> just<00:00:26.730> wanted<00:00:27.000> to

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
difficult at all so i just wanted to

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.200 
difficult at all so i just wanted to
show<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.449> instead<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.910> explained<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.179> in

I<00:02:06.170> love<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:07.380> wool<00:02:07.680> my<00:02:07.920> sister<00:02:08.310> gave<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.789> me

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
I love this wool my sister gave it to me

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.100 
I love this wool my sister gave it to me
I<00:02:09.000> think<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:10.110> think<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.160> really<00:02:11.459> fun<00:02:11.970> color

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
I think I think it's a really fun color

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.680 
I think I think it's a really fun color
and<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:13.550> i'll<00:02:14.550> probably<00:02:14.880> make<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.180> start<00:02:15.660> for

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
and I i'll probably make this start for

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.770 
and I i'll probably make this start for
a<00:02:15.870> girl<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.230> guess<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:17.400> here<00:02:18.060> we<00:02:18.180> are<00:02:18.360> at<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.510> end

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
a girl I guess so here we are at the end

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.290 
a girl I guess so here we are at the end
now<00:02:19.410> this<00:02:19.620> one<00:02:19.860> ended<00:02:20.130> up<00:02:20.280> behind<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:20.880> no<00:02:21.000> loop

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
now this one ended up behind so no loop

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.850 
now this one ended up behind so no loop
around<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:23.630> exact<00:02:24.630> same<00:02:24.930> thing<00:02:25.290> doesn't

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
around and exact same thing doesn't

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.410 
around and exact same thing doesn't
matter<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.160> you're<00:02:26.370> at<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.700> end<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:27.360> just

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
matter that you're at the end you just

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.920 
matter that you're at the end you just
go<00:02:27.630> up<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.020> over<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.300> then<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.570> come<00:02:30.900> back

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
go up and over it and then I come back

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.050 
go up and over it and then I come back
in<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:32.190> same<00:02:32.370> way<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.840> should<00:02:34.640> alternate<00:02:35.640> a

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
in the same way so it should alternate a

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.570 
in the same way so it should alternate a
little<00:02:36.660> bit<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.950> you're<00:02:40.950> doing<00:02:41.160> up<00:02:41.340> and

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
little bit so that you're doing up and

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.030 
little bit so that you're doing up and
over<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.600> alternate<00:02:43.050> ones<00:02:43.230> now<00:02:43.890> that

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
over on the alternate ones now that

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.550 
over on the alternate ones now that
depends<00:02:44.459> on<00:02:44.760> how<00:02:45.240> many<00:02:45.300> sections<00:02:46.020> you<00:02:46.350> made

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
depends on how many sections you made

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.380 
depends on how many sections you made
and<00:02:46.860> this<00:02:47.250> works<00:02:47.459> out<00:02:47.580> really<00:02:47.760> nice<00:02:48.030> if<00:02:48.270> you

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
and this works out really nice if you

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.410 
and this works out really nice if you
have<00:02:48.570> an<00:02:48.750> even<00:02:49.110> number<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.560> sections<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.420> don't

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
have an even number of sections I don't

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.320 
have an even number of sections I don't
think<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:51.870> do<00:02:51.930> Oh<00:02:52.700> we'll<00:02:53.700> see<00:02:53.880> what<00:02:54.060> kind<00:02:54.270> of

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
think I do Oh we'll see what kind of

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.510 
think I do Oh we'll see what kind of
pattern<00:02:54.690> comes<00:02:54.989> out<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.350> all<00:02:55.470> of<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.770> in<00:02:56.370> the

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
pattern comes out of all of this in the

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.780 
pattern comes out of all of this in the
end<00:02:57.320> i'm<00:02:58.320> going<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.530> just<00:02:59.190> keep<00:02:59.340> going<00:02:59.670> around

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
end i'm going to just keep going around

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.440 
end i'm going to just keep going around
and<00:03:00.360> around<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.989> around<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:03.090> pause<00:03:03.420> the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
and around and around and so pause the

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.750 
and around and around and so pause the
video<00:03:03.870> for<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.530> little<00:03:04.650> bit<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.100> then<00:03:05.160> i'll

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
video for a little bit and then i'll

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.280 
video for a little bit and then i'll
show<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.150> how<00:03:07.190> it<00:03:08.190> starts<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.640> look<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.290> the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
show you how it starts to look and the

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.229 
show you how it starts to look and the
reason<00:03:10.620> we<00:03:10.739> cut<00:03:10.980> off<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.160> bottom<00:03:11.760> when<00:03:12.120> we

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
reason we cut off the bottom when we

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.540 
reason we cut off the bottom when we
made<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.540> spool<00:03:12.870> knitter<00:03:13.080> is<00:03:13.350> so<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:13.800> it<00:03:14.400> all

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
made the spool knitter is so that it all

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.229 
made the spool knitter is so that it all
starts<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.300> come<00:03:15.510> through<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.200> go<00:03:17.000> out<00:03:18.000> the

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
starts to come through and go out the

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.729 
starts to come through and go out the
bottom<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:18.750> now<00:03:19.110> you<00:03:19.140> have<00:03:19.290> some<00:03:19.560> place

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
bottom and that now you have some place

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:26.150 
bottom and that now you have some place
for<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.130> go<00:03:20.450> I<00:03:22.760> will<00:03:23.760> be<00:03:23.880> right<00:03:24.120> back
