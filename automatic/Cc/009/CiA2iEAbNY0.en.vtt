was and kind of how it evolved through

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.160 
was and kind of how it evolved through
this<00:02:22.100> year<00:02:22.340> i<00:02:22.489> started<00:02:23.060> out<00:02:23.480> actually<00:02:23.660> when<00:02:24.140> I

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
this year i started out actually when I

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.590 
this year i started out actually when I
first<00:02:24.890> showed<00:02:25.160> any<00:02:25.700> interest<00:02:25.790> in<00:02:26.180> music<00:02:26.329> I

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
first showed any interest in music I

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.569 
first showed any interest in music I
wanted<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:26.959> be<00:02:27.049> a<00:02:27.079> drummer<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:27.560> my<00:02:28.310> brother

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
wanted to be a drummer and my brother

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.370 
wanted to be a drummer and my brother
convince<00:02:29.329> me<00:02:29.390> not<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.600> be<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:29.840> drover<00:02:30.110> because

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
convince me not to be a drover because

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.420 
convince me not to be a drover because
he<00:02:30.500> said<00:02:30.680> look<00:02:30.799> at<00:02:30.890> all<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.040> stuff<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.340> have

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
he said look at all the stuff you have

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.880 
he said look at all the stuff you have
to<00:02:31.459> carry

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
to carry

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.330 
to carry
so<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:33.090> decide<00:02:33.870> what<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.230> tards<00:02:34.650> was<00:02:34.950> probably

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
so I decide what the tards was probably

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.680 
so I decide what the tards was probably
the<00:02:35.460> way<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.610> go<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:35.819> I<00:02:36.030> actually<00:02:36.180> started<00:02:36.480> on

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
the way to go and I actually started on

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.790 
the way to go and I actually started on
that<00:02:36.780> bright<00:02:36.990> base<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.470> then<00:02:37.560> moved<00:02:37.740> to

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
that bright base and then moved to

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.460 
that bright base and then moved to
guitar<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:39.630> know<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.780> started<00:02:40.110> off<00:02:40.260> as

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
guitar and you know I started off as

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:50.039 
guitar and you know I started off as
most<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:41.280> know<00:02:41.370> kids<00:02:41.850> start<00:02:42.120> up

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.080 

so<00:02:51.049> that<00:02:51.290> would<00:02:51.439> have<00:02:51.530> been<00:02:51.680> early<00:02:52.489> 70s<00:02:53.000> is

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
so that would have been early 70s is

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.819 
so that would have been early 70s is
that<00:02:53.239> when<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:53.450> started<00:02:53.810> no<00:02:54.019> no<00:02:54.260> why<00:02:54.409> I<00:02:54.439> would

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
that when you started no no why I would

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.780

if I was going to do this for a living

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.719 
if I was going to do this for a living

because I decided what I was about 13 or
14<00:04:25.910> that<00:04:26.210> this<00:04:26.330> is<00:04:26.449> what<00:04:26.570> I<00:04:26.599> was<00:04:26.780> wanted<00:04:27.139> to<00:04:27.260> do

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
14 that this is what I was wanted to do

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.029 
14 that this is what I was wanted to do
that<00:04:27.650> I<00:04:28.340> couldn't<00:04:28.970> just<00:04:29.169> go<00:04:30.169> about<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:30.590> you
