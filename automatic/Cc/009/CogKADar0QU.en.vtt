race when he was a little younger he
wasn't<00:00:28.390> that<00:00:28.480> good<00:00:28.630> he<00:00:29.470> would<00:00:29.830> be<00:00:29.949> like<00:00:30.160> the

wasn't that good he would be like the
weekend<00:00:30.939> warrior<00:00:31.390> in<00:00:31.599> this<00:00:31.869> video<00:00:32.110> game<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.910> he

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
weekend warrior in this video game so he

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.180 
weekend warrior in this video game so he
got<00:00:34.330> me<00:00:34.510> into<00:00:34.750> it<00:00:34.780> and<00:00:35.050> I<00:00:35.350> just<00:00:35.920> kind<00:00:36.100> of<00:00:36.130> had

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
got me into it and I just kind of had

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.640 
got me into it and I just kind of had
the<00:00:36.340> bug<00:00:36.520> from<00:00:36.700> there<00:00:37.140> back<00:00:38.140> when<00:00:38.200> I<00:00:38.410> like<00:00:38.620> I

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
the bug from there back when I like I

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.230 
the bug from there back when I like I
know<00:00:38.830> once<00:00:39.010> we<00:00:39.070> fought<00:00:39.400> it<00:00:39.700> would<00:00:39.880> I<00:00:40.030> used<00:00:40.180> to

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.240 
know once we fought it would I used to

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.030 
know once we fought it would I used to
go<00:00:40.360> to<00:00:40.480> the<00:00:40.570> gate<00:00:40.720> like<00:00:40.930> I<00:00:41.140> look<00:00:41.500> dude<00:00:41.710> oh<00:00:41.890> you

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
go to the gate like I look dude oh you

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.860 
go to the gate like I look dude oh you
know<00:00:42.190> why<00:00:42.310> y'all<00:00:42.460> showed<00:00:42.670> up<00:00:42.880> there<00:00:43.480> is<00:00:43.630> no

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
know why y'all showed up there is no

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.570 
know why y'all showed up there is no
sense<00:00:44.260> if<00:00:44.470> y'all<00:00:44.650> even<00:00:44.800> be<00:00:45.010> in<00:00:45.100> here<00:00:45.130> right<00:00:45.310> now

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
sense if y'all even be in here right now

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.520 
sense if y'all even be in here right now
like<00:00:45.850> you<00:00:46.150> can<00:00:46.300> get<00:00:46.450> second<00:00:46.900> through<00:00:47.140> 20th<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
like you can get second through 20th and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.530 
like you can get second through 20th and
that<00:00:50.530> mentality<00:00:50.860> is<00:00:51.160> James<00:00:51.520> and<00:00:51.850> get<00:00:52.390> you

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
that mentality is James and get you

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.389 
that mentality is James and get you
kicked<00:00:53.050> a<00:00:53.170> few<00:00:53.350> times

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.889 

the<00:00:58.399> main<00:00:58.579> ejector<00:00:59.059> was<00:00:59.210> to<00:00:59.300> come<00:00:59.449> up<00:00:59.629> and<00:00:59.750> see

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
the main ejector was to come up and see

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.750 
the main ejector was to come up and see
the<00:00:59.960> game<00:01:00.199> make<00:01:00.469> sure<00:01:00.500> that<00:01:00.800> was<00:01:00.920> exactly<00:01:01.519> how

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
the game make sure that was exactly how

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.000 
the game make sure that was exactly how
I<00:01:01.879> wanted<00:01:02.239> it<00:01:02.390> so<00:01:03.050> in<00:01:03.500> this<00:01:03.559> particular<00:01:03.680> event

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
I wanted it so in this particular event

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.560 
I wanted it so in this particular event
you<00:01:04.339> kind<00:01:04.519> of<00:01:04.549> sit<00:01:04.670> down<00:01:04.850> with<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:05.089> storyboard

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
you kind of sit down with the storyboard

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.270 
you kind of sit down with the storyboard
Oh<00:01:05.659> kind<00:01:05.990> of<00:01:06.020> want<00:01:06.320> to<00:01:06.380> see<00:01:06.530> but<00:01:06.770> it<00:01:07.009> says<00:01:07.130> six

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
Oh kind of want to see but it says six

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.859 
Oh kind of want to see but it says six
big<00:01:07.430> warehouse<00:01:07.820> with<00:01:08.000> all<00:01:08.119> these<00:01:08.210> cameras<00:01:08.630> and

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
big warehouse with all these cameras and

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.109 
big warehouse with all these cameras and
these<00:01:08.990> cameras<00:01:09.350> pick<00:01:09.560> up<00:01:09.710> these<00:01:09.830> sensors<00:01:10.220> and

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
these cameras pick up these sensors and

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.670 
these cameras pick up these sensors and
all<00:01:11.210> these<00:01:11.299> sensors<00:01:11.690> are<00:01:11.810> on<00:01:11.930> like<00:01:12.470> I<00:01:12.500> say<00:01:12.649> on

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
all these sensors are on like I say on

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.290 
all these sensors are on like I say on
that<00:01:12.830> joint<00:01:13.130> locations<00:01:13.640> sort<00:01:13.880> of<00:01:14.030> pick<00:01:14.149> up

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
that joint locations sort of pick up

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.260 
that joint locations sort of pick up
what<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:14.810> actors<00:01:15.200> doing<00:01:15.409> okay<00:01:16.280> all<00:01:16.880> that<00:01:17.090> data

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
what the actors doing okay all that data

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.120 
what the actors doing okay all that data
gets<00:01:17.780> put<00:01:18.229> on<00:01:18.350> the<00:01:18.440> scale<00:01:18.619> attacks<00:01:18.890> really

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
gets put on the scale attacks really

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.090 
gets put on the scale attacks really
cool<00:01:19.310> so<00:01:19.580> I<00:01:19.640> grabbed<00:01:20.149> her<00:01:20.299> arm<00:01:20.330> like<00:01:20.780> this<00:01:21.100> ok

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
cool so I grabbed her arm like this ok

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.070 
cool so I grabbed her arm like this ok
so<00:01:22.670> when<00:01:22.790> he's<00:01:22.880> a<00:01:22.909> fairly<00:01:23.360> good<00:01:23.540> distance<00:01:23.960> away

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
so when he's a fairly good distance away

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.899 
so when he's a fairly good distance away
for<00:01:24.470> physics<00:01:24.860> kicks<00:01:25.130> in<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:25.580> then<00:01:25.790> the

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
for physics kicks in and then the

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.700 
for physics kicks in and then the
animation<00:01:26.330> is<00:01:26.450> gone<00:01:26.659> all<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.290> physics<00:01:27.649> just

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
animation is gone all the physics just

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.469 
animation is gone all the physics just
happens<00:01:28.280> my<00:01:28.369> territory<00:01:28.789> I'll<00:01:28.910> just<00:01:29.060> hit<00:01:29.360> the

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
happens my territory I'll just hit the

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.169 
happens my territory I'll just hit the
ground<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:29.869> behave<00:01:30.289> like<00:01:30.440> a<00:01:30.530> pretty<00:01:30.800> much<00:01:31.179> the

00:01:32.169 --> 00:01:32.179 
ground and behave like a pretty much the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:33.520 
ground and behave like a pretty much the
whole<00:01:32.210> characters<00:01:32.750> have<00:01:32.899> made<00:01:33.080> out<00:01:33.200> of<00:01:33.289> clock

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
whole characters have made out of clock

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.560 
whole characters have made out of clock
we've<00:01:33.860> got<00:01:33.979> like<00:01:34.159> a<00:01:34.190> slider<00:01:34.490> right<00:01:34.580> here<00:01:34.940> so

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
we've got like a slider right here so

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.149 
we've got like a slider right here so
faster<00:01:35.960> you<00:01:36.110> go<00:01:36.259> the<00:01:36.289> more<00:01:36.470> kind<00:01:36.800> of<00:01:36.920> showed

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
faster you go the more kind of showed

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.219 
faster you go the more kind of showed
they<00:01:37.640> make<00:01:37.820> up<00:01:38.000> their<00:01:38.090> own<00:01:38.149> mind<00:01:38.479> to<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.050> certain

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
they make up their own mind to a certain

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.200 
they make up their own mind to a certain
extent<00:01:39.619> they<00:01:40.190> know<00:01:40.340> how<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.520> turn<00:01:40.819> they<00:01:41.060> know

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
extent they know how to turn they know

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.899 
extent they know how to turn they know
what<00:01:41.330> it<00:01:41.420> takes<00:01:41.450> a<00:01:41.720> turn<00:01:41.950> just<00:01:42.950> always<00:01:43.159> known

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
what it takes a turn just always known

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.050 
what it takes a turn just always known
as<00:01:44.119> got<00:01:44.479> it<00:01:44.569> look<00:01:44.720> so<00:01:44.840> much<00:01:44.990> me<00:01:45.819> you<00:01:46.819> know<00:01:46.909> we

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
as got it look so much me you know we

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.430 
as got it look so much me you know we
are<00:01:47.179> making<00:01:47.360> video<00:01:47.630> games<00:01:47.659> and<00:01:48.140> trying<00:01:48.380> to

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
are making video games and trying to

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.960 
are making video games and trying to
maintain<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:48.800> little<00:01:49.280> of<00:01:49.399> realism<00:01:49.700> but

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
maintain a little of realism but

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.120 
maintain a little of realism but
sometimes<00:01:50.929> its<00:01:51.110> nice<00:01:51.259> nice<00:01:51.649> to<00:01:51.770> just<00:01:51.890> push<00:01:52.100> it

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
sometimes its nice nice to just push it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.219 
sometimes its nice nice to just push it
a<00:01:52.280> little<00:01:52.310> bit<00:01:52.670> I'm<00:01:53.000> like<00:01:53.210> a<00:01:53.240> like<00:01:53.600> fan<00:01:53.929> euro

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
a little bit I'm like a like fan euro
