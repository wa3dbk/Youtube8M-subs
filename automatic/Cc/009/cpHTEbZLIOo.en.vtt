00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
well we have the 2015 KTM 250 s XF and

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.540 
well we have the 2015 KTM 250 s XF and
guess<00:00:20.330> what<00:00:20.570> I<00:00:20.600> believe<00:00:20.930> 2015<00:00:21.920> is<00:00:22.099> the<00:00:22.130> year<00:00:22.279> of

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
guess what I believe 2015 is the year of

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.600 
guess what I believe 2015 is the year of
refinement<00:00:23.710> KTM<00:00:24.710> is<00:00:24.740> followed<00:00:25.189> suit

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
refinement KTM is followed suit

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.980 
refinement KTM is followed suit
they've<00:00:25.730> gone<00:00:25.910> that<00:00:26.150> direction<00:00:26.450> as<00:00:26.689> well<00:00:26.840> and

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
they've gone that direction as well and

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.749 
they've gone that direction as well and
I<00:00:27.050> think<00:00:27.110> that's<00:00:27.439> great<00:00:27.710> because<00:00:27.950> they<00:00:28.369> have<00:00:28.520> a

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
I think that's great because they have a

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.210 
I think that's great because they have a
very<00:00:29.029> good<00:00:29.270> bike<00:00:29.480> man<00:00:30.050> what<00:00:30.320> a<00:00:30.350> potent<00:00:30.830> engine

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
very good bike man what a potent engine

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.979 
very good bike man what a potent engine
but<00:00:31.640> what<00:00:31.760> they<00:00:31.880> did<00:00:32.119> they<00:00:32.480> updated<00:00:32.870> their

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
but what they did they updated their

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.400 
but what they did they updated their
suspension<00:00:33.710> they<00:00:34.370> have<00:00:34.519> the<00:00:34.640> 4c<00:00:35.090> s4<00:00:35.570> from<00:00:35.840> WP

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
suspension they have the 4c s4 from WP

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.189 
suspension they have the 4c s4 from WP
which<00:00:37.040> is<00:00:37.220> great<00:00:37.460> because<00:00:37.850> this<00:00:38.150> came<00:00:38.420> on<00:00:39.019> the

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
which is great because this came on the

in<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:47.059> past<00:00:47.299> we've<00:00:47.540> had<00:00:47.570> problems<00:00:48.170> with

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
in the past we've had problems with

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.189 
in the past we've had problems with
Forks<00:00:48.799> we're<00:00:49.339> hoping<00:00:49.699> that<00:00:49.909> the<00:00:50.150> four<00:00:50.390> CS<00:00:50.690> Fork

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
Forks we're hoping that the four CS Fork

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.860 
Forks we're hoping that the four CS Fork
much<00:00:51.559> better<00:00:51.890> what<00:00:52.430> they<00:00:52.549> also<00:00:52.729> did<00:00:53.120> is<00:00:53.330> they

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
much better what they also did is they

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.649 
much better what they also did is they
looked<00:00:54.110> at<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:54.650> shock<00:00:54.920> as<00:00:55.129> well<00:00:55.159> the<00:00:55.820> shock<00:00:56.479> is

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
looked at the shock as well the shock is

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.289 
looked at the shock as well the shock is
four<00:00:56.900> millimeters<00:00:57.379> longer<00:00:57.790> they<00:00:58.790> change<00:00:59.089> the

00:00:59.289 --> 00:00:59.299 
four millimeters longer they change the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:01.390 
four millimeters longer they change the
linkage<00:00:59.720> you<00:01:00.170> also<00:01:00.350> notice<00:01:00.769> we've<00:01:01.250> had

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
linkage you also notice we've had
