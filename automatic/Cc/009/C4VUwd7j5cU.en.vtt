 a new playlist that's going to 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.420
 consist of how to place mods or how 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.070
 place skins in the game that world 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.050
 worth this simple is something that we 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.520
 you have asked a lot of people in the 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.039
 comments and also through the 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.410
 twitter and the other day when a great 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.470
 our friend that since 91 with whom 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.169

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.390
 launcher old and cher was not going 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.339
 that I could not put skin and say hey hey 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.469

 start or let's put first then 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:47.979
 I think that right now one of the most 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.839
 complete or one of the most interesting 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:52.479
 that also gives a lot of game that is the 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.519
 of pokemon ok let's compose the mod 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:57.370
 of pokémon that convert to our world 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.049
 of equihua then in the fantastic villa 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.510

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.010
 bichejos or call it as you want here what 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.170

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.180
 by the 90s 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.770
 he gave me a real complaint when I 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.410
 I did because I spent a paste but 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.050

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.270
 google chrome and as you can see I have everything 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.520

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.880
 hammers go from here that one you have

 a more polito charge varied plan tour to 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.830
 hunting one of my favorites that when 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.960
 when it started with the pokémon game and 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.910
 pixar is also worth here you have everything 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.000

 mosquito is a coaching is good so much 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.190
 of the pokemon is worth and the monkeys first 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.070
 Let's get down to business, first of all 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:59.850
 download the files we do here 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.670
 where it puts download we give to crystal 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.009
 here it is well hidden by default 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.770
 dais to show here to show and you give 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.300
 Well here is worth wish pokemon world 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.190
 ok with the files because we give 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.060
 here a media file 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.830
 it opens up we give here to download 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.560
 ok and once we download the 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.540
 archive 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.640
 they will place us here okay this is the 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.489
 pokemon that install vale we open it is 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.010
 a rar file and as you can see here 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.020
 we have all the pokemon files 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.730
 necessary we are going to open here a 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.110
 binder 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.110
 let's call for example pokemon 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.819
 and we are going to save all the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.790
 pokemon files 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.049
 but we save are already being extracted and 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.560
 in principle they should be inside they go to 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:49.889
 check what is corroborated all 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.870
 we close here the winrar and good as the 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:56.750
 world and cher goes wrong, it's the 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.420
 program that is used to put skin 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.959
 I have resorted to another that is having 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.659
 closed the download a moment here that 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.569
 is this the asset browser is worth here 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.919
 you have the asset browser that I'll put 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.049
 also the description to download not 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.790
 you worry and with this one we are going to place 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.169
 the skin that will modify our 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.980
 characters with the aesthetics of the 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:20.860
 pokémon trainers 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.659
 here we give it here we close and good 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.690
 here you have the make produce too 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.940
 let's put it here another folder 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.770
 let's call set 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.860
 browser over here 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.540
 and we do the same thing now now 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.310
 we have the essential elements 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.100
 to put on what we have to do 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.760
 later it is very simple 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.760
 we give you equipment 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.090
 where you do not have the game installed 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.620
 we look here equal value with recommend 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.060
 the main files that was changed 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.880
 when a mod is installed are the data 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.130
 data 23 and data 4 and in fact data 4 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.020
 includes the translations so very 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.700
 simple we open another folder os what 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.340
 you can put on the desktop what I put in 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.050
 folder because I think it's a little bit more 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:10.040
 ordered everything we give to the curriculum 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.040
 original and create and we do here 4 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.320
 control ce to copy 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.579
 and here we pay it and the four 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.079
 original file pasted why 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.459
 we say this in case some day you want 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.210
 return to the initial configuration 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:26.910
 you only have to put another 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.680
 Once you paste the file is because it is 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.000
 very simple we will install pokemon 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.190
 we just have to go to the folder 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.960
 because we 're not going to put it here to put 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.389
 I avoid the original and we will endow 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.760
 to one and dated today from idiot 4 sorry and 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.740
 we drag here we drag what it says 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.750
 move and replace that if we want 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.970
 again move replace already had 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.280
 the unit data would be changed to 4 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.229
 right now we would have exchanged 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.630
 what can be the world of pokemon and 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.430
 and in turn also because of the respect for 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.850
 pokemon now we have to install 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.420
 what are the skins of the files that 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.690
 we do for it 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.410
 we give back good open and not 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.690
 over here 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.100
 human models and cuban are worth all these 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.230
 are the folders of the different 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.490
 coaches because we have that there 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.960
 we open the browser as I said 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.129
 first let's put left here 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.319
 and we give to load 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:17.419
 simple this is very simple how 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:19.429
 it works we give to file we give to open 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.009
 and we look for the kiwi folder on 

00:05:19.429 --> 00:05:25.040
 original that would be in this case here 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:28.400
 As you can see, we opened it 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.770
 and we give him to accept we leave all the 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.590
 files and we would have to use the 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.470
 data 1 we do now is simpler 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.930
 we still take the data 1 we give to 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:43.410
 edit and we give to insert 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.740
 we go to the desk we go to the 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.930
 pokemon folder 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.580
 We give you open models and we give 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.060
 brenda then now that we have to go 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.160
 doing then go introducing for 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:58.430
 get the couplet all the files one 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.360
 to one we are here introduced in pigs 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:04.650
 we give football 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:07.379
 we give again we give to image and 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.210
 we give through adif and we put human 

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:10.889
 health 3 is now worth for example already 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:15.090
 it would since it is so 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:16.500
 would be the body or the aesthetics of pledge 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.729
 now we go for the age and we do 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:22.680
 again the same body 4 we load 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:26.870
 back to give witch is here 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:29.060
 reload we give food 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.950
 again equal and good this would be the 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.320
 esthetic aesthetics I say but 2000 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:36.080
 already two the mechanics to follow is 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.340
 simple truth let's collect let's 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.710
 to leave it here to introduce 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:42.230
 some pokémon trainers to go back 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:45.680
 about our steps that we do 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.990
 simple here in the description you will have 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.200
 the link is worth the leaf as the forum to 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:53.810
 this stable we give you here urges we have 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.880
 here we can work files we give here 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.340
 we downloaded the mediafire file and we 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.200
 all the archives will come out 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.610
 corresponding that we are going to 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.710
 unzip in a folder it is worth 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.000
 this later on the other hand we have to 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.260
 have the laser produce that also what 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.350
 I will put in the description is not necessary 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.760
 in installations an executable and not a 

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:13.560
 executable direct and does not need anything 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.990
 more than we do once that's done 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.450
 we replace the files in the folder 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:21.030
 of eki original wall and then with the 

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.919
 he said we are going to exchange the 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:26.160
 way you get sealed already is this way of 

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:27.690

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:42.150
 way to reciprocate or reward
