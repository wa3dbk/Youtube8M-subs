the button to see the time because of
course<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.809> would<00:00:39.930> use<00:00:40.140> too<00:00:40.379> much<00:00:40.500> battery

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
rechargeable so every month or so you

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.479 
rechargeable so every month or so you
can<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.110> connect<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.710> your<00:00:49.800> computer<00:00:50.309> for

a while to top-up the battery the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.380 
a while to top-up the battery the
display<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.890> actually<00:00:56.039> very<00:00:56.430> easy<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.850> read
