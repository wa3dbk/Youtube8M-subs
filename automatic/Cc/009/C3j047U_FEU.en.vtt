00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.870
 so that we can not users and thought 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.700
 means 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.700
 this is seen visiting those who are engaged 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.610
 we take here the least personal things of lovers 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.150
 those who work with them hatch down Dima 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.640
 form 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:23.260
 from different regions I ran across one and 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:26.670
 same complex issue except 2 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:31.689
 millimeters on your terms 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:35.020
 it means solving this problem I came 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:38.550
 I did not try different glue quickly 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:42.370
 systems we place and edge removers 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.370
 melanin is secluded here everyone wants glue 2 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:50.460
 millimeter plastic so-called 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:53.680
 pvc for this will be required 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.219
 first thing so here is the tassel itself 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.500
 small 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:02.590
 stationery knife you can buy good 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:07.480
 it is in this case to buy bison 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:12.060
 yes he is good maybe she passed 2 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.060
 a millimeter on purpose such a nut is called 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.640
 which was called 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:22.240
 small roller small stab you soar 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.689
 in any hardware store mana that 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:31.900
 the surface was solid need 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:33.549
 acidum will need glue called 88 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.189
 luxury wagon 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.150
 Does waterproof by its composition 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.600
 clever 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.300
 this moment of the bank is worth about 2 to 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.910
 50 rubles in principle or banks you 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:51.640
 enough that problem in the average kitchen 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:56.790
 can say such a firm love for 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.320
 Buys bought about 800, too 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:06.280
 no more healthy fall only near 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:10.929
 We've gotten together enough that we do 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.750
 we take our right dumb that cork with 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:18.030
 sides are facial on this side we him 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:21.610
 we coat with glue 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:28.350
 Particles Pre-give replacement in 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:31.150
 what construction we measure the distance 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.690
 more error we take for what 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:47.100
 clutch 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:47.100
 which means our piece and 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:55.209
 need to stick four of it we 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:59.140
 we put pro mother on the inside 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.989
 surface edge and realized that 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.330
 waiting for 15 minutes after 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.260
 after 15 minutes we put glue on 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.710
 surface 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.210
 Chip and Jedi elements because they sing 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.050
 all intercede glue very quickly 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.810
 absorbed and 3 min plan enough in 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:21.490
 the result about the case we have minutes and and we 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:26.990
 take our cork we press to our chipboard 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:29.060
 press we will stay brew strongly 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.730
 pretty press to your enter 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.730
 maybe I need to will understand 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:45.110
 figuratively he says snuggled at the ends 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.480
 at the end of the vanych our billet edge 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:51.230
 form stresses slightly bent 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.000
 from 600 can look at bends and 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.060
 at the end on to develop tension 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.450
 to remove the voltage you need means 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.510
 hair dryer finance a little bit 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.820
 ruin the end go and tension with 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:12.260
 the edges 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:16.880
 fell with them he found nothing here in 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:18.590
 3-4 hours to be his keep 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.130
 enough to continue 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.840
 do the same handling 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.530
 elementary nothing complicated we have 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.889
 after setting loud except be on 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:37.090
 I was able to remove only see 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:39.919
 also warmed up with a hair dryer with a knife, remove and 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.680
 how would we have the last task 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.930
 the last farther away are loud speakers 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.270
 the rest of the edges accurately compensate 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.830
 one and a half millimeter below 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.389
 begin to enter 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.889
 nothing is difficult just warming up 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:05:03.770
 wines world and our shoot remove our 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:08.479
 A lot of all our items are already 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:10.550
 almost ready after what we do 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.529
 such a small time so tired 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.430
 workpiece at 2 millimeters can 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:24.169
 look we mean doing such 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:30.759
 moments here are otherwise not acute countries 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:30.759
 slightly cut off such movements to 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:43.419
 small that is formed in principle all 

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:47.539
 left for only species left 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:50.400
 for 2, too, hands take acetone wet 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:53.080
 see the contour 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.690
 around the perimeter about our 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.980
 blanks by these when breathing in order to 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:01.710
 remove the remnants of glue as it were in principle 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.630
 nothing complicated there 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.880
 on time on kitchen kitchen time 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:10.120
 fully along with processing is possible 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:13.180
 glue in two days, that is 1 imitation 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.830
 2 after 2 days you can glue this 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.880
 thing use so diamond shaped is glued 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.650
 qualitatively well having falls off 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:25.270
 with an edge amount of millimeters all ta 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:28.150
 the same reason even nothing 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:30.430
 there is nothing complicated 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.940
 if anyone is interested write to 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:38.370
 lichku I will tell you to write or lay out 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.370
 detailed video material of old men
