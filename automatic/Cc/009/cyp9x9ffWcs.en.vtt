00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 who the airmen of american airlines 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.930
 sees the fall of one immediately on the 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.630
 new design that is a major part of the fleet 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.150
 since January, the modern lux wears 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.759
 as a sign for the departure because 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.109
 founded in 1926 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.630
 airline is on 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.310
 modernization course and that concerns 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.699
 all areas of the company 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.960
 there is once the customer service on the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.779
 Let's focus on different ones 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.260
 programs especially at the moment we 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.790
 train a lot of new flight attendants 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.829
 So for many years we introduce 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.350
 right now four to five thousand new ones 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.170
 flight attendants one we specifically 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.280
 school and they also speak 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.250
 various 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.649
 they spoke international 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.750
 countries and that's what we're trying to do 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.670
 an american airline 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.660
 more and more a global airline 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.570
 close 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.610
 In terms of globality, the airline can 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.269
 Headquartered in texas now 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.989
 points 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.589
 It flies to 260 destinations in 50 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.830
 countries 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:06.960
 frankfurt has been owned since 1985 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.420
 the aim from here it comes 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.399
 Once a day after the is america 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.500
 airlines owns together with their 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.710
 subsidiary american eagle almost 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.550
 900 airmen more 500 were determined 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.500
 who on board one of the new 777 300s 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.800
 comes that may be very special 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.929
 happy if the economy would be great too 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.210
 We have to mention in the first part 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:31.409
 the cabin 30 so-called maine kevin 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.539
 extra seats 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.470
 they have an extended seating distance 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.840
 and more 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.210
 bridge venus angle so there you can 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.240
 you just have more legroom 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.020
 So very popular places in the troupe 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:51.370
 7 300 and from the entertainment we offer 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.900
 Over 100 over 250 channels at where they 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.050
 movies can choose 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.210
 They have 350 radioprograms and 180 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.560
 more entertainment than it is 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.570
 for a lot of entertainment on board 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.250
 so no problem with one 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.040
 definitely not boring on a nine 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.840
 up to ten hours flight to dallas 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.510
 it is comfortable thanks to the premium seats in 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.490
 the economy class and those who spend more 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.020
 I also like the business or can 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.140
 first class with all theirs 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.820
 Amenities Choose Delicious Dining 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.670
 and drinks are in all classes 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.010
 1 is being served in the new 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.200
 aviators clearly benefit the passengers 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.040
 through the modernization course of 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.030
 airline around 100 million passengers 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.250
 transports the airline pro 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.970
 year and maybe they belong too 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.970
 soon
