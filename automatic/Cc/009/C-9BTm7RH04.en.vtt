product<00:02:42.019> from<00:02:42.579> Bowers<00:02:43.579> &amp;<00:02:43.879> Wilkins<00:02:44.030> now<00:02:44.840> you

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
product from Bowers &amp; Wilkins now you

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.949 
product from Bowers &amp; Wilkins now you
have<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.650> ability<00:02:46.340> to<00:02:46.370> switch<00:02:46.750> types<00:02:47.750> of

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
have the ability to switch types of

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.190 
have the ability to switch types of
cables<00:02:48.349> for<00:02:49.040> in-between<00:02:49.489> -<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:50.120> think<00:02:50.780> it's<00:02:50.959> 2.5

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
cables for in-between - I think it's 2.5

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.920 
cables for in-between - I think it's 2.5
millimeter<00:02:51.950> 3.5<00:02:52.549> millimeter<00:02:52.970> so<00:02:53.569> you<00:02:53.660> switch

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
millimeter 3.5 millimeter so you switch

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.390 
millimeter 3.5 millimeter so you switch
those<00:02:54.170> out<00:02:54.349> just<00:02:54.410> by<00:02:54.709> pulling<00:02:54.950> these<00:02:55.129> out<00:02:55.340> of

those out just by pulling these out of

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.610 
those out just by pulling these out of
the<00:02:55.489> units<00:02:55.849> they're<00:02:56.390> held<00:02:56.840> in<00:02:56.989> pretty<00:02:57.290> much<00:02:57.410> by

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
the units they're held in pretty much by

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.309 
the units they're held in pretty much by
severe<00:02:58.129> very<00:02:58.370> powerful<00:02:58.879> magnets<00:02:59.329> then<00:03:00.049> I<00:03:00.140> say

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
severe very powerful magnets then I say

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.690 
severe very powerful magnets then I say
about<00:03:00.440> these<00:03:00.709> is<00:03:00.920> they're<00:03:01.069> very<00:03:01.310> light
