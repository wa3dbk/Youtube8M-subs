00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
this I think we all have the same

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.349 
this I think we all have the same
development<00:00:53.010> like<00:00:53.159> we<00:00:53.309> have<00:00:53.430> ad<00:00:53.729> in<00:00:53.879> America

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
like we had Afro Americans who have

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.000 
like we had Afro Americans who have
Italian<00:00:56.370> Americans<00:00:57.260> that<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.409> something<00:00:58.829> what

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
Italian Americans that is something what

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.340

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
we are it Moroccan Dutch that is

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.899 
we are it Moroccan Dutch that is
something<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.789> what<00:01:08.880> is

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
something that is going on and what is

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.450 
something that is going on and what is
going<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.420> happen<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.619> think<00:01:11.039> it<00:01:11.280> is

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
going to happen but I think it is

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.810 
going to happen but I think it is
important<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.899> when<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.590> talk<00:01:13.830> about<00:01:13.860> Muslims

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
important to when you talk about Muslims

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.480 
important to when you talk about Muslims
you<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:15.149> to<00:01:15.360> realise<00:01:15.810> yourself<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.100> is

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
you have to realise yourself that it is

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.639 
you have to realise yourself that it is
not<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.789> how<00:01:17.940> much<00:01:18.090> any<00:01:18.270> group<00:01:18.569> and<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.470> lot<00:01:19.619> of

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
not on how much any group and a lot of

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.669 
not on how much any group and a lot of
people<00:01:20.100> would<00:01:20.250> be<00:01:20.280> not<00:01:20.960> pleased<00:01:21.960> if<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.350> call

soul salvation or in a solution could be
very<00:02:07.020> difficult<00:02:07.289> what<00:02:08.130> we<00:02:08.399> had<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:08.910> Europe<00:02:09.149> or

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
very difficult what we had in Europe or

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.860 
very difficult what we had in Europe or

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
especially in in the Netherlands is that

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.440 
especially in in the Netherlands is that
a<00:02:13.350> lot<00:02:13.859> of<00:02:13.890> Muslims<00:02:14.579> are<00:02:14.910> from<00:02:15.090> migrant

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
historical problems you have a lot of a

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.420 
historical problems you have a lot of a
lot<00:02:25.079> of<00:02:25.109> problems<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.890> we<00:02:25.950> have<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.250> lot<00:02:26.400> of

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
lot of problems and we have a lot of

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.190 
lot of problems and we have a lot of
challenges<00:02:26.730> also<00:02:27.299> like<00:02:27.480> domestic<00:02:27.810> violence

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
challenges also like domestic violence

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.190 
challenges also like domestic violence
if<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.760> call<00:02:30.060> them<00:02:30.299> Muslims<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:30.989> the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
if you call them Muslims and the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.259 
if you call them Muslims and the
problems<00:02:31.680> could<00:02:31.950> be<00:02:32.010> Islamized<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:33.000> could<00:02:33.150> be

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
problems could be Islamized it could be

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.130 
problems could be Islamized it could be
linked<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.380> Islam<00:02:34.799> and<00:02:35.069> that<00:02:35.700> is<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:36.870> think

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
linked to the Islam and that is I think

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.229 
linked to the Islam and that is I think
that<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.739> very<00:02:37.980> dangerous<00:02:38.280> if<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.940> do<00:02:39.090> that

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
that is very dangerous if you do that

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.110 
that is very dangerous if you do that
because<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.690> solution<00:02:40.319> of<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.560> problem<00:02:41.120> is

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
because the solution of the problem is

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.700 
because the solution of the problem is
going<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.569> be<00:02:42.840> going<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.650> be<00:02:43.859> more<00:02:44.069> difficult
