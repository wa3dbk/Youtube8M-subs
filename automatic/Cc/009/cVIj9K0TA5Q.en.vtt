00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.980 
it's not bulky is and it's that kind of
weight<00:01:44.100> but<00:01:44.310> it's<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.610> very<00:01:44.939> firm<00:01:45.270> spread<00:01:45.869> out

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
weight but it's a very firm spread out

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.960 
weight but it's a very firm spread out
weight<00:01:46.229> throughout<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.740> blaster<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.490> it

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
weight throughout the blaster so it

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.789 
weight throughout the blaster so it
always<00:01:48.119> gives<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> great<00:01:48.720> feel<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.380> without

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
always gives it a great feel so without

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.639 
always gives it a great feel so without
talking<00:01:50.220> too<00:01:50.369> much<00:01:50.549> I'll<00:01:50.759> get<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> firing

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
talking too much I'll get to the firing

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.560 
talking too much I'll get to the firing
well<00:01:52.649> I've<00:01:52.740> had<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.920> lot<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.369> jamming<00:01:54.149> problems

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
well I've had a lot of jamming problems

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.139 
well I've had a lot of jamming problems
in<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:55.200> all<00:01:55.500> my<00:01:55.770> entire<00:01:56.280> flywheel<00:01:56.909> guns

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.459 
in this just all my entire flywheel guns
have<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.540> been<00:01:57.689> jamming<00:01:58.020> left<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.380> right

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
have just been jamming left and right

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.990 
have just been jamming left and right
because<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:58.770> super<00:01:59.100> humid<00:01:59.310> my<00:01:59.670> darks<00:01:59.909> are

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
low quality that I was using

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.170 
low quality that I was using
so<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:01.950> had<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.130> go<00:02:02.219> pick<00:02:02.369> up<00:02:02.520> some<00:02:02.579> new<00:02:02.909> fresh

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
so I had to go pick up some new fresh

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.309
