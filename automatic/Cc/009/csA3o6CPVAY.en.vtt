small round with a big punch wow look at
that<00:04:51.460> that's<00:04:52.460> a<00:04:52.610> pretty<00:04:52.760> good<00:04:52.940> group<00:04:53.120> right

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
that that's a pretty good group right

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.190 
that that's a pretty good group right
there<00:04:55.390> we<00:04:56.390> definitely<00:04:56.780> know<00:04:56.900> we've<00:04:57.050> got

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
there we definitely know we've got

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.190 
there we definitely know we've got
penetration<00:04:57.860> here<00:04:58.010> oh<00:04:58.870> that<00:04:59.870> tells<00:05:00.080> you

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
penetration here oh that tells you

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.230 
penetration here oh that tells you
pretty<00:05:00.410> much<00:05:00.500> everything<00:05:00.920> right<00:05:01.070> off<00:05:01.190> the<00:05:01.310> bat

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.860 

when<00:05:05.240> you<00:05:05.300> start<00:05:05.540> to<00:05:05.600> look<00:05:05.660> at<00:05:05.750> the

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
when you start to look at the

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.250 
when you start to look at the
penetration<00:05:06.290> power<00:05:06.730> look<00:05:07.730> at<00:05:07.820> that<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:09.110> then

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
penetration power look at that and then

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:24.340 
penetration power look at that and then
out<00:05:09.410> the<00:05:09.590> other<00:05:09.740> side<00:05:22.600> the<00:05:23.600> mp7

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
out the other side the mp7

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.040 
out the other side the mp7
is<00:05:24.440> easy<00:05:24.860> to<00:05:25.070> handle<00:05:25.250> easy<00:05:25.700> to<00:05:26.090> conceal<00:05:26.450> and<00:05:26.690> as

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
is easy to handle easy to conceal and as

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.370 
is easy to handle easy to conceal and as
we've<00:05:27.350> seen<00:05:27.620> it<00:05:28.100> packs<00:05:28.490> serious<00:05:29.060> firepower

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
we've seen it packs serious firepower

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.170 
we've seen it packs serious firepower
that<00:05:30.380> makes<00:05:30.830> it<00:05:31.010> great<00:05:31.220> for<00:05:31.520> dignitary<00:05:32.090> and

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
that makes it great for dignitary and

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.850 
that makes it great for dignitary and

look<00:05:36.860> at<00:05:36.920> this<00:05:37.010> I've<00:05:37.460> got<00:05:37.640> free<00:05:37.910> room<00:05:38.120> here<00:05:38.360> if

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
look at this I've got free room here if

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.880 
look at this I've got free room here if
I<00:05:38.570> needed<00:05:38.750> to<00:05:38.930> actually<00:05:39.080> deliver<00:05:39.530> rounds

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
I needed to actually deliver rounds

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.040 
I needed to actually deliver rounds
downrange<00:05:40.070> I<00:05:40.370> could<00:05:40.490> do<00:05:40.610> that<00:05:40.730> I<00:05:40.970> can<00:05:41.600> store<00:05:41.960> it

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
downrange I could do that I can store it

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.990 
downrange I could do that I can store it
down<00:05:42.200> here<00:05:42.380> safely<00:05:42.740> no<00:05:42.950> problem<00:05:43.310> and<00:05:43.580> if<00:05:43.880> I'm

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 
down here safely no problem and if I'm

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.360 
down here safely no problem and if I'm
taking<00:05:44.270> a<00:05:44.360> contact<00:05:44.840> I<00:05:45.050> open<00:05:45.410> up<00:05:45.470> my<00:05:45.530> door<00:05:45.830> I<00:05:46.040> can

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
taking a contact I open up my door I can

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.130 
taking a contact I open up my door I can
immediately<00:05:46.670> start<00:05:46.970> delivering<00:05:47.660> rounds

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:48.140 
immediately start delivering rounds

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:49.750 
immediately start delivering rounds
downrange<00:05:48.350> but<00:05:49.010> to<00:05:49.100> start<00:05:49.310> putting<00:05:49.550> heads

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
downrange but to start putting heads

downrange but to start putting heads
down<00:05:50.030> and<00:05:50.240> that's<00:05:50.360> gonna<00:05:50.510> make<00:05:50.690> all<00:05:50.870> the

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
down and that's gonna make all the

down and that's gonna make all the
difference<00:05:51.050> in<00:05:51.410> a<00:05:51.470> firefight<00:05:51.880> so<00:05:52.880> when<00:05:53.600> you're

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
difference in a firefight so when you're

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:54.790 
difference in a firefight so when you're
looking<00:05:53.870> at<00:05:53.990> the<00:05:54.080> mp7

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
looking at the mp7

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.920 
looking at the mp7
it's<00:05:55.250> small<00:05:55.610> its<00:05:55.940> compact<00:05:56.120> that's<00:05:56.510> made<00:05:56.750> for

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
it's small its compact that's made for

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.800 
it's small its compact that's made for
close<00:05:57.110> quarter<00:05:57.440> battle<00:05:58.030> and<00:05:59.030> its<00:05:59.540> sound

close quarter battle and its sound

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.320 
close quarter battle and its sound
suppressor<00:06:00.380> is<00:06:00.530> tailor-made<00:06:01.040> so<00:06:01.760> it<00:06:01.910> doesn't

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
suppressor is tailor-made so it doesn't

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.460 
suppressor is tailor-made so it doesn't
interfere<00:06:02.570> with<00:06:02.870> accuracy<00:06:03.500> or<00:06:03.860> rate<00:06:04.160> of<00:06:04.280> fire

interfere with accuracy or rate of fire

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.860 
interfere with accuracy or rate of fire
and<00:06:05.560> being<00:06:06.370> compact<00:06:06.910> doesn't<00:06:07.390> mean<00:06:07.570> its

and being compact doesn't mean its

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.160 
and being compact doesn't mean its

fire is 950 rounds per minute that's

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.500 
fire is 950 rounds per minute that's
more<00:06:14.620> than<00:06:14.860> a<00:06:14.890> match<00:06:15.190> for<00:06:15.220> any<00:06:15.520> submachine<00:06:16.300> gun
