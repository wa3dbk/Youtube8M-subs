writes<00:01:26.630> my<00:01:27.289> philosophy<00:01:27.890> is<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:28.039> use<00:01:28.340> only<00:01:28.580> what

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
writes my philosophy is to use only what

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.089 
writes my philosophy is to use only what
is<00:01:29.030> freely<00:01:29.479> given<00:01:29.840> or<00:01:29.989> discarded<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:30.739> what<00:01:30.979> is

00:01:31.089 --> 00:01:31.099 
is freely given or discarded and what is

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:34.270 
is freely given or discarded and what is
already<00:01:31.459> present<00:01:31.759> and<00:01:32.000> already<00:01:32.390> running

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
already present and already running

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.760 
already present and already running
and<00:01:34.420> that's<00:01:35.420> what<00:01:35.660> drew<00:01:35.930> me<00:01:36.080> to<00:01:36.110> Daniel<00:01:36.620> was

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
and that's what drew me to Daniel was

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.410 
and that's what drew me to Daniel was
here<00:01:36.920> or<00:01:37.040> someone<00:01:37.310> who<00:01:37.460> saying<00:01:37.670> maybe<00:01:38.060> I<00:01:38.180> don't

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
here or someone who saying maybe I don't

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.410 
here or someone who saying maybe I don't
know<00:01:38.630> what<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:38.960> solution<00:01:39.170> is<00:01:39.650> but<00:01:40.090> I'm<00:01:41.090> going

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
know what the solution is but I'm going

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:48.969 
know what the solution is but I'm going
to<00:01:41.480> disobey

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:50.830 

so<00:01:49.820> basically<00:01:50.149> all<00:01:50.360> three<00:01:50.659> of<00:01:50.719> these

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
so basically all three of these

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.420 
so basically all three of these
movements<00:01:51.049> left<00:01:51.469> right<00:01:51.710> in<00:01:51.799> the<00:01:51.890> center<00:01:52.130> have

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
movements left right in the center have

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.740 
movements left right in the center have
come<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:52.939> conclusion<00:01:53.090> that<00:01:53.600> our

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
come to the conclusion that our

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.350 
come to the conclusion that our
financial<00:01:54.079> system<00:01:54.680> is<00:01:54.829> a<00:01:54.920> big<00:01:55.219> problem<00:01:55.700> we

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
financial system is a big problem we

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.999 
financial system is a big problem we
can't<00:01:56.630> it's<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:56.990> big<00:01:57.229> that<00:01:57.380> we<00:01:57.439> can't<00:01:57.679> control

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
can't it's so big that we can't control

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.639 
can't it's so big that we can't control
it<00:01:58.219> and<00:01:58.369> so<00:01:59.299> many<00:01:59.450> ways<00:01:59.570> we<00:01:59.750> feel<00:01:59.899> enslaved<00:02:00.409> by

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
it and so many ways we feel enslaved by

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.389 
it and so many ways we feel enslaved by
it<00:02:00.850> worse<00:02:01.850> we<00:02:02.750> feel<00:02:03.020> powerless<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.979> change<00:02:04.009> it

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
it worse we feel powerless to change it

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.749 
it worse we feel powerless to change it
and<00:02:04.579> then<00:02:05.569> Daniel<00:02:05.840> comes<00:02:06.079> along<00:02:06.319> and<00:02:06.470> says<00:02:06.590> hey

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
and then Daniel comes along and says hey

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.650 
and then Daniel comes along and says hey
you<00:02:07.759> don't<00:02:07.850> have<00:02:08.000> to<00:02:08.090> be<00:02:08.179> part<00:02:08.390> of<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.509> system

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
you don't have to be part of the system

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.359 
you don't have to be part of the system
