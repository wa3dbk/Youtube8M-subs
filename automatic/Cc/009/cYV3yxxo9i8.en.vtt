00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 video keeps two fans writing cool though 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.379
 you make about the packet with queen 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.379
 would do it 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:21.720
 Hello and welcome last 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.760
 play metin2 de prisis of love video 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.660
 holds asked if I have a little pv 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.349
 can display 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.400
 as I said, of course, that and that 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.400
 I have a few scenes now 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.309
 out this time also in the net 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.440
 place showed but prosperity 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.390
 really do some action in the pv 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.370
 reduce 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.309
 we just got the kite up there 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.989
 no matter how good i join in 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:55.699
 believe equally at some point 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:01:00.750
 Then die a bit later 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:02.969
 level with knees at home this and still 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.280
 other things the employers talk about 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:11.130
 today i have a coworker from the media 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.549
 Power spoken and indeed I have it there 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.770
 get a small channel optimization 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:20.820
 what can I do better and so 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.490
 continue and that is definitely one 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.570
 a few things I've already got 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.820
 For example, a new avatar 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.579
 because the current one simply does not belong to the 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.850
 other things fits because I only need 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.850
 look 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.910
 that I also do more thing this 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.920
 fit each other 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.850
 I mean optical now like that 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.530
 thumbnails and so on but usa mails 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.050
 are you with those I currently have 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.400
 make everyone happy everything recognizes 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:57.960
 or tell you this bad 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:00.810
 We do something else so check 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.940
 simply times the comments who great and 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.870
 yes yes yes now talk briefly as I 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.770
 main this level 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.600
 I believe three or four I have none 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.940
 idea 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:19.070
 could look for yourself anyway 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.810
 no problem 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.110
 watch football if I then queenie on 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.130
 105 levels with cars or in the camera 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:31.890
 Just look what is still here 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.700
 the playlist I should definitely times 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.130
 care for 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:41.750
 because they are really up to date and 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.750
 not all videos in it are even more 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.920
 Otherwise , she said because a case 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:57.470
 girl, a whole community is 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:59.989
 So I'm already relatively 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:04.890
 am successful 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:06.360
 who minecraft that now or so would be the 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.600
 do not think so but that with the 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.650
 two with a limited community 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:17.640
 it then again something else you understand 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.920
 and then we have such an approximate 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.680
 time made how long the let's play 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.810
 should be 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.519
 you just see a zuschauerbindung 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.380
 how long do people watch the video and 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.560
 so on and then you have to stop 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:35.340
 always find something like how long should it be 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.250
 how long can it be maximum and 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.090
 otherwise yes, the description should me 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.320
 then stop too 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.950
 write three lines as come 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.730
 video in front 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.440
 easy for the youtube algorithm that 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.330
 he has certain words like that 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.040
 filters out and then the video becomes 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.590
 has accordingly listed depending on 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.700
 what you are looking for and how you like to escape 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.500
 but in this video i think so 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:06.250
 but not then nothing will work 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:10.490
 come in any case 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:15.260
 Oh, and maybe told me 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:17.210
 It would be cool if I have one 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.380
 firm time if I always do that 

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:21.710
 upload video 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:25.010
 Of course it's a bit ass 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:26.420
 me but if you say we want that 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.460
 I would definitely have on everyone 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.740
 try it 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.920
 I can not promise but nothing but the 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.940
 it will definitely try 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.720
 So just write the comments 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.760
 are 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.890
 Do you want a fixed upload time like 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:48.440
 Every day 18 was what or you know 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:50.990
 already or roughly discussed further 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.030
 Of course, there were others like that 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.610
 things but so everything with me 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.710
 Okay so I only have you now 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.680
 the read where I then stop 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:04.010
 have to work a bit and so on 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.540
 and that's really going to happen soon 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.520
 bit us on a cartoon 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.850
 I hope that you have the channel then 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.520
 of course good and yes we are 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:17.350
 just bones face a bus from 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.590
 the nineties map and 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.870
 the fabric then this already almost over 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.820
 just like a bit of pvm action 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:30.120
 you like to write in the comments 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:30.120
 I'm out to denne size fassi
