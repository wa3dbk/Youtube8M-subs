00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.830 
answer it right then in there and
challenge<00:05:08.669> the<00:05:08.790> substantive<00:05:09.180> basis<00:05:09.660> on<00:05:09.810> which

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
challenge the substantive basis on which

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.719 
challenge the substantive basis on which
they<00:05:10.139> are<00:05:10.200> being<00:05:10.440> attacked<00:05:10.770> I<00:05:11.010> think<00:05:11.310> Obama<00:05:11.580> is

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
they are being attacked I think Obama is

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.430 
they are being attacked I think Obama is
saying<00:05:11.970> he'd<00:05:12.120> like<00:05:12.389> politics<00:05:12.900> to<00:05:13.110> be<00:05:13.229> more

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
saying he'd like politics to be more

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.320 
saying he'd like politics to be more
like<00:05:13.650> that<00:05:13.889> and<00:05:14.100> part<00:05:14.790> of<00:05:14.850> the<00:05:14.940> reason<00:05:14.970> is

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
like that and part of the reason is

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.460 
like that and part of the reason is
because<00:05:15.479> I<00:05:15.660> think<00:05:15.720> he<00:05:15.900> thinks<00:05:16.050> that<00:05:16.260> would<00:05:16.380> be

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
because I think he thinks that would be

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.990 
because I think he thinks that would be
good<00:05:16.560> for<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:16.800> country<00:05:16.950> like<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:17.640> other<00:05:17.760> part

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
good for the country like the other part

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.310 
good for the country like the other part
of<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.120> reason<00:05:18.330> he<00:05:18.450> knows<00:05:18.720> it<00:05:18.870> would<00:05:18.930> be<00:05:19.080> great

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
of the reason he knows it would be great

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.380 
of the reason he knows it would be great
for<00:05:19.350> him<00:05:19.710> because<00:05:20.039> he<00:05:20.160> wins<00:05:20.520> when<00:05:20.729> politics<00:05:21.210> is

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
for him because he wins when politics is

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.420 
for him because he wins when politics is
like<00:05:21.510> this<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:22.140> way<00:05:22.289> that<00:05:22.500> I<00:05:22.530> if<00:05:23.190> I<00:05:23.280> were<00:05:23.400> a

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
like this the way that I if I were a

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.860 
like this the way that I if I were a
Republican<00:05:23.700> what<00:05:24.060> I<00:05:24.090> take<00:05:24.270> away<00:05:24.330> from<00:05:24.660> this<00:05:24.810> is

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
Republican what I take away from this is

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.260 
Republican what I take away from this is
don't<00:05:25.229> let<00:05:25.830> politics<00:05:26.340> be<00:05:26.550> like<00:05:26.760> this<00:05:27.000> ever

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
don't let politics be like this ever

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:33.200 
don't let politics be like this ever
again<00:05:29.360> well<00:05:30.919> at<00:05:31.919> least<00:05:32.039> but<00:05:32.340> one<00:05:32.760> but<00:05:32.970> you<00:05:33.090> know

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
to act you'd must you must think this is

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.120 
to act you'd must you must think this is
that<00:05:36.570> this<00:05:36.750> is<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:36.990> case<00:05:37.140> their<00:05:37.590> reaction<00:05:38.070> is

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
that this is the case their reaction is

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.510 
that this is the case their reaction is
in<00:05:38.370> fact<00:05:38.520> going<00:05:38.729> to<00:05:38.880> be<00:05:39.150> we<00:05:40.039> we<00:05:41.039> don't<00:05:41.220> know<00:05:41.310> why
