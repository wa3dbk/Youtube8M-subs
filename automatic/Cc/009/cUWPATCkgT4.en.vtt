00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.580
 hi food and for now I'm here with yours 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:23.310
 tourism in fact in Russian version 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:23.310
 now let's try the coupons 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:35.350
 hunting is an activity that has roots 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:39.550
 Prehistoric hunters have hunted 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:44.850
 the animals ate but then they have 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:49.270
 sold the vegetarians and took off 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:54.420
 almost all carnivores 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:01:00.360
 but we won because we don't 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:05.610
 they eat the food for us 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:11.350
 we eat horns and for this we become 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:13.270
 strong then we do something against 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:19.050
 vegetarians 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.050
 we make a great detachment 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.560
 it is not true that francesco was a 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.750
 fuck they process something they know how 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:33.390
 do you eat complicated right away 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.360
 means 20 Italian sacrifices e 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.740
 shop and empty so we regret to see that 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.200
 It does nothing 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.250
 means this today we do i 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:48.289
 eat inside the empty space that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.500
 inside its hot because we have to 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:55.050
 leave a constant temperature and use 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.780
 a machine that keeps my temperature 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.170
 always right though if you don't have these 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.990
 shitty things use a manual thermometer 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.590
 and a glass of water and if there 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.310
 temperature becomes too high put a 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.650
 bit of cold water and I just like you 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:19.140
 red meat 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:22.890
 mg then I put water in the 60 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:27.090
 degrees but if you and more red meat put it 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:31.709
 54 crates and if you want less red meat 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:36.799
 then put more maybe 60 8 degrees but 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:41.160
 be careful you do the booklet is too much 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:45.570
 hot then you become a bullshit is out 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.959
 and you often like 7 beef and same shots 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:53.400
 things or thin like my cock for the 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:56.960

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:00.860
 cock holding up 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.230
 because good or butter is closed and if you 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.530
 you don't have this machine, do nothing 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.820
 in the plastic inside the water the air e 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.880
