of<00:02:23.530> in<00:02:24.000> 2000<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.120> was<00:02:25.360> able<00:02:25.569> to<00:02:25.750> participate

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
of in 2000 I was able to participate

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.250 
of in 2000 I was able to participate
with<00:02:26.640> Tony<00:02:27.640> Blair<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.210> representatives<00:02:29.050> of

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
governments and announcing that we had

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.150 
governments and announcing that we had
succeeded

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
succeeded

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.680 
succeeded
and<00:02:36.250> sequencing<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.000> human<00:02:37.120> genome<00:02:37.330> and

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
and sequencing the human genome and

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.510 
and sequencing the human genome and
perhaps<00:02:38.080> some<00:02:38.410> of<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.620> have<00:02:38.650> investments<00:02:39.370> and

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
perhaps some of you have investments and

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.520 
perhaps some of you have investments and
all<00:02:39.610> these<00:02:39.750> biotech<00:02:40.750> companies<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.410> now<00:02:41.470> you

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
all these biotech companies and now you

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.460 
all these biotech companies and now you
know<00:02:41.800> we<00:02:42.060> we<00:02:43.060> cloned<00:02:43.420> Dolly<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.870> sheep<00:02:44.020> and

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
know we we cloned Dolly the sheep and

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.560 
know we we cloned Dolly the sheep and
now<00:02:44.620> apparently<00:02:45.310> they<00:02:45.820> may<00:02:45.970> have<00:02:46.060> cloned<00:02:46.450> the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
now apparently they may have cloned the

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.860 
now apparently they may have cloned the
dog<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.110> we're<00:02:48.040> all<00:02:48.220> talking<00:02:48.490> about<00:02:48.580> this<00:02:48.870> my

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
dog and we're all talking about this my

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.690 
dog and we're all talking about this my
own<00:02:50.020> view<00:02:50.590> is<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:52.890> assuming<00:02:53.890> we<00:02:54.340> don't<00:02:54.550> do

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
own view is that assuming we don't do

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.670 
own view is that assuming we don't do
something<00:02:55.030> stupid<00:02:55.300> like<00:02:55.570> burn<00:02:55.960> ourselves<00:02:56.530> up

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
something stupid like burn ourselves up

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.470 
something stupid like burn ourselves up
with<00:02:56.830> global<00:02:56.980> warming<00:02:57.190> or<00:02:57.640> blow<00:02:57.820> ourselves<00:02:58.030> up

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
with global warming or blow ourselves up

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.090 
with global warming or blow ourselves up
with<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.690> military<00:02:58.930> conflict<00:02:59.650> we<00:02:59.800> could<00:02:59.950> just

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
with a military conflict we could just

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.060 
with a military conflict we could just
as<00:03:00.250> easily<00:03:00.370> avoid<00:03:00.850> I<00:03:01.650> think<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.710> lot<00:03:02.890> of<00:03:02.980> these

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
as easily avoid I think a lot of these

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.950 
as easily avoid I think a lot of these
biotechnology<00:03:03.940> issues<00:03:04.330> will<00:03:04.540> be<00:03:04.570> the

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
biotechnology issues will be the

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.710 
biotechnology issues will be the
dominant<00:03:05.470> sort<00:03:05.770> of<00:03:06.450> intellectual<00:03:07.450> and

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
dominant sort of intellectual and

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.590 
dominant sort of intellectual and
ethical<00:03:07.900> challenges<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.060> lives<00:03:10.270> of<00:03:10.420> those

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
ethical challenges of the lives of those

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.290 
ethical challenges of the lives of those
of<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:10.900> who<00:03:11.110> are<00:03:11.290> 10<00:03:12.280> 20<00:03:12.640> 30<00:03:12.880> years<00:03:13.090> younger

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
of you who are 10 20 30 years younger

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.990 
of you who are 10 20 30 years younger
than<00:03:13.510> I<00:03:13.630> am<00:03:15.870> because<00:03:16.870> I<00:03:17.080> think<00:03:17.230> that<00:03:17.790> we<00:03:18.790> are

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
than I am because I think that we are

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.850 
than I am because I think that we are
going<00:03:19.270> to<00:03:19.360> be<00:03:19.570> able<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.900> save<00:03:20.290> people's<00:03:20.680> lives

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
going to be able to save people's lives

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.290 
going to be able to save people's lives
that<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:22.240> know<00:03:22.770> my<00:03:23.770> generation<00:03:24.210> couldn't<00:03:25.210> be

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
that you know my generation couldn't be

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.720 
that you know my generation couldn't be
saved<00:03:25.570> and<00:03:25.960> we<00:03:26.860> are<00:03:27.010> going<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.400> come<00:03:27.580> up

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
saved and we are going to come up

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.130 
saved and we are going to come up
against<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.210> limits<00:03:28.390> of<00:03:28.660> our<00:03:28.810> own<00:03:28.870> mortality

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
against the limits of our own mortality

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.060 
against the limits of our own mortality
in<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.770> way<00:03:29.920> we<00:03:30.220> never<00:03:30.400> could<00:03:30.730> before<00:03:30.990> and<00:03:31.990> a<00:03:32.920> lot

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
in a way we never could before and a lot

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.680 
in a way we never could before and a lot
of<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:33.340> things<00:03:33.580> that<00:03:33.790> happened<00:03:34.210> good<00:03:34.390> and<00:03:34.510> bad

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
of the things that happened good and bad

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.630 
of the things that happened good and bad
will<00:03:34.930> be<00:03:35.110> stranger<00:03:35.710> than<00:03:35.860> anything<00:03:36.070> ever

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
will be stranger than anything ever

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.750 
will be stranger than anything ever
written<00:03:36.880> in<00:03:37.060> science<00:03:37.420> fiction<00:03:38.400> but<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.430> don't

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
written in science fiction but I don't

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.180 
written in science fiction but I don't
know<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.060> answers<00:03:40.530> which<00:03:41.530> is<00:03:41.650> one<00:03:41.800> reason<00:03:41.830> I

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
know the answers which is one reason I

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.710 
know the answers which is one reason I
would<00:03:42.250> like<00:03:42.580> to<00:03:42.730> live<00:03:42.880> to<00:03:43.000> be<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.150> hundred<00:03:43.240> just

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
would like to live to be a hundred just

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.070 
would like to live to be a hundred just
to<00:03:43.840> see<00:03:43.990> what<00:03:44.140> happens<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:46.660> that<00:03:46.750> means<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:47.050> a

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
to see what happens so that means is a

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:54.720 
to see what happens so that means is a
list<00:03:47.380> or<00:03:47.530> no<00:03:47.650> list<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:53.709> don't<00:03:54.070> know<00:03:54.130> what<00:03:54.220> you

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
list or no list I don't know what you

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.800 
list or no list I don't know what you
should<00:03:54.880> have<00:03:54.970> said<00:03:55.090> there's<00:03:55.270> absolutely<00:03:55.630> no

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
should have said there's absolutely no

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
risk of that given my misspent youth I'm

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.050 
risk of that given my misspent youth I'm
lucky<00:03:58.570> to<00:03:58.690> be<00:03:58.780> here<00:03:58.810> now<00:03:59.670> what<00:04:00.670> I<00:04:00.700> didn't<00:04:00.970> say

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
lucky to be here now what I didn't say

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.730 
lucky to be here now what I didn't say
was<00:04:01.240> that<00:04:01.270> there<00:04:01.810> really<00:04:01.900> is<00:04:02.110> no<00:04:02.140> list<00:04:02.590> though

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
was that there really is no list though

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.180 
was that there really is no list though
there<00:04:02.890> is<00:04:02.980> a<00:04:03.010> list<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.870> secrets<00:04:05.260> if<00:04:05.830> there<00:04:06.040> is

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
there is a list the secrets if there is

there is a list the secrets if there is

the<00:04:08.620> Roswell<00:04:09.070> thing<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.430> think<00:04:09.720> really<00:04:10.720> was<00:04:10.989> an

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
the Roswell thing I think really was an

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.620 
the Roswell thing I think really was an
illusion<00:04:11.739> I<00:04:12.010> don't<00:04:12.730> think<00:04:12.910> it<00:04:13.030> happened<00:04:13.420> I

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
illusion I don't think it happened I

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.780 
illusion I don't think it happened I
mean<00:04:14.620> I<00:04:14.739> think<00:04:14.800> there<00:04:15.130> are<00:04:15.280> rational

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
mean I think there are rational

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.539 
mean I think there are rational
explanations<00:04:16.510> that<00:04:16.630> I<00:04:16.750> have<00:04:17.340> succeeded<00:04:18.340> and<00:04:18.459> I

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
explanations that I have succeeded and I

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.190 
explanations that I have succeeded and I
I<00:04:18.580> did<00:04:19.030> attempt<00:04:19.359> to<00:04:19.390> find<00:04:19.690> out<00:04:19.840> if<00:04:19.989> there<00:04:20.109> were

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
I did attempt to find out if there were

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.159 
I did attempt to find out if there were
any<00:04:20.230> secret<00:04:20.799> government<00:04:21.010> documents<00:04:21.970> that

any secret government documents that

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
some form of life in another universe

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.580 
some form of life in another universe
it's<00:05:31.580> pretty<00:05:31.879> clear<00:05:32.240> that<00:05:32.379> there<00:05:33.379> was

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
it's pretty clear that there was

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.619 
it's pretty clear that there was
something<00:05:33.889> approaching<00:05:34.430> elemental<00:05:35.120> life<00:05:35.330> on

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:35.629 
something approaching elemental life on

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:37.749 
something approaching elemental life on
Mars<00:05:36.020> at<00:05:36.289> one<00:05:36.409> time<00:05:36.680> in<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:36.919> past<00:05:36.949> based<00:05:37.580> on

Mars at one time in the past based on

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
what we've already discovered there so I

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.950 
what we've already discovered there so I
say<00:05:40.310> that<00:05:40.550> only<00:05:40.849> to<00:05:40.969> say<00:05:41.120> this<00:05:41.330> I<00:05:41.360> hope<00:05:41.719> all<00:05:41.930> of

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
say that only to say this I hope all of

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.499 
say that only to say this I hope all of
you<00:05:42.199> wherever<00:05:42.409> you<00:05:42.740> live<00:05:42.979> will<00:05:43.909> continue<00:05:44.419> to

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:44.509 
you wherever you live will continue to

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:47.529 
you wherever you live will continue to
support<00:05:44.690> space<00:05:45.259> exploration<00:05:46.449> whether<00:05:47.449> a

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
support space exploration whether a

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.510 
support space exploration whether a
manned<00:05:47.810> or<00:05:48.080> unmanned<00:05:48.590> is<00:05:48.770> not<00:05:48.919> so<00:05:49.099> important

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 
manned or unmanned is not so important

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.029 
manned or unmanned is not so important
but<00:05:49.550> we<00:05:49.729> have<00:05:49.759> to<00:05:50.060> keep<00:05:50.210> doing<00:05:50.539> that<00:05:50.690> and<00:05:51.039> I'm

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:52.039 
but we have to keep doing that and I'm

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:54.399 
but we have to keep doing that and I'm
afraid<00:05:52.400> that<00:05:52.520> there<00:05:52.909> will<00:05:53.060> be<00:05:53.090> a<00:05:53.409> waning

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:54.409 
afraid that there will be a waning

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:56.920 
afraid that there will be a waning
interest<00:05:54.650> in<00:05:55.099> it<00:05:55.280> in<00:05:55.460> the<00:05:56.210> future<00:05:56.569> I<00:05:56.599> think

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
interest in it in the future I think

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.420 
interest in it in the future I think
it's<00:05:57.080> a<00:05:57.169> great<00:05:57.379> mistake<00:05:57.590> I<00:05:57.919> think<00:05:58.159> we<00:05:58.250> should

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
it's a great mistake I think we should

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.890 
it's a great mistake I think we should
continue<00:05:58.699> to<00:05:58.879> explore<00:05:59.300> the<00:05:59.360> boundaries<00:05:59.840> of

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
continue to explore the boundaries of

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.680 
continue to explore the boundaries of
our<00:06:00.139> existence<00:06:00.759> both<00:06:01.759> end<00:06:02.060> of<00:06:02.150> the<00:06:02.240> earth<00:06:02.389> and

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
our existence both end of the earth and

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.290 
our existence both end of the earth and
beyond<00:06:02.960> the<00:06:03.169> skies<00:06:03.440> when<00:06:04.400> I<00:06:04.430> was<00:06:04.729> president<00:06:05.210> we

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
beyond the skies when I was president we

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.209 
beyond the skies when I was president we
discovered<00:06:05.840> in<00:06:06.020> the<00:06:06.169> bottom<00:06:06.529> of<00:06:06.650> the<00:06:06.740> Amazon

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:07.219 
discovered in the bottom of the Amazon

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:09.100 
discovered in the bottom of the Amazon
River<00:06:07.460> but<00:06:07.940> we<00:06:08.120> were<00:06:08.240> just<00:06:08.270> a<00:06:08.569> small<00:06:08.659> part<00:06:09.050> of

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
River but we were just a small part of

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.760 
River but we were just a small part of
this<00:06:09.229> but<00:06:09.440> two<00:06:10.219> previously<00:06:10.940> undiscovered

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
this but two previously undiscovered

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.680 
this but two previously undiscovered
forms<00:06:12.770> of<00:06:12.889> marine<00:06:13.039> life<00:06:13.219> so<00:06:14.000> deep<00:06:14.360> in<00:06:14.599> the

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
forms of marine life so deep in the

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.240 
forms of marine life so deep in the
Amazon<00:06:15.169> that<00:06:15.349> nope<00:06:15.560> they<00:06:15.740> had<00:06:15.830> never<00:06:15.979> been

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
Amazon that nope they had never been

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.640 
Amazon that nope they had never been
found<00:06:16.520> and<00:06:17.240> all<00:06:17.509> the<00:06:17.810> efforts<00:06:18.289> of<00:06:18.409> marine

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
found and all the efforts of marine

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.010 
found and all the efforts of marine
biologists<00:06:19.279> so<00:06:19.969> I<00:06:20.000> think<00:06:20.180> there<00:06:20.539> are<00:06:20.569> lots<00:06:20.750> of

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
biologists so I think there are lots of

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.529 
biologists so I think there are lots of
interesting<00:06:21.259> discoveries<00:06:22.159> biological<00:06:23.060> on

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 
interesting discoveries biological on
