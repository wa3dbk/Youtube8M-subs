00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.499 
had SPF in it

packaging<00:02:09.170> that<00:02:09.770> said<00:02:10.220> it<00:02:10.490> had<00:02:10.820> it<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:11.420> that's

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
packaging that said it had it so that's

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.750 
packaging that said it had it so that's
even<00:02:11.930> better<00:02:12.230> because<00:02:12.320> if<00:02:12.770> you<00:02:12.890> are<00:02:13.070> oily<00:02:13.310> or

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
even better because if you are oily or

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.000 
even better because if you are oily or
you<00:02:14.210> get<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.690> know<00:02:14.810> oily<00:02:15.200> around<00:02:15.380> your<00:02:15.650> t-zone

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010

you get you know oily around your t-zone
you<00:02:16.280> know<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.520> might<00:02:16.730> kind<00:02:17.060> of<00:02:17.180> make<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.360> a

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
you know it might kind of make it a

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.660 
you know it might kind of make it a
little<00:02:17.630> icky<00:02:17.960> or<00:02:18.020> whatever<00:02:18.290> but<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:18.920> do<00:02:19.100> not<00:02:19.400> see

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
little icky or whatever but I do not see

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:20.230 
little icky or whatever but I do not see
it<00:02:19.760> anywhere

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
it anywhere

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.050 
it anywhere
I'll<00:02:21.230> go<00:02:21.440> ahead<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:22.070> swatch<00:02:22.520> a<00:02:22.730> little<00:02:22.940> bit

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
I'll go ahead and swatch a little bit

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.750 
I'll go ahead and swatch a little bit
and<00:02:23.360> all<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:23.960> really<00:02:24.140> need<00:02:24.440> is<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.710> tad<00:02:25.250> bit<00:02:25.280> and

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
and all you really need is a tad bit and

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.030 
and all you really need is a tad bit and
it<00:02:25.970> is<00:02:26.150> pump<00:02:26.570> so<00:02:26.750> it's<00:02:26.900> even<00:02:27.200> better<00:02:27.410> but<00:02:27.830> you

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
it is pump so it's even better but you

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.550 
it is pump so it's even better but you
barely<00:02:28.430> have<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.820> push<00:02:29.210> it<00:02:29.450> out<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:30.020> if<00:02:30.410> I

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
barely have to push it out and if I

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.040 
barely have to push it out and if I
could<00:02:30.740> see<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.400> kind<00:02:31.850> of<00:02:31.940> is<00:02:32.090> like<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.300> mousse<00:02:32.780> II

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
could see it kind of is like a mousse II

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.610 
could see it kind of is like a mousse II
you<00:02:33.620> know<00:02:33.650> texture<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.850> see<00:02:35.360> how<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:35.720> look<00:02:36.080> see

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
you know texture and see how it look see

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.030 
you know texture and see how it look see
kind<00:02:36.920> of<00:02:36.980> looks<00:02:37.160> moosie<00:02:38.110> so<00:02:39.110> then<00:02:39.320> it<00:02:39.590> blends

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
kind of looks moosie so then it blends

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.550 
kind of looks moosie so then it blends
in<00:02:40.370> very<00:02:40.580> well<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.480> creamy<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.140> it<00:02:42.230> doesn't

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
in very well and creamy and it doesn't

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.160 
in very well and creamy and it doesn't
drive<00:02:42.800> too<00:02:43.100> too<00:02:43.340> fast<00:02:43.610> but<00:02:44.209> it's<00:02:44.360> workable<00:02:44.870> and

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
drive too too fast but it's workable and

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.470 
drive too too fast but it's workable and
blendable<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.920> then<00:02:46.430> it<00:02:46.550> soaks<00:02:47.030> right<00:02:47.180> into

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
blendable and then it soaks right into

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.440 
blendable and then it soaks right into
your<00:02:47.720> skin<00:02:47.959> instantly<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:49.550> like<00:02:49.970> within<00:02:50.270> a

your skin instantly it like within a
couple<00:02:50.660> seconds<00:02:51.260> like<00:02:51.440> when<00:02:51.650> I'm<00:02:51.800> touching<00:02:52.040> it

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.810 
couple seconds like when I'm touching it
here

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
here

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.229 
here
it<00:02:52.970> doesn't<00:02:53.690> feel<00:02:53.959> cakey<00:02:54.860> or<00:02:55.250> it's<00:02:55.700> like<00:02:56.000> by

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
it doesn't feel cakey or it's like by

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.090 
it doesn't feel cakey or it's like by
now<00:02:56.450> I<00:02:56.480> touch<00:02:56.870> my<00:02:57.080> hand<00:02:57.320> and<00:02:57.500> it's<00:02:57.620> completely

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
now I touch my hand and it's completely

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.900 
now I touch my hand and it's completely
set<00:02:58.550> in<00:02:58.820> so<00:02:59.450> it<00:02:59.630> does<00:02:59.930> go<00:03:00.170> on<00:03:00.380> Matt<00:03:00.709> there<00:03:01.070> is<00:03:01.340> no

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
because the powder I was so scared that

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.940

it<00:04:25.400> was<00:04:25.550> gonna<00:04:25.730> be<00:04:26.030> you<00:04:26.690> know<00:04:26.720> powdery<00:04:27.470> or<00:04:27.620> it

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
it was gonna be you know powdery or it

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.460 
it was gonna be you know powdery or it
was<00:04:28.100> gonna<00:04:28.280> show<00:04:28.730> or<00:04:29.060> look<00:04:29.240> cakey<00:04:29.540> because<00:04:30.050> you

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
was gonna show or look cakey because you

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.740 
was gonna show or look cakey because you
know<00:04:30.560> some<00:04:30.860> powders<00:04:31.400> are<00:04:31.580> like<00:04:31.850> that<00:04:32.120> the

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
know some powders are like that the

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.010 
know some powders are like that the
powder<00:04:33.020> is<00:04:33.470> flawless<00:04:34.040> and<00:04:34.430> nice<00:04:34.790> think<00:04:35.390> that

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
powder is flawless and nice think that

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.020 
powder is flawless and nice think that
it's<00:04:36.230> that<00:04:36.530> way<00:04:36.680> because<00:04:36.890> it<00:04:37.190> has<00:04:37.220> that<00:04:37.610> primer

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
it's that way because it has that primer

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.360 
it's that way because it has that primer
inside<00:04:39.020> of<00:04:39.200> it<00:04:39.320> so<00:04:39.500> it<00:04:39.590> kind<00:04:39.830> of<00:04:39.890> gives<00:04:40.160> it<00:04:40.340> that

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
inside of it so it kind of gives it that

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.450 
inside of it so it kind of gives it that
extra<00:04:40.940> you<00:04:41.600> know<00:04:41.750> like<00:04:41.990> texture<00:04:42.590> to<00:04:42.800> blend<00:04:43.280> it

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
extra you know like texture to blend it

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.390 
extra you know like texture to blend it
in<00:04:43.640> better<00:04:43.910> as<00:04:44.180> well<00:04:44.780> as<00:04:44.990> this<00:04:45.260> so<00:04:45.920> being<00:04:46.310> that

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
in better as well as this so being that

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.360 
in better as well as this so being that
it<00:04:46.670> has<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.360> primer<00:04:47.660> in<00:04:47.930> it<00:04:48.110> you<00:04:48.530> won't<00:04:49.100> come

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
it has the primer in it you won't come

the primer in it you probably don't even

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
that the application will go on smoother

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.730 
that the application will go on smoother
and<00:04:57.350> it<00:04:57.470> did<00:04:57.710> but<00:04:58.400> um<00:04:58.610> I<00:04:59.020> am<00:05:00.020> extremely

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
and it did but um I am extremely

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.300 
and it did but um I am extremely
extremely<00:05:01.340> happy<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.230> I<00:05:03.230> was<00:05:03.980> you<00:05:04.160> know

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.370 
extremely happy and I was you know
overall<00:05:05.060> I<00:05:05.390> knew<00:05:05.630> it<00:05:05.780> was<00:05:05.900> gonna<00:05:06.020> turn<00:05:06.290> out

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
overall I knew it was gonna turn out

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.740 
overall I knew it was gonna turn out
fine<00:05:06.440> because<00:05:06.770> I<00:05:07.220> already<00:05:07.520> had<00:05:07.970> loved<00:05:08.270> this

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
fine because I already had loved this

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.720 
fine because I already had loved this
here<00:05:09.200> I<00:05:09.350> think<00:05:09.860> the<00:05:09.950> only<00:05:10.100> difference<00:05:10.250> between

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
here I think the only difference between

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.430 
here I think the only difference between
this<00:05:11.150> one<00:05:11.360> and<00:05:11.390> this<00:05:11.600> one<00:05:11.660> is<00:05:11.810> that<00:05:12.050> this<00:05:12.230> one

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
this one and this one is that this one

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.190 
this one and this one is that this one
has<00:05:12.470> a<00:05:12.620> primer<00:05:13.070> and<00:05:13.400> it<00:05:13.790> doesn't<00:05:14.240> have<00:05:14.419> SPF<00:05:14.990> and

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
has a primer and it doesn't have SPF and

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.590 
has a primer and it doesn't have SPF and
this<00:05:15.410> one<00:05:15.590> does<00:05:15.830> what<00:05:16.400> I<00:05:16.430> did<00:05:16.880> notice<00:05:17.360> though

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
this one does what I did notice though

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.250 
this one does what I did notice though
was<00:05:18.080> my<00:05:18.380> t-zone<00:05:19.250> area<00:05:19.550> or<00:05:20.000> just<00:05:20.030> right<00:05:20.900> here

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
was my t-zone area or just right here

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.950 
was my t-zone area or just right here
just<00:05:21.290> a<00:05:21.710> small<00:05:21.860> tease<00:05:22.250> on<00:05:22.430> a<00:05:22.580> very<00:05:23.330> very<00:05:23.630> enemy

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
just a small tease on a very very enemy

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.210 
just a small tease on a very very enemy
very<00:05:24.500> light<00:05:25.130> hint<00:05:25.700> of<00:05:25.880> like<00:05:26.870> oiliness<00:05:27.500> it<00:05:27.979> did

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
very light hint of like oiliness it did

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.540 
very light hint of like oiliness it did
so<00:05:28.640> I'm<00:05:28.850> thinking<00:05:29.479> the<00:05:29.690> primer<00:05:30.110> might<00:05:31.040> have

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
so I'm thinking the primer might have

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.780 
so I'm thinking the primer might have
that<00:05:32.030> like<00:05:32.390> oil<00:05:32.750> in<00:05:33.169> it<00:05:33.410> or<00:05:33.590> silicone<00:05:34.490> I'm<00:05:34.640> not

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
that like oil in it or silicone I'm not

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.420 
that like oil in it or silicone I'm not
sure<00:05:34.970> whatever<00:05:35.300> it<00:05:35.390> is<00:05:35.800> maybe<00:05:36.800> I'll<00:05:37.070> read<00:05:37.729> it

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
sure whatever it is maybe I'll read it

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.400 
sure whatever it is maybe I'll read it
the<00:05:40.430> the<00:05:40.669> writing<00:05:41.450> on<00:05:41.720> it<00:05:41.780> is<00:05:42.080> kind<00:05:42.350> of

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
the the writing on it is kind of

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.690 
the the writing on it is kind of
see-through<00:05:42.710> and<00:05:42.979> it<00:05:43.100> goes<00:05:43.250> in<00:05:43.430> through<00:05:43.580> the

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
see-through and it goes in through the

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.100 
see-through and it goes in through the
bottle<00:05:44.030> so<00:05:44.180> it<00:05:44.270> makes<00:05:44.479> it<00:05:44.600> kind<00:05:44.840> of<00:05:44.870> hard<00:05:45.050> to

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
bottle so it makes it kind of hard to

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.930 
bottle so it makes it kind of hard to
read<00:05:45.350> but<00:05:45.590> I'm<00:05:45.740> gonna<00:05:45.860> look<00:05:46.070> online<00:05:46.430> but
