00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
put a hammock so they can pretty much

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.029

bask<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.430> hammock<00:00:45.230> fishes<00:00:46.230> again<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
bask on the hammock fishes again on the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:47.569

cave
that's<00:00:47.879> our<00:00:48.059> moist<00:00:48.300> cave<00:00:48.690> most<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.280> time

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that's our moist cave most of the time

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.630

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.979 
but we read a lot about it that it
causes<00:02:20.030> impaction<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.329> even<00:02:21.599> if<00:02:21.720> it's<00:02:21.870> that

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
causes impaction and even if it's that

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.050 
causes impaction and even if it's that
Vitus<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:22.650> it's<00:02:22.950> still<00:02:23.220> not<00:02:23.370> good<00:02:23.670> for<00:02:23.879> them

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
Vitus and it's still not good for them

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.080 
Vitus and it's still not good for them
so<00:02:24.900> should<00:02:25.859> probably<00:02:26.069> use<00:02:26.310> carpet<00:02:26.790> for<00:02:26.970> your

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
so should probably use carpet for your

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.569 
so should probably use carpet for your
tank<00:02:27.329> but<00:02:28.010> that's<00:02:29.010> about<00:02:29.220> it

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
tank but that's about it

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.640 
tank but that's about it
so<00:02:29.819> your<00:02:30.329> luck<00:02:30.480> with<00:02:30.630> your<00:02:30.780> geckos<00:02:31.079> and<00:02:31.109> thanks

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650
