something<00:01:38.100> like<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.600> right

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
something like that and so it's right

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.520 
something like that and so it's right
here<00:01:40.700> and<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.000> setup<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:43.259> once

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
here and it's a setup so just once

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.660 
here and it's a setup so just once
you're<00:01:43.680> there<00:01:43.710> press<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.159> Enter<00:01:44.430> key

you're there press the Enter key

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.170 
you're there press the Enter key
it<00:01:45.329> should<00:01:45.659> say<00:01:45.930> system<00:01:46.890> or<00:01:47.310> set<00:01:47.640> up<00:01:47.729> those<00:01:48.030> two

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
it should say system or set up those two

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.389 
it should say system or set up those two
options<00:01:48.570> may<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:48.810> more<00:01:49.110> what<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.250> right

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
options may be more what this is right

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.600 
options may be more what this is right
now<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.820> for<00:01:51.720> security<00:01:51.930> option<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.770> set<00:01:53.340> up<00:01:53.490> in

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
now is for security option is set up in

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.760 
now is for security option is set up in
system<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.090> all<00:01:54.329> will<00:01:55.140> either<00:01:55.229> make<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:55.680> you

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
system it all will either make it so you

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.219 
system it all will either make it so you
can<00:01:55.890> use<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> password<00:01:56.570> for<00:01:57.570> just<00:01:58.049> when<00:01:58.170> you

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
can use a password for just when you

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.810 
can use a password for just when you
enter<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.560> setup<00:01:58.770> which<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.100> what<00:01:59.640> I'm<00:01:59.729> doing

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
enter the setup which is what I'm doing

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.130 
enter the setup which is what I'm doing
right<00:01:59.939> now<00:02:00.030> or<00:02:00.360> when<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.630> every<00:02:00.869> time<00:02:00.990> you

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
right now or when you every time you

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.990 
right now or when you every time you
boot<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.469> system<00:02:01.579> so<00:02:02.579> when<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.759> go<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:02.909> you

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
boot the system so when you go and you

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.219 
boot the system so when you go and you
select<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.270> system<00:02:03.570> every<00:02:03.719> time<00:02:03.840> certain

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
select the system every time certain

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.719 
select the system every time certain
boots<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.590> computer<00:02:04.920> you'll<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.520> enter

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
boots the computer you'll have to enter

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.690 
boots the computer you'll have to enter
a<00:02:05.759> password<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.719> just<00:02:07.350> move<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.799> thing<00:02:08.520> down

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
a password so just move the thing down

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.750 
a password so just move the thing down
to<00:02:08.879> there<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.149> hit<00:02:09.270> enter<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:10.640> when<00:02:11.640> that's

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
to there and hit enter and when that's

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.610 
to there and hit enter and when that's
all<00:02:12.000> set<00:02:12.270> then<00:02:12.840> every<00:02:13.050> time<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.260> boot<00:02:13.500> your

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
all set then every time you boot your

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.320 
all set then every time you boot your
computer<00:02:13.650> up<00:02:14.069> you'll<00:02:14.640> need<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.120> enter<00:02:15.300> a

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
computer up you'll need to enter a

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.540 
computer up you'll need to enter a
password<00:02:15.629> and<00:02:15.989> so<00:02:16.709> what<00:02:16.800> this<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.040> useful<00:02:17.220> for

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
password and so what this is useful for

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.260 
password and so what this is useful for
is<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.940> can<00:02:18.090> lock<00:02:18.360> a<00:02:18.690> computer<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:20.270> basically

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
is you can lock a computer so basically

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.600 
is you can lock a computer so basically
what<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.540> computer's<00:02:21.959> consists<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.770> two<00:02:23.400> major

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
what a computer's consists of two major

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.270 
what a computer's consists of two major
parts<00:02:24.060> or<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.300> hard<00:02:24.510> drive<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.280> the

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
parts or the hard drive and the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.690 
parts or the hard drive and the
motherboard<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.650> there<00:02:28.650> are<00:02:28.709> more<00:02:28.980> but<00:02:29.610> the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
motherboard and there are more but the

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.369 
motherboard and there are more but the
motherboard<00:02:30.209> is<00:02:30.330> basically<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.870> mean<00:02:31.019> part

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
motherboard is basically the mean part

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.839 
motherboard is basically the mean part
of<00:02:31.410> your<00:02:31.560> computer<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.220> we're<00:02:32.489> computer

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
of your computer and we're computer

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.550 
of your computer and we're computer
boots<00:02:33.090> it<00:02:33.300> boots<00:02:33.480> off<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.870> motherboard<00:02:34.110> and

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
boots it boots off the motherboard and

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.449 
boots it boots off the motherboard and
so<00:02:35.489> to<00:02:36.150> use<00:02:36.599> that<00:02:36.959> computer<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:38.010> only<00:02:38.220> enter

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
so to use that computer the only enter

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.820 
so to use that computer the only enter
in<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.610> password<00:02:38.760> or<00:02:39.360> disable<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.410> password

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
in the password or disable the password

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.740 
in the password or disable the password
or<00:02:41.610> they<00:02:41.790> can<00:02:41.940> just<00:02:41.970> remove<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.480> hard<00:02:42.690> drive

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
or they can just remove the hard drive

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.420 
or they can just remove the hard drive
and<00:02:43.140> access<00:02:43.530> their<00:02:43.620> data<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:43.980> way<00:02:44.099> so<00:02:44.160> this

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
and access their data that way so this

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.890 
and access their data that way so this
is<00:02:44.519> basically<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.940> secure<00:02:45.300> single<00:02:45.629> computer

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
is basically a secure single computer

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.570 
is basically a secure single computer
this<00:02:46.379> is<00:02:46.530> option<00:02:49.160> once<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.340> were<00:02:50.400> done<00:02:50.550> with

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
this is option once you were done with

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.640 
this is option once you were done with
everything<00:02:50.849> you<00:02:51.150> do<00:02:51.390> all<00:02:51.660> closer<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.319> BIOS

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
everything you do all closer to the BIOS

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.589 
everything you do all closer to the BIOS
and<00:02:53.430> we<00:02:53.580> need<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.849> do<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.090> if<00:02:54.209> you're<00:02:54.330> not<00:02:54.480> in

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
and we need to do is if you're not in

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.839 
and we need to do is if you're not in
the<00:02:54.660> main<00:02:54.870> menu<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.560> just<00:02:55.739> escape<00:02:56.280> until<00:02:56.519> you

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
the main menu you just escape until you

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:59.270 
the main menu you just escape until you
get<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.599> the<00:02:57.690> main<00:02:57.780> menu<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.260> near<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.069> bottom

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
it should say similar like f10 sieve and

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.130 
it should say similar like f10 sieve and
escape<00:03:01.980> something<00:03:02.310> like<00:03:02.489> that<00:03:02.670> so<00:03:03.330> just<00:03:03.659> press
