connector here and you can just see just

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.630 
connector here and you can just see just
a<00:00:25.019> switch<00:00:25.260> on<00:00:25.470> we've<00:00:25.980> set<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.340> switch<00:00:26.490> to

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
a switch on we've set the switch to

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.970 
a switch on we've set the switch to
input<00:00:27.599> because<00:00:27.840> we're<00:00:27.990> using<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.380> as<00:00:28.500> an<00:00:28.650> input

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
input because we're using it as an input

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.759 
input because we're using it as an input
on<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> TV<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.849> we're<00:00:30.840> just<00:00:31.019> using<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.529> video

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
on the TV and we're just using the video

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.250 
on the TV and we're just using the video
input<00:00:32.009> here<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.910> also<00:00:33.149> it's<00:00:33.510> possible<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.140> add

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
input here but also it's possible to add

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.319 
input here but also it's possible to add

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
this picture spared this lead on this

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.869 
this picture spared this lead on this
RCS<00:00:39.540> character<00:00:39.960> dr.<00:00:40.370> extremely<00:00:41.370> common<00:00:41.640> and

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
RCS character dr. extremely common and

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.690 
RCS character dr. extremely common and
because<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.110> widely<00:00:43.860> available<00:00:43.920> both<00:00:44.489> on

work<00:00:46.890> itself<00:00:47.219> okay<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.090> let's<00:00:48.420> just<00:00:48.480> look<00:00:48.719> at

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
work itself okay so let's just look at

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.439 
work itself okay so let's just look at
back<00:00:49.110> off<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.920> television<00:00:50.550> here<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.270> main

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
back off and television here so the main

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.689 
back off and television here so the main
thing<00:00:51.719> is<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.170> just<00:00:52.739> look<00:00:52.980> at<00:00:53.129> quickly<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
thing is is just look at quickly the

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.880 
thing is is just look at quickly the
common<00:00:54.030> inputs<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.899> on<00:00:55.079> TVs<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
common inputs that we have on TVs the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.619 
common inputs that we have on TVs the
three<00:00:56.129> most<00:00:56.309> common<00:00:56.460> inputs<00:00:57.030> will<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.449> is

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
three most common inputs will have is

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.160 
three most common inputs will have is
will<00:00:58.109> have<00:00:58.199> HDMI<00:00:58.910> will<00:00:59.910> have<00:01:00.180> an<00:01:00.449> RF<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.960> which

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
will have HDMI will have an RF in which

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.410 
will have HDMI will have an RF in which
basically<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> feed<00:01:02.010> normally<00:01:02.520> from<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.969> UHF

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
basically a feed normally from a UHF

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.210 
basically a feed normally from a UHF
aerial<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.320> then<00:01:04.500> would<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> Skerritt

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
aerial and then would have the Skerritt

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.850 
aerial and then would have the Skerritt
input<00:01:05.640> here<00:01:05.970> okay<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.619> lot<00:01:07.740> of

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
input here okay and it's a lot of

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.750 
input here okay and it's a lot of
connectors<00:01:08.220> there<00:01:08.340> but<00:01:08.520> they're<00:01:08.670> two

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
connectors there but they're two

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.219 
connectors there but they're two
fundamental<00:01:09.270> ones<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.780> we're<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:09.900> going<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
fundamental ones so we're just going to

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.719 
fundamental ones so we're just going to
focus<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> scare<00:01:10.979> clean<00:01:11.250> because

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
focus in the scare clean because

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.640 
focus in the scare clean because
virtually<00:01:12.150> all<00:01:12.180> television<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:13.380> Scout

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
virtually all television have Scout

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.130 
virtually all television have Scout
inputs<00:01:14.070> okay<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:15.150> what<00:01:15.509> we're<00:01:15.600> gonna<00:01:15.720> do<00:01:15.930> here

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
inputs okay so what we're gonna do here

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.320 
inputs okay so what we're gonna do here
is<00:01:16.320> I'm<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.189> focus<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.759> next<00:01:17.939> on

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
is I'm just going to focus the next on

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.840 
is I'm just going to focus the next on
the<00:01:18.420> back<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.290> DVR<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.430> can<00:01:20.549> see<00:01:20.670> we

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
the back of the DVR and we can see we

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.240 
the back of the DVR and we can see we
have<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.509> there's<00:01:22.049> two<00:01:22.229> basic<00:01:22.439> outputs<00:01:23.100> we

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
have and there's two basic outputs we

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.090 
have and there's two basic outputs we
can<00:01:23.400> use<00:01:23.580> here<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.900> were<00:01:25.020> using<00:01:25.229> this

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
can use here and if we were using this

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.770 
can use here and if we were using this
in<00:01:26.159> conjunction<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.759> television<00:01:27.390> we'll<00:01:27.750> use

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
in conjunction with television we'll use

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.770 
in conjunction with television we'll use
the<00:01:28.200> video<00:01:28.829> BNC<00:01:29.430> output<00:01:29.880> here<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.479> there's<00:01:30.689> an

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
the video BNC output here and there's an

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.390 
the video BNC output here and there's an
audio<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.290> output<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.040> we<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.250> use

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
audio in output that we can use

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.100 
audio in output that we can use
underneath<00:01:32.820> all<00:01:33.360> these<00:01:33.720> other<00:01:33.840> ones<00:01:34.049> are

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
underneath all these other ones are

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.380 
underneath all these other ones are
actually<00:01:34.229> inputs<00:01:34.799> from<00:01:34.950> cameras<00:01:35.400> okay<00:01:35.970> and

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
actually inputs from cameras okay and

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.969 
actually inputs from cameras okay and
then<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.020> were<00:01:37.079> using<00:01:37.380> an<00:01:37.500> e<00:01:37.560> conjunction

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
then if we were using an e conjunction

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.399 
then if we were using an e conjunction
with<00:01:38.130> and

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
with and

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.099 
with and
and<00:01:39.649> a<00:01:40.130> monitor<00:01:41.060> with<00:01:41.299> such<00:01:41.479> as<00:01:41.600> a<00:01:41.630> monitor

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
and a monitor with such as a monitor

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:44.529 
and a monitor with such as a monitor
that<00:01:42.140> would<00:01:42.469> have<00:01:42.590> used<00:01:42.890> with<00:01:43.189> a<00:01:43.539> computer

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
that would have used with a computer

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.749 
that would have used with a computer
would<00:01:45.049> just<00:01:45.289> use<00:01:45.439> this<00:01:45.590> VGA<00:01:46.009> connection<00:01:46.460> here

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
would just use this VGA connection here

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.209 
would just use this VGA connection here
VGA<00:01:47.359> can<00:01:47.630> have<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.049> picture<00:01:48.469> but<00:01:48.590> not<00:01:48.740> silent

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
VGA can have the picture but not silent

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:50.649 
VGA can have the picture but not silent
okay<00:01:49.490> so<00:01:50.000> we're<00:01:50.119> going<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:50.299> do<00:01:50.390> at<00:01:50.509> this<00:01:50.600> point

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
okay so we're going to do at this point

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.080 
okay so we're going to do at this point
here<00:01:51.049> is<00:01:51.109> I'm<00:01:51.200> just<00:01:51.229> going<00:01:51.469> to<00:01:51.530> grab<00:01:51.710> this<00:01:52.090> BNC

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
here is I'm just going to grab this BNC

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.239 
here is I'm just going to grab this BNC
connection<00:01:53.659> here<00:01:53.869> I'm<00:01:54.469> just<00:01:54.560> gonna<00:01:54.770> slide<00:01:55.069> it

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:55.249 
connection here I'm just gonna slide it

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:57.760 
connection here I'm just gonna slide it
on<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:56.119> we<00:01:56.240> have<00:01:56.390> it<00:01:56.450> connected<00:01:56.869> now<00:01:57.049> I<00:01:57.289> will

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
on and we have it connected now I will

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.160 
take the faunal output here I will push
it<00:02:00.259> into<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.679> video<00:02:01.000> input<00:02:02.000> here<00:02:02.450> I'm<00:02:02.780> gonna

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
it into the video input here I'm gonna

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.599 
it into the video input here I'm gonna
simply<00:02:03.439> come<00:02:03.590> along<00:02:03.829> now<00:02:04.069> I'm<00:02:04.310> gonna<00:02:04.459> get

simply come along now I'm gonna get
there<00:02:04.819> make<00:02:05.359> sure<00:02:05.390> it's<00:02:05.539> in<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:06.020> input<00:02:06.859> side

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
there make sure it's in the input side

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:08.529 
there make sure it's in the input side
and<00:02:07.549> then<00:02:07.849> we'll<00:02:07.939> come<00:02:08.119> along<00:02:08.209> we've

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
and then we'll come along we've

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.180 
and then we'll come along we've
connected<00:02:08.750> into<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:09.229> scab<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.709> put<00:02:09.979> under

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
connected into the scab and put under

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.949 
connected into the scab and put under
the<00:02:10.250> back<00:02:10.399> of<00:02:10.519> the<00:02:10.580> TV<00:02:10.759> I've<00:02:11.629> actually<00:02:11.780> just

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
the back of the TV I've actually just

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.210 
the back of the TV I've actually just
rotate<00:02:12.500> this<00:02:12.650> right<00:02:13.720> you'll<00:02:14.720> see<00:02:15.069> that<00:02:16.069> we

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
rotate this right you'll see that we

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.390 
rotate this right you'll see that we
have<00:02:16.489> four<00:02:16.910> channel<00:02:17.650> being<00:02:18.650> displayed<00:02:19.040> here

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
have four channel being displayed here

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.460 
have four channel being displayed here
okay<00:02:19.819> now<00:02:20.209> basic<00:02:20.660> and<00:02:20.810> fundamental<00:02:20.900> thing<00:02:21.379> is

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
okay now basic and fundamental thing is

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.900 
okay now basic and fundamental thing is
there's<00:02:21.680> no<00:02:21.709> picture<00:02:22.160> here<00:02:22.340> because<00:02:22.430> with<00:02:22.700> no

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
there's no picture here because with no

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.880 
there's no picture here because with no
cameras<00:02:23.360> going<00:02:23.510> but<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.200> can<00:02:24.319> see<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.709> four

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
cameras going but you can see the four

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.979 
cameras going but you can see the four
basic<00:02:25.280> zones<00:02:25.519> so<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.060> output<00:02:26.450> from<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.690> DVR

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
basic zones so the output from the DVR

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.350 
basic zones so the output from the DVR
very<00:02:27.440> quickly<00:02:27.739> and<00:02:27.950> very<00:02:28.069> easily<00:02:28.209> we<00:02:29.209> also

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
very quickly and very easily we also

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.819 
very quickly and very easily we also
have<00:02:29.720> select<00:02:30.079> the<00:02:31.209> preset<00:02:32.209> okay<00:02:33.019> so<00:02:33.620> I'm<00:02:33.680> just

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
have select the preset okay so I'm just

have select the preset okay so I'm just
going<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.069> turn<00:02:34.370> this<00:02:34.519> back<00:02:34.730> around<00:02:34.760> here

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
going to turn this back around here

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.449 
going to turn this back around here
and<00:02:35.480> I'll<00:02:35.599> talk<00:02:35.750> some<00:02:35.959> more<00:02:36.049> and<00:02:36.349> see<00:02:36.620> is<00:02:36.799> there

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
and I'll talk some more and see is there

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.860 
and I'll talk some more and see is there
any<00:02:37.670> way<00:02:37.849> we<00:02:38.030> can<00:02:38.150> actually<00:02:38.299> run<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.750> audio

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
any way we can actually run the audio

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.920 
any way we can actually run the audio
over<00:02:39.470> as<00:02:39.739> well<00:02:39.950> well<00:02:40.519> we<00:02:40.670> had<00:02:40.849> a<00:02:40.879> secondary<00:02:41.660> and

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
over as well well we had a secondary and

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.910 
over as well well we had a secondary and
RCA<00:02:42.560> output<00:02:43.720> or<00:02:44.720> sorry<00:02:45.019> and<00:02:45.319> yeah<00:02:45.560> something

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
RCA output or sorry and yeah something

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.440 
RCA output or sorry and yeah something
like<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.099> phone<00:02:46.310> or<00:02:46.459> connector<00:02:46.849> here<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:47.389> if

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
like the phone or connector here so if

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.970 
like the phone or connector here so if
we<00:02:47.510> use<00:02:47.660> this<00:02:47.840> white<00:02:48.079> phone<00:02:48.319> for<00:02:48.650> instance

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
we use this white phone for instance

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.539 
we use this white phone for instance
when<00:02:49.489> we<00:02:49.519> connected<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.150> into<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.510> audio<00:02:50.840> here

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
when we connected it into the audio here

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.490 
when we connected it into the audio here
we<00:02:52.549> could<00:02:52.670> run<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.030> fire<00:02:53.209> end<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:53.780> connect

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
we could run the fire end and connect

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.280 
we could run the fire end and connect
within<00:02:54.709> here<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:55.310> if<00:02:56.060> we<00:02:56.090> did<00:02:56.450> have<00:02:56.780> all<00:02:57.109> your

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
within here and if we did have all your

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.589 
within here and if we did have all your
output<00:02:57.799> from<00:02:57.950> the<00:02:58.099> DVR<00:02:58.430> we<00:02:58.970> could<00:02:59.090> feed<00:02:59.269> it<00:02:59.450> in

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
output from the DVR we could feed it in

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.420 
output from the DVR we could feed it in
with<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.930> picture<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.620> actual<00:03:00.980> screen<00:03:01.220> as

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
with the picture to the actual screen as

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.750 
with the picture to the actual screen as
well<00:03:01.639> okay<00:03:02.180> so<00:03:02.840> that's<00:03:03.230> another<00:03:03.859> possible

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
well okay so that's another possible

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.479 
well okay so that's another possible
addition<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.269> it<00:03:05.389> now<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.290> if<00:03:07.099> you<00:03:07.250> were<00:03:07.340> lucky

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
addition to it now and if you were lucky

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.789 
addition to it now and if you were lucky
enough<00:03:07.639> to<00:03:07.790> have<00:03:07.910> a<00:03:08.090> DVR<00:03:08.510> to<00:03:08.930> have<00:03:09.079> a<00:03:09.109> HDMI

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
enough to have a DVR to have a HDMI

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.370 
enough to have a DVR to have a HDMI
output<00:03:10.280> then<00:03:10.849> it<00:03:11.239> would<00:03:11.630> make<00:03:11.810> things<00:03:12.019> very

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
output then it would make things very

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.099 
output then it would make things very
easy<00:03:12.709> you<00:03:13.040> use<00:03:13.400> something<00:03:13.880> like<00:03:13.910> this<00:03:14.480> HDMI

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
easy you use something like this HDMI

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.379 
easy you use something like this HDMI
lead<00:03:15.410> here<00:03:15.769> to<00:03:15.950> simply<00:03:16.430> take<00:03:16.579> picture<00:03:17.239> and

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
lead here to simply take picture and

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.660 
lead here to simply take picture and
sound<00:03:17.569> and<00:03:17.959> rectly<00:03:18.829> truly

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
sound and rectly truly

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.640 
sound and rectly truly
and<00:03:20.209> feed<00:03:20.450> it<00:03:20.569> directly<00:03:20.690> into<00:03:21.020> the<00:03:21.140> television

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
and feed it directly into the television

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.750 
and feed it directly into the television
now<00:03:22.150> virtually<00:03:23.150> all<00:03:23.360> televisions<00:03:24.110> now<00:03:24.920> HDMI

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
now virtually all televisions now HDMI

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.120 
now virtually all televisions now HDMI
inputs<00:03:26.180> but<00:03:26.690> mostly<00:03:27.140> they<00:03:27.380> are<00:03:27.500> still<00:03:27.890> don't

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
inputs but mostly they are still don't

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.190 
inputs but mostly they are still don't
have<00:03:28.310> HDMI<00:03:28.910> outputs<00:03:29.360> if<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:29.870> looked<00:03:30.050> at<00:03:30.170> a

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
have HDMI outputs if you looked at a

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.050 
have HDMI outputs if you looked at a
range<00:03:30.470> of<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.739> DB<00:03:31.010> orbs<00:03:31.280> that<00:03:31.310> we<00:03:31.520> stopped<00:03:31.819> and

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
range of the DB orbs that we stopped and

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.270 
range of the DB orbs that we stopped and
pretty<00:03:32.390> typical<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:33.230> former<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:33.800> EF<00:03:34.130> way

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
pretty typical the former and the EF way

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.300 
pretty typical the former and the EF way
Accomando<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:35.120> HDMI<00:03:36.020> outputs<00:03:36.470> but<00:03:36.860> once<00:03:37.100> you

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
Accomando and HDMI outputs but once you

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.160 
Accomando and HDMI outputs but once you
move<00:03:37.489> into<00:03:37.850> it<00:03:38.090> said<00:03:38.239> sixteen<00:03:38.750> way<00:03:38.930> which

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
move into it said sixteen way which

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.840 
move into it said sixteen way which
would<00:03:39.260> be<00:03:39.319> tough<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:39.800> professional<00:03:40.400> ones<00:03:40.610> all

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
would be tough and professional ones all

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.790 
would be tough and professional ones all
in<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.330> end<00:03:41.420> essentially<00:03:42.050> I<00:03:42.140> hope<00:03:42.530> that's

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
in the end essentially I hope that's

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.370 
in the end essentially I hope that's
become<00:03:43.040> extremely<00:03:43.430> common<00:03:43.730> and<00:03:44.300> so<00:03:45.020> that's<00:03:45.200> it

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
become extremely common and so that's it

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.340 
become extremely common and so that's it
