00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
long long way so I would just do like

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.619 
long long way so I would just do like
about<00:01:02.500> two<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:03.040> three<00:01:03.070> taps<00:01:03.550> at<00:01:04.119> each<00:01:04.329> of<00:01:04.509> those

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
about two to three taps at each of those

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.359 
about two to three taps at each of those
parts<00:01:05.049> doesn't<00:01:05.379> have<00:01:05.469> to<00:01:05.590> be<00:01:05.649> perfect<00:01:06.159> because

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
parts doesn't have to be perfect because

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.609 
parts doesn't have to be perfect because
you're<00:01:06.520> going<00:01:06.670> to<00:01:06.729> rub<00:01:06.880> it<00:01:06.969> around<00:01:07.060> anyway<00:01:07.619> and
