00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 as for the last video we have 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.830
 unmarked open opening with them 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.599
 four 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.480
 this time we will move to a 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:17.100
 closed opening so introduced by the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:20.880
 cost of four and so after a 4 on 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.300
 going to analyze a gambit lady refused so 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.230
 d4 d5 still challenging the center 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.570
 the symmetrical response of black to white 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.969
 alas this time we go downright 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.320
 to offer a pawn to the black I reassure you 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.780
 it is temporary that there are variants 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.879
 to recover it in order to develop our 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.480
 pieces more harmoniously and more 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.340
 so quickly to the on these 4 rather 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.770
 than take the blacks will play c6 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.770
 and finally it's so it's a blow 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.500
 interesting since on taking in d5 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.100
 by our pioncer 4 whites the blacks 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.949
 will simply answer the recovery on 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.049
 five by their black c6 pawns so 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.030
 finally there would be a symmetry that 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.920
 would be perfect on the chessboard 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.950
 and at the centers of the structure 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.610
 of pawns so the blacks are not going 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.350
 take the blanks either and each is going 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.830
 just trying to make sure that 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.320
 the opposing side take the first one so 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.430
 to consolidate its pawn structure 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.720
 central so cavalier c3 always in 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.390
 the goal of bringing center and 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.020
 to control the central boxes there one 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.820
 see for example that the cost of 4 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.860
 the thrust of the pawn in four is 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.259
 possible and that it's a very 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.630
 interesting since it will bring a 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.470
 additional pressure on the box of 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.189
 5 then instead of letting us do 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.070
 obviously the blacks go right away 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:02:00.090
 prevented that by rider f6 to bring 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.829
 a piece that controls box 4 in addition 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.390
 and that will prevent us from pushing 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.110
 our pawns since it would simply be 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.580
 give to the opponent and so there is 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.319
 several variants jacques cavallier f3 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.050
 which is possible we will study the 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.350
 variant to almost 3 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:19.580
 and after three years we realize that 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:22.520
 the the c4 counter is now protected by 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.330
 our crazy f1 and that now we're going 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.220
 to be able to release the pieces on the rights 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.150
 so the rider who is located in giant 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.310
 or the fouquet located in f1 for roque and 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.860
 as soon as possible now that we have 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.040
 got a strong center since we have a 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.260
 pawn c4 which controls the central box 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.390
 of the five is a pawn of the four who 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.580
 check the central box e5 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.120
 we also have a rider who controls the 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.040
 center also the boxes of 4 and d5 our 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.910
 jumper in c3 and so we can 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.270
 just now take out our pieces 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.890
 miller for castling and quietly at 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.090
 it's also a good shot 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.490
 since it protects once more the 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.350
 pawn of the five the case of the five is a 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.590
 key box in this opening since 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:16.370
 this is the basis of all the pressures 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.090
 we're going to say and riders f3 is a shot 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.970
 interesting since it prevents 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.430
 hence any thrust of black pawns 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.280
 in them 5 for example after jumpers b17 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.850
 which will be played right away 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.950
 riders p 17 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.550
 so here it's clear that the goal for 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.310
 blacks is to be able to push this 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.900
 pawn in the 5 the pure of 6 to bring him into 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.850
 1-5 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.510
 that would create an attack in the center 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.870
 would attack the size of the structure 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.739
 of pawns in the center and that's what he 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.560
 always try to get with 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.959
 with our pawns in the opening 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.390
 dams and two to just bring 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.790
 one more piece that controls this 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.010
 famous box e 4 in order to push 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.980
 our plus 4 is no mystery it's 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.300
 not complicated the blacks is looking to 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.950
 push their pawns succeed when the 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.080
 5 and whites seeks to push their 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.320
 three year old pawns on the 4th it's not over 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.169
 complicated that it fucks six always 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.330
 the same idea to push their pawns in 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.250
 them 5 and lanouf where of the three with 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.740
 always the same idea also to push 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.039
 our pawn of 4 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:29.500
 and so there the white threat she is 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:31.630
 clear is the thrust 4 right now 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.780
 which would threaten in addition a fork 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.940
 on box 5 being that blacks 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.720
 take the lead if I dare to say and 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.729
 immediately play the shot them 5 who's going 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.599
 ultimately challenge the center 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:49.270
 white and who goes first threatened the 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:51.669
 fork in them four so forcing 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.389
 probably the whites to take this 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:57.370
 pawn years 5 and after it's a part 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.800
 which is played but the important thing is 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.409
 see that in the opening 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.720
 we have to come to challenge to try to 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:06.909
 control the maximum of central box 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.069
 with his pawns and then with these 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:11.050
 pieces is disputed never leave 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:13.750
 the opponent do what he wants to try 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.599
 yourself to get a central attack 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.669
 with the structure of pions here is where 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:22.120
 we have a position that is balanced 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:24.849
 since to the two pawns that are 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.759
 finally on the fourth row the 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:30.669
 pawn c4 who is here and the pawn of 4 on 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:33.909
 has a kind of symmetry with the pawn 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.940
 a 5 and the e5 pawn is therefore also the 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:40.050
 fork threat that we see here 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:42.729
 indicated with the red arrow 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.330
 so here I hope that this little 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.219
 opening or you also allowed have 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.259
 more of the Spanish variant of 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:53.080
 the Spanish opening to understand a 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.889
 little better how to play the openings 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.419
 In chess 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:00.580
 in any case I really did the best 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.110
 for to put the most items 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.250
 important I think for a beginner or 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:07.900
 for a player who discovers the game 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:11.319
 together in two small openings 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.270
 finally as soon as they come from videos 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:15.909
 short of less than 10 minutes 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.560
 here I will maybe make other videos 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:19.120
 I'm not sure yet everything depends on 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.120
 time I will have to do it 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.700
 soon because I'm going to attack 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.270
 with 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:30.310
 the opening variants of greek with 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.040
 especially miniature parties I 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:36.040
 past you know him greco was a 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.050
 17th century Italian player who was 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.890
 very brilliant tactically and who has 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:44.590
 writes a two-part compendium in 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.570
 which we see all that is matte 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.190
 from Greek maths which is very well known 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.840
 since we can see it in the rules 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:54.730
 chess in the low forgiveness to 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:56.980
 on it and it's a it's a 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:59.550
 classic to know absolutely for all 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:03.100
 amateur players to avoid this 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:05.320
 finally to take a quick defeat 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.840
 on a miniature part with an oversight 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.310
 any in the opening 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.980
 here and well I'll see you soon for 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:15.730
 for all these novelties and thank you for 

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:17.910
 have me watch if I can tell at 

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.910
 meet again
