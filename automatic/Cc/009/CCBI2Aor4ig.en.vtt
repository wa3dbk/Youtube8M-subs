five<00:00:07.370> application<00:00:08.370> it's<00:00:09.360> very<00:00:09.450> basic<00:00:09.840> whether

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
five application it's very basic whether

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.370 
five application it's very basic whether
you<00:00:10.980> have<00:00:11.330> some<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.540> other<00:00:12.660> models<00:00:12.929> that

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
you have some of the other models that

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:25.070 
you have some of the other models that
we<00:00:13.469> have<00:00:13.500> that<00:00:13.920> are<00:00:14.070> wider<00:00:22.220> the<00:00:23.220> course<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.420> the

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
we have that are wider the course of the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.900 
we have that are wider the course of the
application<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.890> installation<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.640> going<00:00:26.730> to

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
application and installation is going to

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.429 
application and installation is going to
be<00:00:27.060> exactly<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.750> same

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
be exactly the same

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.209 
be exactly the same
now<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.640> first<00:00:29.990> step<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.230> need<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.980> do<00:00:32.309> is<00:00:34.219> to

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
now the first step you need to do is to

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.190 
now the first step you need to do is to
place<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.640> over<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.090> top<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.630> tips<00:00:36.870> like

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
place it over this top of the tips like

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.510 
place it over this top of the tips like
so<00:00:37.550> now<00:00:38.550> when<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.300> doing<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.370> you're<00:00:41.370> going

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
so now when you doing this you're going

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.790 
so now when you doing this you're going
to<00:00:41.610> need<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:42.000> push<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.960> all<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.860> way<00:00:43.980> back<00:00:45.800> so

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
to need to push that all the way back so

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.319 
to need to push that all the way back so
that<00:00:48.710> you're<00:00:49.710> you're<00:00:50.100> gonna<00:00:50.250> hit<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.940> trunk

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
that you're you're gonna hit the trunk

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.590 
that you're you're gonna hit the trunk
area<00:00:51.539> that's<00:00:52.699> part<00:00:53.699> right<00:00:53.910> here<00:00:54.149> that's<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
area that's part right here that's the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.889 
area that's part right here that's the
factory<00:00:55.160> sub<00:00:56.160> trunk<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.969> then<00:00:57.300> once<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.690> get

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
factory sub trunk and then once you get

factory sub trunk and then once you get
it<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.530> gonna<00:00:58.680> kind<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.100> bottom<00:00:59.789> out

of the panel see how's the two holes
those<00:01:39.180> are<00:01:39.329> gonna<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.689> screw<00:01:39.930> right<00:01:40.229> in

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
those are gonna just screw right in

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.920 
those are gonna just screw right in
using<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.890> self-tapping<00:01:41.189> screws<00:01:41.880> now<00:01:42.750> it's

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
using the self-tapping screws now it's

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.530 
using the self-tapping screws now it's
important<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.439> understand<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:45.000> panel

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
important to understand that this panel

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.289 
important to understand that this panel
is<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.930> go<00:01:46.140> at<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.860> pretty<00:01:47.250> extreme<00:01:47.759> angle

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
is going to go at a pretty extreme angle

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.170 
is going to go at a pretty extreme angle
from<00:01:48.630> from<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.799> valance<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.490> top<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:50.970> tip

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
from from the valance the top of the tip

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.210 
from from the valance the top of the tip
area<00:01:51.570> all<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.810> way<00:01:52.079> over<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> trunk<00:01:52.979> it's

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
area all the way over to the trunk it's

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.289 
area all the way over to the trunk it's
gonna<00:01:53.369> sit<00:01:53.670> at<00:01:53.820> an<00:01:53.939> angle<00:01:55.880> once<00:01:56.880> you're<00:01:57.149> in

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
gonna sit at an angle once you're in

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.039 
gonna sit at an angle once you're in
position<00:01:58.549> we've<00:01:59.549> provided<00:02:00.049> self-tapping
