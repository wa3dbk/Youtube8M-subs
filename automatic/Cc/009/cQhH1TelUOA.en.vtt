00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
start the night before just because it

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.560 
start the night before just because it
is<00:00:56.649> kind<00:00:56.950> of<00:00:57.040> a<00:00:57.100> process<00:00:57.550> it<00:00:57.760> does<00:00:57.940> have<00:00:58.120> to<00:00:58.270> sit

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
is kind of a process it does have to sit

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.139 
is kind of a process it does have to sit
you<00:00:59.230> do<00:00:59.440> have<00:00:59.680> to<00:00:59.800> boil<00:01:00.010> the<00:01:00.160> water<00:01:00.340> have<00:01:00.879> the

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
you do have to boil the water have the

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.420 
you do have to boil the water have the
first<00:01:01.360> layer<00:01:01.540> set<00:01:01.899> and<00:01:02.200> then<00:01:02.440> you<00:01:02.829> know<00:01:03.040> do<00:01:03.309> the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
first layer set and then you know do the

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.009 
first layer set and then you know do the
instant<00:01:03.850> pudding<00:01:03.969> although<00:01:04.390> that's<00:01:04.539> a<00:01:04.809> lot

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
instant pudding although that's a lot

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.840 
instant pudding although that's a lot
quicker<00:01:05.199> than<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:05.619> jello<00:01:05.859> but<00:01:06.459> then<00:01:06.609> the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
quicker than the jello but then the

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.209 
quicker than the jello but then the
final<00:01:07.240> layer<00:01:07.569> of<00:01:07.780> jello<00:01:07.990> also<00:01:08.380> has<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.709> sit<00:01:08.950> so

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:09.219 
final layer of jello also has to sit so

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:10.230 
final layer of jello also has to sit so
that<00:01:09.249> way<00:01:09.579> if<00:01:09.700> you<00:01:09.789> do<00:01:09.909> it<00:01:09.939> the<00:01:10.060> night<00:01:10.209> before

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
that way if you do it the night before

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.760 
that way if you do it the night before
then<00:01:10.780> you<00:01:10.840> don't<00:01:10.990> have<00:01:11.079> to<00:01:11.139> stress<00:01:11.469> about<00:01:11.619> it

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
then you don't have to stress about it

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.319 
then you don't have to stress about it
the<00:01:11.979> whole<00:01:12.130> entire<00:01:12.399> day<00:01:12.670> especially<00:01:12.999> for

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
the whole entire day especially for

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:27.770 
the whole entire day especially for
making<00:01:13.749> multiple<00:01:14.020> treat

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.080 

and<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.620> course<00:01:28.890> because<00:01:29.310> whipped<00:01:29.760> cream

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
and of course because whipped cream

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.360 
and of course because whipped cream
makes<00:01:30.450> everything<00:01:30.990> taste<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.920> much<00:01:32.130> better

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370

raspberries and blueberries to make sure

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.350

you<00:02:03.400> don't<00:02:03.610> have<00:02:03.760> the<00:02:03.850> stems<00:02:04.060> with<00:02:04.210> them

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
you don't have the stems with them

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.820 
you don't have the stems with them
blueberries<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.050> then<00:02:05.290> you're<00:02:05.410> gonna<00:02:05.530> fill

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
blueberries and then you're gonna fill

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.710 
blueberries and then you're gonna fill
it<00:02:05.950> with<00:02:06.070> water<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:06.400> let<00:02:06.880> it<00:02:06.970> sit<00:02:07.300> till<00:02:07.570> it

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
it with water and let it sit till it

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:15.780 
it with water and let it sit till it
obviously<00:02:08.320> gets<00:02:08.560> frozen<00:02:14.160> after<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:15.490> comes<00:02:15.610> out

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
obviously gets frozen after it comes out

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.400 
obviously gets frozen after it comes out
of<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.030> freezer<00:02:16.210> this<00:02:16.630> is<00:02:16.810> what<00:02:16.990> it<00:02:17.140> looks

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
of the freezer this is what it looks

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.470 
of the freezer this is what it looks
like<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.950> pretty<00:02:18.550> much<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:18.880> just<00:02:18.910> add<00:02:19.240> it<00:02:19.360> to

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
like and pretty much you just add it to

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.780
