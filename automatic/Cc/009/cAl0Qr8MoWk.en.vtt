don't have to play zone against and then

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.670 
don't have to play zone against and then
we<00:00:24.210> got<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.480> second<00:00:24.810> half<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.230> well<00:00:25.470> if

violation is the nuances of the rule the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.370 
violation is the nuances of the rule the
out-of-bounds<00:00:30.390> call<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.990> single<00:00:31.260> worst

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
out-of-bounds call is the single worst

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.170 
out-of-bounds call is the single worst
call<00:00:31.590> I've<00:00:31.619> ever<00:00:31.890> seen<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.700> was<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> kind<00:00:33.059> of

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
call I've ever seen that was the kind of

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.930 
call I've ever seen that was the kind of
egregious<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:35.100> zone<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.610> single

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
egregious and so is the zone the single

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.190 
egregious and so is the zone the single
biggest<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.270> kill<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.570> think<00:00:36.840> going<00:00:36.960> forward

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
biggest to kill you think going forward

now<00:00:37.320> they<00:00:37.440> have<00:00:37.590> Kansas<00:00:37.950> state<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.250> believe<00:00:38.399> in

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
now they have Kansas state I believe in

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.150 
now they have Kansas state I believe in
the<00:00:39.059> second<00:00:39.360> round<00:00:39.450> that's<00:00:39.750> an<00:00:40.590> extension<00:00:40.860> to

the second round that's an extension to

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.340 
the second round that's an extension to
zone<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.550> right<00:00:41.730> it's<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> rebounding<00:00:42.660> issues

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
zone is right it's the rebounding issues

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.590 
zone is right it's the rebounding issues
they<00:00:43.920> don't<00:00:44.040> rebound<00:00:44.730> defensively<00:00:45.329> and

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
they don't rebound defensively and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.119 
they don't rebound defensively and
you're<00:00:45.750> asking<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.170> lot<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.379> any<00:00:46.590> team<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.860> win

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
you're asking a lot of any team to win

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.799 
you're asking a lot of any team to win
in<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> tournament<00:00:47.489> that's<00:00:47.940> extending

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
in the tournament that's extending

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.510 
in the tournament that's extending

possessions you know like okay well we
missed<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.789> shot<00:00:50.940> well<00:00:51.120> now<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.329> get<00:00:51.570> a<00:00:51.600> chance

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
missed the shot well now we get a chance

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.170

to<00:00:52.140> meet<00:00:52.350> another<00:00:52.800> one<00:00:53.160> how<00:00:53.640> are<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.820> supposed

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
to meet another one how are you supposed

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.610 
to meet another one how are you supposed
to<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:54.420> good<00:00:54.660> teams<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.170> don't<00:00:55.410> get<00:00:55.530> me<00:00:55.590> wrong

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
to be good teams and don't get me wrong

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.049 
to be good teams and don't get me wrong
it's<00:00:55.949> debatable<00:00:56.309> where<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> Kansas<00:00:56.910> is

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
it's debatable where the Kansas is

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.660 
it's debatable where the Kansas is
actually<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.719> good<00:00:57.930> team<00:00:58.170> but<00:00:58.680> UNC<00:00:59.190> Asheville

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
actually a good team but UNC Asheville

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.670 
actually a good team but UNC Asheville
man<00:00:59.879> they<00:01:00.059> did<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.270> mean<00:01:00.420> they<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:00.840> about<00:01:01.440> took

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
man they did I mean they just about took

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.640 
man they did I mean they just about took
them<00:01:01.800> there<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.370> aside<00:01:02.879> from<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.420> zone<00:01:03.930> sort

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
them there and aside from that zone sort

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.080 
them there and aside from that zone sort
of<00:01:04.710> exposing<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.159> weakness<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.610> Syracuse<00:01:06.030> where

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
of exposing a weakness of Syracuse where

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.429 
of exposing a weakness of Syracuse where
do<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.270> think<00:01:06.390> they<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.570> improve<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.020> parents

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
do you think they can improve on parents

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.410 
do you think they can improve on parents
offensively<00:01:07.890> well<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> guess<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.150> biggest

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
offensively well I guess the biggest

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.760 
offensively well I guess the biggest
thing<00:01:09.689> that's<00:01:09.810> difficult<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.229> say<00:01:10.320> after<00:01:10.740> a

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
thing that's difficult to say after a

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.050 
thing that's difficult to say after a
game<00:01:10.979> like<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.250> when<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.610> play<00:01:11.760> against<00:01:12.000> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
game like that when I play against a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.670 
game like that when I play against a
team<00:01:12.240> where<00:01:12.510> nobody<00:01:12.869> solid<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.260> me<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.530> you

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
team where nobody solid to me and you

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.010 
team where nobody solid to me and you
basically<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:14.700> hard<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.970> say<00:01:15.119> offensively

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
basically it's hard to say offensively

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.330 
basically it's hard to say offensively
what<00:01:16.259> exactly<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.860> they<00:01:17.009> can<00:01:17.130> do<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.310> course

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
what exactly it is they can do of course

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.710 
what exactly it is they can do of course
they<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:17.820> sharper<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.509> that's<00:01:18.630> an

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
they have to be sharper and that's an

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.270 
they have to be sharper and that's an
issue<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.259> fairness<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.890> see<00:01:20.100> with

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
issue in fairness that you see with

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.249 
issue in fairness that you see with
number<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:20.610> see<00:01:20.820> all<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.630> time<00:01:21.840> playing

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
number one see all the time playing
