00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
well because I said the cache is not

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.780 
well because I said the cache is not
good<00:03:00.940> in<00:03:01.209> there<00:03:01.600> but<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:03.130> only<00:03:03.370> case<00:03:03.550> what

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
good in there but the only case what

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.660 
good in there but the only case what
it's<00:03:03.970> not<00:03:04.180> good<00:03:04.450> is<00:03:04.989> if<00:03:05.530> you<00:03:05.590> are<00:03:05.980> making<00:03:06.010> only

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
it's not good is if you are making only

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.240 
it's not good is if you are making only
it's<00:03:07.000> not<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:07.540> good<00:03:07.870> if<00:03:08.050> you're<00:03:08.200> meeting<00:03:08.440> but

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
it's not that good if you're meeting but

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.490 
it's not that good if you're meeting but
if<00:03:09.370> you<00:03:09.489> are<00:03:09.580> maging<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.239> ranging<00:03:10.810> or<00:03:10.989> killing

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
if you are maging and ranging or killing

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.830 
if you are maging and ranging or killing
melee<00:03:11.920> and<00:03:12.160> range<00:03:12.520> it's<00:03:13.120> gonna<00:03:13.270> be<00:03:13.510> really

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
melee and range it's gonna be really

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.370 
melee and range it's gonna be really
good<00:03:14.020> because<00:03:14.190> currently<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.370> mud<00:03:15.610> staff<00:03:15.940> is

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
good because currently the mud staff is

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.530 
good because currently the mud staff is
5.5<00:03:17.380> million<00:03:17.830> because<00:03:18.790> not<00:03:19.060> that<00:03:19.180> many<00:03:19.360> people

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
5.5 million because not that many people

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.690 
5.5 million because not that many people
have<00:03:19.930> that<00:03:20.170> high<00:03:20.470> defense<00:03:20.980> level<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.549> high

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
have that high defense level and high

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.030 
have that high defense level and high
range<00:03:22.000> level<00:03:22.420> you<00:03:22.840> know<00:03:22.989> combination<00:03:23.620> of<00:03:23.769> both

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
range level you know combination of both

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.910 
range level you know combination of both
so<00:03:24.750> that's<00:03:25.750> why<00:03:26.049> the<00:03:26.110> staff<00:03:26.440> is<00:03:26.620> currently

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
so that's why the staff is currently

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.900 
so that's why the staff is currently
really<00:03:27.160> high<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:27.989> yeah<00:03:28.989> that<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:30.400> diagonal

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
really high and yeah that that diagonal

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.820 
really high and yeah that that diagonal
thing<00:03:31.269> should<00:03:31.450> be<00:03:31.570> most<00:03:31.810> profitable<00:03:32.080> to<00:03:32.590> kill

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
thing should be most profitable to kill

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.890 
thing should be most profitable to kill
so<00:03:33.459> as<00:03:33.610> you<00:03:33.730> can<00:03:33.850> see<00:03:34.030> I<00:03:34.060> don't<00:03:34.209> have<00:03:34.480> that<00:03:34.660> much

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
so as you can see I don't have that much

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.460 
so as you can see I don't have that much
cash<00:03:35.200> I<00:03:35.530> only<00:03:35.769> have<00:03:36.070> 900<00:03:36.790> K<00:03:37.030> in<00:03:37.299> my<00:03:37.570> stack<00:03:38.110> and

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
cash I only have 900 K in my stack and

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.410 
cash I only have 900 K in my stack and
then<00:03:38.650> I<00:03:38.769> have<00:03:38.920> some<00:03:39.190> snake<00:03:39.489> skins<00:03:39.910> which<00:03:40.239> is

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
then I have some snake skins which is

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.520 
then I have some snake skins which is
around<00:03:40.690> 1<00:03:41.049> million

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
around 1 million

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.560 
around 1 million
I<00:03:41.769> bought<00:03:42.549> these<00:03:42.760> because<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:43.269> can<00:03:43.299> make

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
I bought these because you can make

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.569 
I bought these because you can make
quite<00:03:43.900> good<00:03:44.140> cash<00:03:44.380> from<00:03:44.620> them<00:03:44.829> if<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.130> make<00:03:45.310> in

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
quite good cash from them if you make in

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.479 
quite good cash from them if you make in
two<00:03:45.790> bodies<00:03:46.299> I<00:03:46.420> think<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:47.890> buy<00:03:48.070> them<00:03:48.280> for<00:03:48.430> like

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.479 
two bodies I think you buy them for like
3k<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.329> you<00:03:49.390> can<00:03:49.799> pretty<00:03:50.799> much<00:03:50.950> make<00:03:51.100> them

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
3k and you can pretty much make them

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.319 
3k and you can pretty much make them
into<00:03:51.730> 4k<00:03:52.000> so<00:03:53.579> yeah<00:03:54.579> that's<00:03:54.790> what<00:03:54.940> I'm<00:03:55.000> doing<00:03:55.209> at

chompers like a few weeks ago I made a

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.740 
chompers like a few weeks ago I made a
video<00:04:33.100> where<00:04:33.789> I<00:04:33.819> was<00:04:34.060> training<00:04:34.360> with<00:04:34.539> the

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
equip them and a lot of you said that

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.620 
equip them and a lot of you said that
what<00:04:43.449> are<00:04:43.840> you<00:04:44.169> doing<00:04:44.590> to<00:04:44.949> not<00:04:45.210> use<00:04:46.210> great

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
what are you doing to not use great

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.969 
what are you doing to not use great
chinch<00:04:46.840> on<00:04:47.020> pasture

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
chinch on pasture

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.610 
chinch on pasture
actually<00:04:48.639> they<00:04:48.849> are<00:04:48.940> not<00:04:49.120> that<00:04:49.300> bad<00:04:49.539> the<00:04:50.319> dead

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
actually they are not that bad the dead

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.950 
actually they are not that bad the dead
chin<00:04:50.860> chompers<00:04:51.250> have<00:04:51.460> 25<00:04:52.000> more<00:04:52.270> accuracy<00:04:52.780> and

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
chin chompers have 25 more accuracy and

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.219 
chin chompers have 25 more accuracy and
max<00:04:53.800> it<00:04:54.099> is<00:04:54.370> increased<00:04:54.759> by<00:04:55.030> two<00:04:55.090> or<00:04:55.539> three<00:04:55.930> and

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
max it is increased by two or three and

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.510 
max it is increased by two or three and
that's<00:04:56.800> about<00:04:57.039> it

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
that's about it

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.480 
that's about it
and<00:04:57.789> they<00:04:58.150> cost<00:04:58.389> three<00:04:58.870> times<00:04:59.139> more<00:04:59.440> so<00:05:00.220> in<00:05:00.370> my

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
and they cost three times more so in my

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.790 
and they cost three times more so in my
opinion<00:05:00.639> gray<00:05:01.210> are<00:05:01.449> better<00:05:01.960> unless<00:05:02.500> you<00:05:02.680> have

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
opinion gray are better unless you have

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.310 
opinion gray are better unless you have
a<00:05:02.830> lot<00:05:03.099> of<00:05:03.130> cash<00:05:03.490> to<00:05:03.789> spend<00:05:04.030> on<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.320> legend
