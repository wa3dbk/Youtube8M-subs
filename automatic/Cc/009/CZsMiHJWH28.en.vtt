00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
crime world but also in all of our

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.460 
crime world but also in all of our
storylines<00:01:22.710> as<00:01:23.100> characters<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.840> get<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.229> lot

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
storylines as characters so I get a lot

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.179 
storylines as characters so I get a lot
of<00:01:25.890> most<00:01:26.520> people<00:01:26.939> stop<00:01:27.180> me<00:01:27.360> about<00:01:27.630> my<00:01:28.320> personal

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
tribulations on the show just as much as

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.969 
tribulations on the show just as much as
the<00:01:33.869> crimes<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.409> mean<00:01:34.530> that's<00:01:34.680> sort<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.890> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
the crimes I mean that's sort of a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.550 
the crimes I mean that's sort of a
backdrop<00:01:35.189> for<00:01:35.659> for<00:01:36.659> what<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.110> know<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
backdrop for for what you know the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.780 
backdrop for for what you know the
characters<00:01:37.979> are<00:01:38.100> going<00:01:38.340> through<00:01:38.430> every<00:01:38.640> week

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
characters are going through every week

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.940 
characters are going through every week
so<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.329> think<00:01:39.540> that's<00:01:39.720> why<00:01:39.960> fans<00:01:40.650> love<00:01:40.920> a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
so it's I think that's why fans love a

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.280 
so it's I think that's why fans love a
good<00:01:41.130> character<00:01:41.579> they<00:01:41.729> yes<00:01:41.880> I'm<00:01:42.119> 13<00:01:42.479> yeah<00:01:42.720> yeah

forthright and

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.260 
forthright and
she<00:02:13.900> had<00:02:13.990> a<00:02:14.020> very<00:02:14.430> clear<00:02:15.430> opinion<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:16.090> things

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.540 
she had a very clear opinion of things
and<00:02:16.510> that's<00:02:16.630> not<00:02:16.750> always<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.320> way<00:02:17.710> it<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:17.980> with

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
and that's not always the way it is with

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.830 
and that's not always the way it is with
women<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.120> television<00:02:19.480> at<00:02:19.540> least<00:02:19.690> at<00:02:19.810> that

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
women and television at least at that

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.280
