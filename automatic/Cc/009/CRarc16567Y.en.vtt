and<00:00:41.289> with<00:00:42.289> that<00:00:42.440> as<00:00:42.649> our<00:00:42.800> legacy<00:00:43.390> I've<00:00:44.390> always

and with that as our legacy I've always

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.209 
and with that as our legacy I've always
felt<00:00:44.870> with<00:00:45.110> an<00:00:45.230> electric<00:00:45.590> car<00:00:45.829> or<00:00:46.160> a

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
felt with an electric car or a

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.490 
felt with an electric car or a
possibility<00:00:46.940> we<00:00:46.969> would<00:00:47.329> have<00:00:47.480> to<00:00:47.719> move<00:00:48.230> into

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
possibility we would have to move into

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.349 
possibility we would have to move into
it<00:00:48.800> with<00:00:49.010> ideas<00:00:49.430> that<00:00:49.489> we<00:00:49.699> think<00:00:49.940> are<00:00:50.030> our<00:00:50.210> own

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 
it with ideas that we think are our own

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:53.979 
it with ideas that we think are our own
ideas<00:00:50.570> or<00:00:51.170> you<00:00:51.649> have<00:00:51.980> to<00:00:52.129> do<00:00:52.190> it<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:52.930> of<00:00:53.930> course

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
ideas or you have to do it and of course

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.869 
ideas or you have to do it and of course
that's<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:54.620> that's<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.039> most<00:00:55.250> basic<00:00:55.699> thing

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
that's the that's the most basic thing

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.080 
that's the that's the most basic thing
and<00:00:56.149> then<00:00:56.359> the<00:00:56.480> other<00:00:56.590> the<00:00:57.590> other<00:00:57.620> thing<00:00:57.980> is

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
and then the other the other thing is

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.590 
and then the other the other thing is
when<00:00:59.090> we<00:00:59.269> got<00:00:59.420> an<00:00:59.570> es<00:01:00.429> the<00:01:01.429> expression<00:01:02.149> system

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
when we got an es the expression system

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.270 
when we got an es the expression system
we<00:01:02.809> learned<00:01:03.050> so<00:01:03.320> much<00:01:03.530> about<00:01:03.940> because<00:01:06.100> we<00:01:07.100> move

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
we learned so much about because we move

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.450 
we learned so much about because we move
from<00:01:07.400> there<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:07.970> t<00:01:08.180> pi<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:09.100> at<00:01:10.100> that<00:01:10.280> point

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
from there the t pi and at that point

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.670 
from there the t pi and at that point
you<00:01:10.670> are<00:01:10.730> making<00:01:10.790> electric

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
you are making electric

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.640 
you are making electric
and<00:01:12.430> then<00:01:12.730> the<00:01:12.850> next<00:01:12.910> thing<00:01:13.150> you<00:01:13.330> know<00:01:13.650> really

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
and then the next thing you know really

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.130 
and then the next thing you know really
just<00:01:15.310> a<00:01:15.400> quick<00:01:15.610> history<00:01:15.790> of<00:01:16.180> this<00:01:16.360> guitar<00:01:16.510> we

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
just a quick history of this guitar we

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.630 
just a quick history of this guitar we
were<00:01:17.290> really<00:01:17.500> sort<00:01:17.980> of<00:01:18.010> chasing<00:01:18.430> down<00:01:18.580> the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
were really sort of chasing down the

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.390 
were really sort of chasing down the
next<00:01:19.090> TI<00:01:19.300> but<00:01:20.260> when<00:01:20.440> we<00:01:20.650> developed<00:01:21.100> a<00:01:21.160> pickup

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
next TI but when we developed a pickup

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.790 
next TI but when we developed a pickup
or<00:01:21.700> it<00:01:22.000> clearly<00:01:22.420> told<00:01:22.750> us<00:01:22.930> it<00:01:23.110> and<00:01:23.380> I<00:01:23.560> saw<00:01:23.770> a

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
or it clearly told us it and I saw a

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.530 
or it clearly told us it and I saw a
Pawnee<00:01:24.130> and<00:01:24.340> that's<00:01:24.520> really<00:01:24.880> happened

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
Pawnee and that's really happened

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.120 
Pawnee and that's really happened
because<00:01:25.840> I<00:01:26.140> can<00:01:26.350> remember<00:01:26.560> that<00:01:26.770> meeting

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
because I can remember that meeting

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.010 
because I can remember that meeting
where<00:01:27.340> we<00:01:27.370> go<00:01:27.610> oh<00:01:27.850> wait<00:01:28.390> a<00:01:28.420> minute<00:01:28.510> this<00:01:28.810> isn't

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
where we go oh wait a minute this isn't

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.160 
where we go oh wait a minute this isn't
the<00:01:29.260> thesis<00:01:29.770> this<00:01:30.490> is<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.700> Leonard<00:01:31.150> part<00:01:31.479> right

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
the thesis this is a Leonard part right

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.900 
the thesis this is a Leonard part right
right<00:01:32.560> you<00:01:32.800> think<00:01:32.979> this<00:01:33.070> could<00:01:33.460> change<00:01:33.490> that

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
right you think this could change that

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.000 
right you think this could change that
minute<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.660> pickup<00:01:34.990> people<00:01:35.290> to<00:01:35.440> justify<00:01:35.950> the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
minute the pickup people to justify the

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.609 
minute the pickup people to justify the
new<00:01:36.220> idea<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:37.720> new<00:01:37.869> idea<00:01:38.110> was<00:01:38.260> so<00:01:38.380> evident

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
new idea that new idea was so evident

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.469 
new idea that new idea was so evident
that<00:01:39.130> we<00:01:39.190> couldn't<00:01:39.610> stick<00:01:39.910> it<00:01:40.030> on<00:01:40.150> a<00:01:40.180> whole

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
that we couldn't stick it on a whole

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.350 
that we couldn't stick it on a whole
vehicle<00:01:40.780> so<00:01:41.590> it<00:01:41.619> didn't<00:01:42.160> fail<00:01:42.340> in<00:01:42.550> t-5<00:01:42.880> anymore

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
vehicle so it didn't fail in t-5 anymore

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.690 
vehicle so it didn't fail in t-5 anymore
because<00:01:44.020> it's<00:01:44.440> so<00:01:44.560> much<00:01:44.710> personality<00:01:44.950> really

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
because it's so much personality really

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.370 
because it's so much personality really
wanted<00:01:46.060> to<00:01:46.149> dump<00:01:46.360> our

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.340 

I<00:01:51.060> mean<00:01:52.060> look<00:01:52.210> at<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.390> ridge<00:01:52.630> we'll<00:01:53.200> talk

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
I mean look at the ridge we'll talk

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.740 
I mean look at the ridge we'll talk
about<00:01:53.409> that<00:01:53.649> later<00:01:53.860> but<00:01:54.340> how<00:01:55.090> about<00:01:55.329> starting

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
about that later but how about starting

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.719 
about that later but how about starting
over<00:01:55.990> there's<00:01:56.560> never<00:01:56.740> been<00:01:56.829> a<00:01:57.009> bridge<00:01:57.340> like

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
over there's never been a bridge like

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.960 
over there's never been a bridge like
that<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:59.170> like<00:01:59.229> complete<00:02:00.130> jewelry<00:02:00.610> it's

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
that it's like complete jewelry it's

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.480 
that it's like complete jewelry it's
jewelry<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:01.630> the<00:02:01.659> eyes<00:02:01.930> he<00:02:02.710> gets<00:02:02.920> jewelry<00:02:03.310> to

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490
