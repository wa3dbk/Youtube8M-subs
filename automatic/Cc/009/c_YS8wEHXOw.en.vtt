dragon<00:00:27.269> would<00:00:27.570> have<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> lot<00:00:27.990> of<00:00:28.109> elements<00:00:28.470> but

dragon would have a lot of elements but

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.550 
dragon would have a lot of elements but
it's<00:00:29.460> just<00:00:29.670> an<00:00:29.849> element<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.420> metal<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.349> an

it's just an element of metal and an

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.069 
it's just an element of metal and an
element<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.130> light<00:00:35.270> so<00:00:36.270> he<00:00:36.390> jumps<00:00:36.750> onto<00:00:36.899> a

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
element of light so he jumps onto a

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.930 
element of light so he jumps onto a
cloud<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.649> then<00:00:37.739> he<00:00:37.890> kind<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.430> bursts<00:00:38.790> off

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
cloud and then he kind of bursts off

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.970 
cloud and then he kind of bursts off
with<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.270> bit<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.629> rainbow<00:00:40.050> stuff<00:00:40.410> we're

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.860 
with a bit of rainbow stuff we're
getting<00:00:41.070> evolve<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.820> second<00:00:42.480> form<00:00:42.690> and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
getting evolve it to second form and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.319 
getting evolve it to second form and

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
just take a look at his evolution and

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.630 
just take a look at his evolution and
animation<00:00:45.870> here<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.440> lot<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.280> different

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
animation here it is a lot of different

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.720 
animation here it is a lot of different
colors<00:00:49.399> all<00:00:50.399> right<00:00:50.550> let's<00:00:50.730> see<00:00:50.940> what<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.420> does

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730
