00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.330
 comes with the application for that but if 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.830

 and then to make a voice note myself 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.850
 I told them in the first option is 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.649

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:43.469

 basically this is the option using 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.150
 soon the application with which it comes 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.670
 that phone another way of doing the 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.260
 voice notes is downloading applications 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.780
 of we noticed that there is completely 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.099
 free in the app store we enter the 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.160
 app store 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.989
 we give in looking for voice notes and I 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.310
 download two that are very easy to 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:37.489
 use this is called light recorder 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.870
 it's very fast, it's easy to use and 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.110
 this one that seemed to me like 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.900
 interesting that is called is called simple 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.720
 mic audio order I liked more than the 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.550
 previous since the previous one brings a lot 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.280
 a lot of advertising and this does not have 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.690
 advertising almost this is simple mix 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.350
 remember that there is no advertising 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.720
 while this other one is called 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.940
 work online if advertising comes in 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.980
 it's up to huca then we go to 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.050
 use these two applications 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.000
 quickly the first one I told them that 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.190
 bring advertising is here has it 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.940
 upstairs has advertising above if I want 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.510
 to record a new one a new one 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.860
 voice message I click here in the center 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.380
 as you will see here they are throughout the center 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.690
 is the advertising yes I think I record it 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:29.690
 I give here on the red button started to 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:33.080
 record 123 testing 123 I'll stop here and 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.210
 I get advertising I go out here and 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.100
 Now if I want to listen to that 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.050
 I clicked here 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.300
 here I have two audio notes that I have 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.950
 done let's leave this application 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.140
 since all that advertising is like 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.170
 annoying but this other application that 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.750
 Simple flame mix is ​​more interesting since 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.300
 that behind they were not either public in 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.400
 advertising to start making a note 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.510
 voice they start with their finger 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.510
 we do this there is passion blanc 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.000
 let's start another side passion and 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.970
 we started recording this is a test 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.670
 voice this is a voice note trying out 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.520
 three and with only again with the 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.010
 fingers and hands to one side stops 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.630
 if we want to see the voice notes 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.000
 here we have several that we have already done 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.300
 also brings the options to share 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.720
 to upload to the cloud if we click on it 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.430
 here 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.430
 here it tells me that I should 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.020
 to weave use to the options of 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.810
 share I must pay lost in the year 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.000
 with me since it does not allow me to record 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.789
 share my voice notes so 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.669
 free here we have the option of the 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:45.250
 cloud so basically these two 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.560
 applications that are free do not 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.240
 allows us to share our voice notes 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.630
 allows us to make for voice notes that 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.539
 we want however does not allow us 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.180
 share the voice notes which yes 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.860
 allows you to make the application with which 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.280
 comes the phone that says is here 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.040
 above that is called voice notes 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.360
 I tell them to be video many
