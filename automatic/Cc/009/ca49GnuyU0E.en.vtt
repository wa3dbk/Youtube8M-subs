00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
small town that's quite isolated and

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.360 
small town that's quite isolated and
very<00:03:00.280> like<00:03:00.490> a<00:03:00.520> rural<00:03:01.000> community<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:02.470> being

very like a rural community and being

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.220

I think one of the things that makes

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.180 
I think one of the things that makes
that<00:04:01.150> particular<00:04:02.140> that<00:04:02.320> transition<00:04:02.890> from

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
that particular that transition from

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.640 
that particular that transition from
country<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.880> city<00:04:03.970> particularly<00:04:04.570> easy<00:04:05.170> is

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
country to the city particularly easy is

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.260 
country to the city particularly easy is
that<00:04:05.920> you've<00:04:06.160> got<00:04:06.190> a<00:04:06.340> lot<00:04:06.520> of<00:04:06.550> other<00:04:06.820> country

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
that you've got a lot of other country

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.150 
that you've got a lot of other country
girls<00:04:07.480> here<00:04:07.690> that<00:04:07.810> are<00:04:07.900> in<00:04:07.990> the<00:04:08.080> same<00:04:08.230> boat<00:04:08.290> so

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
girls here that are in the same boat so

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.040 
girls here that are in the same boat so
you've<00:04:09.550> always<00:04:09.760> got<00:04:09.880> someone<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.270> talk<00:04:10.480> to<00:04:10.690> you

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
you've always got someone to talk to you

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.570 
you've always got someone to talk to you
know<00:04:11.200> you<00:04:11.860> have<00:04:11.980> people<00:04:12.220> there<00:04:12.460> that

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
know you have people there that

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.349 
know you have people there that
understand<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:14.550> live<00:04:15.550> on<00:04:15.580> a<00:04:15.700> balcony<00:04:15.970> with

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
understand I live on a balcony with

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.060 
understand I live on a balcony with
seven<00:04:16.660> other<00:04:16.840> girls<00:04:17.049> and<00:04:17.350> I<00:04:17.560> think<00:04:17.769> my<00:04:17.859> whole

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
seven other girls and I think my whole

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.420 
seven other girls and I think my whole
balcony<00:04:18.549> is<00:04:18.790> not<00:04:19.750> from<00:04:19.900> Sydney<00:04:20.290> so<00:04:20.620> when<00:04:20.859> we

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
balcony is not from Sydney so when we

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.640 
balcony is not from Sydney so when we
all<00:04:21.580> help<00:04:21.880> each<00:04:22.000> other<00:04:22.210> and<00:04:22.630> get<00:04:23.350> through<00:04:23.560> it

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
all help each other and get through it

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:24.630 
all help each other and get through it
and<00:04:23.800> so<00:04:23.920> we<00:04:24.010> don't<00:04:24.160> really<00:04:24.220> get<00:04:24.430> homesick

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
and so we don't really get homesick

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.550 
and so we don't really get homesick
anymore<00:04:25.000> or<00:04:25.450> anything<00:04:25.810> like<00:04:25.840> that<00:04:25.990> so<00:04:26.410> it's

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
anymore or anything like that so it's

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.070 
anymore or anything like that so it's
really<00:04:26.680> good<00:04:27.390> especially<00:04:28.390> since<00:04:28.810> I'm<00:04:28.990> an

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
really good especially since I'm an

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.800 
really good especially since I'm an
international<00:04:29.380> student<00:04:29.680> I<00:04:30.130> guess<00:04:30.630> for<00:04:31.630> most

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
international student I guess for most
