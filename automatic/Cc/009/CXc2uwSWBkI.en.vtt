other cool interesting stuff like and

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.670 
other cool interesting stuff like and
reformed<00:00:20.369> token<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.789> jellybeans<00:00:21.260> so<00:00:22.260> let's

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
reformed token to jellybeans so let's

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.019 
reformed token to jellybeans so let's
compare<00:00:22.920> these<00:00:23.070> two<00:00:23.220> devices<00:00:23.460> here<00:00:23.820> pretty

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
compare these two devices here pretty

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.200 
compare these two devices here pretty
quick<00:00:24.439> and<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:26.099> want<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.340> check<00:00:26.550> out<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.880> speed

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
quick and I want to check out the speed

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.419 
quick and I want to check out the speed
here<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.990> course<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.349> galaxy's<00:00:28.710> 2<00:00:28.890> plus<00:00:29.130> was<00:00:29.369> a

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
here of course the galaxy's 2 plus was a

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.370 
here of course the galaxy's 2 plus was a
little<00:00:29.609> bit<00:00:29.699> too<00:00:29.820> overrun<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.449> device<00:00:30.720> came

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
little bit too overrun and device came

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.959 
little bit too overrun and device came
with<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.590> different<00:00:31.859> GPU<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.700> different

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
with a different GPU in a different

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.959 
with a different GPU in a different
color<00:00:33.210> than<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.380> original<00:00:34.890> Galaxy<00:00:35.850> s2

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
color than the original Galaxy s2

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.420 
color than the original Galaxy s2
serious<00:00:36.870> but<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.500> original<00:00:37.770> guys<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.309> to

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
serious but the original guys have to

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.979 
serious but the original guys have to
serious<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:38.850> mean<00:00:38.969> if<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.210> like<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.510> look<00:00:39.719> at

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
serious I mean if you like to look at

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.530 
serious I mean if you like to look at
this<00:00:40.170> device<00:00:40.879> it's<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.090> pretty<00:00:42.300> pretty

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
this device it's a pretty pretty

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.930 
this device it's a pretty pretty
interesting<00:00:42.840> device<00:00:43.500> actually<00:00:43.980> especially

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
interesting device actually especially

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.360 
interesting device actually especially
this<00:00:45.239> color<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.780> lot<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.170> people<00:00:46.410> liked<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
this color a lot of people liked the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.510 
this color a lot of people liked the
galaxy<00:00:47.940> s<00:00:48.059> toes<00:00:48.710> kind<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.770> like<00:00:49.890> hardcore<00:00:50.219> look

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
galaxy s toes kind of like hardcore look

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.470 
galaxy s toes kind of like hardcore look
here<00:00:51.260> this<00:00:52.260> one's<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.590> little<00:00:52.680> bit<00:00:52.860> more

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
here this one's a little bit more

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.580 
here this one's a little bit more
rounded<00:00:54.480> off<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.809> little<00:00:54.989> bit<00:00:55.140> more<00:00:55.320> like<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
rounded off a little bit more like the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.029 
rounded off a little bit more like the
galaxy<00:00:56.190> s4<00:00:56.840> so<00:00:57.859> if<00:00:58.859> you<00:00:59.010> just<00:00:59.160> go<00:00:59.489> here<00:01:00.090> and

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
galaxy s4 so if you just go here and

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:08.359 
galaxy s4 so if you just go here and
check<00:01:02.039> out<00:01:02.250> what<00:01:03.059> they<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:07.070> can<00:01:08.070> kind

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
check out what they do have you can kind

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.609 
check out what they do have you can kind
of<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.790> difference<00:01:09.540> here<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.960> terms<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
of see a difference here in terms of the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.030 
of see a difference here in terms of the
display<00:01:11.210> it's<00:01:12.210> way<00:01:12.390> darker<00:01:12.689> here<00:01:13.170> on<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
display it's way darker here on the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.330 
display it's way darker here on the
galaxy<00:01:14.520> s2<00:01:14.610> plus<00:01:15.470> way<00:01:16.470> better<00:01:16.710> probably

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
galaxy s2 plus way better probably

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.850 
galaxy s2 plus way better probably
display<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.110> foot<00:01:19.290> between<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.680> two

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
display so and foot between the two

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.020 
display so and foot between the two
jellybean<00:01:20.280> here<00:01:22.340> versus<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.549> latest

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
jellybean here versus the latest

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.069 
jellybean here versus the latest
software<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:28.850> above<00:01:29.850> here<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.270> course<00:01:30.450> have<00:01:30.869> a

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
software and above here of course have a

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.920 
software and above here of course have a
few<00:01:31.680> core<00:01:32.130> processor

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:47.600 

let's<00:01:38.590> do<00:01:38.740> a<00:01:38.770> quick<00:01:39.040> Leary<00:01:39.400> sort<00:01:39.670> here

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.300 

okay<00:01:48.540> almost<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.020> same<00:01:49.230> they're<00:01:49.530> on<00:01:49.740> both<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
okay almost the same they're on both the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.600 
okay almost the same they're on both the
Aleksic<00:01:50.670> or<00:01:50.790> bus<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.510> galaxy's<00:01:51.990> 2<00:01:52.200> plus

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.370 

I'm<00:01:56.610> very<00:01:56.910> very<00:01:57.090> familiar<00:01:57.270> here<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:58.020> terms<00:01:58.230> of

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
I'm very very familiar here in terms of

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:14.790 
I'm very very familiar here in terms of
speed

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.700 

there<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:15.880> go<00:02:16.360> so<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.170> can<00:02:17.350> see<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.560> this

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
there you go so you can see that this

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.240 
there you go so you can see that this
one<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:17.950> popping<00:02:18.280> up<00:02:18.370> first<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:20.860> mean<00:02:21.070> that

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
one is popping up first so I mean that

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.830 
one is popping up first so I mean that
that<00:02:21.430> makes<00:02:21.610> your<00:02:21.820> software<00:02:22.300> is<00:02:22.420> really

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
that makes your software is really

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.680 
that makes your software is really
really<00:02:23.020> making<00:02:23.440> making<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.340> difference<00:02:25.030> in

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
really making making a difference in

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.900 
really making making a difference in
terms<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:26.110> processor<00:02:26.740> I<00:02:26.770> mean<00:02:27.010> if<00:02:27.160> I<00:02:27.580> would<00:02:27.730> go

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
terms of processor I mean if I would go

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.610 
terms of processor I mean if I would go
more<00:02:28.120> in<00:02:28.270> depth<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.690> we'll<00:02:28.870> try<00:02:29.140> them<00:02:29.260> out<00:02:29.410> I

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
more in depth and we'll try them out I

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.260 
more in depth and we'll try them out I
did<00:02:29.890> actually<00:02:30.130> do<00:02:30.400> believe<00:02:30.670> that<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:30.970> Aleks

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
did actually do believe that the Aleks

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.190 
did actually do believe that the Aleks
is<00:02:31.330> 2<00:02:31.510> plus<00:02:31.750> has<00:02:31.960> a<00:02:31.990> better<00:02:32.320> and<00:02:33.180> better<00:02:34.200> things

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
is 2 plus has a better and better things

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.320 
is 2 plus has a better and better things
like<00:02:35.410> that<00:02:35.710> and<00:02:35.920> also<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.160> better<00:02:36.340> GPU<00:02:37.000> in<00:02:37.150> terms

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
like that and also a better GPU in terms

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.170 
like that and also a better GPU in terms
of<00:02:37.480> gaming<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:39.460> definitely<00:02:39.730> might<00:02:40.000> check

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
of gaming and I definitely might check

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.860 
of gaming and I definitely might check
it<00:02:40.270> out<00:02:40.360> a<00:02:40.510> lot<00:02:40.630> more<00:02:40.990> in<00:02:41.200> another<00:02:41.680> video<00:02:41.980> but

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
it out a lot more in another video but

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.840 
it out a lot more in another video but
it's<00:02:43.870> an<00:02:44.050> interesting<00:02:44.200> market<00:02:44.770> I<00:02:45.220> mean<00:02:45.700> of

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
it's an interesting market I mean of

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.880 
it's an interesting market I mean of
course<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.780> might<00:02:46.930> want<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.290> get<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:47.680> one

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
course you might want to get this one

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.820 
course you might want to get this one
just<00:02:48.040> fully<00:02:48.340> more<00:02:49.060> like<00:02:49.360> a<00:02:49.390> modern<00:02:50.260> look<00:02:50.530> and

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
just fully more like a modern look and

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.910 
just fully more like a modern look and
feel<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.580> think<00:02:51.610> that<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:52.150> device<00:02:52.390> has<00:02:52.920> with

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
feel I think that this device has with

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.480 
feel I think that this device has with
this<00:02:54.310> like<00:02:54.610> galaxy<00:02:55.180> s4<00:02:55.540> lip<00:02:56.130> which<00:02:57.130> is<00:02:57.280> pretty

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
this like galaxy s4 lip which is pretty

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.490 
this like galaxy s4 lip which is pretty
interesting<00:03:00.120> there<00:03:01.120> you<00:03:01.210> go<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.870> final<00:03:02.350> piece

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
interesting there you go the final piece

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.930 
interesting there you go the final piece
of<00:03:02.650> camera<00:03:03.900> this<00:03:04.900> play-doh<00:03:05.640> it's<00:03:06.640> not<00:03:06.790> the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
of camera this play-doh it's not the

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.080 
of camera this play-doh it's not the
best<00:03:07.120> it's<00:03:07.690> not<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.960> best<00:03:08.110> out<00:03:08.320> there<00:03:08.940> you<00:03:09.940> can

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
best it's not the best out there you can

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.480 
best it's not the best out there you can
probably<00:03:10.330> see<00:03:10.660> that<00:03:10.690> already<00:03:11.110> this<00:03:11.890> one<00:03:12.160> is<00:03:12.430> a

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
probably see that already this one is a

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.910 
probably see that already this one is a
little<00:03:12.790> bit<00:03:12.880> more<00:03:13.150> I<00:03:13.530> think<00:03:14.530> actually<00:03:14.680> it's

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
little bit more I think actually it's

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.160 
little bit more I think actually it's
more<00:03:15.010> like<00:03:15.070> girls<00:03:15.310> have<00:03:15.580> a<00:03:15.640> home<00:03:16.150> LED<00:03:16.390> screen<00:03:16.780> I

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
more like girls have a home LED screen I

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.040 
more like girls have a home LED screen I
can't<00:03:18.160> even<00:03:18.220> feel<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.090> see<00:03:19.510> it<00:03:19.540> here<00:03:19.870> that

can't even feel it and see it here that

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.330 
can't even feel it and see it here that
it<00:03:20.260> looks<00:03:20.440> better<00:03:21.190> here<00:03:21.520> on<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:23.620> in<00:03:23.950> the

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
it looks better here on the in the

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.320 
it looks better here on the in the
galaxy<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:26.110> galaxy<00:03:26.140> is<00:03:26.650> 2<00:03:26.980> plus<00:03:27.250> more<00:03:28.090> like
