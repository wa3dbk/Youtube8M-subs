00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.380 
will sell for about five hundred and
fifty<00:03:12.090> thousand<00:03:12.600> dollars<00:03:13.430> our<00:03:14.430> top<00:03:14.730> investor

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
fifty thousand dollars our top investor

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.160 
fifty thousand dollars our top investor
just<00:03:16.380> perfect<00:03:16.620> close<00:03:16.950> down<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.340> house<00:03:17.519> at<00:03:18.170> 169

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
just perfect close down the house at 169

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.830 
just perfect close down the house at 169
thousand<00:03:19.920> dollars<00:03:20.280> they<00:03:21.239> will<00:03:21.450> put<00:03:21.690> in

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
thousand dollars they will put in

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.250 
thousand dollars they will put in
probably<00:03:22.140> about<00:03:22.470> 75<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.700> a<00:03:24.180> hundred<00:03:24.540> thousand

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
probably about 75 to a hundred thousand

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.790 
probably about 75 to a hundred thousand
so<00:03:26.190> they<00:03:26.370> will<00:03:26.550> make<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.760> net<00:03:27.510> profit<00:03:27.810> of<00:03:28.110> over

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
so they will make a net profit of over

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.150 
so they will make a net profit of over
two<00:03:29.160> hundred<00:03:29.190> thousand<00:03:30.000> dollars<00:03:30.390> on

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
two hundred thousand dollars on

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.320 
two hundred thousand dollars on
so<00:03:32.160> this<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.640> really<00:03:34.040> good<00:03:35.040> investment<00:03:35.760> it's
