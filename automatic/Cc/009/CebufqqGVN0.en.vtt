00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.070 
but that's one of the more fun aspects
that<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.060> instead<00:03:15.570> of<00:03:15.690> being<00:03:15.780> on<00:03:15.989> the

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
that is that instead of being on the

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.390 
that is that instead of being on the
screen<00:03:16.350> you're<00:03:16.650> actually<00:03:16.739> playing<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.160> video

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
screen you're actually playing a video

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.070 
screen you're actually playing a video
game<00:03:17.430> in<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.940> typical<00:03:18.300> world<00:03:18.480> these<00:03:18.720> things

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
game in the typical world these things

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.110 
game in the typical world these things
that<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.470> could<00:03:19.739> be<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:20.220> drawback<00:03:20.550> for<00:03:20.970> you

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
that that could be a drawback for you

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.680 
that that could be a drawback for you
because<00:03:22.160> of<00:03:23.160> those<00:03:23.550> max<00:03:23.850> victory<00:03:24.269> lap<00:03:24.480> by<00:03:24.630> the

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
because of those max victory lap by the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.650 
because of those max victory lap by the
AI<00:03:24.870> just<00:03:25.080> took<00:03:25.350> us<00:03:25.530> both<00:03:25.680> out<00:03:25.890> now<00:03:26.420> we<00:03:27.420> tried

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
AI just took us both out now we tried

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.690 
AI just took us both out now we tried
but<00:03:27.900> do<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.709> think<00:03:28.769> that<00:03:28.980> could<00:03:29.190> be<00:03:29.250> a

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
but do you think that could be a

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.610 
but do you think that could be a
drawback<00:03:30.000> for<00:03:30.450> you<00:03:30.600> because<00:03:31.140> you<00:03:31.290> have<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.530> be

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
drawback for you because you have to be

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.720 
drawback for you because you have to be
there<00:03:31.739> in<00:03:31.860> person<00:03:31.980> now<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.340> have<00:03:32.459> all<00:03:32.550> these

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
there in person now you have all these

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.400 
there in person now you have all these
like<00:03:33.000> massively<00:03:33.360> multiplayer<00:03:33.750> games<00:03:34.260> you

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
like massively multiplayer games you

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.590 
like massively multiplayer games you
could<00:03:34.530> play<00:03:34.739> words<00:03:35.550> with<00:03:35.670> friends<00:03:35.790> remotely

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
could play words with friends remotely

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.840 
could play words with friends remotely
and<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.769> don't<00:03:37.890> need<00:03:38.100> to<00:03:38.250> physically<00:03:38.640> be

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
and and you don't need to physically be

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.340 
and and you don't need to physically be
in<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.000> same<00:03:39.180> space<00:03:39.450> as<00:03:39.630> someone<00:03:39.930> the

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
in the same space as someone the

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.390 
in the same space as someone the
physical<00:03:40.709> part<00:03:40.830> is<00:03:40.980> actually<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.370> most

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
physical part is actually the most

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.370 
physical part is actually the most
appealing<00:03:42.000> part<00:03:42.239> about<00:03:42.480> Anki<00:03:42.780> Drive<00:03:42.810> it's<00:03:43.260> the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
appealing part about Anki Drive it's the

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.050 
appealing part about Anki Drive it's the
fact<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.830> can<00:03:43.980> have<00:03:44.130> real<00:03:44.519> characters

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
fact that you can have real characters

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.610 
fact that you can have real characters
ones<00:03:45.300> you<00:03:45.420> can<00:03:45.600> touch<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:45.989> you<00:03:46.080> can<00:03:46.230> hold<00:03:46.440> you

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
ones you can touch and you can hold you

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.380 
ones you can touch and you can hold you
can<00:03:46.769> collect<00:03:46.920> them<00:03:47.250> and<00:03:47.430> you<00:03:47.850> evolve<00:03:48.209> them

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
can collect them and you evolve them

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.840 
can collect them and you evolve them
over<00:03:48.660> time<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.170> so<00:03:49.470> people<00:03:50.130> form<00:03:50.670> these

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
over time and so people form these

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.250 
over time and so people form these
emotional<00:03:51.540> connections<00:03:51.989> with<00:03:52.140> these

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
emotional connections with these

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.900 
emotional connections with these
characters<00:03:52.709> in<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:52.920> way<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.280> never<00:03:53.489> can

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
characters in a way that you never can

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.250 
characters in a way that you never can
do<00:03:54.090> when<00:03:54.420> they're<00:03:54.540> on<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.720> screen<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.139> you

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
do when they're on the screen and you
