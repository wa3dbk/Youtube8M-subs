and Chris is going to give us some tech

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.310 
and Chris is going to give us some tech
information<00:00:27.570> about<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.930> but<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.170> particular

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
information about it but this particular

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.349 
information about it but this particular
product<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.160> mainly<00:00:29.580> aimed<00:00:29.939> at<00:00:30.210> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
product is mainly aimed at the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.630 
product is mainly aimed at the
volunteers<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.349> let's<00:00:31.800> take<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> look<00:00:32.219> at<00:00:32.309> it

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
volunteers so let's take a look at it

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.870 
volunteers so let's take a look at it
outstanding<00:00:33.590> it's<00:00:34.590> designed<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.160> work<00:00:35.430> with<00:00:35.670> a

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
outstanding it's designed to work with a

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.350 
outstanding it's designed to work with a
100<00:00:36.570> watt<00:00:36.690> speaker<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:38.370> amplifier<00:00:38.879> here

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
100 watt speaker and the amplifier here

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.400 
100 watt speaker and the amplifier here
is<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:40.320> airhorn<00:00:41.070> producing<00:00:41.730> tone<00:00:42.270> only<00:00:42.540> system

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
is a airhorn producing tone only system

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.740 
is a airhorn producing tone only system
so<00:00:43.800> with<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.430> volunteers<00:00:44.969> it's<00:00:45.329> just

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
so with that for volunteers it's just

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.170 
so with that for volunteers it's just
going<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.140> be<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.800> high<00:00:46.980> frequency<00:00:47.640> airhorn

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
going to be the high frequency airhorn

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.500 
going to be the high frequency airhorn
tone<00:00:48.600> only<00:00:49.039> it's<00:00:50.039> actually<00:00:50.489> very<00:00:50.789> nicely<00:00:51.120> set

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
tone only it's actually very nicely set

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.360 
tone only it's actually very nicely set
up<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> self-contained

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
up in that you have a self-contained

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.250 
up in that you have a self-contained
amplifier<00:00:53.910> box<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.899> can<00:00:55.079> be<00:00:55.170> mounted

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
amplifier box so this can be mounted

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.779 
amplifier box so this can be mounted
under<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.649> seat<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.489> rear<00:00:56.670> storage

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
under the seat in the rear storage

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.840 
under the seat in the rear storage
compartment<00:00:57.050> wherever<00:00:58.050> it's<00:00:58.289> needed<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.850> for

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
compartment wherever it's needed and for

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.569 
compartment wherever it's needed and for
operating<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.780> nice<00:01:01.109> clean<00:01:01.739> handheld

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
operating you have a nice clean handheld

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.119 
operating you have a nice clean handheld
microphone<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.500> bit<00:01:04.710> more<00:01:04.890> than

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
microphone here but it's a bit more than

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.120 
microphone here but it's a bit more than
just<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.580> microphone<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.810> actually<00:01:07.380> has<00:01:07.740> a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
just a microphone it actually has a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.060 
just a microphone it actually has a
button<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.540> side<00:01:09.750> here<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:11.040> that

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
button on the side here and with that

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.670 
button on the side here and with that
you<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.939> ability<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.390> set<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:13.049> up<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.320> one

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
you have the ability to set it up in one

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.070 
you have the ability to set it up in one
of<00:01:13.860> two<00:01:14.040> unique<00:01:14.340> ways<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.420> use<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.810> for

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
of two unique ways you can use this for

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.640 
of two unique ways you can use this for
an<00:01:16.170> on/off<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:16.830> radio<00:01:17.250> rebroadcast<00:01:18.000> or<00:01:18.650> what

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
an on/off for radio rebroadcast or what

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.010 
an on/off for radio rebroadcast or what
I<00:01:19.860> suggest<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.640> using<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.420> for<00:01:21.900> its

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
I suggest is using this for its

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.469 
I suggest is using this for its
alternative<00:01:22.680> which<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.549> lighting<00:01:24.000> control

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
alternative which is a lighting control

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.499 
alternative which is a lighting control
button<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.530> with<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.340> actually<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
button so with that it actually is a

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.170 
button so with that it actually is a
on/off<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:28.530> give<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.829> push<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.250> locks<00:01:29.909> into

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
on/off so give it a push in locks into

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.719 
on/off so give it a push in locks into
place<00:01:30.360> as<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.380> see<00:01:31.590> there<00:01:31.829> it's<00:01:32.579> nice

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
place as you can see there it's nice

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.219 
place as you can see there it's nice
time<00:01:32.850> you<00:01:32.939> turn<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.180> registry<00:01:33.930> lighting

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
time you turn on registry lighting

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.899 
time you turn on registry lighting
around<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.560> vehicle<00:01:34.710> exactly<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.610> it's

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
around the vehicle exactly so it's

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.649 
around the vehicle exactly so it's
actually<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> 20<00:01:37.140> amp<00:01:37.549> system<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.939> inline<00:01:39.420> fuse

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
actually a 20 amp system so inline fuse

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.450 
actually a 20 amp system so inline fuse
on<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.110> as<00:01:40.259> well<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:40.619> that'll<00:01:40.979> actually<00:01:41.130> take

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
on this as well so that'll actually take

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.490 
on this as well so that'll actually take
care<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.850> your<00:01:41.970> circuitry<00:01:42.450> protection<00:01:43.079> for

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
care of your circuitry protection for

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.319 
care of your circuitry protection for

course you've got a PA function and an
airhole<00:02:19.770> function<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.550> again<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.849> airhole

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
airhole function and again the airhole

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.490 
airhole function and again the airhole
function<00:02:21.450> again<00:02:21.690> is<00:02:21.810> being<00:02:22.020> aimed<00:02:22.230> at

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
function again is being aimed at

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.920 
function again is being aimed at
volunteers<00:02:23.010> where<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.310> can't<00:02:23.640> run<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.239> siren
