00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.940
 as far as I remember, it should be Japanese 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.570
 instant noodles and so 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.570

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:49.370
 noodles from japan here are all in japanese 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.320
 written nothing incomprehensible at all there on 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.010
 I will leave a link on ebay 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.600
 it was written that this is some kind of ramen 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:03.980

 In general, we have 382 kilocalories and 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:23.060
 something there is another 10 grams 13 grams and 55 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:28.330
 and 9 grams and so I understand pour 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.710
 boiling water is necessary if I am not mistaken so well 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.830
 can and cook it is necessary I know FIG him 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:38.720
 to be honest, itâ€™s generally written 4,500 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:45.830
 milliliters of kefir 500 ate a lot she 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:51.350
 let's actually watch I'm just 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:55.190
 I hope this is not this 14th sixth 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:01.390
 Well, this is not overdue 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.390
 no, but let's open the profile 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:14.020
 let's open now we will 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.020
 boiling water 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.060
 so what do we have here we have here 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.400
 some bag I understand with sauce 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.940
 This sauce probably needs at the end 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.989
 add 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.970
 such a bag means then specials 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.900
 a sort of small bag and actually 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.090
 catcher herself at night since it's on healthy 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.770
 noodles 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.200
 I don't know about me here probably not 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.709
 at the month 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:46.190
 although you can month bath go shorter 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:50.300
 ok let me spice here 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:55.400
 These here poured out a small bag with 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:03:00.910
 spices so they don't want me 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.910
 get enough sleep get enough sleep 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:13.260
 so I poured shorter spice 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.630
 now what and do the sauce I will add this 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.580
 at the end you understand and let's now 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.050
 try try pouring our noodles and 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.500
 let her not know there will be 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.500
 boil soft 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:37.350
 so let on now sit here 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:41.130
 I have a shorter me and then just 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.950
 Shuffle to this top sprawled 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.769
 from me more plates guys to 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:52.170
 Unfortunately, there is no sense in terms of volumes 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:56.519
 let her sit there for more minutes 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:59.190
 again and we'll be back in short guys at all 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.060
 we almost got brewed but I decided 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:07.470
 add this bag there add and 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:11.040
 and damn here I do 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.530
 idiot package needed to be added immediately 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.510
 here it turns out the spices I thought that 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:23.060
 capsules of the world 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:28.220
 exactly now i will add this sachet 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.220
 it smells like miso soup 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:41.490
 let's mix the whole thing and let them 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:44.400
 sit for five minutes and so the guys here 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:48.150
 our noodles have finally collapsed let's 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:51.870
 all the same and try to taste us 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:55.590
 Here is such a noodle happened with 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:58.200
 broth am the type of miso soup is such 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.780
 Generally guys 186 rubles a month and 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.970
 by shipment and from japan i can credit 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.270
 leave in the description who should be able to 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.300
 order and so let's try 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.650
 Well, in principle, guys are pretty 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.349
 still good noodles 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.550
 but the only thing that seems to me would be 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:18.440
 probably better and cook in a pan and then 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.840
 what is it a little bit 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.420
 harshly turned out well in general 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.750
 cool and here is this broth 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:28.970
 such a broth like the taste of the type 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:32.090
 miso soup and well, as if in other words 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:35.620
 saying we did it miso 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:39.530
 soup and noodles 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.600
 this broth is delicious and noodles too 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:44.420
 Basically nothing so cool and this 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:48.380
 I will probably give noodles points 8 out of 10 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:53.720
 pretty good noodles it was u 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:56.590
