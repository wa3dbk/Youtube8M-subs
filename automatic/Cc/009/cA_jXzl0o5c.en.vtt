00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.350

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.910

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.179

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.230
 natural products 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.820
 the first mask I make myself 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.130
 regularly is a purifying mask 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.050
 as the first ingredient I use 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.270
 apple cider vinegar which is recognized for 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.010
 its multiple health benefits in 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.539
 skin level it will help fight 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.830
 against acne thanks to its properties 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.960
 antiseptic 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.400
 it restores the natural toll of the 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.140
 skin which will allow to rebalance 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.090
 sebum production 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.320
 but also help maintain 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.300
 hydration of the skin 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.160
 it is also rich in vitamins and 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.320
 minerals that our skin needs 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.610
 if you see a deposit with an appearance 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.590
 strange grow in your 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.000
 vinegar do not worry 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.620
 are the bacteria that produce the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.780
 vinegar that grow and that wants 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.550
 say that your product is alive and it 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.350
 can give the maximum of its benefits 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.809
 to choose the best vinegar 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.090
 preferred 100% pure organic and not 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.489
 pasteurized I also use for this 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.230
 mask of green clay powder this 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.359
 product is super famous for its 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.400
 purifying properties like vinegar 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.860
 it has antiseptic action and regulate 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.630
 sebum it will absorb the toxins to a 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.640
 healing action and gives radiance 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.990
 with complexion in a bowl I will pour 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.880
 the equivalent of a tablespoon 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.360
 of clay and a tablespoon of 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.950
 vinegar 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.750
 I then mix until I get a 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.189
 quite smooth and fluid paste 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.780
 but you have to be careful not to 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.119
 not mix with an iron instrument 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.979
 or oxidizable metal otherwise it oxides 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.350
 clay in plastic accessories or 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.970
 made of wood will do very well before 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.280
 to apply my mask I will dilate 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.600
 mepor to have an optimal action I 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.040
 will just boil 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.750
 the water in a saucepan and let my 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.340
 face a few minutes above the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.439
 steam then I will apply my 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.540
 brush mask with emphasis on 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.009
 zone t and avoiding sensitive areas 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.930
 I will let ask five ten minutes 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.600
 and rinse with warm water before 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.880
 mask is completely dried and then 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.430
 my skin and rid of impurities and 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.479
 toxins she may have accumulated 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.770
 let's move on now to the nourishing mask 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.780
 who is my favorite 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.549
 I'm going to use honey and I'm doing 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.100
 be careful that it is 100% pure and 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.469
 unpasteurized this one even has some 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.160
 pollen the honeydew miraculous effects 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.300
 on skin soothing moisturizers at 12 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.760
 ten years they prevent the development 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.950
 bacteria or fungi they help 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.720
 to scarring and it has an action 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.640
 antioxidant so it prevents the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.620
 skin aging I will also 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.090
 use carrot oil but who 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.220
 is not pure and also oil of 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.780
 sunflower in this oil feeds and 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.390
 protects the skin it gives an effect 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.580

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.620

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.200
 who have healing actions and 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.850
 antioxidant game but mix a 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.160
 small amount of both until you get 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.420
 a homogeneous paste and I'm going to apply it 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.820
 by making small movements 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.410
 circular since honey to small 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.540
 crystals that have a slightly 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.400
 exfoliating but it also happens to me 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.350
 to leave my mask as it is without 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.030
 exfoliate my skin for about five 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.130
 ten minutes in any case the effect is 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.710
 still so amazing it softens 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.570
 tunes pulp and skin I'm stunned 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.920
 each time by its effectiveness to which 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.610
 point my skin is soft after 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.290
 use 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.180
 so here are my favorite masks have 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.950
 more secret for you I hope it 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.210
