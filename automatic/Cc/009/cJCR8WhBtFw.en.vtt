why<00:00:02.730> so<00:00:03.030> many<00:00:03.149> hard<00:00:03.419> drives<00:00:03.540> asks<00:00:04.470> boxy<00:00:05.220> link

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
why so many hard drives asks boxy link

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.990 
why so many hard drives asks boxy link
well<00:00:06.089> I'm<00:00:06.899> going<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.200> explain<00:00:07.589> this<00:00:07.649> in<00:00:08.189> the

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
well I'm going to explain this in the

well I'm going to explain this in the
most<00:00:09.120> basic<00:00:09.889> analogies<00:00:10.889> I<00:00:11.040> can<00:00:11.309> make<00:00:12.000> for<00:00:12.179> you

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
most basic analogies I can make for you

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.829 
most basic analogies I can make for you
guys<00:00:12.679> so<00:00:13.679> there<00:00:14.340> is<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.519> um<00:00:14.880> I'm<00:00:15.599> going<00:00:15.750> to

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
guys so there is a um I'm going to

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.960 
guys so there is a um I'm going to
explain<00:00:16.289> this<00:00:16.350> there's<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.920> red<00:00:17.220> card<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.760> here

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
explain this there's a red card in here

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.230 
explain this there's a red card in here
and<00:00:18.590> it's<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.770> dedicated<00:00:20.310> right<00:00:20.580> card<00:00:20.939> not

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
and it's a dedicated right card not

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.400 
and it's a dedicated right card not
expel<00:00:21.600> rate<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.109> but<00:00:23.100> on<00:00:23.869> right<00:00:24.869> here<00:00:27.410> that's

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
expel rate is but on right here that's

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.769 
expel rate is but on right here that's
the<00:00:28.740> rate<00:00:28.949> card<00:00:29.340> these<00:00:29.730> wires<00:00:30.000> go<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.539> back

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
the rate card these wires go in the back

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.110 
the rate card these wires go in the back
here<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.590> course<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.579> canal<00:00:32.940> between

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
here and of course the canal between

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.690 
here and of course the canal between
hard<00:00:33.600> drives<00:00:34.760> those<00:00:35.760> are<00:00:36.000> serial<00:00:36.510> ATA<00:00:37.700> the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
hard drives those are serial ATA the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.340 
hard drives those are serial ATA the
blue<00:00:38.969> tables<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.640> power<00:00:41.640> cables

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
blue tables and the power cables

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.619 
blue tables and the power cables
obviously<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.530> cables<00:00:44.040> found<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.489> left<00:00:44.760> so

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
obviously the cables found it left so

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.520 
obviously the cables found it left so
when<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.870> went<00:00:46.700> rage<00:00:47.930> there's<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.140> enticed

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
when you went rage there's it enticed

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.840 
when you went rage there's it enticed

associate of different numbers and I'm

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.810 
associate of different numbers and I'm
writing<00:00:57.449> two<00:00:57.780> great<00:00:58.020> ones<00:00:58.260> right<00:00:58.620> here<00:00:58.789> now<00:00:59.789> I

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
writing two great ones right here now I

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.090 
writing two great ones right here now I
know<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.180> lot<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.629> people<00:01:00.719> might<00:01:01.289> say<00:01:01.530> hey<00:01:02.039> you

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
know a lot of people might say hey you

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.590 
know a lot of people might say hey you
you<00:01:02.489> should<00:01:02.699> do<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.300> should<00:01:03.329> do<00:01:03.570> that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
you should do this you should do that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.870 
you should do this you should do that
but<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.610> what<00:01:05.850> works<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.180> meet

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
but this is this is what works to meet

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.000 
but this is this is what works to meet
these<00:01:08.880> two<00:01:09.150> hard<00:01:09.390> drives<00:01:09.630> right<00:01:09.990> here<00:01:10.350> are<00:01:10.619> my

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
these two hard drives right here are my

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.630 
these two hard drives right here are my
C<00:01:11.280> Drive<00:01:11.310> wait<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> second<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:13.950> partition

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
C Drive wait a second you can partition

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.670 
C Drive wait a second you can partition
one<00:01:15.030> drive<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.570> multiple<00:01:15.990> drives<00:01:16.259> but<00:01:16.500> how

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
one drive to be multiple drives but how

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.100 
one drive to be multiple drives but how
come<00:01:16.860> you've<00:01:17.040> got<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.460> grimes<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.630> if<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.960> was

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
come you've got to grimes so if this was

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.550 
come you've got to grimes so if this was
only<00:01:19.409> one<00:01:19.950> well<00:01:20.930> these<00:01:21.930> are<00:01:22.520> in<00:01:23.659> 81<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.320> what<00:01:25.530> a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
only one well these are in 81 and what a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.880 
only one well these are in 81 and what a
raid<00:01:25.830> one<00:01:26.100> does<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.759> effectively<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.650> this

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
raid one does is effectively if if this

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.270 
raid one does is effectively if if this
drive<00:01:29.189> dies<00:01:29.460> or<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.390> drive<00:01:30.689> dies<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.439> still

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
drive dies or this drive dies I still

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.679 
drive dies or this drive dies I still
have<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.430> copy<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.850> everything<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.479> called

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
have a copy of everything it's called

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.719 
have a copy of everything it's called
Mary<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:36.360> these<00:01:36.900> are<00:01:36.960> both<00:01:37.340> 120<00:01:38.340> gig<00:01:38.490> hard

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
Mary so so these are both 120 gig hard

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.859 
Mary so so these are both 120 gig hard
drives<00:01:39.110> but<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.170> don't<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.710> 240<00:01:41.610> gigs<00:01:41.850> up<00:01:42.090> from

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
drives but I don't have 240 gigs up from

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.780 
drives but I don't have 240 gigs up from
these<00:01:43.049> two<00:01:43.229> drives<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.740> only<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.430> half<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
these two drives I only have half the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.050 
these two drives I only have half the
capacity<00:01:45.630> however<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.740> either<00:01:47.220> drive<00:01:47.759> dies

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
capacity however if either drive dies

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.170

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
have two terabyte hard enough so why

have two terabyte hard enough so why
don't<00:04:42.590> you<00:04:42.710> just<00:04:42.920> take<00:04:43.160> two<00:04:43.430> here<00:04:43.820> by<00:04:43.970> our<00:04:44.150> guys

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
don't you just take two here by our guys

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.080 
don't you just take two here by our guys
to<00:04:44.540> make<00:04:44.630> a<00:04:44.690> 2g<00:04:45.080> two<00:04:45.950> terabyte<00:04:46.490> drive<00:04:46.760> while<00:04:47.030> I
