00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello youtube friends today I come with 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.640
 another minecraft video in this case them 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.410
 I will show how to make a server 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.980
 without ever 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.550
 First of all, we go to the internet 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.679
 to the explorer who have 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.679
 and we put mini craft 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.420
 net point 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:33.140
 when we go to the page we go to a 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.140
 place or download as they appear 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:41.760
 they have to download this file 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:46.090
 the last file that is mini craft 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.329
 server dot hard and 621 every time that 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.030
 is the one that will serve us here they put it 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.020
 to download 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.020
 and you 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.700
 minimize 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.530
 let's do it like this and create a folder 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:07.510
 we put new folder 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.600
 and we put the mini that will serve us 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.740
 inside an intake done this we go to the 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.740
 folder and we open it 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.820
 when we open it 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.240
 expect that this will generate the 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.240
 world 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.190
 when it appears that says don you 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.520
 put here they close the little red dot puts 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.520
 the stop 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.670
 and it's going to close is going to take more fierce 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.159
 is going to be the solar 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.159
 we have done this you 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.690
 it does not close me it's going to close 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.690
 Ok here 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.630
 online mode they put false because if 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.610
 scepter 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.560
 you can only put the servers that 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.870
 they have that the people who have bought 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.520
 the micro 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.700
 and if you put false you can put the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.870
 who have 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.290
 mike the pirate 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:11.720
 on level set nothing to be flu 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:13.800
 maximum swipe of players we put an end 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.240
 what is it so that 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.240
 I see 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:25.920
 and to know the triples we go to cmd 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.920
 and we put ip config 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.569
 let's look for the one that says address 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:37.519
 ipv4 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:43.390
 to each address ipv4 200 points 127,928 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:46.350
 9 200 points 127 points 92 points 69 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.440
 in this case this is my p 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.780
 you can do as you want 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.240
 the meat or zero is for if they want 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.630
 appear on your rival or one so that 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.020
 appear in 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.090
 in 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:03.450
 creative after the difficulty of choosing 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.239
 you can be one two or three the pvp 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.540
 is so they can stick if you say and 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:10.769
 you put it in false you can not paste 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.200
 generate structure is if you do not want 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.930
 generate put in false in this case I 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.450
 yes I want them to be structures and for 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.430

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.220

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.680
