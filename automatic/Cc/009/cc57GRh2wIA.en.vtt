00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.890
 the film is directed by raja gosnell who 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.420
 made the first smart return of 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.249
 new with the story he does a job 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.289
 so cool in that purpose 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:04.240
 want to make a movie that is based on 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.429
 in a classic story then everything 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.399
 much discussed very old in this 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.110
 history of smurfs the gargamel that is 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.610
 played by marvelous hank 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.410
 azaria that also dubs the goal 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.820
 the Simpsons and participates in several other 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.530
 series with front 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.960
 he looks wonderful on paper but the 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.820
 gargamel character is a villain half of 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.950
 table is an 80's villain that he 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.990
 fall a lot of caricature that today does not 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.880
 glue a lot and what they tried to do 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.980
 this movie to give a same 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.680
 depth perceiving oic is very 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.890
 right it was very shallow personality 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.230
 of him was to create a past that he is 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.310
 mentioned very quickly in the film speaks 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.860
 that when he was a child he was 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.150
 played by his father inside a well and 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.280
 he was very ill treated by the family 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.670
 So you end up relating a 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.700
 little more with the payment of way 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.040
 none in 2007 four nights make 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.500
 macs village pro real world is daddy 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.720
 smurf smurf smurfette the bumbling 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.420
 pessimist who in the middle of history tries to 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.280
 optimistic but it is a disaster and the 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.770
 vain bride and groom that I even saw that he is 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.900
 gay and I the stereotype a little forced 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.520
 so this too conceited character he 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.320
 is one of the economic centers of the 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.600
 Most jokes around things 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.130
 that he speaks to many lives are 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.950
 related to the gay world 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.360
 Oh, that's the kind of slang that 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.670
 people generally relate to the 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.280
 gay people but he's a character 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.830
 extremely stereotyped half full 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.230
 boring team and just looking in the mirror and it's 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.880
 a mirror a bit negative but even 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.160
 so an introduction of this universe in the 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.200
 children's world that already is one already can be 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.630
 considered a breakthrough or not 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.640
 The Safe Game The Movie also features 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.739

 bouet production turned blue as he
