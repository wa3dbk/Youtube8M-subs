 hours of being baked and there 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.910
 began the habit of taking out the bread 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.780
 hot every 20 minutes

 as a reference by the bank of mexico 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.730
 to reference inflation in the country 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.130
 ah 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.549
 process 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.350

 minutes or until all the 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.170
 dry ingredients are found 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.710
 perfectly mixed 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.710
 ah

 thin without breaking between your fingers 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.030
 serving the dough in pieces of 90 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.030
 grams 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.660
 to form the bolillos we will begin 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.670
 forming a roll with the dough 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.710
 press on the dough with the part

 posterior of the palm of the hand and 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.930
 start rolling with the help of the 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.370
 fingers once formed this roll with 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.640
 the help of little fingers 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.250
 we will start to form a bolillo 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.069
 fermented in fermentation chamber 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.630
 30 to 35 minutes with 60 percent of 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.580
 humidity 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.710
 in case of not having a camera 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.380
 fermentation cover the bread trays 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.680
 with a plastic and ferment for one hour 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.850
 approximately at room temperature 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.550
 once the time of 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.410
 Fermentation remove from the chamber or remove 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.490
 the plastic that covers them and let dry 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.530
 for about 5 minutes 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.330
 they performed sage on the bolillo of a 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.760
 end towards the other in the form of 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.430
 crescent and making a slight 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.680
 pressure on bread you should be careful 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.930
 in not doing much pressure when performing 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.760
 the cut because you can cause 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.690
 all the expense generated within the bread 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.690
 be expressed 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.700
 bake at 220 degrees centigrade with 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.110
 Initial steam injection by 5 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.110
 seconds for 12 minutes 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.799
 ah 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.739
 do not 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.739
 yes
