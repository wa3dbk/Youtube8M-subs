00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.310 
doesn't require that much so that's a
good<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.549> bad<00:02:02.579> thing<00:02:02.759> um<00:02:05.840> as<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.990> can<00:02:07.020> see

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
good and a bad thing um as you can see

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.749 
good and a bad thing um as you can see
you<00:02:07.530> could<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.860> watch<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.250> entire<00:02:08.459> race

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
you could you watch the entire race

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.400 
you could you watch the entire race
basically<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.840> bottom<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.200> this<00:02:10.289> as

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
basically in the bottom of this as

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.229 
basically in the bottom of this as
possible<00:02:10.619> wins<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.400> think<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.849> just<00:02:12.090> is

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
possible wins and I think that just is

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.320 
possible wins and I think that just is
you<00:02:12.450> know

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
you know

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.380 
you know
possible<00:02:13.810> wins<00:02:14.170> based<00:02:14.500> upon<00:02:14.820> what<00:02:15.820> you've<00:02:16.060> put

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
possible wins based upon what you've put

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.470 
possible wins based upon what you've put
