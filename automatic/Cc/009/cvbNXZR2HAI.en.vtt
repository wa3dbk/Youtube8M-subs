00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
fit it inside this space then we have

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.740 
fit it inside this space then we have
too<00:01:07.619> much<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.460> natural<00:01:09.030> way<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.479> keeping

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
too much it's a natural way of keeping

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.109 
too much it's a natural way of keeping
you<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.770> make<00:01:10.979> sure<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.250> edit<00:01:11.460> things<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.090> a

fit where you want them to go next make
sure<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.650> choose<00:01:17.130> bins<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.729> have<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.150> clear

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
sure to choose bins that have a clear

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.109 
sure to choose bins that have a clear
side<00:01:19.380> because<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.220> helps<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.640> see<00:01:20.909> what's

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119

inside<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.840> see<00:01:22.439> if<00:01:22.680> things<00:01:22.920> are

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
inside of it and see if things are

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.649 
inside of it and see if things are
really<00:01:23.520> getting<00:01:23.759> low<00:01:24.090> in<00:01:24.270> terms<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.600> supplies

really getting low in terms of supplies

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.800 
really getting low in terms of supplies
or<00:01:25.350> if<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.070> need<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.400> go<00:01:26.549> ahead<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.060> maybe<00:01:27.240> up
