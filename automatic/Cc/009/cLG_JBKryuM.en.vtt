percent<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.200> its<00:02:10.289> health<00:02:10.879> so<00:02:11.879> now<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.569> said<00:02:13.080> I

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
percent of its health so now I said I

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.030 
percent of its health so now I said I
ought<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.560> go

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
ought to go

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.250 
ought to go
for<00:02:14.159> the<00:02:14.250> Draco<00:02:14.489> meteor<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:17.689> surprisingly<00:02:18.689> it

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
for the Draco meteor and surprisingly it

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.319 
for the Draco meteor and surprisingly it
was<00:02:20.189> a<00:02:20.219> KO<00:02:21.500> not<00:02:22.500> even<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.769> crit<00:02:23.069> or<00:02:23.250> anything<00:02:23.670> so

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
was a KO not even a crit or anything so

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:28.039 
was a KO not even a crit or anything so
that<00:02:24.930> was<00:02:25.079> pretty<00:02:25.560> awesome<00:02:25.879> for<00:02:26.879> me<00:02:27.019> John<00:02:28.019> I

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
that was pretty awesome for me John I

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.589 
that was pretty awesome for me John I
sensed<00:02:28.379> houndoom<00:02:28.859> and<00:02:29.069> I<00:02:29.760> was<00:02:30.209> predicting

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
sensed houndoom and I was predicting

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.390 
sensed houndoom and I was predicting
your<00:02:30.659> pursuit<00:02:31.019> so<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.230> decided<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.650> say<00:02:31.980> stay<00:02:32.370> in

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
your pursuit so I decided to say stay in

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.280 
your pursuit so I decided to say stay in
and<00:02:32.730> try<00:02:32.849> to<00:02:32.879> do<00:02:33.030> as<00:02:33.120> much<00:02:33.180> damage<00:02:33.329> with<00:02:33.870> Draco

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
and try to do as much damage with Draco

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.839 
and try to do as much damage with Draco
meteor<00:02:34.470> or<00:02:34.709> even<00:02:34.890> know<00:02:34.980> it's<00:02:35.129> already<00:02:35.280> minus<00:02:35.609> 2

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
meteor or even know it's already minus 2

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.630 
meteor or even know it's already minus 2
but<00:02:36.750> he<00:02:36.989> actually<00:02:37.109> carry<00:02:37.470> Sucker<00:02:37.829> Punch<00:02:38.159> and

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
but he actually carry Sucker Punch and

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.990 
but he actually carry Sucker Punch and
that<00:02:39.599> totally<00:02:39.810> sucks<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.609> Draco<00:02:41.790> meteor

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
that totally sucks so the Draco meteor

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.959 
that totally sucks so the Draco meteor
did<00:02:42.900> quite<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.260> lot<00:02:43.489> wat<00:02:44.489> even<00:02:44.790> though<00:02:44.849> it's

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:44.969 
did quite a lot wat even though it's

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:47.599 
did quite a lot wat even though it's
minus<00:02:45.329> 2<00:02:45.510> but<00:02:45.810> not<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.260> KO<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:47.010> then<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.519> was

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
minus 2 but not the KO and then I was

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:48.770 
minus 2 but not the KO and then I was
taking<00:02:47.849> about<00:02:47.970> switching<00:02:48.209> but<00:02:48.480> he<00:02:48.659> might

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
taking about switching but he might

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.750 
taking about switching but he might
predict<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.290> switch<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:50.159> know<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.489> second

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
predict the switch you know the second

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.490 
predict the switch you know the second
time<00:02:50.909> but<00:02:51.720> after<00:02:51.900> school<00:02:52.169> for<00:02:52.379> to

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
time but after school for to

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.809 
time but after school for to
sucker-punch<00:02:52.829> it<00:02:53.129> was<00:02:53.250> pretty<00:02:53.489> awesome<00:02:53.609> on

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
sucker-punch it was pretty awesome on

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.330 
sucker-punch it was pretty awesome on
his<00:02:54.030> part<00:02:54.269> so<00:02:55.049> then<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.260> decided<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.919> go<00:02:56.010> for<00:02:56.280> it

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
his part so then I decided to go for it

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.409 
his part so then I decided to go for it

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
case you wanted to switch into anything

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.580 
case you wanted to switch into anything

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
wheezing and I switch out because it's

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.250 
wheezing and I switch out because it's
banded<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.459> pursuit<00:04:05.819> won't<00:04:06.540> do<00:04:06.750> much<00:04:06.930> on<00:04:07.199> a

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
banded and pursuit won't do much on a

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.500 
banded and pursuit won't do much on a
wheezing<00:04:07.620> that's<00:04:07.799> not<00:04:07.949> switching<00:04:08.159> out<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:09.090> he

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
wheezing that's not switching out so he

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.469 
wheezing that's not switching out so he
a<00:04:09.540> fire<00:04:10.439> blast<00:04:10.769> and<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.519> melodic<00:04:12.000> took<00:04:12.209> it<00:04:12.329> like

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:12.479 
a fire blast and I melodic took it like

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.020 
a fire blast and I melodic took it like
a<00:04:12.509> beast<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:13.310> it's<00:04:14.310> almost<00:04:14.549> back<00:04:14.879> to<00:04:15.000> full

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030

before leftovers and um you um i guess
if<00:04:35.099> the<00:04:35.280> surf<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:35.940> goes<00:04:36.240> for<00:04:36.479> pain<00:04:36.690> split<00:04:37.050> now

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
if the surf and goes for pain split now
