00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.000
 Hello everyone 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.120
 I am often asked how to use my trekking poles. 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.880
 Now I will come to demonstrate with you. 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.280
 How should the trekking pole be used correctly? 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.900
 The average trekking pole is not three or four 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.440
 Collapsed is about 60 centimeters 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.800
 Elongation can be about 135 cm 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.140
 At most, this length is probably 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.380
 I am often asked how much the length of the trekking pole should be. 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.680
 Now let me report to you. 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.160
 Each person’s height is different, so the length of the trekking pole will be different. 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.180
 Generally the most comfortable location 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.140
 Is the way the upper arm is horizontal 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.340
 Ping Road and Shangshan are best horizontal 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.660
 If it is downhill, our trekking poles will have to be a hurdle. 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.560
 Going up again when you go down 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.300
 Going downhill can be a little longer 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.400
 Because our force is above the arm 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.640
 Do not apply more force to your shoulder than your shoulder 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.600
 Actually the situation is like this 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.640
 You don’t need trekking poles over your shoulders. 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.014
 Then use climbing at this time. 

00:01:12.014 --> 00:01:13.274
 This is how it looks 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.580
 If you are the length, say it again. 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.280
 Is the horizontal position of the arm 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.920
 Then follow the important part of the report. 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.120
 This is a wristband 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.540
 All trekking poles should have a wristband 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.840
 The correct use of the wristband is important 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.140
 Look carefully, I will make a mistake demonstration first. 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.120
 Pull it out like this 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.020
 Many people in this way are wrong like this. 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.520
 It seems the easiest but the most error-prone 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.100
 What is the problem with this? 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.660
 Today, if I have a situation, when I open my hand, 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.519
 The trekking pole is still stuck in my hand. 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.100
 It has no way to do strain plus your wrists may hurt 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.480
 The old Taiwanese mountaineering community 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.300
 Mr. Wu Yulong, Captain of Mount Wong, Taiwan 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.080
 He teaches us all the most important ways to use it. 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.360
 First through the palm of your hand and then back 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.500
 See if this is not the case with your hand. 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.120
 You give it strength again 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.740
 Did you find that the palm of your hand is also contributing? 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.580
 This is the most correct way to use 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.600
 Today, if you say that you are sour, your wrist can help you. 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.720
 In fact, don’t use too much force on the palm 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.000
 It is just like this, just hold it gently. 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.300
 For people who really use strength, he is a wrist 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.600
 Use the power of the wristband to do the extra points of the strength of the hand 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.180
 If an unexpected situation has occurred 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.902
 Let go of your hands! 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.680
 It’s okay to touch the tree to touch the land and touch the mountain wall.
