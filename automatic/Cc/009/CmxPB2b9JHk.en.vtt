00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
probably not the most recent one but I

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.450 
probably not the most recent one but I
think<00:01:05.449> I've<00:01:05.540> done<00:01:05.720> one<00:01:06.049> like<00:01:06.890> a<00:01:06.920> survival

games<00:01:07.610> something<00:01:07.880> like<00:01:08.030> that<00:01:08.680> like<00:01:09.680> a<00:01:09.740> little

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
games something like that like a little

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.969 
games something like that like a little
ways<00:01:10.310> before<00:01:10.690> where<00:01:11.690> I<00:01:12.020> was<00:01:12.320> reviewing<00:01:12.860> it

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
ways before where I was reviewing it

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.359 
ways before where I was reviewing it
kind<00:01:13.310> of<00:01:13.490> or<00:01:13.820> just<00:01:13.850> showing<00:01:14.210> it<00:01:14.420> around<00:01:14.770> in<00:01:15.770> the

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
video but basically it is called the

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.780

why is if you look at the gold iron coal

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.120 
why is if you look at the gold iron coal
lapies<00:01:29.870> diamond<00:01:31.540> redstone<00:01:32.540> and<00:01:32.990> emerald<00:01:33.500> all
