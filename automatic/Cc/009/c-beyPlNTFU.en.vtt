today<00:00:02.700> we<00:00:02.939> have<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.090> battle<00:00:03.480> with<00:00:03.629> black<00:00:03.990> stars

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.349 
today we have a battle with black stars
showing<00:00:05.100> us<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.400> true<00:00:05.609> power<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:05.970> steelix

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
showing us the true power of steelix

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.839 
showing us the true power of steelix
honestly<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:07.170> feel<00:00:07.680> steelix<00:00:08.130> is<00:00:08.280> a<00:00:08.309> very<00:00:08.519> strong

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
honestly I feel steelix is a very strong

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.060 
honestly I feel steelix is a very strong
and<00:00:09.030> underrated<00:00:09.510> Pokemon<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.320> I'm<00:00:10.800> really

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
and underrated Pokemon and I'm really

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.169 
and underrated Pokemon and I'm really
happy<00:00:11.250> for<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:11.610> battle

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
happy for this battle

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.539 
happy for this battle
so<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:13.110> I'd<00:00:13.230> like<00:00:13.530> steelix<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.070> just<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.429> has

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
so the I'd like steelix is just it has

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.580 
so the I'd like steelix is just it has
some<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.420> highest<00:00:15.599> defense<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.379> game

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
some of the highest defense in the game

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.189 
some of the highest defense in the game
I<00:00:16.800> think<00:00:17.010> he<00:00:17.070> has<00:00:17.190> 200<00:00:17.400> base<00:00:17.760> defence<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.900> it

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
I think he has 200 base defence so it

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.260 
I think he has 200 base defence so it
becomes<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.619> huge<00:00:20.070> physical<00:00:20.460> wall<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:21.060> I

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
becomes a huge physical wall that I

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.970 
becomes a huge physical wall that I
think<00:00:21.660> people<00:00:21.869> can<00:00:22.050> take<00:00:22.199> more<00:00:22.439> advantage<00:00:22.680> of

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
think people can take more advantage of

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.769 
think people can take more advantage of
think<00:00:23.550> what<00:00:23.699> scares<00:00:24.210> people<00:00:24.300> from<00:00:24.630> using

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
think what scares people from using

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.960 
think what scares people from using
steelix<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.830> has<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> lot<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.519> common

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
steelix is that it has a lot of common

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.730 
steelix is that it has a lot of common
weaknesses<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:27.869> we<00:00:27.930> could<00:00:28.080> gets<00:00:28.199> ground<00:00:28.500> weak

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
weaknesses so we could gets ground weak

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.160 
weaknesses so we could gets ground weak
against<00:00:29.010> fighting<00:00:29.279> weak<00:00:29.550> against<00:00:29.820> fire<00:00:30.170> not

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
against fighting weak against fire not

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.690 
against fighting weak against fire not
some<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.590> best<00:00:31.890> things<00:00:32.160> you<00:00:32.369> want<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.610> be

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
some of the best things you want to be

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.360 
some of the best things you want to be
weak<00:00:32.910> against<00:00:33.360> also<00:00:33.899> it's<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.260> offensive<00:00:35.160> stats

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
weak against also it's a offensive stats

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.549 
weak against also it's a offensive stats
are<00:00:35.700> good<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.600> shear<00:00:36.960> force<00:00:37.200> ability

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
are good with that shear force ability

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.740 
are good with that shear force ability
but<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:37.890> not<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.219> incredibly<00:00:38.700> reliable<00:00:39.059> so

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
but it's not like incredibly reliable so

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.150 
but it's not like incredibly reliable so
it<00:00:39.809> does<00:00:39.960> take<00:00:40.110> some<00:00:40.170> setup<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.800> make<00:00:40.980> sure

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
it does take some setup to make sure

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.040 
it does take some setup to make sure
it's<00:00:41.430> really<00:00:41.579> strong<00:00:41.910> now

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
it's really strong now

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.750 
it's really strong now

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850

hidden<00:03:57.260> power<00:03:57.380> I<00:03:57.530> didn't<00:03:57.829> get<00:03:57.950> touched<00:03:58.549> so<00:03:59.390> we

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
hidden power I didn't get touched so we

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.000 
hidden power I didn't get touched so we
didn't<00:03:59.720> get<00:03:59.810> to<00:03:59.870> see<00:03:59.989> how<00:04:00.049> tanky<00:04:00.470> it<00:04:00.560> was<00:04:00.709> but

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
didn't get to see how tanky it was but

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.539 
didn't get to see how tanky it was but
that<00:04:02.000> shear<00:04:02.239> force<00:04:02.600> makes<00:04:02.930> it<00:04:03.109> hurt<00:04:03.440> yo<00:04:03.739> and<00:04:04.130> it

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
that shear force makes it hurt yo and it

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.789 
that shear force makes it hurt yo and it
has<00:04:04.670> good<00:04:04.880> coverage<00:04:05.090> with<00:04:05.299> that<00:04:05.540> ice<00:04:06.410> and

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
has good coverage with that ice and

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.310 
has good coverage with that ice and
steel<00:04:07.670> probably<00:04:08.420> we<00:04:08.570> got<00:04:08.720> ground<00:04:09.019> on<00:04:09.200> that

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
steel probably we got ground on that

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.380 
steel probably we got ground on that
earthquake<00:04:09.709> as<00:04:09.890> well<00:04:10.070> so<00:04:10.850> we<00:04:10.940> got<00:04:11.090> some<00:04:11.269> good
