very<00:00:58.199> handy<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:58.800> opposed<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.579> just<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> HQ

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
which doesn't really work anyway and

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.280 
which doesn't really work anyway and
then<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.789> get<00:01:02.940> airplay<00:01:03.149> functionality<00:01:03.600> there

camera roll rename import to bridge I

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.980

believe<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.939> which<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.630> another<00:01:51.840> one<00:01:51.930> of

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
believe that is which is another one of

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.929 
believe that is which is another one of
his<00:01:52.200> tweaks<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.950> opening<00:01:53.369> doesn't<00:01:53.700> really

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
his tweaks the opening doesn't really

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.730 
his tweaks the opening doesn't really
seem<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.210> work<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.869> think<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.350> might<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.500> because

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
seem to work I think it might be because

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.639 
seem to work I think it might be because
I<00:01:55.890> don't<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.250> anything<00:01:57.259> installed<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.500> it

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
I don't have anything installed that it

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.230 
I don't have anything installed that it
doesn't<00:01:58.920> open<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.490> imagine<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.060> things

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
doesn't open in I imagine it's things

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.149 
doesn't open in I imagine it's things
like<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.570> file<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.140> things<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.530> would<00:02:01.860> work

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
like I file and things that would work

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.760 
like I file and things that would work
fine<00:02:02.520> without<00:02:03.060> opening<00:02:03.600> feature<00:02:03.899> but<00:02:04.590> as<00:02:04.680> you

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
fine without opening feature but as you

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.560 
fine without opening feature but as you
can<00:02:04.890> see<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.280> can<00:02:05.490> view<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.880> back<00:02:06.149> nice<00:02:06.509> and
