00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.240 
and stuff so i could get more practice
so<00:03:51.300> when<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.480> have<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.750> client<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:52.410> can<00:03:52.560> easily<00:03:52.860> do

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
so when I have a client I can easily do

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.750 
so when I have a client I can easily do
it<00:03:53.280> without<00:03:53.520> even<00:03:54.420> bothering<00:03:54.600> to<00:03:54.930> um<00:03:55.320> you<00:03:55.760> know

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
it without even bothering to um you know

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.760 
it without even bothering to um you know
like<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.090> practice<00:03:57.420> I<00:03:57.720> can<00:03:57.900> do<00:03:58.050> it<00:03:58.140> fast<00:03:58.440> and

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
like a practice I can do it fast and

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.770 
like a practice I can do it fast and
this<00:03:59.340> really<00:03:59.580> cuts<00:03:59.910> down<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.150> make<00:04:00.390> up<00:04:00.540> time

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
this really cuts down the make up time

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.750 
this really cuts down the make up time
because<00:04:01.110> usually<00:04:01.290> I'll<00:04:01.590> be<00:04:01.770> put<00:04:02.550> on<00:04:02.730> a

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
because usually I'll be put on a

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.410 
because usually I'll be put on a
foundation<00:04:03.750> in<00:04:04.350> a<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.850> contoured<00:04:05.850> foundation

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
foundation in a a contoured foundation

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.570 
foundation in a a contoured foundation
so<00:04:06.510> it<00:04:06.600> doesn't<00:04:06.840> take<00:04:06.960> long<00:04:06.990> just<00:04:07.200> put<00:04:07.680> on<00:04:07.830> my

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
so it doesn't take long just put on my

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.100 
so it doesn't take long just put on my
console<00:04:09.030> under<00:04:09.240> here<00:04:09.510> my<00:04:09.630> lighter<00:04:09.840> concealer

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090
