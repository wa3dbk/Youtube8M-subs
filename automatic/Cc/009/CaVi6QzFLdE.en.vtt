just how to get the results you're
looking<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:30.949> now<00:00:31.949> if<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.189> remember

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
looking for now if you remember

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.880 
looking for now if you remember
correctly<00:00:32.790> when<00:00:33.690> we<00:00:33.840> butcher<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.410> tenderloin

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
correctly when we butcher the tenderloin

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.430 
correctly when we butcher the tenderloin
in<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.160> last<00:00:35.399> video<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:36.090> ended<00:00:36.930> up<00:00:36.989> with<00:00:37.200> nine

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
in the last video I ended up with nine

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.310 
in the last video I ended up with nine
steaks<00:00:37.950> but<00:00:38.790> only<00:00:38.969> eight<00:00:39.300> steaks<00:00:39.690> meted<00:00:40.200> in

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
steaks but only eight steaks meted in

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.470 
steaks but only eight steaks meted in
storage<00:00:40.950> because<00:00:41.520> let's<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.059> say<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
storage because let's just say the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.810 
storage because let's just say the
butcher<00:00:42.780> was<00:00:42.930> getting<00:00:43.230> hungry<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.399> heated

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
butcher was getting hungry so I heated

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.479 
butcher was getting hungry so I heated
up<00:00:45.000> some<00:00:45.360> leftover<00:00:45.960> potato<00:00:46.410> cauliflower<00:00:46.829> mesh

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
up some leftover potato cauliflower mesh

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.029 
up some leftover potato cauliflower mesh
and<00:00:47.879> went<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.840> work<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.350> missing<00:00:49.680> steak

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
and went to work on that missing steak

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.310 
and went to work on that missing steak
now<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.300> brush<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.780> meat<00:00:51.960> directly

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
now I like to brush the meat directly

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.400 
now I like to brush the meat directly
with<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.010> oil<00:00:53.219> versus<00:00:54.180> adding<00:00:54.719> oil<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.320> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
with the oil versus adding oil to the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.950 
with the oil versus adding oil to the
frying<00:00:55.440> pan<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.910> there's<00:00:57.120> less<00:00:57.300> smoke<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
frying pan so there's less smoke in the

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.770 
frying pan so there's less smoke in the
house<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.579> important<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.149> understand

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
house and it's important to understand

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.720 
house and it's important to understand
that<00:01:01.559> while<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:01.949> cut<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.340> meat<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.699> very

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
that while this cut of meat is very

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.500 
that while this cut of meat is very
tender

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
tender

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.780 
tender
it<00:01:03.899> also<00:01:04.110> has<00:01:04.470> less<00:01:04.739> flavor<00:01:04.949> than<00:01:05.400> some<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.700> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
it also has less flavor than some of the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.210 
it also has less flavor than some of the
other<00:01:05.970> cuts<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.020> needs<00:01:07.260> both<00:01:07.470> seasoning

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
other cuts so it needs both seasoning

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.700 
other cuts so it needs both seasoning
and<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:09.060> good<00:01:09.299> sear<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:10.049> get<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> most<00:01:10.500> flavor

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
and a good sear to get the most flavor

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.030 
and a good sear to get the most flavor
here<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:12.150> think<00:01:12.210> course<00:01:12.810> salt<00:01:13.110> works<00:01:13.320> best

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
here and I think course salt works best

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.120 
here and I think course salt works best
I<00:01:14.159> used<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.150> gray<00:01:15.390> sea<00:01:15.450> salt<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.290> since<00:01:16.920> black

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
I used a gray sea salt and since black

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.920 
I used a gray sea salt and since black
pepper<00:01:17.520> tends<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.060> burn<00:01:18.270> easily

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
pepper tends to burn easily

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.649 
pepper tends to burn easily
I<00:01:19.110> used<00:01:19.830> whole<00:01:20.310> peppercorns<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.360> just

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
I used whole peppercorns that I just

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.020 
I used whole peppercorns that I just
slightly<00:01:22.140> cracked<00:01:22.439> by<00:01:23.310> hitting<00:01:23.670> them<00:01:23.820> with

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
slightly cracked by hitting them with

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.850 
slightly cracked by hitting them with
the<00:01:24.330> bottom<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.110> saucepan<00:01:25.320> or<00:01:25.799> Malik

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
the bottom of the saucepan or Malik

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.770 
the bottom of the saucepan or Malik
I<00:01:26.890> think<00:01:27.250> cast<00:01:27.490> iron<00:01:27.790> is<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.120> best<00:01:28.330> way<00:01:28.480> to<00:01:28.510> go

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
I think cast iron is the best way to go

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.080 
I think cast iron is the best way to go
over<00:01:28.840> searing<00:01:29.350> meat<00:01:29.560> since<00:01:30.310> it<00:01:30.490> retains<00:01:30.820> heat

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
over searing meat since it retains heat

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.110 
over searing meat since it retains heat
so<00:01:31.330> well<00:01:31.540> and<00:01:31.780> can<00:01:32.170> quickly<00:01:32.320> brown<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:33.040> meat

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
so well and can quickly brown the meat

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.880 
so well and can quickly brown the meat
without<00:01:34.120> it<00:01:34.240> getting<00:01:34.360> overcooked<00:01:35.140> internally

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
without it getting overcooked internally

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.460 
without it getting overcooked internally
then<00:01:36.610> just<00:01:36.910> place<00:01:37.150> it<00:01:37.180> down<00:01:37.540> and<00:01:37.840> don't<00:01:38.290> touch

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
then just place it down and don't touch

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.950 
then just place it down and don't touch
it<00:01:38.680> for<00:01:38.860> three<00:01:39.100> minutes<00:01:39.360> since<00:01:40.360> it<00:01:40.540> needs<00:01:40.690> that

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
it for three minutes since it needs that

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.530 
it for three minutes since it needs that
time<00:01:41.260> to<00:01:41.470> develop<00:01:41.620> a<00:01:41.980> golden-brown<00:01:42.580> cross-

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
time to develop a golden-brown cross-

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.630 
time to develop a golden-brown cross-
flip<00:01:44.050> the<00:01:44.200> steak<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:44.800> give<00:01:44.920> it<00:01:45.010> another<00:01:45.100> three

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
flip the steak and give it another three

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.240 
flip the steak and give it another three
minutes<00:01:45.820> on<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.180> second<00:01:46.600> side<00:01:46.660> and<00:01:47.170> once<00:01:47.950> that

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
minutes on the second side and once that

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.670 
minutes on the second side and once that
sides<00:01:48.580> golden<00:01:49.090> brown<00:01:49.390> you'll<00:01:50.170> want<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.410> sear

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
sides golden brown you'll want to sear

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.500 
sides golden brown you'll want to sear
the<00:01:50.830> sides<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.310> little<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:51.970> you<00:01:52.090> just<00:01:52.270> want<00:01:52.479> to

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
the sides a little and you just want to

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.510 
the sides a little and you just want to
do<00:01:52.690> this<00:01:52.840> for<00:01:53.080> about<00:01:53.170> 30<00:01:53.500> seconds<00:01:54.070> per<00:01:54.250> side

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
do this for about 30 seconds per side

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.090 
do this for about 30 seconds per side
just<00:01:55.510> to<00:01:55.630> get<00:01:55.750> some<00:01:55.930> appetizing<00:01:56.620> color<00:01:56.650> on

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100
