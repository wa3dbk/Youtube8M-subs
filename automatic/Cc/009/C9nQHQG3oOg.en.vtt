00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.059
 hi I'm back with a new video 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.650
 Dukan recipe is this great journey 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.050
 Nutella will be required 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.660
 this recipe requires the use of 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.680
 web therefore 0 tolerated can be 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.060
 eaten at will 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.580
 obviously respecting the doses 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.010
 Daily milk can be 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.590
 eaten starting from the attack precisely 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.960
 because we are not tolerated if not 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.019
 you have the guar you can replace it 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.720
 with 80 g of cornstarch attention though 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:38.150
 because in this case it becomes tolerated 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.370
 and therefore the minimum four must be eaten 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.860
 days it stays in the fridge for about 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.549
 three days and it is possible to freeze 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.890
 jars with these doses will come to me 3 in 

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:50.960
 large jars as those of protection 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.729
 of the dukan boutique 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.670
 I leave you to the proceedings i 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:02.089
 ingredients are 300 ml of milk 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:06.440
 skimmed liquid 8 grams of flour 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:09.740
 sweetener guar to taste in rome 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.740
 hazelnut half vial of aroma to 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:17.299
 vanilla 3 tablespoons of milk powder 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:20.200
 mixed with 2 tablespoons of dukan cocoa 2 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:23.450
 spoons of quart then first of all 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.560
 mix the cocoa powder and milk 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.560
 leave it aside 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.630
 in a bowl pour over the 300 ml of 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.630
 milk 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.560
 and about 4 grams of war 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:58.229
 and blend with electric whips is the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.780
 minimum speed as soon as it starts 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.570
 take some density you can 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:14.040
 increase speed and add plan 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:15.900
 slowly the other measure of guar once 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.330
 that you have incorporated well the 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.480
 second scoop of guar increased to 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:36.810
 maximum speed and fitted well the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:43.850
 milk once the milk is well fitted 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:49.799
 it must be so very dense 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:51.480
 you see now putting the whips to the 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.519
 minimum speed 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.870
 gradually add the milk in 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:59.790
 powder the cocoa you have 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:02.930
 previously mixed I put them a 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.930
 teaspoon at a time 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.040
 now add the half vial of 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.040
 vanilla 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.680
 the roma hazelnut of course to taste 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.220
 and the sweetener 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.769
 I changed the whip because with 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.840
 I don't feel very well about that though 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.840
 in short, he wanted to make any 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.910
 keep stirring until you do 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.910
 you will see more cocoa dots 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.980
 Now add the quark a little at a time 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.940
 as you can see, this is exactly what you give him 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.500
 the consistency of the real nutella 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.790
 try to do it also with the balance with 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.790
 the total that is not good 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.419
 here the protection is done 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.550
 let it rest for ten minutes like this 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.130
 air 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.070
 after that put the wall in place of course 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:31.630
 you can put it where you want this is 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.630
 consistency 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.310
 here's the recipe I hope there is 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.580
 liked this is the consistency of the 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.580
 Nutella 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.610
 to the next recipe
