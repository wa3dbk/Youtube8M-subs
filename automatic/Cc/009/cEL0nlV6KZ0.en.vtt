couldn't get anywhere luckier than that
it<00:01:52.649> seems<00:01:53.549> reasonable<00:01:54.240> for<00:01:54.450> now<00:01:54.570> unless<00:01:54.810> we

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
it seems reasonable for now unless we

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.480 
it seems reasonable for now unless we
see<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> couple<00:01:55.710> more<00:01:55.799> come<00:01:56.009> out<00:01:56.130> onto<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
see a couple more come out onto the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.889 
see a couple more come out onto the
market<00:01:56.670> like<00:01:56.909> burning<00:01:57.299> scorching<00:01:57.979> etc<00:01:58.979> so

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
market like burning scorching etc so

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.450 
market like burning scorching etc so
hopefully<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.079> isn't<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.530> only<00:02:01.560> usual<00:02:02.280> one

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
hopefully this isn't the only usual one

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.490 
hopefully this isn't the only usual one
