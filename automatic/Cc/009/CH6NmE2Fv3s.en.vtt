00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.680
 good in this video we wanted to show 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:10.790
 how to perform the last step of the method 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.950
 of experts in a very fast way in 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.309
 about two seconds we will get a 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.400
 fight for that first thing we have 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.560
 that stop this do not do it with the 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.099
 permutation of the t how to perform the 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.130
 permutation of the one bit more than one 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:31.090
 second two seconds we're going to see what 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.090
 it takes 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.079
 ah 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.110
 after seconds taking and releasing the 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.910
 Cube 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.140
 to buy the step right now 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.140
 super fast 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.160
 the same 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.500
 good that we need to know to do 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.360
 these movements very fast what 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.670
 we have to have is an algorithm with 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.260
 a good concatenation of movements and 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.930
 it means a good concatenation of 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.430
 movement means that apart from the 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.140
 correct position to catch cubes if 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.960
 our algorithm has for example 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.479
 Front and rear movements 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.150
 right left would be very difficult 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.820
 release them all then clear so not 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.950
 would have an algorithm how many less 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.350
 faces we play better for example me that 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.000
 I normally use the one that was 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.729
 internet but I have seen other variants 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.260
 that I have not liked so much but good 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.680
 the one I use would be 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.680
 to the right side from the top to the top 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.580
 Clockwise 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.530
 we turn it down again to the right 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.200
 We return the top one back then 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.540
 go down to the right and I now with this 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.970
 fear already intercalated frontal to put together 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.090
 here being now we go up 2 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.690
 with this finger one is given and it is lowered 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.460
 with this finger is given to another 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.550
 and be south now since here would be the 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.250
 above 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.110
 we go down right and with the front the 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.600
 would return here with the thumb 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:15.530
 look at the question where I'm going to do it 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.030
 little more fluid to be seen but all with 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.460
 the fingers of course the position 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.530
 correct to catch the bucket and starting 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.770
 this algorithm would be like that to begin with 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.240
 giving him already would be up and you 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.480
 I would get here with these two hammers 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.840
 bring all the seeds old right 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.900
 and left trigger is clear its time and 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.850
 trigger low and trigger then 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.670
 we choose from here we return to face 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.000
 when they join these 22 up 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.390
 to form this quickly trigger and 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.890
 we lower the trigger and go up and 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.410
 coming here already very easy because over 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.209
 the trigger circle low we go down and 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.069
 here directly with the thumb already 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.349
 intercalar and masters the frontal 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.019
 with that well-practiced algorithm and 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.959
 taking the correct position the cube will 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.260
 could take in the t cell very very little 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.260
 weather 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.650
 to equip side 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.379
 the hotel 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:23.349
 and well I will upload the algorithm tpl and 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:27.540
 how to do it in less than three 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.540
 seconds thank you I salute
