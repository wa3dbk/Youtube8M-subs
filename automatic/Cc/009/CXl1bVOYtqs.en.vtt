and<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.500> figured<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:17.040> out<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.430> long<00:02:17.670> time<00:02:18.030> ago

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
and I figured this out a long time ago

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.210 
and I figured this out a long time ago
mainly<00:02:18.720> by<00:02:19.050> trial<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.620> error

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
mainly by trial and error

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.940 
mainly by trial and error
this<00:02:20.489> mold<00:02:20.730> holds<00:02:21.180> about<00:02:21.330> 60<00:02:21.930> grams<00:02:22.200> now<00:02:22.560> we

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
this mold holds about 60 grams now we

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.310 
this mold holds about 60 grams now we
have<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.519> do<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:23.850> by<00:02:24.030> weight<00:02:24.360> instead<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:25.110> by

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
have to do this by weight instead of by

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.740 
have to do this by weight instead of by
us<00:02:25.709> volume<00:02:26.250> measurements<00:02:26.910> because<00:02:27.390> we're

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
us volume measurements because we're

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.690 
us volume measurements because we're
going<00:02:28.019> to<00:02:28.170> weigh<00:02:28.380> out<00:02:28.560> both<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.220> dough<00:02:29.430> and

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
going to weigh out both the dough and

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.880 
going to weigh out both the dough and
the<00:02:30.180> filling<00:02:30.209> so<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:30.959> everything<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.590> even

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
the filling so that everything is even

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.910 
the filling so that everything is even
so<00:02:32.670> for<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:32.970> dough<00:02:33.209> I'm<00:02:33.600> going<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.470> weigh<00:02:34.709> out

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
so for the dough I'm going to weigh out

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.890 
so for the dough I'm going to weigh out
15<00:02:35.850> gram<00:02:36.330> balls<00:02:36.720> like<00:02:37.260> this<00:02:38.570> once<00:02:39.570> they<00:02:39.780> are

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
15 gram balls like this once they are

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.290 
15 gram balls like this once they are
done<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.560> want<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:40.890> just<00:02:41.130> set<00:02:41.370> them<00:02:41.610> aside<00:02:41.760> at

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
done you want to just set them aside at

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.690 
done you want to just set them aside at
room<00:02:42.330> temperature<00:02:43.260> now<00:02:43.680> for<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.010> filling<00:02:44.340> I'm

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
room temperature now for the filling I'm

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.420 
room temperature now for the filling I'm
using<00:02:45.090> my<00:02:45.360> homemade<00:02:45.660> Lotus<00:02:46.260> paste<00:02:46.590> now<00:02:47.370> you

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
using my homemade Lotus paste now you

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.430 
using my homemade Lotus paste now you
want<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:47.910> make<00:02:48.030> sure<00:02:48.330> this<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:48.750> cold<00:02:49.110> because

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
want to make sure this is cold because

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.759 
want to make sure this is cold because
it<00:02:49.769> helps<00:02:50.220> when<00:02:50.430> rolling<00:02:50.819> this<00:02:51.000> into<00:02:51.420> balls

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
it helps when rolling this into balls

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.380 
it helps when rolling this into balls
now<00:02:52.769> just<00:02:53.069> like<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.280> dough<00:02:53.670> I'm<00:02:54.000> weighing

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
now just like the dough I'm weighing

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.190 
now just like the dough I'm weighing
this<00:02:54.750> out<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.380> here<00:02:56.130> I'm<00:02:56.340> using<00:02:56.400> 45<00:02:57.299> grams<00:02:57.870> of

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
this out and here I'm using 45 grams of

make<00:03:10.620> sure<00:03:10.829> these<00:03:11.040> are<00:03:11.250> both<00:03:11.459> at<00:03:11.670> room

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
make sure these are both at room

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.520 
make sure these are both at room
temperature<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.630> will<00:03:12.810> make<00:03:12.989> this<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.230> whole

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
temperature it will make this a whole

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.150 
temperature it will make this a whole
lot<00:03:13.769> easier<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:15.720> dough<00:03:15.930> ball<00:03:16.200> into<00:03:16.500> a<00:03:16.739> flat

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
lot easier the dough ball into a flat

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.110 
lot easier the dough ball into a flat
circle

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.110

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
and as you can see this stretches kind

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.500 
and as you can see this stretches kind
of<00:03:24.209> like<00:03:24.420> pizza<00:03:24.870> dough<00:03:25.340> then<00:03:26.340> I'm<00:03:26.700> gonna<00:03:27.060> place
