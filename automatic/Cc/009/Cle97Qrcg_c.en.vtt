00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
but I would have liked it if they just

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.869 
but I would have liked it if they just
didn't<00:00:43.379> put<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.590> there<00:00:43.739> maybe<00:00:44.489> put<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> little

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
didn't put that there maybe put a little

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.880 
didn't put that there maybe put a little
tag<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.539> outside<00:00:45.930> but<00:00:46.140> having<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.530> tag

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890

camera<00:01:33.450> cut<00:01:33.630> out<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.079> definitely<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.619> made

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890
