 spoonful of liquor and let's reserve 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.020

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.550
 butter at room temperature and you 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.470
 we are going to add little by little the 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.680
 icing sugar until there is a paste 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.680
 homogeneous 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.579
 then we are going to add half of the 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.579
 cocoa and we beat again 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.580

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.630
 when we have a homogeneous mixture 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.340
 we are going to put everything all all the 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.560
 melted chocolate and the truth is that 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.870
 this is the richest part of all the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.870
 process and we are going to beat again 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.140

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.010
 let's beat to get a new 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.010
 mixture 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.620
 let's refrigerate it for one hour 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.620
 there is a manageable paste 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.980
 when we have already removed the pasta from 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.050
 fridge will make balls will 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.820

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.060
 cocoa that was left over and if you want nuts 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.060
 almonds 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.430

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.970
 freezer for half an hour 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.010
