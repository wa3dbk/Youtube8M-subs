all the glue and then stick this in the
opposite<00:00:48.570> side<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.410> took<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.219> out<00:00:51.079> just<00:00:52.079> stick

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
opposite side you took it out just stick

the pushpin in to the opposite side
sticking<00:00:55.500> out<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.370> it's<00:00:56.460> sticking<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:56.850> about

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
sticking out so it's sticking out about

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.799 
sticking out so it's sticking out about
that<00:00:57.329> much<00:00:58.550> then<00:00:59.550> you<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.329> want<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.570> take

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
that much then you just want to take

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:11.719 
that much then you just want to take
this<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.760> just<00:01:03.799> roll<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.979> back<00:01:10.310> you<00:01:11.310> shoot<00:01:11.610> it

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
this and just roll it back you shoot it

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.600 
this and just roll it back you shoot it
into<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.150> wall<00:01:12.360> as<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.260> can<00:01:13.439> see<00:01:13.619> stick<00:01:14.400> some

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
into the wall as you can see stick some

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.399 
into the wall as you can see stick some
pretty<00:01:15.299> darn<00:01:15.990> far<00:01:16.610> even<00:01:17.610> sometimes<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.390> far<00:01:18.659> so

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
pretty darn far even sometimes so far so

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.410 
pretty darn far even sometimes so far so
hard<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:19.860> stuck<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.310> then<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:21.030> thing<00:01:21.299> goes

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
hard it's stuck in then the thing goes

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:29.420 
hard it's stuck in then the thing goes
off<00:01:21.830> usually<00:01:22.830> doesn't<00:01:23.310> do<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:26.869> so<00:01:28.250> if<00:01:29.250> you

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
off usually doesn't do that so if you

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.740 
off usually doesn't do that so if you
really<00:01:29.640> want<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> get<00:01:30.060> fancy<00:01:32.030> take<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.390> push

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
really want to get fancy take this push

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.640 
really want to get fancy take this push
pin<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.979> this<00:01:35.280> whistle<00:01:36.270> II<00:01:36.360> think<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:37.470> take

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
pin and this whistle II think just take

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.600 
pin and this whistle II think just take
the<00:01:38.100> end<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.700> rip<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.869> little<00:01:39.900> part<00:01:40.380> out

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
the end of it rip that little part out

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.149 
the end of it rip that little part out
see<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.899> will<00:01:42.899> part<00:01:43.200> those<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.740> there<00:01:43.950> just

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
see that will part those in there just

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.370 
see that will part those in there just
take<00:01:44.369> out<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:45.509> don't<00:01:45.689> hear<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.840> even<00:01:46.229> throw

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
take out you don't hear that even throw

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.300 
take out you don't hear that even throw
away<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:48.500> you<00:01:49.500> were<00:01:49.619> going<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.890> take<00:01:50.070> this

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
away this you were going to take this

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.590 
away this you were going to take this
and<00:01:51.500> you're<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.530> gonna<00:01:52.890> take<00:01:53.759> your<00:01:54.030> dirt

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
and you're just gonna take your dirt

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.410 
and you're just gonna take your dirt
that<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.560> had<00:01:55.740> earlier<00:01:57.680> stick<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.890> in<00:01:59.420> about

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
that you had earlier stick this in about

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.130 
that you had earlier stick this in about
that<00:02:00.810> much<00:02:01.369> then<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:03.030> can<00:02:03.060> disguise<00:02:03.689> this

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
that much then you can disguise this

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:12.910 
that much then you can disguise this
money<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.430> centered<00:02:05.790> right

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.370 

and<00:02:13.920> then<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:15.300> can<00:02:15.450> even<00:02:15.630> just<00:02:15.900> stick<00:02:16.200> out

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
and then you can even just stick out

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.170 
and then you can even just stick out
that<00:02:16.650> bark<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.310> really<00:02:17.610> doesn't<00:02:17.910> need<00:02:17.940> to

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
that bark it really doesn't need to

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.570 
that bark it really doesn't need to
because<00:02:18.420> when<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:19.620> pushes<00:02:20.040> into<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.340> wall

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
because when it pushes into the wall

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.140 
because when it pushes into the wall
it's<00:02:20.910> gonna<00:02:21.120> push<00:02:21.870> down<00:02:21.900> like<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:23.150> but

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
it's gonna push down like that but

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.680 
it's gonna push down like that but
usually<00:02:24.770> you<00:02:25.770> can<00:02:25.920> leave<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.670> sometimes<00:02:27.480> you

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
usually you can leave you sometimes you

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.240 
usually you can leave you sometimes you
even<00:02:27.870> don't<00:02:28.200> even<00:02:28.320> have<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.740> have<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.010> tip

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
even don't even have to have the tip

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.580 
even don't even have to have the tip
sticking<00:02:29.730> out<00:02:29.850> but<00:02:30.120> usually<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.110> works<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.470> lot

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
sticking out but usually it works a lot

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.980 
sticking out but usually it works a lot
better<00:02:31.850> so<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:32.940> have<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.870> looks

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
better so you have that and it looks

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.950 
better so you have that and it looks
like<00:02:34.110> just<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.530> normal<00:02:34.560> dart<00:02:35.100> gun<00:02:35.280> now<00:02:35.960> so

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
like just a normal dart gun now so

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.490 
like just a normal dart gun now so
there's<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> point<00:02:37.500> on<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:39.510> it's<00:02:39.660> dishes

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
there's a point on it and it's dishes

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:54.610 
there's a point on it and it's dishes
just<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.460> same<00:02:41.700> float<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:50.060> still<00:02:51.060> seems<00:02:51.480> yeah

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.100 

so<00:02:55.620> for<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:57.450> next<00:02:58.880> dirt<00:02:59.880> if<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.750> want<00:03:00.960> to<00:03:01.050> do

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
so for the next dirt if you want to do

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.830 
so for the next dirt if you want to do
both<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.590> gotta<00:03:01.800> have<00:03:01.980> more<00:03:02.460> than<00:03:02.520> one<00:03:02.910> thing

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
both you gotta have more than one thing

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
gonna do just take this dart and just

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.420 
gonna do just take this dart and just
kind<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.750> rip<00:03:13.520> this<00:03:14.520> off<00:03:14.760> so<00:03:15.120> it's<00:03:15.270> like<00:03:15.450> that

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
kind of rip this off so it's like that

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.540 
kind of rip this off so it's like that
and<00:03:17.430> then<00:03:17.670> it's<00:03:17.880> pull<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.420> holder<00:03:18.600> enough

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
and then it's pull the holder enough

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.479 
and then it's pull the holder enough
then<00:03:20.550> you<00:03:21.420> have<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.660> nice<00:03:21.840> and<00:03:21.870> hollow<00:03:22.489> you

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
then you have it nice and hollow you

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.640 
then you have it nice and hollow you
want<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.730> take<00:03:23.850> this<00:03:24.090> in<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:26.250> snip<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.760> off

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
want to take this in and snip it off

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.590 
want to take this in and snip it off
with<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.770> scissors<00:03:30.560> then<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:31.770> take<00:03:31.980> this

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
with the scissors then you take this

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
stick it through where you set that

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.420 
stick it through where you set that
thing<00:03:34.950> off<00:03:35.190> Center<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.270> right<00:03:40.340> Center<00:03:41.340> it

thing off Center it right Center it
right<00:03:41.459> it<00:03:42.030> doesn't<00:03:42.239> have<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.540> be<00:03:42.660> sticking<00:03:42.989> out

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
right it doesn't have to be sticking out

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.910 
right it doesn't have to be sticking out
very<00:03:43.320> far

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.440 

and<00:03:49.920> then<00:03:50.100> this<00:03:50.310> one<00:03:50.520> you<00:03:50.670> want<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:50.880> push<00:03:51.120> the

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
and then this one you want to push the

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.470 
and then this one you want to push the
push<00:03:51.690> pin<00:03:51.960> down<00:03:52.170> Carter<00:03:52.710> ways<00:03:53.270> it<00:03:54.270> doesn't

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
push pin down Carter ways it doesn't

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.560 
push pin down Carter ways it doesn't
isn't<00:03:55.020> as<00:03:55.290> you<00:03:56.220> can<00:03:56.400> push<00:03:56.670> it<00:03:56.910> down<00:03:57.120> pretty

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
isn't as you can push it down pretty

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.820 
isn't as you can push it down pretty
hard<00:03:58.370> but<00:03:59.690> that's<00:04:00.690> basically<00:04:01.020> the<00:04:01.320> kind<00:04:01.710> of

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
hard but that's basically the kind of

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.640 
hard but that's basically the kind of
concept<00:04:02.730> of<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.090> this<00:04:03.540> gun<00:04:03.810> usually<00:04:04.050> doesn't

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
concept of it this gun usually doesn't

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:15.849 
concept of it this gun usually doesn't
work<00:04:04.860> for<00:04:05.190> this<00:04:05.370> type<00:04:05.730> of<00:04:05.760> dirt<00:04:06.210> I<00:04:06.590> will<00:04:07.590> try<00:04:07.920> it

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:24.710 

one<00:04:16.859> more<00:04:16.950> time<00:04:23.420> yeah

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
one more time yeah

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:32.000 
one more time yeah
this<00:04:25.290> type<00:04:25.500> of<00:04:25.530> gun<00:04:26.510> doesn't<00:04:27.510> shoot<00:04:30.560> this<00:04:31.560> type

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
this type of gun doesn't shoot this type
