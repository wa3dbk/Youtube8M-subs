00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.840
 he 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.590
 hello everyone with you ultra and this 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.320
 another series of quick and easy moss 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.570
 last issue we considered a career 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.570
 now I will show a few 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.570
 improvements 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.340
 and we will probably start 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.410
 let's say so wireless 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.410
 transportation 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.410
 luhta 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.940
 by means of gizmos that adds 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:44.220
 mouth to expand he is called tesseract 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.930
 so there are three kinds of glitch items for 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.930
 energy and for liquids but 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.590
 than you need to be crafted body and tesseract 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:58.690
 that is, such a thing 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.030
 diamond head and tempered glass 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.010
 melts u so 2 obsidian dust 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.420
 and lead ingot 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.500
 then we need to fill this building 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.500
 ender pearls 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.240
 Dropper is all mechanisms 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.240
 old xp john 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.260
 and finally set up 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.080
 here 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.940
 silver cage tin ingot 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.950
 pneumatic motor filled 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.500
 tesseract and here merged which 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.610
 will determine its type tin will give 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.940
 40 for items 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.580
 electrum go off for energy and copper 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.610
 respectively for liquids 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.220
 so we will need 40 for items for 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.240
 start stop the quarry 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:52.079
 it snap right here 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.079
 quarry rose 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.740
 go from here 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.850
 we put you 10 washes 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.850
 see let's sleek tov that is 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.490
 piece of hardware does not work configuration in Korea 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.530
 arrange Saint-AndrÃ© access to the device 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.569
 there is on the server here like this 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.069
 here you can leave here you can not 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:21.459
 I will touch any frequency 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.459
 put the unit 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.860
 loot and over rather slowly so this 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.160
 so let's say especially is it true them 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.330
 career sorting system will be faster 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.790
 I will not say how much 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.180
 because very much even I would 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.180
 said 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.950
 here we also make a unit but here we have blue 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.660
 the arrow, that is, you need to click here two 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.050
 times 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.050
 recipe only 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:05.900
 slipped do here so try 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.900
 start a career 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.170
 I can find a lever 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.950
 fabulously 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.950
 Bereg did not want to start 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.300
 let's cheat 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.810
 in this way 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.690
 quarry again for a slave 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.620
 snoot 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.050
 inspired moves from career to system 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.440
 sorting here we see here already got 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.440
 coal 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:04:01.030
 take this with me yet 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:11.040
 edit confederation will be far away 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:14.430
 I did not go there because I will connect 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.430
 there is enough space 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.220
 here goes well and fabulously 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.570
 become so you can connect 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.310
 several quarries on the same frequency 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.310
 that is, let's say we have three careers 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.990
 all at frequency 1 but with configuration with 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.940
 antennas 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.290
 with him only send acts of terror to the reception 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.290
 will not work 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:44.010
 and here we only use reception when 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.330
 siphons 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:53.350
 let's try to do the same 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:56.680
 from the liquid so for this we put here 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:00.240
 here tesseract ask him the purity of two 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.240
 center only again 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:15.670
 and cleanliness 2 reception professor of course 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.470
 burdock but a piece of iron works and to these 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:21.120
 water level does not fall despite being 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.120
 what engines and active est 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.790
 he is the water level in the pipe is not 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.129
 egg 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.340
 wonderful 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:35.690
 straight can be done 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.690
 she won't be short here 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.230
 can also make energy 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.169
 tesseract 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.810
 but 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:48.129
 notice energy with effects 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.980
 difficult to transfer because 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:52.900
 this kind of terrorist attacks has a loss 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:58.990
 let's say you passed 10 min joules per 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:06:01.690
 attack and only 8 losses will come 20 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.960
 percent a very substantial amount when 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.539
 high volume transfers 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.860
 In another telephone gray terminal 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:13.070
 put the topic fifty dollars 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:16.750
 it's only 30 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:16.750
 at 40 I don't want to count 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:25.339
 Here is such a thing that 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:28.139
 like and not very tricky but very 

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:30.439
 greatly improves the convenience of the game 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:35.689
 thank you all for watching subscribe 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:35.689
 put your finger up see you soon
