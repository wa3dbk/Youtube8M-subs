00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.059
 Halli hello people in today's tutorial 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.850
 I want you this super compact 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.920
 a blog wide wilders german system 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.539
 imagine the design or 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.939
 the concept comes to this system 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.470
 not from me but from szp so 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.490
 forget about him on the channel 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.230
 stop by 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.910
 In the following tutorial I would like 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.710
 explain to you how to really do this 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.200
 very very useful storage system builds 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.329
 or what advantages that has 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.399
 that are this system it is possible 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.170
 many villiger compact side by side 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.180
 to store in or store 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.020
 so that with every single villiger 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.579
 can act 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.500
 Winter should not be the right one 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.300
 You could go to trade 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.829
 just this button the villiger will 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.840
 moreover, from the system 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.940
 thrown out and burned 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.010
 or killed the next one 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.510
 villiger will come from the right 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.399
 then automatically fill his space 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.410
 and so you can get the perfect ones 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.120
 look out the village for you 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.129
 I need to act and now I want to 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.840
 show you how to build this system 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.790
 in the first step of the tutorial need 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.960
 Let's take care that the rails 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.270
 are properly laid 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.790
 for that we need as power trails and 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.170
 detector wales is very important here 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.270
 that you have the rails in the right one 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.220
 order is up and off we go in the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.350
 we start here a normal rail 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.810
 a power trail to grow detectors 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.520
 then up here again two seemed here 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.400
 down a track here again one 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.840
 Broadway and a detector the whole 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.119
 we'll do the second here now 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.360
 put a rail one again 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.299
 powered rail a detector rail two 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.700
 here seemed a rail here 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.259
 Broadway and here a detector then 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.360
 Can we see the rails here again 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.340
 removed and can now do it 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.140
 to cultivate the whole 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.810
 we go to the back 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.270
 place here at the height of the powertrain 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.610
 once a row with this switch 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.659
 Activate so that the powertrain 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.460
 is then activated automatically 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.740
 Here we place a row with red 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.990
 sox which in this blog go this 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.460
 We will pass on up here then 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.439
 Here we place a row on it 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.330
 with normal blocks here we place 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.960
 again a website stream on which you 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.030
 now twice invested 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.160
 Let's put a row here 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.490
 solid blocks on it come redstone 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.710
 Repeater we let this in now 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.960
 flow a row with solid blocks 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.060
 Let's just put that on 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.370
 few fans kates which automatically 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.310
 then we should remove this 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.920
 blocks are here now one 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.540
 step forward that we place 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.370
 Here we click a ship here 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.530
 place then we go here one 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.840
 look down here so on 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.550
 this height has an upside down sap 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.620
 which is oriented downwards 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.050
 we pull this one out here 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.270
 along and now really only missing 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.310
 still the iron tractors which we open 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.620
 Place height of power trails 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.040
 we place these aligned below 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.760
 at our our oatmeal and if 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.920
 Now we go up 12 blocks because 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.950
 for this block place these two 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.990
 blocks and can now here below 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.880
 once a row with buttons place 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.830
 Which makes sure that if you have this 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.410
 Button presses the tractor once here 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.570
 is opened and so that my cross 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.160
 the whole thing is of course designed that way 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.680
 if here the willicher in it I sit 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.300
 Try the mainka here for a moment 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.750
 then we finally see place 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.920
 the door 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.290
 in that the whole thing through the 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.210
 detectors is detected then we can 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.550
 press this button that is the door 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.560
 opens out and that drives my kart 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.870
 Now you can do this construction 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.980
 theoretically infinitely wide he continues 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.170
 I have it all now 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.970
 expanded and now we want in the second 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.410
 Step up to make sure that the better 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.630
 come into the system respectively 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.910
 be properly dismissed as last 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.500
 the managers are shown in the main 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.270
 cards fail here if you have this 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.430
 button could either press that then 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.990
 leave directly in the lava or you 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.790
 transports those elsewhere 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.470
 The easiest way to do it is by us 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.630
 Just start a bucket with the back 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.610
 to put water then we place 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.890
 here a sign once again with water 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.930
 and david box by meinhard something bigger 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.030
 is as a blog that will mic has 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.340
 always in the water and therefore always 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.110
 move in the right direction 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.700
 Now I would in this case the 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.080
 Willich once in lava or 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.670
 Do not drop into anything here 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.350
 suddenly too easy here again 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.770
 a sign here a sign and again 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.600
 water 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.060
 and so the village do not land anything 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.560
 and will die 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.570
 we continue in which we then the 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.250
 to introduce more in the system 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.960
 that means we have to do it again 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.000
 drive over here all 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.710
 of course also in line cards and to 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.720
 First and foremost , we'll place it here 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.550
 a series of solid blocks so that 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.710
 Do not water directly into the website 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.150
 Technique is also here you have again 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.070
 the possibility the villiger with water 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.530
 to transport away respectively 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.030
 to make sure that the village with 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.570
 taken from a rail system again 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.950
 become 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.990
 in this case I leave the pictures 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.270
 I'll just die now 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.400
 here again a glass mining 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.290
 Here is a small case, even if we are 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.479
 then we can have disguised whole 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.250
 Place a sign here too 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:01.870
 now it is very important the 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.220
 villinger end system to get it 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.410
 Let's take a solid one here 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.440
 block go to the trek and go 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.419
 here now a block down and 12 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.979
 blocks to the side when we place 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:13.450
 Just two more tractors then 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.240
 we can remove these blocks again 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.729
 place a row here again 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.960
 blocks dress up the whole way and also 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.910
 Here we can take care of it again 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.830
 the water then flows along 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.780
 Here we place a sign again 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.700
 place water again and the whole thing 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.770
 We'll do that until you get here 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.750
 arrived at the front are where our villiger 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.370
 be transported away again 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.990
 in the third and last step this 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.330
 I would like to explain tutorials to you now 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.490
 like the simplest villiger in one 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.200
 First of all I would be able to get kart 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.100
 recommend once a rail to the water 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.720
 to conduct electricity 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.460
 and if you did that you should 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.560
 best not your villiger again 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.460
 far away or here 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.590
 a tree 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.630
 then you take a bucket of water 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.220
 this in the opposite corner to 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.780
 just like me all this 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.460
 did that place here 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.260
 like a bucket of water and you will 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.720
 directly see that all villiger here 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.310
 be pushed forward to this corner 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.229
 Now you can have a garden 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.120
 Placed this simply pushes it in 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.500
 the corner and you see a will directly 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.780
 jotun is pushed in more directly 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.280
 characterized that it were, the greater mic 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.660
 as a blog he grabs this 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.460
 villiger who is pushed into the corner 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.570
 and then this one gets directly into the system 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.370
 introduced 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.380
 now it can happen that the better 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.539
 a bell too far forward falls so 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.220
 not directly the most obvious gap 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:26.229
 Filling out the whole is not bad 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.760
 because the second villiger here 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:29.950
 drives along or the second 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.480
 my god what is driving along here 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.670
 these 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.320
 gap then fill another small one 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.120
 problem that can occur is that 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.140
 villiger hang on this position 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.910
 or 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.620
 that my cards are not in this position 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:42.420
 falls down or not 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.130
 the whole thing is not moving on 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.170
 bad as soon as the next winter 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.910
 comes with my god he will block this 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.100
 push back into the water and so will 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.750
 the system keeps running 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.160
 I have the whole thing down here once 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:55.110
 simulates that you see the better 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.190
 stay put in here and now you can 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.690
 For example , if you press the button 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.760
 you probably do not like it
