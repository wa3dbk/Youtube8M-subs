 sweet recipes 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.300
 Hi everyone 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.279
 tonight we make another recipe 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.460
 let's make banal banal just trivial 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.860
 very simple suitable for all are i 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.440
 stuffed tomatoes 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:27.110
 naturally we will start from the filling up 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.699
 to arrive at the end of the form 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.930
 just completed how it had to do 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.130
 inside full 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.680
 I leave you to the video and see you soon 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.899
 the ingredients that videos are those 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.410
 that I do based on my tastes 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.480
 sons 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.930
 But you can not do anything even 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.130
 others in other ways then we use in 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.520
 this area in this recipe that we go back to 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:53.360
 one small tuna then two slices of tuna 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:58.340
 not thin ham, an anchovy 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:02.260
 mayonnaise in oil a red tour the egg 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.489
 hard and of course tomatoes 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.869
 initially we take ours immediately 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.540
 faithful lobe friend and let's go to drain the 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:14.680
 tuna drained tuna and we send to 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.680
 put in 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.310
 then we put in that I know it again 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:37.720
 hard it will put us let's go and get it 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:43.780
 anchovy vasco dissolve a bit to 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:45.420
 half but inside the ham but 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.400
 let's go and put it this way 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.750
 gross without being so many 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:02:00.340
 problems and threading admit the 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:07.510
 Mayonnaise on never seen we regulate ourselves 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:17.050
 as you go by and on 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:20.830
 to chop everything now let's go to 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.210
 prepare our tomatoes then the 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:28.150
 what we're going to do now is 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:32.040
 take the tomato like this and go to 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.040
 cut off the top 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:41.630
 in this way shortly thereafter that with 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.630
 a teaspoon 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:49.160
 we go inside and we go to 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.160
 remove the top so 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.360
 at this time of use he wanted 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.980
 it has nothing to do with it, even for many 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.000
 the kiwis 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.000
 when I have to open the kiwi 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.860
 let's try not to do too much strength 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:17.019
 because otherwise we go we go to break 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:17.019
 also the tomato you see and at the end 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.080
 the space of being able to put ourselves remains 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.660
 let's do it now from floor to floor 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.000
 even with others so we can 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.920
 then go directly to the piero 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.400
 Now let's put in the full 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:40.000
 tomatoes we see spoon and let's go to 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.000
 fill them 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:55.030
 and let's move on to the others because not not there 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.530
 let's do now that we're done with 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.240
 fill them 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.010
 let us pass to the last phase the children who 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.300
 we run a little to make them a little more 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:07.270
 nice and here is our appetizer 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.220
 ready as you can see you can 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.230
 do even with small things 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.830
 decorations and appetizers very much 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.830

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.379
