00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.320
 an explanation of this game a lot 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:13.210
 very nice we have a little four aces 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.010
 place them in this way on the table e 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.449
 ask the viewer kindly to 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.180
 carmen and one should indicate them 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.430
 that of hearts push that forward 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.510
 of heart in this way you turn it and you do 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.460
 the same thing with the other aces now 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.220
 it was an important part of it when 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.649
 natively another card its axes like 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.360
 you slide three cards in your hand 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.230
 right 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.750
 hold the card in china in break it is so 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.440
 and flip them over the paper over the 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.290
 break so as to take away a card 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.399
 turned in this way but we come to the 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.489
 average from another angle 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.350
 ok let's see the move better then 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.809
 take between cards this way 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.940
 in the meantime , push one 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.420
 keep asking for a separation with 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.050
 pinkie 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.520
 in this way then push three cards 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.280
 so in this way it puts you three 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.670
 cards on the first on the first ace 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.740
 you hold an extra card 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.869
 separated from the deck with the little finger e 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.990
 fold over the other cards so 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.119
 to put them all on the holding card 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.159
 separation so that when 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.510
 go support them apparently from 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.590
 Ace cards are actually four 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.470
 here we are now that they learned me the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.200
 move we are receiving uni trak art either 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.450
 push a last canvas with my e 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.280
 take away four Venetian reality cards 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.710
 four hinges support 3 kick the 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.310
 first ace the same thing is done with the second one 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.119
 ace between cards plus a reassurance 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.850
 tag take it take the group from 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.020
 itself that of separation 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.700
 to have all the cards above 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.979
 so you put separation into reality 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.020
 when I'm here there wo n't be a 4 card 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.540
 but 5 apparently will be 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.799
 four, however, unlike these 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.329
 on the last associated just that 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.720
 chosen or put on the mind between 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.060
 really only 3 this 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.720
 generally 3 and then the gray one 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.930
 it's done 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.210
 because then you say that you will go despair le 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.010
 four aces take the first solo 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.390
 show that of piquet objects 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.150
 all on top of the deck what happens 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.800
 now that when transmitting the 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.720
 apparently challenges the axis one of the 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.420
 three cards having taken an extra card 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.490
 first class will now stay here and here 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.010
 you have any card and then put it 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.010
 half that sees everything in the middle of the deck 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.410
 milazzo will be here now release of 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.800
 paintings or having two cards I leave of 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.910
 straw with under you have read on the 4 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.350
 so you say great to take it on 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.100
 reality paintings is any card 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.130
 half here was put everything in the deck 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.420
 same thing with the ace of flowers ace of 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.600
 flowers in the middle of the three cards 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.220
 heels in the middle at the most now what 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.990
 happens between the three movie boards at 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.330
 maximum reaches the point of the 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.459
 society the spectator towards hearts 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.290
 now before showing yourself outside of you 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.990
 that you have lost three cards 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.459
 what you have to do scroll the deck e 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.019
 dates I take a separation above the 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.590
 the first three cards in short, the axes of the idol 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.430
 scroll closing it sees three cards 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.769
 above the minimum 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.780
 in this way as before then you will have 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.720
 between cards besides if separated by this 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.100
 of the linen deck now shown 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.470
 the ace of hearts and the one chosen with in 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.019
 top of the three cards or jazz point above 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.570
 the deck and to make the boards appear now 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.640
 that are apartments do not kill themselves 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.760
 all you have to do is shoot in this 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.769
 so the group of cards then the three 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.330
 the ace that was on the table builds 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.130
 another guard and more the three cards that 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.230
 they are the axes he had considered before 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.670
 of separation 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.920
 put it all this way and turn 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.700
 obviously masking through sofia 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.970
 14 of paternal blowing are turned 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:58.610
 been four aces have reached the top 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.610
 I hope you enjoyed it thanks hi
