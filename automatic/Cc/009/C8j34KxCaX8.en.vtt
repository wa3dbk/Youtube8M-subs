00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
if there's one um because they haven't

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.550 
if there's one um because they haven't
been<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.460> any<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.790> nests<00:01:36.380> but<00:01:37.380> um

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
been going in any of the nests but um

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.270 
been going in any of the nests but um
I'm<00:01:38.130> really<00:01:38.460> excited<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.180> really<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.720> like<00:01:39.930> it

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
been able to go in it yet because they

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.480 
been able to go in it yet because they
like<00:01:48.570> haven't<00:01:49.049> figured<00:01:49.320> out<00:01:49.439> what<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.799> but

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
like haven't figured out what it is but

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.920 
like haven't figured out what it is but
eventually<00:01:50.759> they<00:01:51.060> will<00:01:51.090> figure<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.689> out<00:01:51.780> and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.020 
eventually they will figure it out and
I'm<00:01:52.020> going<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.170> be<00:01:52.259> excited<00:01:52.530> when<00:01:52.770> they<00:01:52.890> do<00:01:53.030> now

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030

it's just a box and you put it in there

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.900 
it's just a box and you put it in there
you<00:02:46.140> punch<00:02:46.350> a<00:02:46.440> hole<00:02:46.590> through<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.160> they

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
you punch a hole through it and they

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.400 
you punch a hole through it and they
there's<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.270> strain<00:02:48.750> that<00:02:48.780> they<00:02:48.990> use<00:02:49.200> for

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
there's a strain that they use for

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.550 
there's a strain that they use for
nesting<00:02:49.830> and<00:02:49.950> mine<00:02:50.490> actually<00:02:50.700> loved<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.900> they
