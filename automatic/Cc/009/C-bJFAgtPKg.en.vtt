vintage<00:00:08.940> review<00:00:09.510> so<00:00:09.690> this<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.110> stock<00:00:10.380> this

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
vintage review so this is the stock this

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.470 
vintage review so this is the stock this
is<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.950> foregrip<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:11.969> priming

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
is the foregrip this is the priming

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.999 
is the foregrip this is the priming
mechanism<00:00:12.990> as<00:00:13.110> well<00:00:13.230> as<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.559> firing

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
mechanism as well as the firing

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.099 
mechanism as well as the firing
mechanism<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.450> vintage

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
mechanism and this is vintage

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.990 
mechanism and this is vintage
of<00:00:16.170> course<00:00:16.500> only<00:00:16.740> vintage<00:00:17.340> blasters<00:00:17.820> have

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
of course only vintage blasters have

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.720 
of course only vintage blasters have
this<00:00:18.180> kind<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.600> style<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.289> them<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.490> looks

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
this kind of style to them so it looks

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.550 
this kind of style to them so it looks
like<00:00:20.910> we<00:00:21.029> have<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.210> date<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.539> is<00:00:21.720> 2003

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
like we have a date this is 2003

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.710 
like we have a date this is 2003

you<00:00:25.019> could<00:00:25.260> tell<00:00:25.439> kind<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.369> by<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:27.029> logo

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
you could tell kind of that by this logo

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.689 
you could tell kind of that by this logo
here<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.289> not<00:00:28.500> quite<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.920> new<00:00:29.070> nerf<00:00:29.279> logo

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
here this is not quite the new nerf logo

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.820 
here this is not quite the new nerf logo
and<00:00:29.910> at<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.269> same<00:00:30.449> time<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:30.840> not<00:00:31.349> quite<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
and at the same time it's not quite the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.470 
and at the same time it's not quite the
old<00:00:31.859> nerf<00:00:32.250> logo<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:32.880> kind<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.239> weird

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
old nerf logo so it's kind of a weird

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.090 
old nerf logo so it's kind of a weird
period<00:00:33.809> for<00:00:34.140> nerf<00:00:34.260> where<00:00:34.469> they<00:00:34.559> use<00:00:34.710> this<00:00:34.920> logo

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
period for nerf where they use this logo

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.470 
period for nerf where they use this logo
and<00:00:35.340> they<00:00:35.399> did<00:00:35.610> not<00:00:35.730> put<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.149> lot<00:00:36.329> of

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
and they did not put it on a lot of

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.660 
and they did not put it on a lot of
blasters<00:00:36.899> but<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.739> atom<00:00:38.100> blasters

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
blasters but this is the atom blasters

model<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:40.110> cyclotron<00:00:40.649> now<00:00:41.070> it's<00:00:41.219> got<00:00:41.340> a

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
model of the cyclotron now it's got a

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.940 
model of the cyclotron now it's got a
tube<00:00:41.879> clip<00:00:42.239> here<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.600> back<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.770> one

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
tube clip here in the back and this one

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.470 
tube clip here in the back and this one
is<00:00:44.070> not<00:00:44.190> totally<00:00:44.789> full<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.090> think<00:00:45.270> it'll<00:00:45.390> fit

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
is not totally full I think it'll fit

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.770 
is not totally full I think it'll fit
one<00:00:45.750> more<00:00:45.780> but<00:00:46.079> right<00:00:46.260> now<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.820> want<00:00:48.690> to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
one more but right now we have I want to

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.549 
one more but right now we have I want to
say<00:00:48.960> five<00:00:49.530> balls<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.219> our<00:00:50.460> tube<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.559> that

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
say five balls in our tube and that

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.220 
say five balls in our tube and that
should<00:00:53.340> shoulder<00:00:53.640> like<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.449> hope<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.050> can

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
should shoulder like this I hope you can

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.840 
should shoulder like this I hope you can
see<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.739> camera<00:00:56.039> I'll<00:00:56.219> try<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.550> hold<00:00:56.670> it

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
see that on camera I'll try and hold it

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.880 
see that on camera I'll try and hold it
out<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.329> little<00:00:57.360> bit<00:00:57.570> more<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.020> anyway<00:00:58.710> as

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
out just a little bit more and anyway as

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.979 
out just a little bit more and anyway as
you<00:00:59.039> rotate<00:00:59.520> through<00:00:59.789> this<00:01:00.120> there's<00:01:00.870> a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
you rotate through this there's a

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.990 
you rotate through this there's a
flapper<00:01:01.530> mechanism<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.309> here<00:01:02.460> which<00:01:02.609> grabs

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
flapper mechanism in here which grabs

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.509 
flapper mechanism in here which grabs
the<00:01:03.239> ball<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.660> thrusts<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.650> forward<00:01:05.100> which<00:01:05.489> is

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the ball and thrusts it forward which is

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.310 
the ball and thrusts it forward which is
really<00:01:06.060> neat<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.510> I'm<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.780> try<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.229> do

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
really neat so I'm going to try and do

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.310 
really neat so I'm going to try and do
it<00:01:07.470> from<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.770> angle<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:09.020> tricky<00:01:10.020> for<00:01:10.229> me

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
it from this angle and tricky for me

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.670 
it from this angle and tricky for me
because<00:01:10.530> I'm<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> righty<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:12.229> you<00:01:13.229> can<00:01:13.439> see

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
because I'm a righty but you can see

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.859 
because I'm a righty but you can see
that<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.159> getting<00:01:14.369> some<00:01:15.060> very<00:01:15.270> respectable

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
that it's getting some very respectable

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.620 
that it's getting some very respectable
ranges<00:01:16.320> that<00:01:16.500> ball<00:01:16.650> probably<00:01:17.220> went<00:01:17.400> 25<00:01:17.909> 27

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
ranges that ball probably went 25 27

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.850 
ranges that ball probably went 25 27
feet<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.310> you<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.580> fire<00:01:20.850> them<00:01:21.119> pretty<00:01:21.420> fast

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
feet and you can fire them pretty fast

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.140 
feet and you can fire them pretty fast
which<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.280> really<00:01:23.610> really<00:01:23.759> neat<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
which is just really really neat the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.149 
which is just really really neat the
clip<00:01:24.360> obviously<00:01:24.840> comes<00:01:25.080> out<00:01:25.229> like<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.619> it's

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
clip obviously comes out like this it's

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.700 
clip obviously comes out like this it's
sort<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.670> spring<00:01:27.330> fed<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.840> also<00:01:28.140> assisted<00:01:28.590> by

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
sort of spring fed it's also assisted by

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.170 
sort of spring fed it's also assisted by
gravity<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.369> just<00:01:29.520> fill<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.880> with<00:01:30.000> your

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
gravity and you just fill it with your

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.499 
gravity and you just fill it with your
balls<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.750> throw<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.890> back<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.939> like<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.479> and

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
balls and throw it back in like so and

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.319 
balls and throw it back in like so and
keep<00:01:34.229> going<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:35.159> just<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.640> really<00:01:36.119> cool

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
keep going it's just a really cool

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.450 
keep going it's just a really cool
blaster<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.170> uses<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.860> rather<00:01:38.250> unique

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
blaster and uses a rather unique

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.359 
blaster and uses a rather unique
mechanism<00:01:39.180> not<00:01:39.570> quite<00:01:39.869> flywheel<00:01:40.409> technology

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
mechanism not quite flywheel technology

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.880 
mechanism not quite flywheel technology
like<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.700> ripsaw<00:01:42.090> more<00:01:42.540> similar<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
like the ripsaw more similar to the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.190 
like the ripsaw more similar to the
vortex<00:01:44.189> style<00:01:44.670> blasters<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.240> guess<00:01:45.450> because<00:01:45.960> it

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
vortex style blasters I guess because it

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.219 
vortex style blasters I guess because it
is<00:01:46.320> using<00:01:46.740> some<00:01:47.310> potential<00:01:48.149> spring<00:01:48.509> energy<00:01:48.720> to

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
is using some potential spring energy to
