doesn't work properly but most of them
do<00:04:49.310> work<00:04:49.520> I've<00:04:49.940> tested<00:04:50.450> a<00:04:50.540> lot<00:04:50.570> of<00:04:50.720> them<00:04:50.960> that

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.690 
they do work
I<00:04:51.890> think<00:04:52.370> this<00:04:52.490> method<00:04:52.669> is<00:04:52.940> way<00:04:53.419> better<00:04:53.720> than

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
I think this method is way better than

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.510 
I think this method is way better than
any<00:04:55.700> other<00:04:55.970> IP<00:04:56.630> TV<00:04:57.100> alright<00:04:58.100> so<00:04:58.310> you<00:04:58.370> can<00:04:58.430> see

any other IP TV alright so you can see

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.440 
any other IP TV alright so you can see
that<00:04:58.760> it<00:04:58.880> does<00:04:59.030> work<00:04:59.270> it's<00:04:59.810> much<00:05:00.050> faster<00:05:00.370> so

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
that it does work it's much faster so
