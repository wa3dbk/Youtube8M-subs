00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.790
 so hey people and welcome to one 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.800
 new video thank the insertions 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.599
 my name is powerful and show today 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.240
 I'll tell you something new with that 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.430
 winter patch 4 was there namely 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.320
 something was changed what 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.630
 was improved and what exactly 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.609
 means I show you now we catch 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.619
 but just with the biggest one or 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.599
 at least with the apparently am 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.849
 most important for dice and indeed were 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.009
 made improvements to the netcode 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.719
 that means improved updates on 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.390
 long distances through the introduction 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.730
 a cone in which the high frequency 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.739
 update sent and received 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.690
 In addition, it will now be 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.360
 receive and send damage from 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.879
 prioritizes opponents that means it is 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.230
 just probably faster there or 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.780
 At least that's the probability 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.640
 higher that it is more reliable than first 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.480
 information arrives with you so that he 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.469
 just do not suffer this one hit death 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.359
 I have tested it all already 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.070
 myself I have just under an hour long 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.320
 played and it actually came to me 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.390
 as if that were just a bit 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.189
 faster or responds 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.560
 just a bit crispier I have that 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.600
 not only feeling about netcode but also 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.430
 At the war match function was continued 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.650
 so worked new players with one 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.540
 Rank 10 or lower now 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.220
 put them into their own servers so they can 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.869
 not looking directly against the hardcore 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.520
 have to play this and sometimes the 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.840
 time actually got neat 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.580
 einzuspielen 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.409
 There are also a few changes to it 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.270
 the servers that are really found 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.250
 that does not mean just server with that 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.280
 official presets are found now 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.659
 but also with the 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.189
 razer these are two different things 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.750
 that has nothing to do with it, whether in the server 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.689
 really official but definitely 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.100
 you can now find more servers 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.799
 saying new there is also a new one 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.630
 game mode and that's scott operation 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.430
 or squad destruction to german 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.470
 this is about a fast 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.390
 infantry based mode in which the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.920
 Objectives are very important 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.649
 actually as well as normal 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.659
 Operation mode The mode is also accurate 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.579
 on the normal so original 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.070
 Operation mode was based but 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.689
 adapted to that one just less 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.690
 Player has actually played 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.879
 Here's a five to five match special 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.040
 peculiarities of the mode are that there is no 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.689
 there are vehicles 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.760
 of sports in the air so with the 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:19.159
 parachute beside and besides you can 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.230
 not just as usual on a basis 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.819
 but on two different the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.750
 hold also slightly different 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.519
 are positioned 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.019
 you probably want to prevent that 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.209
 this is somehow trapping to spawn 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.180
 or what else does the team come up with first? 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.040
 destroyed two out of three bases wins 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.900
 the round and very important the player 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.819
 The bomb does not become permanent 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.340
 displayed but the player will only 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.799
 displayed as a bomb carrier if he too 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.959
 is spotted who does not know that man 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.549
 somehow shoot over an object and 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.319
 Nevertheless, the ball hangs particularly tight 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.480
 but that also happens on stones 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.549
 others are actually looking at those 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.470
 nothing should be in the way and there is 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:57.530
 Now many many put that through the 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.409
 cd or controlled by a community 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.310
 project in the ce rome and that became 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.409
 I call it deployment 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.900
 of course there are more 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:08.269
 Changes to the squad sports 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.250
 the basic idea is that one so 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.439
 can no longer spawn in someone of 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.209
 but in his spot he is at the same time 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.530
 That means if he is in a fight 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.299
 just shot or 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.430
 is suppressed and thus you can 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.769
 not so easy spawn and spawn with him 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.780
 I think that should be really good 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.940
 you definitely die less so 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.769
 unnecessary deaths die for how often 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.629
 happens because you bond something 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.519
 and directly dismantled or how often 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.319
 it already happened that you have someone 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.359
 shoots and the board somebody else and 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.560
 This will make you red in the end 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.370
 because he through the spawn protection 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.680
 is protected 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.569
 on the subject of fighting fits the following and 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.190
 Although the magic bags were again 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.709
 that means when you're in the fight 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.159
 it also does not work the sanitas 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:48.769
 more 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.569
 that was already as far as I was before 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.220
 So in Battlefield 4, that's white 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.930
 nothing new but that 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.030
 behavior of the bags was again so 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.099
 a bit overworked and adapted 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.989
 the little first aid packet 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.479
 So they work differently now 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.340
 that is, during the big ones 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:06.620
 already be deactivated once you 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.209
 is suppressed the work 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.139
 Small still so long to get one 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.669
 takes damage 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.019
 that means you just have it 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.549
 different purposes and 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.709
 I would say different advantages 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.120
 I'm curious if this is something 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.919
 it will change how many people 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.709
 actually to the big or the 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.419
 small medic bag grab for all 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.700
 headset player or general audio 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.180
 junkies, there is something new and that 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.830
 has been 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.810
 the sound of foot steps improved 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.289
 so that they are easier to perceive 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.539
 should 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.370
 for example, there was a mistake in the 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.289
 the grenade as soon as she went up 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.600
 the sound of foot steps beside 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.699
 has issued and that should not be more 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.009
 but it can also happen 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.479
 that the hitters here are not video 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.310
 always the same color and that 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.509
 is one of the new features that is 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.150
 if I hit my head now 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:51.770
 the hit maker turns red with me and if 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.330
 I will then do the opponents 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.370
 he blue that means I have three 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.410
 different colors white red and blue 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.490
 So I just know what's going on 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.990
 just helps me a bit 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.039
 to react faster and better 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.720
 to get feedback 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.060
 that's also true with the colors 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.710
 on and on with the vehicles 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.180
 there you can do that just because 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.490
 if you do not bother anymore 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.889
 yellow in the t90 then you can then synonymous 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.080
 just change the vehicle hd color 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.550
 The whole has many options you can 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.680
 can really set a lot even the 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.130
 shine effect or else was down there 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.630
 rotate 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.979
 that is simply playing around times so 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.630
 here in the video you can see it too 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.889
 I just tried it and me 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.180
 think it's really great in green 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.840
 and that's why I have it so first 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.180
 calmly 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.130
 Last but not least we have the 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.199
 hegel physics which was revised there 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.490
 really a lot has been done that is 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:36.470
 heli pilots will be then 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:39.800
 probably very happy about it 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.210
 cool maneuvers like no idea roll or 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.639
 So a backflip is now 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.260
 easily possible the whole should be up 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:48.159
 In any case, help the enemy 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.300
 dodge or not by means of a team 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:52.010
 I do not want to dodge you in any case 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.380
 but we are only now at the end of 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.610
 video the complete patch and changelog 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.110
 you can also find that in the description 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.300
 linked because there are still a few 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.280
 But they are more for me now 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.810
 not so interesting to read 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.409
 as I said there is also in the 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.849
 description 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:06.409
 otherwise I will go first 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.060
 Let's say that we are there to the end 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:11.889
 that means thank you very much 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.889
 watch and see you next time
