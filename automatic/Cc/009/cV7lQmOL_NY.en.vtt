00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:15.659
 Yes I do and the video of how to make a supplement edited by I web camera is this time I these things 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:19.789
 What kind of equipment do you use? Recently I used in the 2012 2013 version 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:19.789
 I would like to introduce you 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:28.830
 This is a microphone of this PC This is Sony's Electro a Lectore Condenser 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:32.410
 It is said to be a microphone 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.640
 Mike Turn salt It is connected to the PC 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.910
 Type that contains voice 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.770
 It is a type called pcv 80 u to the ec 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:47.010
 Sound is 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:49.890
 It is actually very important than the image . Does the clear audio enter or not enter? 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.810
 Network on whether hear not hear 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.360
 Who is looking 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:59.170
 Yeah I because the concentration is determined 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:03.760
 Please note the sound than this image 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:07.950
 This Sony microphone is about the low price of 5,000 yen, right? 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:12.200
 You get pretty good sound quality 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.200
 Mike one of the recommended 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:21.860
 It is when using a web camera x split 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.440
 If you can yes I think this is a webcam for division 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.960
 logicool hd pro webcam 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:32.820
 You may also have come also do it or Ne Well new people say that there is 9 people, but this is very 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.970
 High resolution and range 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:43.020
 We become very good thing clear 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:48.400
 In the meantime, I have a microphone attached to the camera, but I hoped to introduce it if I could 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:51.970
 I think it would be better to have a separate microphone prepared separately 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:56.520
 It's this Rojeku Lecco pro display 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.730
 You can set it to keep it hanging 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.390
 Put on a tripod 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:06.370
 As it is also possible to show it is by standing 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.370
 It is a valid camera 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.420
 Shooting techniques This is not using a camera or using an ipad iphone 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.220
 If 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.450
 Follow 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.790
 It is a technique aspect of photography 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:27.530
 First camera Let's take them securely 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:32.269
 I think the good is that if possible also to not, such as a tripod 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:37.440
 In the angle, I would like to put the camera in a higher position than life 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:42.840
 It's like looking at your tongue, such as looking into from above Looking At Camera too much 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.620
 Fix the camera with an image that looks like you are looking straight when you are not good 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.850
 Let's go 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:52.520
 Prepare a microphone with 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:54.910
 And one more thing, when I take that face, I already have enough brightness to make it as bright as possible 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.660
 By the way let's take 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:03.900
 It would be nice to have some lighting equipment, but it 's not good. 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:07.180
 Light Please make sure to take while securing the light . 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:12.880
 Two people if you can 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:20.380
 One person was taken with a camera and written as a can, but with cheat sheet 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:21.840
 Write something to talk and bring in front of the camera in front of the shot, and then I will go back there 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.950
 If you look at it 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.660
 I think it would be good to be done by two people like that if you do alone 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.090
 There is no 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.090
 I think and hope I am doing as long as two people 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:41.020
 bgm 8 bags 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:45.630
 Background music Music is light and flowing more than 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.630
 Sometimes you can put out the atmosphere 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:56.460
 In the case of commercial use, there is also a sound source to purchase like this 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:00.030
 Once you buy these things and choose to buy them 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:03.330
 I think that I can use it well and listen 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.400
 It is also more of Atoano site 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.430
 Free and usable sound mail 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.140
 Url is written 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:18.000
 That's free case, sound source is positive 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:21.209
 It is necessary to specify the copyright, and there are cases like that . 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.070
 Keep your promise and use it 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:30.230
 If you are a Mac user Make music with garageband and use it 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:35.620
 I think it seems no problem Madokaya on youtube 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.620
 I think whether you want to create garageband 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.750
 PC software 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:51.390
 The benefit of our customers, we have to introduce It is a split hand software which it is large that 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.760
 Live for use with windows PC 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:58.100
 web's 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:59.750
 It is a mechanism, but instead of delivering to ustream, it records in the personal computer and 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.380
 That the use 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:07.860

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:11.080
 In and I guess that Mac people with the Mac camera it from using the imob 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:15.849

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:19.540
 There is that people You're windows movie maker of windows 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:23.800
 It is a free editing software 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:25.400
 So how is the wind zoom princess here? 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:31.430
 Maa 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:33.560
 And trimming is to say I easily and simply go to Edit 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:38.780
 If you shorten the scale 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.230
 It is a useless effect, I think that it is better to use such things 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.800
 Yes 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:47.440
 Exercise as much as possible 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:51.160
 Please focus on that say so when the scale happens that does not 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:57.670
 It's kinda nice adobe premiere braces elements 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:06:04.870

 think 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:22.460
 In has this ipad recommend as long as the start of the video it is yet to come 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:25.760
 Especially if ipad right you can carry it with one hand 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:30.560
 There is no problem if data is put in the cloud 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:33.650
 The price is now without tax, though 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.780
 32,800 yen with 16 giga 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:40.810
 Tripod then stand 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:44.009
 Well go to go to be in a meeting of the I mean this Tsu stand 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:47.280
 It is an opportunity to attach it to a tripod 

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:53.250
 It sells cheaply even in that Amazon 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:55.460
 There is a microphone at iphone ipad compatible microphone so it is 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:07:00.530
 I think you should use it 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:03.919
 Hey imob's app This is another editing software that you will need 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.800

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:13.940
 I I've been iphone ipad-to-ipod touch Te 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:17.460
 The camera is attached and weird similarly

 You can shoot and edit 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:25.249
 If you are going to start the video 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:30.039
 I think it would be nice if you use this ipad right 

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:30.039
 You can also shoot with beautiful quality
