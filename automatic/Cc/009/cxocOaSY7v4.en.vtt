00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
there's not too much energy at the end

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.460 
there's not too much energy at the end
so<00:02:50.060> instead<00:02:50.330> of<00:02:50.390> over<00:02:50.870> leading<00:02:51.260> this<00:02:51.410> and

hand which our shoulder I move away
again<00:03:09.520> actually<00:03:10.520> we<00:03:10.610> did<00:03:10.760> earlier<00:03:11.090> from<00:03:11.810> here

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
again actually we did earlier from here

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.390 
again actually we did earlier from here
we<00:03:12.050> get<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.260> same<00:03:12.470> shoulder<00:03:12.950> bolt<00:03:13.130> type

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
we get the same shoulder bolt type

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.830 
we get the same shoulder bolt type
action<00:03:13.850> but<00:03:13.970> I<00:03:14.030> didn't<00:03:14.300> take<00:03:14.450> it<00:03:14.570> to<00:03:14.690> my

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
action but I didn't take it to my

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.170 
action but I didn't take it to my
shoulder<00:03:15.320> I<00:03:15.380> turned<00:03:15.620> into<00:03:15.770> a<00:03:15.950> strip<00:03:16.310> if<00:03:17.000> she's

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
shoulder I turned into a strip if she's

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.699 
shoulder I turned into a strip if she's
going<00:03:17.330> to<00:03:17.390> go<00:03:17.450> into<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.840> rock<00:03:18.080> and<00:03:18.260> go<00:03:18.440> here

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
going to go into a rock and go here

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.820

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
again this is a tricky guys does this

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.010 
again this is a tricky guys does this
rocket<00:03:22.280> go<00:03:22.489> make<00:03:23.209> sure<00:03:23.390> that<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:23.540> don't<00:03:23.660> pull

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.050 
rocket go make sure that I don't pull
her<00:03:24.140> down<00:03:24.170> the<00:03:24.470> slot<00:03:24.739> she's<00:03:25.400> gonna<00:03:25.550> do<00:03:25.730> a<00:03:25.760> rock

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
going out when I take one down

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.410 
going out when I take one down
trap<00:03:29.510> go<00:03:30.319> across<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.980> underneath<00:03:31.519> and<00:03:32.269> give

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
trap go across and underneath and give

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.119 
trap go across and underneath and give
her<00:03:32.540> an<00:03:32.659> inside

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
her an inside

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.259 
her an inside
so<00:03:36.129> we<00:03:36.250> don't<00:03:36.340> have<00:03:36.519> some<00:03:36.790> of<00:03:36.819> these<00:03:37.000> patterns

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
so we don't have some of these patterns

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.520 
so we don't have some of these patterns
