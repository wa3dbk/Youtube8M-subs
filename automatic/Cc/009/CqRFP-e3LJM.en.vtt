00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:08.680
 Huron script 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.950
 today we will sort out the cogs and 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.690
 bolt new and step french mx 31 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.849
 sell and what is better or worse 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.710
 its German rival minimum 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.890
 dry quietly we will tell you about combat 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.890
 advantages and disadvantages of mx a 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.890
 let's get started 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.200
 let's start by tradition with virtues plus 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.510
 number one cannon 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.730
 cannon our thirty has a magnificent 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.160
 able to penetrate 260 millimeters of armor 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.379
 adversary or unconventional ally 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.690
 and good accuracy allows you to mock 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.030
 over the opponent's weak points and put 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.570
 average 390 damage each 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.519
 shot 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.170
 This is a very significant plus of this tank 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.620
 would need to mess around a lot of gold 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.690
 to break through dozens 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.159
 plus number two mobility engine here 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.250
 also did not disappoint the twelve-cylinder 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.649
 diesel opposit 720 horsepower 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.839
 knows his work moves 32 ton 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.270
 car quite cheerfully change flank 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.280
 doing heart-rending affairs we shoot out 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.350
 bushes dramatically change flank for 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.750
 support team at the end decide the outcome 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.060
 combat twisting agile strands and fr 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.530
 sa it all works out for our tank 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.810
 pretty easy plus number 3 hd model 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.640
 small little plus but still on 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.280
 the tank is nice to look at looking at 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.649
 various tracks mounting and of course 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.009
 muzzle barrel dragon lovers so 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:35.049
 generally plus 20 kilos on the tank 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.540
 fly in the ointment is now minus the number one 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.490
 skill dependence this tank is not the first 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.890
 branches not even 2 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.259
 he is for experienced players who ideally 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.600
 know the cards while reloading enemies 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.820
 the moment when you can and need to slip on 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.369
 vantage point why ask you a 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.340
 then that our armor stands relief 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.000
 terrain building bushes but not 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.649
 our 80 millimeters in the forehead 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.200
 minus number 2 dimensions 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.719
 the second minus I highlighted the size of the tank in 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.759
 Generally, as the top of this branch is our tank 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:09.399
 quite big and again it's a turret 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.650
 commander which is on amx 30 b 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:16.840
 I didn't like her right away 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.740
 plainly from the shelters themselves minus died 3 m 4 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.220
 degrees down 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.560
 and the kind and disappointment is the most annoying 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.630
 that our Frenchman has tower armor 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.580
 we have a big gun mask but 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.710
 such uwaine just does not allow us 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.090
 to tank the towers from various tubercles 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.040
 cover the mound and everything like that is all 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.530
 the main advantages and disadvantages that I 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.630
 highlighted it mx thirty first prototype 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.300
 I want to say that the tanks of this class 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.190
 not about armor and 80 millimeters of steel on 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.010
 forehead the french need only to 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.840
 aerodynamics and regard and and i don't see 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.850
 sense is all i wanted to tell 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.620
