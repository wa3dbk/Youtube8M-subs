00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.450 
what it looks like once they run okay as
you<00:03:26.930> can<00:03:26.960> see<00:03:27.080> I<00:03:27.230> got<00:03:27.440> this<00:03:27.620> speaker<00:03:28.070> wire<00:03:28.220> ran

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
you can see I got this speaker wire ran

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.730 
you can see I got this speaker wire ran
so<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:28.760> actually<00:03:28.970> ran<00:03:29.390> this<00:03:29.630> one<00:03:29.870> I<00:03:30.140> popped<00:03:30.620> out

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
so I actually ran this one I popped out

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.520 
so I actually ran this one I popped out
the<00:03:30.980> top<00:03:31.520> liner<00:03:31.790> here<00:03:32.000> ran<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.510> wire<00:03:32.690> around

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
the top liner here ran the wire around

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.160 
the top liner here ran the wire around
behind<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:35.090> then<00:03:35.180> it<00:03:35.270> comes<00:03:35.480> out<00:03:35.600> right<00:03:35.870> here

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
behind and then it comes out right here

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.930 
behind and then it comes out right here
under<00:03:36.740> the<00:03:36.890> snap<00:03:37.100> so<00:03:37.340> it's<00:03:37.460> not<00:03:37.580> gonna<00:03:37.670> fall

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
under the snap so it's not gonna fall

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.600 
under the snap so it's not gonna fall
out<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.330> then<00:03:39.020> they<00:03:39.830> both<00:03:40.040> come<00:03:40.250> down<00:03:40.400> here

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
out and then they both come down here

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.150 
out and then they both come down here
now<00:03:40.820> I<00:03:41.150> did<00:03:41.360> the<00:03:41.660> loop<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.560> cable<00:03:42.950> down

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
now I did the loop the cable down

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.150 
now I did the loop the cable down
between<00:03:43.880> this<00:03:44.300> piece<00:03:44.740> there's<00:03:45.740> about<00:03:45.890> an<00:03:46.010> inch

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
between this piece there's about an inch

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.830 
between this piece there's about an inch
of<00:03:46.310> a<00:03:46.430> loop<00:03:46.610> before<00:03:46.940> it<00:03:47.120> comes<00:03:47.270> back<00:03:47.420> up<00:03:47.480> so

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
of a loop before it comes back up so

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.530 
of a loop before it comes back up so
when<00:03:47.990> I<00:03:48.020> stick<00:03:48.800> this<00:03:49.430> plastic<00:03:50.150> piece<00:03:50.300> of<00:03:50.450> my

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540

skirt<00:03:50.810> in<00:03:51.080> it's<00:03:51.709> gonna<00:03:51.830> have<00:03:52.070> room<00:03:52.550> so<00:03:52.820> that

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
skirt in it's gonna have room so that

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.880 
skirt in it's gonna have room so that
cable<00:03:53.270> can<00:03:53.360> go<00:03:53.480> up<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:53.959> then<00:03:54.230> down<00:03:54.440> behind<00:03:54.650> the

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
cable can go up and then down behind the

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.590 
cable can go up and then down behind the
skirt<00:03:55.130> so<00:03:55.850> now<00:03:55.940> I'm<00:03:56.000> going<00:03:56.120> to<00:03:56.180> go<00:03:56.300> ahead<00:03:56.450> and
