00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
we're going to do is on all these marked

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.090 
we're going to do is on all these marked
pegs<00:00:11.969> we're<00:00:12.870> going<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.320> reach<00:00:13.590> behind<00:00:14.240> and<00:00:16.100> and

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
pegs we're going to reach behind and and

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.250 
pegs we're going to reach behind and and
let<00:00:17.310> me<00:00:17.430> get<00:00:17.610> this<00:00:17.789> just<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.180> little<00:00:18.420> closer<00:00:18.780> so

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
let me get this just a little closer so

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.169 
let me get this just a little closer so
you<00:00:19.289> can<00:00:19.470> see<00:00:20.510> you're<00:00:21.510> going<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:22.910> pick<00:00:23.910> the

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:24.179 
you can see you're going to pick the

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:29.810 
you can see you're going to pick the
second<00:00:24.840> strand<00:00:25.849> of<00:00:26.849> yarn<00:00:27.240> up<00:00:27.769> hi<00:00:28.769> Dan<00:00:29.160> each<00:00:29.339> peg

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
second strand of yarn up hi Dan each peg

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.040 
second strand of yarn up hi Dan each peg
and<00:00:30.240> pull<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.900> over<00:00:31.220> to<00:00:32.220> where<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.490> sits<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
and pull it over to where it sits on the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.420 
and pull it over to where it sits on the
top<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.970> existing<00:00:36.480> loop<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.190> that's

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
top of the existing loop and so that's

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.700 
top of the existing loop and so that's
what<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.730> looked<00:00:39.090> like<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:40.820> that's<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.989> first

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
what it looked like so that's the first

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.100 
what it looked like so that's the first
one<00:00:44.039> that<00:00:44.899> I<00:00:45.899> just<00:00:46.020> did<00:00:46.320> that's<00:00:46.949> some<00:00:47.190> Pig<00:00:47.489> -

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
loop or stitch okay now when I finished

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.069

I'm<00:01:30.150> going<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.540> push<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.079> down<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.470> little<00:01:31.650> bit

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
I'm going to push this down a little bit

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
you can see we now have the loom it's

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.940 
you can see we now have the loom it's
two<00:01:41.430> loops<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:42.119> all<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.750> mark<00:01:43.020> pigs<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.710> one

two loops on all the mark pigs in one
loop<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.729> unmarked<00:01:45.360> ones<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.969> this<00:01:47.969> will

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
loop on the unmarked ones and this will

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.600 
loop on the unmarked ones and this will
be<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.780> increased<00:01:49.439> rows<00:01:49.770> bring<00:01:50.159> your<00:01:50.310> working

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
in place go ahead and knit peg one and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.959 
in place go ahead and knit peg one and
this<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.130> where<00:02:05.369> we<00:02:05.579> do<00:02:05.939> our

there's<00:02:29.870> the<00:02:30.230> knit<00:02:30.439> stitch<00:02:31.750> now<00:02:32.750> we<00:02:33.290> have<00:02:33.799> to

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
there's the knit stitch now we have to

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.509 
there's the knit stitch now we have to
reach<00:02:34.250> back<00:02:34.640> under<00:02:35.329> here<00:02:35.540> again<00:02:36.079> let<00:02:37.069> me<00:02:37.099> bring

it in closer also once again pick the
second<00:02:41.569> loop<00:02:41.780> up<00:02:42.310> bring<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:43.340> over<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:46.060> wrap

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
second loop up bring it over and wrap

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.099 
second loop up bring it over and wrap
the<00:02:47.540> yarn<00:02:47.569> back<00:02:48.349> around<00:02:48.739> to<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.370> front<00:02:50.109> yes

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
the yarn back around to the front yes

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:55.440 
the yarn back around to the front yes
that's<00:02:51.650> in<00:02:51.889> a<00:02:51.980> counterclockwise<00:02:52.370> position

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.379 

and<00:02:56.450> get<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:57.170> over<00:02:57.700> now<00:02:58.700> if<00:02:58.909> you're<00:02:59.120> working

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389 
and get that over now if you're working

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.929 
and get that over now if you're working
in<00:02:59.750> the<00:02:59.810> other<00:03:00.200> direction<00:03:00.590> in<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.639> clockwise

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
in the other direction in a clockwise

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.420 
in the other direction in a clockwise
direction<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:03.620> will<00:03:03.769> reverse<00:03:04.189> your

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
direction you will reverse your

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.679 
direction you will reverse your
directions<00:03:05.209> but<00:03:05.540> I'm<00:03:06.319> working<00:03:06.859> in<00:03:07.069> a

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:07.689 
directions but I'm working in a

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.539 
directions but I'm working in a
counterclockwise<00:03:08.689> direction<00:03:09.159> on<00:03:10.159> the<00:03:10.310> loom

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
counterclockwise direction on the loom

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.240 
counterclockwise direction on the loom
and<00:03:10.849> that's<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.930> perspective<00:03:12.590> I'm<00:03:12.769> coming

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
and that's the perspective I'm coming

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.809 
and that's the perspective I'm coming
from<00:03:13.549> okay<00:03:13.879> so<00:03:14.840> now<00:03:15.290> we<00:03:15.349> have<00:03:15.829> two<00:03:16.189> loops<00:03:16.549> on

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
from okay so now we have two loops on

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.030 
from okay so now we have two loops on
Pig<00:03:17.209> one<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.170> two<00:03:18.349> loops<00:03:18.650> on<00:03:18.889> pig<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:20.739> knit<00:03:21.739> the

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
Pig one and two loops on pig to knit the
