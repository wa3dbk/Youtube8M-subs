00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.469
 per m2 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.279
 soon 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.349
 of course 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.349
 first 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.869
 m 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.410
 Mr. N 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.510
 borisov 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.950
 what should know is 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.500
 bad that this is a personal trainer 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.670
 to achieve goals if we want 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.990
 get a haircut then we hire someone 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.560
 correctly understand hairdressers if we 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.270
 urgent need to get to another 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.830
 end of town 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.740
 and we do not have a car for another what we do 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.000
 we hire a taxi driver to get ahead of us 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.780
 if we want to teach swimming 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.830
 In addition, we hire a passing instructor 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.280
 swimming and if we want to achieve goals 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.450
 or we have a dream we want 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.579
 to embody someone specialist 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:07.700
 who can apply 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.940
 shown for this specialists and 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.080
 care is very clear that with all this we 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.890
 can contact our friends they 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.670
 almost a year they have a reason they float on 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.610
 accounting they by the way will support achievements 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.730
 goals too but the cake to do it 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.850
 professionally 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.380
 when the first person went to pay he took 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.590
 with yourself as her 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.170
 hunted down yes and do not tolerate 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.290
 in this moment 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.890
 we have concentrated all our efforts and 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.940
 direct to what accumulated reached 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.500
 goals 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.660
 he does the same bumps 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.290
 man is that all his efforts 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.300
 concentrating and direct on 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.410
 achieving military goals but that's what 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.270
 interesting 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.929
 area is not carry therapists 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.759
 the mission of the fund nor the consultant more precisely 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:51.860
 advise 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.120
 not whether it is and does not solve problems 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.390
 then I wonder how it helps you 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.510
 achieve goals as he died from zhekov 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.240
