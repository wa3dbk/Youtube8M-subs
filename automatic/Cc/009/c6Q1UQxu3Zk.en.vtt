00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.860
 Obesity is one of the epidemics for 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.679
 the 21st century 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.180
 the patient who suffers from obesity 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.910
 first you have to know is that it is 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.090
 a chronic disease and in many cases 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.419
 is going to be so serious that it will cause 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.630
 a shortening in their quality of life and 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.640
 in the duration of his life the obesity in 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.040
 teknon medical center we are treating 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.670
 in different ways and us inside 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.350
 of the digestive endoscopy service 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.379
 We are using two methods 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:46.040
 mainly what is the treatment with 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.800
 intragastric balloon and surgery by 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.150
 natural holes that would be called pose 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.760
 which is a reduction of the stomach 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.010
 by placing a few bites 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.530
 in the stomach that are going to make the 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.920
 we reduce it without needing to 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.040
 open the stomach this is done to 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.399
 through a transport that is this 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.950
 apparatus by which we will place the 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.799
 endoscope that is this other device more 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.490
 small that we will pass it through 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.490
 this 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.890
 we can enter it and we can 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.680
 work inside the stomach to four 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.140
 hands or we will be two doctors 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.259
 working and we can go placing him 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.600
 points to the patient to reduce the 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.990
 stomach 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.570
 what do we look for a patient 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.390
 obese obese a patient what 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.270
 we are offering is a treatment 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.240
 multidisciplinary team to modify 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.280
 eating habits 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.070
 the only viable solution is that the 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.759
 patient learn to be happy eating 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.920
 least for that we're going to introduce 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.649
 several systems the system that we have 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.600
 started is talking about the ball 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.899
 intragastric the intragastric balloon is 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.420
 a prosthesis in the shape of a round ball 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.500
 that we put it deflated inside the 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.690
 stomach and once inside you 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.540
 we introduce a serum until getting 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.440
 a measure between 600 800 centimeters 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.090
 cubic this is going to be a treatment 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.390
 restrictive or the patient who has 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.150
 a stomach capacity of 1500 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.000
 cubic centimeters if we put 700 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.280
 cubic centimeters then he will have a 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.440
 thereafter capacity 800 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.040
 with which you will eat less if you eat 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.420
 less 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.819
 this system serves to help change 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.010
 the habit but undoubtedly once 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.620
 we remove the ball the patient can 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.829
 think it will go back to eating as 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.260
 formerly that is true except that the 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:58.799
 patient we have modified his habit 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.239
 and I can be happy again 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.049
 less quantity that is what we are 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:06.540
 looking when we think the ball or 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.030
 the patient wants a system more 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.220
 long time in the longer term what 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.829
 we are doing is reducing it the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.400
 stomach with the system as the system 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:21.960
 has as we have said it is going to be 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:25.190
 through these holes we will pass 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.250
 some points that 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:32.360
 we will be placing and sewing with this 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.490
 system see you will see it well and 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.370
 we passed the points and it's as if we were 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.160
 placing some hard to reduce 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.760
 the volume of the stomach is also a 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.430
 restrictive restrictive technique that 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.460
 say that of the volume size that 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.100
 has the stomach through this 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:55.970
 technology we are going to reduce capacity 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.370
 of the same or in all cases what 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.910
 what we are looking for is a modification 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:06.490
 of the patient's eating habit if 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:09.700
 the patient learns to eat less 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.770
 you will lose weight will be much happier 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.240
 you will find much better and you will have a 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.580
 higher quality of life with greater 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.870
 possibility of living more years 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.810
 undoubtedly the obese patient is a 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.660
 patient who has much more risk 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.550
 cardiac complications with your 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.630
 self-esteem with pain in 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.850
 joints 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.280
 for all of you already known with 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.400
 what the treatment that we are 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.470
 offering is a treatment 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.340
 truly if the patient understands 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.900
 the meaning will go very well not 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.030
 we are doing it to all 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.610
 patients because there are many people who do not 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.490
 understands that he has to modify the 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.220
 Eating habits is not a system 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.650
 miraculous or do not think that you 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.350
 operating or placing a ball are going to 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.980
 catch and cure your obesity obesity 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.500
 as we have all known is chronic 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:06.760
 it means that all of life you are 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.760
 he has to be controlling
