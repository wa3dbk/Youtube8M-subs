00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.590 
them meeting up on f7 my first move I
considered<00:01:02.730> actually<00:01:03.000> was<00:01:03.090> Queen<00:01:03.300> h5

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
considered actually was Queen h5

mentally<00:01:04.110> my<00:01:04.290> head<00:01:04.439> quickly<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.220> course

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
mentally my head quickly and of course

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.859 
mentally my head quickly and of course
dismissed<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.970> quickly<00:01:06.240> after<00:01:06.540> teen<00:01:06.720> takes

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
dismissed that quickly after teen takes

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.960 
dismissed that quickly after teen takes
h5<00:01:07.290> bishop<00:01:07.680> f7<00:01:08.040> doesn't<00:01:08.340> work<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> next

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
h5 bishop f7 doesn't work so the next

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.640 
h5 bishop f7 doesn't work so the next
one<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.180> looked<00:01:09.420> at<00:01:09.570> was<00:01:09.810> Queen<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.920> g4<00:01:11.340> check

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
one I looked at was Queen to g4 check

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.990 
one I looked at was Queen to g4 check
deflecting<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.830> Queen<00:01:14.100> away<00:01:14.460> again<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.850> is

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
deflecting the Queen away again this is

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.179 
deflecting the Queen away again this is
a<00:01:15.030> deflection<00:01:15.479> because<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.290> are<00:01:16.500> removing<00:01:16.979> a

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
a deflection because you are removing a

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.469 
a deflection because you are removing a
piece<00:01:17.369> from<00:01:17.520> something<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.060> guarding<00:01:18.390> in

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
piece from something it's guarding in

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.289 
piece from something it's guarding in
this<00:01:18.600> case<00:01:18.780> blocking<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> file<00:01:20.210> maybe<00:01:21.210> a

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
this case blocking the file maybe a

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.280 
this case blocking the file maybe a
decoy<00:01:22.520> anyway<00:01:23.570> Bishop<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.659> seven<00:01:24.930> check<00:01:25.170> I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
decoy anyway Bishop of seven check I

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.749 
decoy anyway Bishop of seven check I
literally<00:01:25.650> get<00:01:25.890> confused<00:01:26.280> by<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.490> every

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
literally get confused by that every

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.760 
literally get confused by that every
time<00:01:26.909> I'm<00:01:26.970> like<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.509> feel<00:01:27.750> like<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.680> know

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
time I'm like I feel like the you know

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.190 
time I'm like I feel like the you know
the<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.280> trans<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:30.000> know<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.329> transgression

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the the trans you know the transgression

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.649 
the the trans you know the transgression
of<00:01:31.320> man<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.920> going<00:01:32.250> backwards<00:01:32.490> toward<00:01:33.180> never

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
of man like going backwards toward never

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.179 
of man like going backwards toward never
learning<00:01:34.140> from<00:01:34.290> their<00:01:34.439> mistakes<00:01:34.470> you<00:01:35.040> know

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
learning from their mistakes you know

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.700 
learning from their mistakes you know
like<00:01:35.430> I'm<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.930> evolving<00:01:36.930> every<00:01:37.290> time<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.560> talk

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
like I'm on evolving every time I talk

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.980 
like I'm on evolving every time I talk
about<00:01:38.100> decoy<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.700> deflection<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.479> like<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
about decoy and deflection it's like the

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.830 
about decoy and deflection it's like the
semantics<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> difference<00:01:41.159> though

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
semantics and the difference though

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.539 
semantics and the difference though
anyway<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.140> one's<00:01:43.320> pretty<00:01:43.470> clear<00:01:43.829> as<00:01:44.040> far

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
anyway so this one's pretty clear as far

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.030 
anyway so this one's pretty clear as far
as<00:01:45.030> what<00:01:45.390> you're<00:01:45.509> trying<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.140> execute<00:01:46.710> here

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
as what you're trying to execute here

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.740 
as what you're trying to execute here
the<00:01:47.189> king<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:47.579> g6<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.270> see<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> pretty

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
the king is on g6 you see a pretty

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.219 
the king is on g6 you see a pretty
obvious<00:01:49.549> setup<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:51.090> pieces<00:01:51.420> coordinated

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
obvious setup of the pieces coordinated

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.980 
obvious setup of the pieces coordinated
and<00:01:52.350> what<00:01:52.590> they're<00:01:52.740> trying<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.100> target<00:01:53.689> if<00:01:54.689> you

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
and what they're trying to target if you

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.870 
and what they're trying to target if you
didn't<00:01:55.350> find<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.740> one<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.189> advice<00:01:56.549> would<00:01:56.820> be

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
didn't find this one the advice would be

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.499 
didn't find this one the advice would be
that<00:01:58.399> well<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.549> again<00:01:59.790> you're<00:02:00.000> probably<00:02:00.210> not

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
that well you again you're probably not

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.209 
that well you again you're probably not
letting<00:02:00.899> yourself<00:02:01.229> consider<00:02:01.649> all<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.950> checks

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
letting yourself consider all the checks

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.069 
letting yourself consider all the checks
possible<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.090> if<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.450> focused<00:02:03.869> on

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
possible if you if you focused on

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.679 
possible if you if you focused on
something<00:02:04.649> more<00:02:04.920> passive<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.640> g4<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.420> remove

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
something more passive like g4 to remove

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.510 
something more passive like g4 to remove
the<00:02:06.810> bishop<00:02:07.110> it's<00:02:07.500> actually<00:02:07.920> probably<00:02:08.129> like

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
the bishop it's actually probably like

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.540 
the bishop it's actually probably like
the<00:02:08.670> second<00:02:09.060> best<00:02:09.209> thing<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.509> consider

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
the second best thing to consider

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.000 
the second best thing to consider
because<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:12.060> means<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.420> were

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
because it means you were

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.070 
because it means you were
recognizing<00:02:13.849> what<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.150> idea<00:02:14.510> was<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:15.019> you

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
recognizing what the idea was and you

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.690 
recognizing what the idea was and you
were<00:02:15.110> going<00:02:15.500> with<00:02:15.530> something<00:02:16.010> to<00:02:16.250> remove<00:02:16.549> the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
were going with something to remove the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.729 
were going with something to remove the
bishop<00:02:17.030> but<00:02:17.180> it's<00:02:17.360> just<00:02:17.510> allow<00:02:18.200> yourself<00:02:18.349> to

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
bishop but it's just allow yourself to

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.530 
bishop but it's just allow yourself to
consider<00:02:19.099> the<00:02:19.250> most<00:02:19.430> forceful<00:02:20.000> options<00:02:20.360> any

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
consider the most forceful options any

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.259 
consider the most forceful options any
any<00:02:20.900> move<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.560> requires<00:02:22.220> one<00:02:22.640> response<00:02:23.120> from
