this<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:06.630> curved<00:02:06.930> there<00:02:07.369> that's<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.550> idea

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
this it's curved there that's the idea

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:15.470 
this it's curved there that's the idea
do<00:02:09.540> that<00:02:09.720> for<00:02:09.930> each<00:02:09.960> of<00:02:10.050> them<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:14.480> pretty

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
do that for each of them that it pretty

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.920 
do that for each of them that it pretty
smooth<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:16.290> see<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.650> all<00:02:17.400> right<00:02:17.930> what's

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
smooth you see that all right what's

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.140 
smooth you see that all right what's
next<00:02:19.260> now<00:02:19.950> I'm<00:02:20.070> just<00:02:20.250> popping<00:02:20.670> out<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.940> wings

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.200 

goes<00:02:27.720> pretty<00:02:27.900> fast<00:02:28.200> like<00:02:28.380> that<00:02:28.880> okay<00:02:29.880> I'm<00:02:30.030> just

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
goes pretty fast like that okay I'm just

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.100 
goes pretty fast like that okay I'm just
crimping<00:02:30.660> these<00:02:30.810> now<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:32.660> little<00:02:33.660> bit<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:34.020> the

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110

by<00:02:38.250> hand<00:02:38.520> but<00:02:38.930> they're<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:39.960> little<00:02:40.050> bit<00:02:40.200> sharp

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
by hand but they're a little bit sharp
