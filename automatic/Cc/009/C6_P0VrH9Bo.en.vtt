00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.540
 long time i came to do a tutorial 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:17.720

 come on but all the hair back and 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:38.870
 separate the piece up here you 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:50.570
 divided into three like a 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:55.340

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.850

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.070

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:07.700
 There the hair that got loose you get 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:10.930
 to pull the corner and pass down but the 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.930
