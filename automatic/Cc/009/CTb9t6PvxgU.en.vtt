00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 welcome to one more episode explaining 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.890
 flowers 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 I am giving flowers and today 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.790
 We will present a beautiful land of 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.790
 flowers for different occasions 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.400
 to make this land the most important thing 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.710
 is to have a flexible wire 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.529
 let's work with this wire 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.650
 Galvanized type and after 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.480
 straighten it 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:41.770
 you have to form it with a tape zone 7 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.490
 it's self-adhesive but for me to do this 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.490
 we have to stretch a little 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.250
 it does not need to be perfect 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.750
 but if they cover as much as possible 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.750
 of the wire 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.430
 once we have the wire 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.430
 lined 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.040
 work with filial course this earth is going 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.490
 to be completely from the exoficial what 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.880
 let's do 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.909
 this is love 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.350
 make small 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.659
 twigs and leave him in groups 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.530
 Egyptian filial is a complement flower 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:29.060
 it's a non-main flower but now it's going to 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.610
 be the unique flower of our tiara and we 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.360
 let's give that special shine that 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:40.390
 have and we will use one more wire 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:43.600
 soft to go talking our flower 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.350
 We can do it as abundantly as 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:51.060
 we want or as light as our 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.060
 idea of you 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.179
 if you notice I'm leaving a piece of 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:02.490
 wire that is in which I'm going to join the 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.490
 two extremes so it's important 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.190
 I really like doing this kind of 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.300
 decorations are very simple and once 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.680
 very fluid 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.940
 They can be elegant or very rustic 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.120
 spirit of character that you give him 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.700
 now lands are very fashionable 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.330
 tiaras can be for the girls of the 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:32.280
 flowers that go in the comparsa can be 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:36.620
 for a quinceanera for the lady ladies 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.049
 of honor or even for the bride 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:44.360
 I could have many many twigs 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:46.489
 long corns can cut them to just one 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.370
 front is the one that carries the decoration 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.620
 floral the back we're going to 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.090
 leave it ready because it's the part that's going to 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.370
 touching the skin either on the forehead or the 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.549
 hair and we do not need you to have 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.489
 too much flower so it is not clogged 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.140
 or in the back where we're going to 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.709
 make the closure of this earth inside 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:13.400
 we are doing a little more faded 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:17.150
 the flowers are smaller layers 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.280
 to be able to make this closure that the 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.170
 where are we going to have in the 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.680
 front that is much more abundant 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.760
 we are going to use the same name with which 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:33.099
 we sealed the flowers 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.099
 and with it we make our closure 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.910
 I am now working with clips 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.920
 official but you can work with 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.500
 any type of complement flower 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:48.680
 how is the solid I do 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:51.200
 the letizia or even pink orchids or 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.010
 any other type of flower that you more 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.070
 you like it only in flowers like roses or 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:02.150
 mini roses you have to light the and that 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.980
 will be in another class when we do 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.920
 all those that get out of my line of 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.030
 I'm going to remove them with scissors 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.750
 simple 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.000
 and finally I'm going to make a bow and 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.840
 I'm going to add this bow to the part of 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.970
 behind 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.480
 I like many demons with 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.730
 transparencies as is the bar of 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.410
 organza but you can do it 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.860
 any other material that you have to the 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.500
 hand what is important is to do things 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.180
 simple with the material that we have in 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.770
 our house 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.949
 I like to always leave 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.670
 a little ribbon waterfall is like 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.970
 a tail 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.240
 since it makes it more lucid about everything 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.610
 for girls or for little girls 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.960
 maidens 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.710
 who will use it 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.710
 same 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:10.899
