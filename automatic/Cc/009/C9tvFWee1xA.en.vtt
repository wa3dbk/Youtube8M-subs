00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
first is we're mixing the yeast with the

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
waiting about five minutes that's it

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.720 
waiting about five minutes that's it
started<00:00:55.980> then<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:56.220> the<00:00:56.309> mix<00:00:56.489> everything

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
started then with the mix everything

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.020 
started then with the mix everything
alright<00:00:57.540> so<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:57.900> dumped<00:00:58.110> in<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.260> yeast<00:01:00.110> maybe

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
alright so we dumped in the yeast maybe

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.470 
alright so we dumped in the yeast maybe
follow<00:01:03.030> direction<00:01:04.280> so<00:01:05.280> next<00:01:05.850> we're<00:01:06.300> going<00:01:06.390> to

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480 
follow direction so next we're going to

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
that you mix it up with a good mixer we

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.350 
that you mix it up with a good mixer we
don't<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.130> our<00:01:20.159> mixer<00:01:20.610> at<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> moment<00:01:21.120> so

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
don't have our mixer at the moment so

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.350 
don't have our mixer at the moment so
we're<00:01:21.600> gonna<00:01:21.720> use<00:01:21.810> some<00:01:22.260> good<00:01:22.470> old-fashioned

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360

we're gonna use some good old-fashioned
muscle<00:01:24.360> power<00:01:25.100> we<00:01:26.100> might<00:01:26.280> have<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.460> do<00:01:26.610> shifts

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
muscle power we might have to do shifts

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.260 
muscle power we might have to do shifts
maybe<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.250> bigger<00:01:29.460> bowl<00:01:29.760> would<00:01:30.000> have<00:01:30.120> been<00:01:30.240> a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
maybe a bigger bowl would have been a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.690 
maybe a bigger bowl would have been a
good<00:01:30.479> idea<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:31.110> think<00:01:31.680> it's<00:01:31.770> good<00:01:31.890> actually

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
is we're going to split the dough in

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.310 
is we're going to split the dough in
half<00:01:35.580> some<00:01:36.090> these<00:01:36.120> two<00:01:36.420> Super<00:01:36.630> Bowls<00:01:36.870> cover

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320

both<00:01:37.560> plastic<00:01:38.130> wrap<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.490> let<00:01:38.580> it<00:01:38.760> rise<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.000> 20

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
both plastic wrap and let it rise for 20
