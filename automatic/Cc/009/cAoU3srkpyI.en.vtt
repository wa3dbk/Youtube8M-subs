00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:24.840
 year extreme harvest around 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.360
 with 2 200 200 rhetoric here or already 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.260
 more than 10 years 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:33.930
 my littel system with organic taken 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.210
 here comes out almost three and a half 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.040
 put a gift 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.800
 combine harvester 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.110
 but please see what the mass 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.480
 and how the combine works 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.250
 scatters 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.250
 straw and what mulch want 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.540
 well done back 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.540
 crop bi si 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.830
 the idea also got us species 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.860
 Hello 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.270
 the good 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.920
 Lena wind 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.580
 perfect for lips 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.580
 chic quality 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.580
 sorry that little 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.550
 let's caravan 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:46.560
 so tells the field after cleaning the field which 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:51.600
 7 10 years he worked in the system blowjob and 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.610
 here interestingly imagine 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.840
 today about more than a month of rain 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.420
 there was also a temperature over 40 on the soil and 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.850
 constantly 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.340
 even in the shade more than 30 degrees but i 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.850
 regular mail cracked and ground in 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.070
 the soil will not drive a nail aggregates 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:16.080
 cultivators in the mail jump but here 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:23.250
 here look here here 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:27.930
 after harvesting the chopped straw 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.880
 I have now removed myself with my own hand 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.100
 ok digging the soil from i dig under i 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.209
 can go deeper by 15 20 centimeters 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.310
 the soil 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.760
 for 10 years has accumulated such an amount 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.340
 organics on believe it almost 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.620
 thin beautiful why there is no 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.660
 the stones are not lumps here pure organic 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.610
 it is allowed to get here on this 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.120
 array specifically here on this 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:57.400
 territories over 35 price 1 hectare order 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.890
 and wheat but tell me flew work on 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.880
 given a closer look at 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:07.060
 we have no alternative if we are not 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.230
 restructure our rural 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.030
 farms 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.519
 amid global climate change and 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:20.060
 almost lose we can not 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:24.019
 feed people we must stay ahead 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:27.769
 blows that on strong nature and we 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:31.660
 even are you ready books and mine system 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:34.810
 essential oils and this is one of the alternatives 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.810
 the seeker let her see 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.340
 he 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.640
 here on huts from sk see such 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.640
 cracks 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:04.500
 try digging here here and not crowbar 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:07.670
 dig this hand that is visual 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.210
 example of how extreme conditions 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:17.060
 mean over 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:19.870
 heavy summer 2012 triggered new 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.870
 systems 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.190
 felling in the same way plunges on 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.490
 no longer jump the soil of terrible cracks 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.490
 on which the remnants of moisture leave this 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.490
 the soil 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.289
 must be rebuilt 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.600
 already temporarily I have to roll
