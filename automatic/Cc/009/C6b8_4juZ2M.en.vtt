 the solo of when it's time the green day 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.520
 it's very simple let's divide it into two 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.940
 parts the first part would be the 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.940
 following 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.660
 of agreement let's go to it we place the 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.160
 index finger on the first and second 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.160
 third fret rope 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.479
 and 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:45.170
 now we place the ring finger in the 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:49.159
 third string fourth fret first 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:52.479
 second third of first agreement 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:56.500
 second third now index finger 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:58.930
 first rope fret number two 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.920

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.329
 I repeat 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.370
 now with the ring finger 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:25.690
 we put it on the second fret string 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:28.700
 number 5 and the index finger in the first 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:35.840
 second fret rope 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:38.480
 would be second first second we stop 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.420
 and again second second second 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.489
 'we are expecting second and second second 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.080
 finally we put the index finger on 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.080
 the second string third fret 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.550
 come now with the second part 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.130
 we would place the index finger touching the 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.560
 second third and fourth string of 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.239
 fifth fret 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.239
 we play second third quarter 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.410
 now 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.340
 we put the index finger in the second 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.590

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.560

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:24.180
 fourth fret rope and ring finger in 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.830
 the fourth fifth string fret would be 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:29.420
 second third fourth 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.060
 second third fourth and now it would be 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.620
 ring finger 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.620

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.190
 I'm going to repeat the entire floor to camera 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.250
 slow is to say these two parts touched 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.280
 twice 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.510

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.760
 and 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.180
 Y 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:31.120

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.220
 nothing we would have this alone that is very 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.630
 simple is very melodic and can not
