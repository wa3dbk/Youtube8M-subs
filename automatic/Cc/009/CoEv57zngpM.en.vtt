00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.640 
and a small period of time so once you
have<00:02:29.980> regeneration<00:02:30.489> it's<00:02:30.730> easier<00:02:31.120> to<00:02:31.870> heal

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
have regeneration it's easier to heal

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.860 
have regeneration it's easier to heal
and<00:02:32.980> like<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:33.519> just<00:02:33.790> saw<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.030> hill<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.569> healed

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
and like you just saw a hill I healed

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.050 
and like you just saw a hill I healed
pretty<00:02:35.290> quickly<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:36.040> this<00:02:36.459> guy<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.730> trying<00:02:36.940> to

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
pretty quickly and this guy is trying to

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.119 
pretty quickly and this guy is trying to
knock<00:02:37.330> me<00:02:37.510> out<00:02:37.540> in<00:02:37.780> water<00:02:38.080> look<00:02:38.560> at<00:02:38.650> this<00:02:38.890> guy

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
knock me out in water look at this guy

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.309 
knock me out in water look at this guy
you<00:02:39.489> can't<00:02:39.700> kill<00:02:39.940> cool<00:02:40.150> on<00:02:40.300> one<00:02:40.569> like<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:40.810> and

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
you can't kill cool on one like that and

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.610 
you can't kill cool on one like that and
I<00:02:41.769> just<00:02:41.950> love<00:02:42.190> playing<00:02:42.670> in<00:02:43.050> this<00:02:44.050> map<00:02:44.319> and<00:02:44.530> I

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
I just love playing in this map and I

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.619 
I just love playing in this map and I
just<00:02:44.769> love<00:02:45.010> going<00:02:45.310> in<00:02:45.519> water<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.940> feels<00:02:46.090> so<00:02:46.390> fun

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
just love going in water it feels so fun

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.930 
just love going in water it feels so fun
and<00:02:46.750> it's<00:02:46.900> so<00:02:47.019> realistic<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:48.580> don't<00:02:48.760> know

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
and it's so realistic and I don't know

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.110 
and it's so realistic and I don't know
why<00:02:49.180> I<00:02:49.209> always<00:02:49.480> go<00:02:49.810> for<00:02:49.840> that<00:02:50.200> water<00:02:50.410> it's<00:02:50.860> just

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
why I always go for that water it's just

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.690 
why I always go for that water it's just
anyways<00:02:52.120> yeah<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.019> Emma<00:02:53.800> Ward<00:02:54.310> because

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
anyways yeah and Emma Ward because

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.140 
anyways yeah and Emma Ward because
mostly<00:02:55.150> there's<00:02:55.749> not<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:55.930> lot<00:02:56.230> of<00:02:56.409> ammo<00:02:56.709> or

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
mostly there's not a lot of ammo or

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.860 
mostly there's not a lot of ammo or
scattered

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
scattered

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.780 
scattered
scattered<00:02:59.140> guns<00:02:59.470> around<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.040> map<00:03:00.220> unless<00:03:00.610> you

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
scattered guns around the map unless you

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.539 
scattered guns around the map unless you
kill<00:03:01.000> somebody<00:03:01.269> and<00:03:01.989> I<00:03:02.170> just<00:03:02.409> think<00:03:02.769> it's<00:03:03.159> it's

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
kill somebody and I just think it's it's

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.160 
kill somebody and I just think it's it's
actually<00:03:03.909> subjective<00:03:04.450> for<00:03:04.629> the<00:03:04.690> second<00:03:05.049> goose

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
actually subjective for the second goose

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.690 
actually subjective for the second goose
to<00:03:05.349> slide<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.769> that's<00:03:06.099> something<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.549> I

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
to slide and that's something that I

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.300 
to slide and that's something that I
really<00:03:06.849> like<00:03:07.269> to<00:03:07.330> talk<00:03:07.629> about<00:03:07.870> on<00:03:08.680> trigger

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
really like to talk about on trigger

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.580 
really like to talk about on trigger
three<00:03:09.580> because<00:03:09.849> I<00:03:09.940> don't<00:03:10.150> like<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:11.170> way<00:03:11.319> they

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
three because I don't like the way they

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.410 
three because I don't like the way they
made<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:11.950> boosters<00:03:12.370> in<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.610> game<00:03:12.760> because

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
made the boosters in the game because

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.089 
made the boosters in the game because
there's<00:03:13.659> too<00:03:13.810> much<00:03:13.930> good<00:03:14.230> boosters<00:03:14.769> they<00:03:14.950> put

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
there's too much good boosters they put

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.580 
there's too much good boosters they put
as<00:03:15.280> one<00:03:15.610> they<00:03:16.180> put<00:03:16.390> too<00:03:16.569> much<00:03:16.720> good<00:03:17.079> boosters

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
as one they put too much good boosters

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.610 
as one they put too much good boosters
in<00:03:17.769> the<00:03:17.890> same<00:03:18.190> slot<00:03:18.870> and<00:03:19.870> I<00:03:20.019> think<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.379> the

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
in the same slot and I think that the

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.800 
in the same slot and I think that the
game<00:03:20.739> would<00:03:20.890> be<00:03:20.950> a<00:03:21.069> lot<00:03:21.430> much<00:03:21.670> better<00:03:21.970> if<00:03:22.239> they

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
game would be a lot much better if they

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.809 
game would be a lot much better if they
would<00:03:22.930> balance<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.530> boosters<00:03:24.069> on<00:03:24.310> each<00:03:24.519> game

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
would balance the boosters on each game

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.089 
would balance the boosters on each game
and<00:03:25.060> that's<00:03:25.569> another<00:03:25.810> technique<00:03:26.079> I<00:03:26.349> use<00:03:26.560> a<00:03:26.769> lot

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
and that's another technique I use a lot

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.910 
and that's another technique I use a lot
the<00:03:27.599> grenade<00:03:28.599> I<00:03:28.870> don't<00:03:29.019> know<00:03:29.110> I<00:03:29.319> don't<00:03:29.379> have<00:03:29.890> a

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
the grenade I don't know I don't have a

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.250 
the grenade I don't know I don't have a
specific<00:03:30.390> name<00:03:31.390> for<00:03:31.420> that<00:03:31.720> but<00:03:31.959> throwing

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
specific name for that but throwing

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.170 
specific name for that but throwing
grenades<00:03:32.650> when<00:03:33.250> somebody<00:03:33.579> shooting<00:03:33.910> at<00:03:34.030> you

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
grenades when somebody shooting at you

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.240 
grenades when somebody shooting at you
is<00:03:34.299> really<00:03:34.690> at<00:03:35.379> your<00:03:35.620> advantage<00:03:36.220> when

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
is really at your advantage when

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.770 
is really at your advantage when
somebody's<00:03:36.819> trying<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.060> kill<00:03:37.150> you<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:37.510> that's

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
somebody's trying to kill you and that's

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.509 
somebody's trying to kill you and that's
one<00:03:37.989> of<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.290> techniques<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:38.799> can<00:03:38.950> give<00:03:39.129> to<00:03:39.340> you

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
one of the techniques I can give to you

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.849 
one of the techniques I can give to you
going<00:03:40.299> for<00:03:40.480> grenades<00:03:40.750> when<00:03:41.140> you<00:03:41.260> know<00:03:41.470> when

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
going for grenades when you know when

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.740 
going for grenades when you know when
you<00:03:41.950> get<00:03:42.310> to<00:03:42.430> know<00:03:42.519> your<00:03:42.700> map<00:03:42.879> a<00:03:42.910> lot<00:03:43.209> you<00:03:43.720> know

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
you get to know your map a lot you know

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.809 
you get to know your map a lot you know
where<00:03:44.170> their<00:03:44.379> needs<00:03:44.470> are<00:03:44.739> and<00:03:45.040> once<00:03:45.519> you<00:03:45.670> get

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
where their needs are and once you get

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:47.789 
where their needs are and once you get
Rene's<00:03:46.090> grenades<00:03:46.510> can<00:03:46.690> save<00:03:47.019> your<00:03:47.200> life<00:03:47.319> more

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
Rene's grenades can save your life more

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.580 
Rene's grenades can save your life more
than<00:03:48.010> a<00:03:48.040> gun<00:03:48.280> itself<00:03:48.670> so<00:03:49.569> one<00:03:50.379> of<00:03:50.409> the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
than a gun itself so one of the

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.899 
than a gun itself so one of the
techniques<00:03:50.829> techniques<00:03:51.519> that<00:03:51.700> I'm<00:03:51.760> just

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909 
techniques techniques that I'm just

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.330 
techniques techniques that I'm just
gonna<00:03:52.060> try<00:03:52.329> to<00:03:52.390> explain<00:03:52.690> to<00:03:52.840> you<00:03:52.930> guys<00:03:52.959> is<00:03:53.409> the

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
gonna try to explain to you guys is the

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.490 
gonna try to explain to you guys is the
white<00:03:54.549> dot<00:03:54.790> technique<00:03:55.569> now<00:03:55.840> I<00:03:55.870> don't<00:03:56.230> know<00:03:56.349> if

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
white dot technique now I don't know if

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.110 
white dot technique now I don't know if
you<00:03:56.620> guys<00:03:56.739> realize<00:03:57.010> but<00:03:57.370> in<00:03:57.519> the<00:03:57.640> middle<00:03:58.030> of

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
you guys realize but in the middle of

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.670 
you guys realize but in the middle of
your<00:03:58.209> screen<00:03:58.269> there's<00:03:58.720> a<00:03:58.810> white<00:03:58.989> dot<00:03:59.230> that

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
your screen there's a white dot that

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.559 
your screen there's a white dot that
follows<00:04:00.010> you<00:04:00.099> everywhere<00:04:00.129> you<00:04:00.609> go<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:00.970> when

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
follows you everywhere you go and when

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.409 
follows you everywhere you go and when
you<00:04:01.690> use<00:04:02.019> that<00:04:02.049> stuff<00:04:02.889> like<00:04:03.040> this<00:04:03.280> can<00:04:04.060> happen

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:04.419 
you use that stuff like this can happen

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:06.240 
you use that stuff like this can happen
a<00:04:04.510> lot<00:04:04.690> and<00:04:04.959> it<00:04:05.349> just<00:04:05.590> helps<00:04:05.889> you<00:04:05.980> throw

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
a lot and it just helps you throw

just<00:05:29.970> jumping<00:05:30.510> out<00:05:30.600> of<00:05:30.660> there<00:05:30.930> for<00:05:31.470> no<00:05:31.590> reason

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
just jumping out of there for no reason

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.890 
just jumping out of there for no reason
whatsoever<00:05:32.280> any<00:05:33.060> thought<00:05:33.240> was<00:05:33.390> gonna<00:05:33.510> fall<00:05:33.750> on

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
whatsoever any thought was gonna fall on

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.770 
whatsoever any thought was gonna fall on
land<00:05:34.110> but<00:05:34.650> yeah<00:05:34.860> when<00:05:35.610> you<00:05:35.730> run<00:05:35.970> a<00:05:36.000> gun<00:05:36.330> the

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
land but yeah when you run a gun the

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.200 
land but yeah when you run a gun the
enemy<00:05:37.170> has<00:05:37.380> less<00:05:37.620> control<00:05:38.010> over<00:05:38.340> how<00:05:38.850> he<00:05:38.910> aims

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.630 
enemy has less control over how he aims
and<00:05:39.570> I<00:05:40.080> would<00:05:40.230> be<00:05:40.410> really<00:05:40.680> stupid<00:05:40.890> if<00:05:41.190> I<00:05:41.400> felt

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
and I would be really stupid if I felt

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.020 
and I would be really stupid if I felt
in<00:05:41.790> there<00:05:42.420> for<00:05:42.750> the<00:05:42.840> second<00:05:43.200> time<00:05:43.350> but<00:05:43.950> I<00:05:44.850> also

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
in there for the second time but I also

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.890 
enemies not when your enemy is close to
you<00:05:49.800> always<00:05:50.400> go<00:05:50.670> for<00:05:50.970> the<00:05:51.030> whack<00:05:51.270> and<00:05:51.510> roll<00:05:51.660> if

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
you always go for the whack and roll if

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.300 
you always go for the whack and roll if
you<00:05:52.020> watch<00:05:52.170> big<00:05:52.380> -<00:05:52.530> crew<00:05:52.770> they<00:05:52.950> showed<00:05:53.190> you

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
you watch big - crew they showed you

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.460 
you watch big - crew they showed you
that<00:05:53.490> technique<00:05:53.910> and<00:05:54.090> that<00:05:54.480> technique<00:05:54.900> is<00:05:55.110> far

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
that technique and that technique is far

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.010 
that technique and that technique is far
more<00:05:55.860> effective<00:05:56.370> than<00:05:56.400> just<00:05:56.550> aiming<00:05:57.210> like<00:05:57.870> I

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
more effective than just aiming like I

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.050 
more effective than just aiming like I
said<00:05:58.260> if<00:05:58.500> you<00:05:58.590> just<00:05:58.890> aim<00:05:59.100> when<00:05:59.520> the<00:05:59.640> enemy<00:06:00.000> is

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
said if you just aim when the enemy is

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.080 
said if you just aim when the enemy is
too<00:06:00.330> close<00:06:00.710> well<00:06:01.710> he<00:06:02.100> will<00:06:02.220> aim<00:06:02.430> exactly<00:06:02.970> at

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
too close well he will aim exactly at

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.730 
too close well he will aim exactly at
you<00:06:03.210> and<00:06:03.300> you<00:06:03.420> could<00:06:03.600> die<00:06:03.810> instantly<00:06:04.410> or

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
you and you could die instantly or

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.170 
you and you could die instantly or
easier<00:06:05.130> especially<00:06:05.640> when<00:06:05.790> stuff<00:06:06.000> like<00:06:06.060> that

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
easier especially when stuff like that

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.730 
easier especially when stuff like that
happens<00:06:06.360> when<00:06:06.870> your<00:06:07.050> team<00:06:07.230> is<00:06:07.260> right<00:06:07.590> behind

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
happens when your team is right behind

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.850 
happens when your team is right behind
them<00:06:08.130> but<00:06:08.940> if<00:06:09.090> you<00:06:09.270> run<00:06:09.510> a<00:06:09.540> gun<00:06:09.870> and<00:06:10.170> you<00:06:10.680> can

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
them but if you run a gun and you can

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.100 
them but if you run a gun and you can
just<00:06:11.100> you<00:06:11.430> can<00:06:11.460> just<00:06:11.640> a<00:06:11.880> few<00:06:11.910> bullets<00:06:12.480> and<00:06:12.690> one

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
just you can just a few bullets and one

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.680 
just you can just a few bullets and one
one<00:06:13.620> whack<00:06:13.920> is<00:06:14.190> all<00:06:14.670> it<00:06:14.820> takes<00:06:14.970> to<00:06:15.150> get<00:06:15.330> a<00:06:15.390> kill

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
one whack is all it takes to get a kill

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:16.910 
one whack is all it takes to get a kill
and<00:06:15.870> that's<00:06:16.260> something<00:06:16.470> that<00:06:16.590> you're<00:06:16.830> gonna

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:16.920 
and that's something that you're gonna

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.410 
and that's something that you're gonna
really<00:06:17.160> have<00:06:17.370> want<00:06:17.640> to<00:06:17.760> adapt<00:06:18.000> to<00:06:18.030> when

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:18.420 
really have want to adapt to when

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.360 
really have want to adapt to when
implemented<00:06:18.690> three<00:06:19.410> and<00:06:19.860> I<00:06:19.920> think<00:06:20.130> it's<00:06:20.280> a

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
implemented three and I think it's a

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.090 
implemented three and I think it's a
really<00:06:20.550> fun<00:06:20.670> technique<00:06:21.180> to<00:06:21.600> to<00:06:22.410> play<00:06:22.680> with<00:06:22.890> and

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
really fun technique to to play with and

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.740 
really fun technique to to play with and
I<00:06:23.160> think<00:06:23.220> it's<00:06:23.520> a<00:06:23.580> really<00:06:23.760> fun<00:06:23.880> tactic<00:06:24.510> to<00:06:24.720> use

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
I think it's a really fun tactic to use

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.530 
I think it's a really fun tactic to use
and<00:06:25.230> I'm<00:06:25.800> making<00:06:26.490> myself<00:06:26.790> look<00:06:27.000> so<00:06:27.300> bad

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540 
and I'm making myself look so bad

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.720 
and I'm making myself look so bad
running<00:06:28.050> into<00:06:28.290> a<00:06:28.320> grenade<00:06:28.680> like<00:06:28.860> that<00:06:29.070> that's

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
running into a grenade like that that's

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.920 
running into a grenade like that that's
one<00:06:29.880> of<00:06:29.970> the<00:06:30.060> things<00:06:30.240> I'll<00:06:30.419> tell<00:06:30.600> you<00:06:30.690> not<00:06:30.870> to

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
one of the things I'll tell you not to

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.620 
one of the things I'll tell you not to
do<00:06:31.230> but<00:06:31.470> still<00:06:31.860> accidents<00:06:32.760> can<00:06:32.910> happen<00:06:33.060> but

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
do but still accidents can happen but

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:35.360 
do but still accidents can happen but
those<00:06:33.810> are<00:06:33.960> the<00:06:34.050> two<00:06:34.230> techniques<00:06:34.470> I<00:06:34.919> really

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
those are the two techniques I really

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.570 
those are the two techniques I really
wanted<00:06:35.640> to<00:06:35.700> clarify<00:06:36.180> and<00:06:36.360> give<00:06:36.630> to<00:06:36.810> you<00:06:36.990> on
