about the editing yeah generally how

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.279 
about the editing yeah generally how
many<00:05:18.979> shots<00:05:19.190> you<00:05:19.370> take<00:05:19.669> before<00:05:20.599> you<00:05:20.900> get<00:05:21.080> one

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
many shots you take before you get one

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.140 
many shots you take before you get one
that<00:05:21.530> you're<00:05:21.650> actually<00:05:21.830> willing<00:05:22.729> to<00:05:22.909> show

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
that you're actually willing to show

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.640 
that you're actually willing to show
your<00:05:23.330> portfolio<00:05:23.930> you're<00:05:24.199> quite<00:05:24.380> proud<00:05:24.620> of

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650

well as you shoot more you get more

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.980 
well as you shoot more you get more
critical<00:05:28.699> and<00:05:29.349> I<00:05:30.349> think<00:05:31.310> that<00:05:31.669> when<00:05:32.630> you<00:05:32.659> get

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990

critical and I think that when you get
more<00:05:33.169> critical<00:05:33.560> you<00:05:33.650> work<00:05:33.830> becomes<00:05:34.130> better

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
more critical you work becomes better

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.159

transcend reality I would say you know
of<00:06:17.300> course<00:06:17.509> you<00:06:17.690> need<00:06:17.810> to<00:06:17.930> truck<00:06:18.229> it<00:06:18.530> trihard

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
of course you need to truck it trihard
