00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
been supported since vista basically

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.319 
been supported since vista basically
like<00:03:50.350> what<00:03:50.829> do<00:03:50.890> i<00:03:50.920> do<00:03:50.980> about<00:03:51.130> this<00:03:51.430> so<00:03:51.790> that's

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
like what do i do about this so that's

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.880 
like what do i do about this so that's
gonna<00:03:52.630> know<00:03:52.900> why<00:03:53.019> they'd<00:03:53.200> sell<00:03:53.440> it<00:03:53.560> so<00:03:53.739> we

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
gonna know why they'd sell it so we

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.380 
gonna know why they'd sell it so we
eventually<00:03:54.160> had<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.400> just<00:03:54.609> like<00:03:54.700> turn<00:03:54.970> off<00:03:55.150> the

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
eventually had to just like turn off the

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.240 
eventually had to just like turn off the
sound<00:03:55.660> to<00:03:56.380> get<00:03:56.530> it<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.680> work<00:03:56.799> that<00:03:57.040> was<00:03:57.160> our

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
sound to get it to work that was our

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.590 
sound to get it to work that was our

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
solution so we play battlefront with no

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.520 
solution so we play battlefront with no
sound
