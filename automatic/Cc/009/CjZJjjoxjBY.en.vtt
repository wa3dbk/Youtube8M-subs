that's how they get bigger and stronger

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.270 
that's how they get bigger and stronger
we've<00:02:23.780> gone<00:02:23.900> straight<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:24.380> super<00:02:25.070> said

we've gone straight to that super said

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.540 
we've gone straight to that super said
which<00:02:26.150> is<00:02:26.330> two<00:02:26.540> exercises<00:02:26.960> back-to-back<00:02:27.560> and

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
which is two exercises back-to-back and

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.010 
which is two exercises back-to-back and
