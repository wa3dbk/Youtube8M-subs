00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
coming months to fit in with Rick's

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.350 
coming months to fit in with Rick's
range<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.739> movement<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.760> every<00:02:12.060> step

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
range of movement so that every step

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.360 
range of movement so that every step
that<00:02:12.390> Rick<00:02:12.840> takes

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.460 
that Rick takes
now<00:02:13.519> is<00:02:13.879> a<00:02:14.030> step<00:02:14.450> towards<00:02:14.870> his<00:02:14.989> future

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
independence and it's Rick's

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.390 
independence and it's Rick's
determination<00:02:18.440> that<00:02:18.590> will<00:02:18.709> get<00:02:18.890> him<00:02:18.980> off<00:02:19.190> the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
months he's gonna be using muscles that

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.720 
months he's gonna be using muscles that
he<00:02:59.659> hasn't<00:02:59.870> used<00:03:00.230> for<00:03:00.890> a<00:03:00.920> long<00:03:01.040> time<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.640> those

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
he hasn't used for a long time and those

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:02.949 
he hasn't used for a long time and those
muscles<00:03:02.090> are<00:03:02.150> gonna<00:03:02.209> be<00:03:02.359> doing<00:03:02.480> a<00:03:02.510> lot<00:03:02.629> of<00:03:02.780> work

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
muscles are gonna be doing a lot of work

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.869 
muscles are gonna be doing a lot of work
like<00:03:03.319> I<00:03:03.409> said<00:03:03.590> before<00:03:03.739> he's<00:03:04.400> got<00:03:04.519> to<00:03:04.640> generate

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
like I said before he's got to generate

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.780 
like I said before he's got to generate
about<00:03:05.299> 300<00:03:06.049> to<00:03:06.109> 400<00:03:06.470> percent<00:03:06.590> more<00:03:07.099> energy

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
about 300 to 400 percent more energy

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.940 
about 300 to 400 percent more energy
than<00:03:07.909> he<00:03:07.970> would<00:03:08.209> have<00:03:08.359> used<00:03:08.959> before<00:03:09.530> the

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
than he would have used before the

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.740 
than he would have used before the
accident<00:03:10.129> happened<00:03:10.819> but<00:03:11.120> whether<00:03:11.329> he's<00:03:11.510> using

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
accident happened but whether he's using

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.869 
accident happened but whether he's using
his<00:03:11.870> artificial<00:03:12.170> limb<00:03:12.470> sockets<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:13.549> ass<00:03:13.670> can

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
his artificial limb sockets the ass can

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.520 
his artificial limb sockets the ass can
be<00:03:13.970> put<00:03:14.150> under<00:03:14.299> a<00:03:14.420> lot<00:03:14.569> of<00:03:14.690> forces<00:03:14.959> that<00:03:15.140> are
