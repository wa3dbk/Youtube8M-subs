00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
this but then you're going to unravel it

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.270 
this but then you're going to unravel it
20<00:00:59.820> times<00:01:00.090> like<00:01:00.870> approximately<00:01:01.559> 20<00:01:01.829> times<00:01:02.070> to

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
20 times like approximately 20 times to

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.650 
20 times like approximately 20 times to
do<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> little<00:01:02.789> more<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> little<00:01:03.210> less

I'd recommend 20 and then you can under

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.179 
I'd recommend 20 and then you can under
out<00:01:07.610> unravel<00:01:08.610> at<00:01:08.700> one<00:01:08.850> time<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.360> one<00:01:09.840> two<00:01:10.470> three

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
out unravel at one time so one two three

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.929 
out unravel at one time so one two three
four<00:01:11.880> like<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.450> keep<00:01:12.600> count<00:01:12.930> like<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
four like just keep count like that and
