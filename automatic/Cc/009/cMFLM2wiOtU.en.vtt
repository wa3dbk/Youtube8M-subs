00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
pisses me off anyway it's just so much

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.410

driving<00:00:50.280> me<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.670> when<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.210> go<00:00:51.329> across

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
driving me that when I have to go across

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.209 
driving me that when I have to go across
the<00:00:51.780> map<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.199> game<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.590> get<00:00:52.800> really

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
the map in this game I get really

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.729 
the map in this game I get really
annoyed<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.360> was<00:00:54.570> looking<00:00:54.899> at<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> faster

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
annoyed so I was looking at a faster

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.000 
annoyed so I was looking at a faster
easier<00:00:56.510> or<00:00:57.510> more<00:00:57.539> fun<00:00:58.079> solution<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
easier or more fun solution to the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.490 
easier or more fun solution to the
problem<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.640> I<00:01:00.300> figured<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.050> best<00:01:01.109> way<00:01:01.289> that

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
problem and I figured the best way that

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.820 
problem and I figured the best way that
you<00:01:01.590> could<00:01:01.739> do<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.460> steal<00:01:03.030> play<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:04.140> as

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
you could do it is just steal play so as

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.429 
you could do it is just steal play so as
you<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.129> see<00:01:05.309> I'm<00:01:05.400> out<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> airport<00:01:06.090> here

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439

it<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.680> dark<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.610> some<00:01:08.790> reason<00:01:09.090> though

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
it is dark and for some reason though

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.149 
it is dark and for some reason though
the<00:01:09.420> little<00:01:09.720> jets<00:01:09.960> were<00:01:10.170> gone<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.409> guess<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
the little jets were gone I guess the

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.450 
the little jets were gone I guess the

miss this point and the reason for that
is<00:01:47.909> pretty<00:01:47.939> simple<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.840> tried<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.560> before<00:01:49.770> I

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
is pretty simple I tried this before I

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.870 
is pretty simple I tried this before I
came<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.659> at<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:51.990> different<00:01:52.619> angle<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.369> I'm<00:01:53.670> not

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
came in at a different angle and I'm not

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.240 
came in at a different angle and I'm not

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
sure if I was either not close enough to

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.130 
sure if I was either not close enough to
Dom<00:01:56.459> or<00:01:57.119> not<00:01:57.390> close<00:01:57.659> enough<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.959> that

Dom or not close enough to that

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.710 
Dom or not close enough to that
parachute<00:01:58.619> jump<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.670> either<00:01:59.970> way<00:02:00.209> you<00:02:00.329> put<00:02:00.360> it

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
parachute jump but either way you put it

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.359 
parachute jump but either way you put it
when<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.020> attempted<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.829> jump<00:02:02.039> out<00:02:02.220> of<00:02:02.250> the

kind<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.899> didn't<00:02:07.170> work<00:02:07.319> but<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:09.030> being<00:02:09.269> said

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
kind of didn't work but that being said

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.839 
kind of didn't work but that being said
go<00:02:09.929> ahead<00:02:10.079> and<00:02:10.319> line<00:02:10.470> up<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.190> not<00:02:11.640> that

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
go ahead and line up this is not that
