00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
of the tips that I've picked up along

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.709 
of the tips that I've picked up along
the<00:00:39.070> way

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
the way

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.090 
the way
so<00:00:40.719> before<00:00:41.050> you<00:00:41.079> run<00:00:41.320> your<00:00:41.500> sled<00:00:41.770> at<00:00:41.860> all<00:00:41.980> the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 
it's not frozen to the ground so you

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.819 
it's not frozen to the ground so you
want<00:00:45.190> to<00:00:45.250> pick<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.460> back<00:00:46.410> I'm<00:00:47.410> just<00:00:47.590> breaking

riding though one thing I like to make

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.960 
riding though one thing I like to make
sure<00:01:57.880> I<00:01:58.030> mentioned<00:01:58.390> was<00:01:58.509> around<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.840> pants<00:01:59.140> so

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
sure I mentioned was around the pants so

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.219 
sure I mentioned was around the pants so
the<00:02:00.970> one<00:02:01.119> investment<00:02:01.630> you<00:02:01.690> definitely<00:02:02.049> want

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
the one investment you definitely want

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.920 
the one investment you definitely want
to<00:02:02.260> make<00:02:02.440> is<00:02:02.680> a<00:02:02.710> good<00:02:03.430> pair<00:02:03.700> of<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.630> chest

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
to make is a good pair of the the chest

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.859

high<00:02:05.140> boot<00:02:05.470> style<00:02:05.830> snowmobile<00:02:06.820> pants<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:07.780> the

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
high boot style snowmobile pants and the

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.770 
high boot style snowmobile pants and the
reason<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:08.229> say<00:02:08.440> that<00:02:08.649> I<00:02:08.890> learned<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.399> hard<00:02:09.610> way

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
reason I say that I learned the hard way

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.610 
reason I say that I learned the hard way
originally<00:02:10.780> when<00:02:10.929> I<00:02:10.959> was<00:02:11.110> riding<00:02:11.320> I<00:02:11.500> was

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
originally when I was riding I was

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.680 
originally when I was riding I was
wearing<00:02:11.830> just<00:02:12.430> kind<00:02:12.580> of<00:02:12.610> a<00:02:12.700> pair<00:02:12.910> of<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.480> waist

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
wearing just kind of a pair of the waist

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.750 
wearing just kind of a pair of the waist
high<00:02:13.870> snow<00:02:14.110> pants<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.920> what<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.430> quickly

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
high snow pants and what I quickly

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.250 
high snow pants and what I quickly
discovered<00:02:16.120> is<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:16.630> get<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.780> hell<00:02:17.019> of<00:02:17.049> a

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
discovered is that you get a hell of a

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.460 
discovered is that you get a hell of a
draft<00:02:17.530> across<00:02:18.100> your<00:02:18.280> lower<00:02:18.430> back<00:02:18.730> when<00:02:19.120> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
draft across your lower back when the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.780 
draft across your lower back when the
jacket<00:02:20.470> rides<00:02:20.680> up<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.190> get<00:02:21.340> cold<00:02:21.519> pretty

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
jacket rides up and you get cold pretty

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:38.920 
jacket rides up and you get cold pretty
quick<00:02:22.030> so<00:02:22.299> it's<00:02:22.720> good<00:02:22.840> investment

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.899 

the<00:02:39.680> basic<00:02:40.040> controls<00:02:40.400> of<00:02:40.519> your<00:02:40.670> snowmobile

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
the basic controls of your snowmobile

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.729 
the basic controls of your snowmobile
are<00:02:41.239> fairly<00:02:41.480> easy<00:02:41.810> to<00:02:42.019> get<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.260> hang<00:02:42.439> of<00:02:42.560> but

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
are fairly easy to get the hang of but

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.069 
are fairly easy to get the hang of but
you<00:02:42.829> do<00:02:42.980> need<00:02:43.129> to<00:02:43.310> remember<00:02:43.549> to<00:02:43.819> lean

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
you do need to remember to lean

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.360 
you do need to remember to lean
particularly<00:02:45.079> in<00:02:45.260> loose<00:02:45.500> powder<00:02:45.829> the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
particularly in loose powder the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.130 
particularly in loose powder the
snowmobile<00:02:46.879> is<00:02:47.000> going<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.209> tend<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.629> tip<00:02:47.870> or

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
snowmobile is going to tend to tip or

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.960 
snowmobile is going to tend to tip or
lean<00:02:48.379> away<00:02:48.920> from<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.310> direction<00:02:49.459> that<00:02:49.819> you're

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
lean away from the direction that you're

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.640 
lean away from the direction that you're
turning<00:02:50.180> in<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:50.989> if<00:02:51.079> you're<00:02:51.170> turning<00:02:51.470> right

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
turning in so if you're turning right

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.960 
turning in so if you're turning right
the<00:02:51.890> snowmobile<00:02:52.310> is<00:02:52.400> going<00:02:52.519> to<00:02:52.579> want<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.790> tip

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
the snowmobile is going to want to tip

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.130 
the snowmobile is going to want to tip
and<00:02:53.120> laughs<00:02:53.299> especially<00:02:53.870> if<00:02:53.930> you're<00:02:54.049> going

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
and laughs especially if you're going

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.229 
and laughs especially if you're going
faster<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:55.069> make<00:02:55.250> sure<00:02:55.280> that<00:02:55.549> you<00:02:55.700> lean<00:02:55.970> out

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
faster so make sure that you lean out

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.059 
faster so make sure that you lean out
into<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:56.989> direction<00:02:57.230> that<00:02:57.530> you're<00:02:57.680> turning

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
into the direction that you're turning

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.649 
into the direction that you're turning
to<00:02:58.099> keep<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.549> snowmobile<00:02:59.030> flat<00:03:01.180> if<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.359> made<00:03:02.569> a

to keep the snowmobile flat if I made a

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.630 
to keep the snowmobile flat if I made a
