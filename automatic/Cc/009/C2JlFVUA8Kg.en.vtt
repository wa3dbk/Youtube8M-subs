00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:13.490
 I started like he had a little house 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:18.029
 little one at home with facts and all 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:20.850
 girls passing by there also said 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.100
 nice little house 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.930
 it all started like this at 4 and a half years 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.610
 going up on a bar chair and into 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.220
 province of rieti without his 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.290
 parents knew nothing by chanting one 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.490
 cottage in canada was for the little one 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:39.010
 great claudio 1955 or so was born 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.780
 the same enthusiasm the orange one 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.700
 same passion that even today baglioni 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.860
 put his concerts on term 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.650
 hasty to define a show or rather a 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.450
 one man show lasting 3 hours 10 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.340
 the only Roman singer-songwriter 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.589
 embracing the guitar by sitting and the 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.809
 classic electric piano 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.970
 an intimate show telling one 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.890
 history that even a career that 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.960
 intertwines life dedicating the tour to 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.510
 mom silvia disappeared last February 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.989
 that if accompanied defended baglioni in the 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.989
 his path 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.820
 Yes No 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.820
 are they 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.820
 I do not know 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.799
 lacking in some ways the wave of 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.780
 emotions of another round of 1986 is 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.090
 only three days was the debut 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.520
 national third party of ten fingers 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.740
 before Cagliari Rome and Milan and before 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.930
 to start over with you like the title 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.580
 last about new album 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.920
 live songs surprise and 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.149
 they strike notes that they dig into the soul 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.100
 like the years of youth 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.530
 or double thread that tells stories 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.600
 of southern islands from lampedusa to 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.600
 looking for something ever further north 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.230
 perhaps 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.230
 I go 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.010
 I was fine 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.179
 immediate good 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.250
 instead of the classical orchestra, the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.260
 people on stage also called in the 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.880
 reversal of roles to sing to devote 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.140
 to the songs because not even ironically 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.760
 to sign autographs 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.730
 claudio baglioni enters the audience 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.310
 to play over 350 skate and songs 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.350
 I'll make 200 of them tonight 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.570
 public three generations audience would like 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.670
 were they so they kept pace in a live 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.620
 just look at the voice, just feel the kitchen 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.990
 you will still have the same guarantee of a 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.000
 great artist and the classic songs there 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.480
 they are all for the joy of those who have more than 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.480
 a white hat
