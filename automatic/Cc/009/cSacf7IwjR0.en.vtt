here is to not over darken this I'll

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.250 
here is to not over darken this I'll

start here with the ear and I'll add

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.250 
start here with the ear and I'll add
color<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:02.100> where<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.850> ear<00:02:03.060> touches<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.050> head

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.010 
color to where the ear touches the head
and<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.560> call<00:02:04.800> this<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.010> ear<00:02:05.220> flaps<00:02:05.780> color<00:02:06.780> in

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
and I call this the ear flaps color in

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.010 
and I call this the ear flaps color in
that<00:02:07.050> fairly<00:02:07.830> nicely<00:02:08.149> not<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.539> heavy<00:02:09.750> hand

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
that fairly nicely not with a heavy hand

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.949 
that fairly nicely not with a heavy hand
because<00:02:10.350> it's<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.649> very<00:02:11.039> dark<00:02:11.310> color<00:02:11.970> but<00:02:12.750> just

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
because it's a very dark color but just

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.440 
because it's a very dark color but just
so<00:02:13.050> you've<00:02:13.230> got<00:02:13.380> some<00:02:13.680> shading<00:02:14.520> created

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
so you've got some shading created

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.300 
so you've got some shading created
because<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.320> lighter<00:02:16.530> gray<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:16.950> really

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
because that lighter gray is really

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.530 
because that lighter gray is really
light<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.550> that's<00:02:17.910> not<00:02:18.090> going<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.270> give<00:02:18.420> you

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
light and that's not going to give you

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.949 
light and that's not going to give you
any<00:02:19.190> variation<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:21.300> don't<00:02:21.420> put<00:02:21.690> too<00:02:21.810> much

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
any variation in you don't put too much

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.490 
any variation in you don't put too much
on<00:02:22.170> there<00:02:22.820> clean<00:02:23.820> q-tip<00:02:24.060> gamsol<00:02:24.989> and<00:02:25.320> you're

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
on there clean q-tip gamsol and you're

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.550 
on there clean q-tip gamsol and you're
gonna<00:02:25.590> pull<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.010> color<00:02:26.330> in<00:02:27.330> from<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.470> edge

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
gonna pull the color in from the edge

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.449 
gonna pull the color in from the edge
just<00:02:28.770> like<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.070> didn't<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.459> other<00:02:29.580> one<00:02:31.459> the

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
just like you didn't the other one the

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.410 
just like you didn't the other one the
secret<00:02:32.820> is<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:32.940> not<00:02:33.180> over<00:02:33.420> blend<00:02:33.660> very<00:02:34.380> common

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
secret is to not over blend very common

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.699 
secret is to not over blend very common
people<00:02:36.420> will<00:02:36.690> over<00:02:37.080> blend<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.500> then<00:02:37.560> you've

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
people will over blend and then you've

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.710 
people will over blend and then you've
got<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.010> same<00:02:38.190> color<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:39.000> all<00:02:39.360> over<00:02:39.390> again

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
got the same color to all over again

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.690 
got the same color to all over again
I'll<00:02:40.080> blend<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.410> together<00:02:40.560> then<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.520> have<00:02:41.610> to

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
I'll blend it together then you have to

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.979 
I'll blend it together then you have to
start<00:02:41.910> over<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.209> darken<00:02:42.540> everything<00:02:42.840> down

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
start over and darken everything down

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.320 
start over and darken everything down
again<00:02:43.320> pull<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.400> color<00:02:44.610> in<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.820> little<00:02:45.150> bit

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.670 

you've<00:02:48.330> got<00:02:48.480> some<00:02:48.690> contrast<00:02:49.200> there<00:02:49.440> I

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
you've got some contrast there I

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.530 
you've got some contrast there I
remember<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.340> was<00:02:50.489> telling<00:02:50.640> about<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.120> micron

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
remember I was telling about the micron

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.630 
remember I was telling about the micron
pen<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.470> eye<00:02:52.500> here<00:02:53.070> is<00:02:53.250> gotten<00:02:53.610> a

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
pen this is the eye here is gotten a

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.979 
pen this is the eye here is gotten a
little<00:02:53.790> cloud<00:02:54.030> so<00:02:54.330> I'll<00:02:54.390> take<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.690> micron

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
little cloud so I'll take that micron

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.650 
little cloud so I'll take that micron
pen<00:02:55.489> fill<00:02:56.489> then<00:02:56.700> in<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.910> little<00:02:57.120> bit<00:02:57.269> and<00:02:57.510> make

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
pen fill then in a little bit and make

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.890 
pen fill then in a little bit and make
that<00:02:57.840> so<00:02:58.019> that's<00:02:58.200> more<00:02:58.440> vibrant<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.660> the<00:03:00.660> last

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
that so that's more vibrant and the last

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.150 
that so that's more vibrant and the last
thing<00:03:01.110> I'll<00:03:01.230> do<00:03:01.380> is<00:03:01.530> add<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.680> little<00:03:01.769> bit<00:03:01.980> of

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
thing I'll do is add a little bit of

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.930 
thing I'll do is add a little bit of
color<00:03:02.370> in<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.940> ear<00:03:03.120> because

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.950 

there's<00:03:07.900> your<00:03:08.050> pink<00:03:09.180> little<00:03:10.180> blend<00:03:10.540> there<00:03:10.750> oh

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
there's your pink little blend there oh

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.700 
there's your pink little blend there oh
one<00:03:11.830> more<00:03:12.010> thing<00:03:12.070> I'll<00:03:12.400> take<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.790> dark<00:03:13.710> gray

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
one more thing I'll take the dark gray

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.560 
one more thing I'll take the dark gray
and<00:03:15.070> then<00:03:15.280> add<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.460> little<00:03:15.610> color<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.150> table

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
and then add a little color to the table

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.610 
and then add a little color to the table
two<00:03:16.890> seconds

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.479 

Oh<00:03:23.370> with<00:03:23.879> rads<00:03:24.180> Reds<00:03:24.540> are<00:03:24.660> very<00:03:24.840> tricky<00:03:25.140> I<00:03:25.489> well

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
Oh with rads Reds are very tricky I well

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.759 
Oh with rads Reds are very tricky I well
oftentimes<00:03:26.879> use<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.420> red<00:03:27.810> sharpie<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:28.290> fill<00:03:28.650> in

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
oftentimes use a red sharpie to fill in

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.339 
oftentimes use a red sharpie to fill in
my<00:03:28.920> Reds<00:03:29.220> because<00:03:29.489> red<00:03:30.209> prismacolor<00:03:30.810> red

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
my Reds because red prismacolor red

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.430 
my Reds because red prismacolor red
markers<00:03:31.830> red<00:03:32.129> whatever<00:03:32.629> can<00:03:33.629> be<00:03:33.660> inherently

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
markers red whatever can be inherently

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.949 
markers red whatever can be inherently
troublesome<00:03:35.190> they<00:03:36.120> believe<00:03:36.420> they<00:03:36.720> believe

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
troublesome they believe they believe

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.979 
troublesome they believe they believe
they<00:03:37.349> smear<00:03:37.830> they<00:03:38.819> don't<00:03:39.060> they're<00:03:39.569> hard<00:03:39.840> to

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
they smear they don't they're hard to

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.559 
they smear they don't they're hard to
shade<00:03:40.230> so<00:03:40.560> in<00:03:40.680> this<00:03:40.830> case<00:03:41.069> I<00:03:41.250> used<00:03:41.489> a<00:03:41.849> red

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
shade so in this case I used a red

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.500 
shade so in this case I used a red
sharpie<00:03:43.440> marker<00:03:43.730> and<00:03:44.730> I'll<00:03:44.879> go<00:03:45.000> back<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.239> add

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
sharpie marker and I'll go back and add

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.600 
sharpie marker and I'll go back and add
a<00:03:45.540> little<00:03:45.750> bit<00:03:45.870> more<00:03:46.190> second<00:03:47.190> layer<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.400> create

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
a little bit more second layer to create

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.520 
a little bit more second layer to create
the<00:03:47.849> shading<00:03:48.090> because<00:03:49.080> it's<00:03:49.200> such<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.319> small

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
the shading because it's such a small

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.809 
the shading because it's such a small
area<00:03:49.709> it's<00:03:50.069> not<00:03:50.190> going<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.400> make<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.549> huge

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
area it's not going to make a huge

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.330 
area it's not going to make a huge
amount<00:03:51.090> of<00:03:51.150> difference<00:03:51.860> and<00:03:52.860> you<00:03:53.010> can<00:03:53.160> have<00:03:53.310> a

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
amount of difference and you can have a

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.339 
amount of difference and you can have a
little<00:03:53.549> bit<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:53.819> shading<00:03:54.030> there<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:56.239> Stickles

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
little bit of shading there and Stickles

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.539 
little bit of shading there and Stickles
when<00:03:58.349> you're<00:03:58.470> using<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.829> Stickles<00:03:59.190> use<00:03:59.370> the

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
when you're using the Stickles use the

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.550 
when you're using the Stickles use the
tip<00:03:59.760> to<00:04:00.030> spread<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.630> around<00:04:00.690> a<00:04:01.019> little<00:04:01.140> bit<00:04:01.349> so

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
tip to spread it around a little bit so

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.949 
tip to spread it around a little bit so
it's<00:04:01.680> not<00:04:01.769> quite<00:04:02.040> so<00:04:02.069> thick<00:04:02.329> the<00:04:03.329> thicker<00:04:03.599> it

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
it's not quite so thick the thicker it

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.440 
it's not quite so thick the thicker it
is<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.200> more<00:04:04.440> opaque<00:04:04.799> it<00:04:04.980> becomes<00:04:05.329> and<00:04:06.329> that

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
is the more opaque it becomes and that

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.479 
is the more opaque it becomes and that
becomes<00:04:06.750> a<00:04:06.870> problem<00:04:07.079> and<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:08.040> last<00:04:08.280> thing

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
becomes a problem and the last thing

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.770 
becomes a problem and the last thing
I'll<00:04:08.640> do<00:04:08.790> is<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.030> little<00:04:09.329> bit<00:04:09.450> of<00:04:09.540> shading

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
I'll do is a little bit of shading

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.809 
I'll do is a little bit of shading
underneath<00:04:11.090> and<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.239> bottom<00:04:13.430> we<00:04:14.430> want<00:04:14.640> him<00:04:14.760> to

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
underneath and the bottom we want him to

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.750 
underneath and the bottom we want him to
be<00:04:14.970> standing<00:04:15.360> on<00:04:15.450> something<00:04:16.310> okay<00:04:17.340> this<00:04:17.609> is

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
pink this is blush pink dead and draw

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.420 
pink this is blush pink dead and draw
that<00:04:21.930> underneath<00:04:22.229> remember<00:04:23.160> you're<00:04:23.280> not

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
that underneath remember you're not

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.230 
that underneath remember you're not
going<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.669> touch<00:04:24.060> that<00:04:24.530> q-tip<00:04:25.669> to<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:26.850> blush

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
going to touch that q-tip to the blush
