00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello today here is such a test drive 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.130
 hair dryer 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.120
 Chinese auto companies help to thaw 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.790
 windshield 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.789
 let's show you that now glass is all 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:21.119
 frozen overboard minus 4 minus 5 years 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:26.310
 what we do we include so this 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:33.120
 usually the cigarette lighter we put this hair dryer on 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:34.730
 panel and plant for in this car 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.350
 cold start 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:43.879
 temperature you see at zero niro 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.879
 now lead 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:57.610
 oh how can she be for 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:01:02.130
 so now that we do a hair dryer for some reason not 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:05.620
 buzzed and here the button of the left is about 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:09.510
 The first mode turned on on it and 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:12.310
 need to milk the glass there is such a turbo 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.940
 strongly blows 0 heat then in general 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:20.310
 there is no way to clean 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.310
 experiment turn off the stove to 0 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.700
 put all pen 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:33.410
 and see if it helps at all 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.110
 I bought it in the summer and when I 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.540
 checked you know very easy to him 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.330
 take and convert 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.360
 hot air is even hotter then 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.650
 it's cold now 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.650
 let's see how he handles the tasks 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.070
 he gets off the panel 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.070
 to give him 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.350
 quite able 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.319
 I think it will somehow save 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.970
 that's better to be able to them but it will be on 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.480
 place to stand in general, now we wait 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.480
 for a while 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.900
 and see if it helps at least somehow 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.319
 because here I am now framed 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.540
 Here he is now only blew out warm here 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.910
 a little bit warm don't think it's straight 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.520
 here's your hair dryer that you tumble dry 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.010
 you blow what will be so hot will be 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.330
 for thawing glass visible such 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.330
 warm enough 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.780
 again ki now 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.519
 -four 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.099
 I do not think that he will be very very 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.560
 useful and super fast 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.640
 glass at minus twenty minutes watson 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.160
 It is only half an hour to warm up 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.590
 took drunk in the morning closing well 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.240
 to get to the Crimea shell went to drink tea 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:22.610
 I think many are doing so I also do 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.610
 Look, it's only been there for a couple of minutes. 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.960
 and here we see 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.900
 already such a thawed spot 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.900
 i.e. the process is running 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.120
 Well 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.870
 honestly i can't imagine 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.060
 Now you will need to sit wait 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.390
 to at the elastic question with his 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.390
 using 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.290
 Anyway, you need to turn on the stove and I think 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.150
 for the purity of the experiment, we have already understood 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.150
 that yes he acts 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.349
 with a little minus you can normally 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.770
 turn off as a supplement well, all glass 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:05.480
 you are not from that satin good will be eggs 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:08.090
 warmer with trimmed naturalism in general in winter 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.870
 it's very cold when they go to 2 when u 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.690
 me leather interior leather becomes a stake 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.060
 it's very cold to sit better probably this one 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.600
 between the legs of a hair dryer to throw from him 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.600
 more good 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.040
 or simply 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:28.969
 the situation of the population when they went to drink tea 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.639
 20 grays better than warm up 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:34.779
 like this is a reason to upset glass for a long time 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.779
 but it is so thought out loud 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.610
 let's see which will be better to use 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.610
 it's time for the window to turn on the stove 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:50.060
 this is paired with a stove, it will somehow 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:53.800
 quickly so muzychku include 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.800
 Muzychka you can faster way 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.379
 Well hair dryer is the work it pleases 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.060
 in general if you are interested in someone 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:18.389
 go buy is not on the site will link 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.350
 I bought a moto fell for about sadko 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:24.590
 came out 600 rubles 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:26.270
 This is the cheapest cost model. 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.760
 China in my opinion there is only one hundred fifty 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.390
 or one hundred and seventy rubles he call whom 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.150
 costs about 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:35.960
 Go 106,100 rubles read from time 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.960
 when things can change 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.020
 because he melted like a corner and then 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.350
 weakly it is possible to turbo this 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:53.390
 include 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.390
 and move a little further away 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.460
 as for more circulated 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.949
 so I turned on the turbo look like 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.949
 quickly went to 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:32.279
 But in general , not even warm 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:39.460
 does not have time to heat up 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.370
 so I still have to go back, I want 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:45.090
 strongly betrayed but these two stoves began 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.090
 already work 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.460
 here in a pair can be used in a pair not 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:54.120
 I advise you to use it as a hair dryer 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:57.599
 then there Lada wanted to throw there who does not 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:00.390
 Enough heat wave advice later 

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:02.180
 you are on fire 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:05.630
 on the first day 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.580
 he lives too 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:10.960
 make sure the car is on what 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.960
 battery site 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:19.080
 so just let's mane glass here 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:22.810
 so you can throw seats 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.750
 without seat heating laid 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.210
 while smoking 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.370
 whether the car is warming up all the seat already 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:32.460
 warm and here is such a result 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:36.620
 who is interested in this device take 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.620
