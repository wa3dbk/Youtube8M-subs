00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
straight away of course but I guess you

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.130 
straight away of course but I guess you
get<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.850> ton<00:02:53.060> of<00:02:53.090> viewers<00:02:53.450> for<00:02:53.630> one<00:02:53.750> hour<00:02:53.870> or<00:02:53.990> two

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
get a ton of viewers for one hour or two

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.590 
get a ton of viewers for one hour or two
hours<00:02:54.320> on<00:02:54.680> Saturday<00:02:55.130> evening<00:02:55.490> then<00:02:56.060> try<00:02:56.360> and

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
hours on Saturday evening then try and

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.710 
hours on Saturday evening then try and
pull<00:02:56.750> off<00:02:56.900> sort<00:02:57.470> of<00:02:58.090> 10,000<00:02:59.090> hours<00:02:59.360> of<00:02:59.390> footage

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
pull off sort of 10,000 hours of footage

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.390 
pull off sort of 10,000 hours of footage
with<00:03:00.020> one<00:03:00.200> viewer<00:03:00.500> do<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.040> understand<00:03:01.340> what

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
with one viewer do you understand what

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.680 
with one viewer do you understand what
I'm<00:03:01.490> saying<00:03:01.550> I'd<00:03:01.850> prefer<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.150> get<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.480> quality

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
I'm saying I'd prefer to get the quality

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.300 
I'm saying I'd prefer to get the quality
in<00:03:02.990> there<00:03:03.170> so<00:03:03.530> we<00:03:03.620> do<00:03:03.709> a<00:03:03.740> lot<00:03:03.860> of<00:03:03.950> planning<00:03:04.160> the

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
in there so we do a lot of planning the

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.740 
in there so we do a lot of planning the
preparation<00:03:04.820> to<00:03:04.940> make<00:03:05.120> sure<00:03:05.240> that's<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.600> case

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
preparation to make sure that's the case

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.960 
preparation to make sure that's the case
so<00:03:06.440> that's<00:03:06.709> the<00:03:06.860> idea<00:03:07.130> behind<00:03:07.190> it<00:03:07.550> guys<00:03:07.730> and

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
so that's the idea behind it guys and

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.550 
so that's the idea behind it guys and
that's<00:03:08.300> why<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.510> don't<00:03:08.780> stream<00:03:09.020> my<00:03:09.170> rates<00:03:09.380> if

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
that's why I don't stream my rates if

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.170 
that's why I don't stream my rates if
you<00:03:09.650> guys<00:03:09.860> desperately<00:03:10.490> wants<00:03:10.700> to<00:03:10.730> see<00:03:10.970> that

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
you guys desperately wants to see that

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.210 
you guys desperately wants to see that
and<00:03:11.330> I<00:03:11.420> don't<00:03:11.450> mind<00:03:11.840> just<00:03:12.050> sort<00:03:12.950> of<00:03:12.980> watching

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
and I don't mind just sort of watching

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.920 
and I don't mind just sort of watching
you<00:03:13.400> read<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:13.910> not<00:03:14.000> being<00:03:14.150> involved<00:03:14.480> then

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
you read and not being involved then

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.050 
you read and not being involved then
maybe<00:03:15.740> I'll<00:03:15.980> do<00:03:16.130> it<00:03:16.280> but<00:03:16.400> as<00:03:16.820> a<00:03:16.910> general

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
maybe I'll do it but as a general

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.120 
maybe I'll do it but as a general
feeling<00:03:17.570> it<00:03:17.810> sounds<00:03:18.200> like<00:03:18.320> it's<00:03:18.560> just<00:03:18.800> epic

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130
