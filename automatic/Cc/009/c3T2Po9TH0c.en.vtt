00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.090 

all<00:00:01.050> right<00:00:01.199> so<00:00:01.350> here<00:00:01.500> I'm<00:00:01.589> gonna<00:00:01.770> look<00:00:01.949> at

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
all right so here I'm gonna look at

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.130 
all right so here I'm gonna look at
another<00:00:02.129> example<00:00:02.520> of<00:00:03.179> subtracting<00:00:03.810> whole

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
another example of subtracting whole

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.010 
another example of subtracting whole
numbers<00:00:04.200> so<00:00:05.069> in<00:00:05.430> Part<00:00:06.180> A<00:00:06.299> we<00:00:06.480> have<00:00:06.509> four

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
numbers so in Part A we have four

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.780 
numbers so in Part A we have four
hundred<00:00:07.170> twelve<00:00:07.620> thousand<00:00:08.220> three<00:00:08.670> hundred

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
hundred twelve thousand three hundred

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.480 
hundred twelve thousand three hundred
forty<00:00:09.120> seven<00:00:09.660> minus<00:00:10.349> two<00:00:10.769> hundred<00:00:10.860> sixteen

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
forty seven minus two hundred sixteen

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.700 
forty seven minus two hundred sixteen
thousand<00:00:12.030> five<00:00:12.420> hundred<00:00:12.630> seventeen<00:00:13.380> I'm

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
thousand five hundred seventeen I'm

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.820 
thousand five hundred seventeen I'm
gonna<00:00:14.009> do<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.280> one<00:00:14.400> first

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
gonna do that one first

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.120 
gonna do that one first
so<00:00:16.830> my<00:00:16.980> first<00:00:17.160> column<00:00:18.470> there's<00:00:19.470> no<00:00:19.619> problem<00:00:20.039> I

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
so my first column there's no problem I

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.939 
so my first column there's no problem I
don't<00:00:20.189> have<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.430> borrow<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.680> digit<00:00:22.680> from<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
don't have to borrow a digit from the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.160 
don't have to borrow a digit from the
next<00:00:23.189> column<00:00:23.400> or<00:00:23.670> anything<00:00:23.820> as<00:00:24.269> long<00:00:24.869> as<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
next column or anything as long as the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.990 
next column or anything as long as the
number<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.560> top<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.070> greater<00:00:26.400> than<00:00:26.670> or<00:00:26.849> equal

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
number on top is greater than or equal

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.480 
number on top is greater than or equal
to<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.510> number<00:00:27.779> on<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.960> bottom<00:00:28.189> we<00:00:29.189> can<00:00:29.310> just

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
to the number on the bottom we can just

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.999 
to the number on the bottom we can just
do<00:00:29.609> our<00:00:29.640> subtraction<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.750> seven<00:00:31.230> minus<00:00:31.650> seven

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
do our subtraction so seven minus seven

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.000 
do our subtraction so seven minus seven
is<00:00:32.369> gonna<00:00:32.700> leave<00:00:32.880> us<00:00:32.910> with<00:00:33.210> zero<00:00:33.620> if<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.710> look<00:00:34.890> at

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
is gonna leave us with zero if I look at

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.930 
is gonna leave us with zero if I look at
my<00:00:35.100> next<00:00:35.399> column<00:00:35.719> well<00:00:36.719> four<00:00:37.170> minus<00:00:38.040> one<00:00:38.579> is

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
my next column well four minus one is

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.110 
my next column well four minus one is
gonna<00:00:39.210> leave<00:00:39.480> us<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:39.840> three<00:00:40.610> well<00:00:41.610> now<00:00:41.730> this

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
gonna leave us with three well now this

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.540 
gonna leave us with three well now this
is<00:00:42.270> our<00:00:42.420> first<00:00:42.750> kind<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.079> against<00:00:44.040> spot<00:00:44.309> where

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
is our first kind of against spot where

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.310 
is our first kind of against spot where
we<00:00:44.640> have<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.910> be<00:00:45.000> careful<00:00:45.480> because<00:00:45.960> now<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
we have to be careful because now the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.479 
we have to be careful because now the
number<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:47.600> top<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.930> larger<00:00:49.530> than<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> number

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
number on top is larger than the number

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.850 
number on top is larger than the number
on<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.910> bottom<00:00:51.170> so<00:00:52.170> if<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.350> think<00:00:52.440> about<00:00:52.620> it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
on the bottom so if you think about it

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.350 
on the bottom so if you think about it
if<00:00:52.920> you've<00:00:53.039> got<00:00:53.070> three<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.789> sense<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.180> guess

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
if you've got three in a sense I guess

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.600 
if you've got three in a sense I guess
somebody<00:00:54.690> couldn't<00:00:54.960> take<00:00:55.199> away<00:00:55.350> five<00:00:55.949> well

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
somebody couldn't take away five well

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.310 
somebody couldn't take away five well
you<00:00:56.760> can<00:00:57.030> you've<00:00:57.239> got<00:00:57.390> negative<00:00:57.809> numbers<00:00:58.199> of

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you can you've got negative numbers of

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.110 
you can you've got negative numbers of
course<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:58.890> again<00:00:58.980> when<00:00:59.699> we<00:00:59.789> do<00:00:59.910> subtraction

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
course but again when we do subtraction

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.229 
course but again when we do subtraction
that's<00:01:00.780> not<00:01:00.960> how<00:01:01.170> we<00:01:01.230> do<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:01.980> if<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.940> number

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
that's not how we do it so if the number

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.230 
that's not how we do it so if the number
on<00:01:03.359> top<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:04.250> smaller<00:01:05.250> than<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.729> number<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
on top is smaller than the number on the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.510 
on top is smaller than the number on the
bottom<00:01:06.390> what<00:01:07.170> we<00:01:07.290> do<00:01:07.439> again<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:07.950> borrow<00:01:08.430> a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
bottom what we do again is we borrow a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.500 
bottom what we do again is we borrow a
digit<00:01:08.970> from<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.270> next<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.500> next<00:01:10.740> column<00:01:11.510> so

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
digit from the next the next column so

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.510 
digit from the next the next column so
instead<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.990> two<00:01:13.590> I'm<00:01:13.890> gonna<00:01:14.100> bump<00:01:14.340> this

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
instead of a two I'm gonna bump this

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.359 
instead of a two I'm gonna bump this
down<00:01:14.760> by<00:01:14.970> one<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.650> well<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.950> would<00:01:17.070> make<00:01:17.220> it

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
down by one and well that would make it

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.940 
down by one and well that would make it
into<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> 1<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.270> instead<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.409> three<00:01:19.710> I'm

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
into a 1 and instead of a three I'm

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.890 
into a 1 and instead of a three I'm
gonna<00:01:20.159> now<00:01:20.340> pretend<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.210> thirteen

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
gonna now pretend this is a thirteen

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.300 
gonna now pretend this is a thirteen
okay<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:22.950> I'm<00:01:23.130> kind<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.340> borrowing<00:01:25.159> you<00:01:26.159> know

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
okay so I'm kind of borrowing you know

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.450 
okay so I'm kind of borrowing you know
one<00:01:26.610> digit<00:01:27.030> from<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.360> next<00:01:27.689> column<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.920> 13

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
one digit from that next column so 13

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.580 
one digit from that next column so 13
minus<00:01:29.490> five<00:01:30.299> well<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.960> do<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.320> that's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
minus five well we can do that that's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.609 
minus five well we can do that that's
gonna<00:01:31.710> leave<00:01:31.979> us<00:01:32.009> with<00:01:32.250> eight<00:01:33.380> all<00:01:34.380> right<00:01:34.500> but

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
gonna leave us with eight all right but

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.260 
gonna leave us with eight all right but
now<00:01:34.740> we've<00:01:34.920> really<00:01:35.130> got<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.490> same<00:01:35.729> problem

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
now we've really got the same problem

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.510 
now we've really got the same problem
again<00:01:36.630> because<00:01:37.409> now<00:01:37.560> I'm<00:01:37.710> thinking<00:01:38.070> about<00:01:38.130> one

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
again because now I'm thinking about one

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.210 
again because now I'm thinking about one
minus<00:01:38.970> six<00:01:39.270> well<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:40.170> number<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:40.740> top<00:01:40.979> is

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
minus six well the number on top is

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.700 
minus six well the number on top is
smaller<00:01:41.840> so<00:01:42.840> what<00:01:43.020> I'm<00:01:43.110> gonna<00:01:43.229> have<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.530> do

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
smaller so what I'm gonna have to do

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.249 
smaller so what I'm gonna have to do
again<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.369> borrow<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.880> digit<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.750> instead<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.110> a

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
again is borrow a digit so instead of a

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.710 
again is borrow a digit so instead of a
one<00:01:46.530> I'm<00:01:46.740> gonna<00:01:46.860> make<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.280> into<00:01:47.640> one<00:01:48.270> smaller

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
one I'm gonna make this into one smaller

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.770 
one I'm gonna make this into one smaller
which<00:01:49.259> again<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.829> zero<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:51.299> again<00:01:51.540> then<00:01:51.689> we

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
which again is a zero and again then we

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.260 
which again is a zero and again then we
just<00:01:51.960> tack<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> one<00:01:52.590> in<00:01:52.890> front<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.250> our<00:01:53.430> original

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
just tack a one in front of our original

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.459 
just tack a one in front of our original
number<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.960> now<00:01:55.799> we<00:01:55.860> have<00:01:56.130> 11<00:01:56.640> minus<00:01:57.450> six<00:01:58.229> which

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
number so now we have 11 minus six which

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.410 
number so now we have 11 minus six which
is<00:01:58.530> gonna<00:01:58.740> give<00:01:58.920> us<00:01:59.070> five<00:01:59.369> you<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.149> just<00:02:00.270> drop

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
is gonna give us five you can just drop

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.780 
is gonna give us five you can just drop
down<00:02:00.630> or<00:02:00.810> comma<00:02:01.100> again<00:02:02.100> we've<00:02:02.460> got<00:02:02.640> this

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
down or comma again we've got this

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.260 
down or comma again we've got this
problem<00:02:03.180> again<00:02:03.930> because<00:02:04.880> now<00:02:05.880> we<00:02:05.939> have<00:02:06.240> zero

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
problem again because now we have zero

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.440 
problem again because now we have zero
minus<00:02:07.049> one<00:02:07.610> well<00:02:08.610> I'm<00:02:08.819> gonna<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.149> borrow

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
minus one well I'm gonna have to borrow

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.080 
minus one well I'm gonna have to borrow
a<00:02:09.660> digit<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.379> instead<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.800> a

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
a digit so instead of a

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.690 
a digit so instead of a
or<00:02:11.180> this<00:02:11.569> is<00:02:11.720> gonna<00:02:11.959> become<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.290> three<00:02:12.709> again<00:02:13.580> we

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
or this is gonna become a three again we

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.949 
or this is gonna become a three again we
just<00:02:13.790> put<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.090> 1<00:02:14.330> out<00:02:14.480> front<00:02:14.770> 10<00:02:15.770> minus<00:02:16.160> 1<00:02:16.190> is<00:02:16.730> 9

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
just put a 1 out front 10 minus 1 is 9

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.479 
just put a 1 out front 10 minus 1 is 9
and<00:02:17.959> then<00:02:18.380> 3<00:02:18.800> minus<00:02:19.040> 2<00:02:19.730> is<00:02:20.150> 1<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.099> says<00:02:22.250> if<00:02:22.370> we

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
and then 3 minus 2 is 1 so it says if we

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.610 
and then 3 minus 2 is 1 so it says if we
do<00:02:22.640> our<00:02:22.670> subtraction<00:02:22.970> it<00:02:23.660> says<00:02:23.989> our<00:02:24.170> final

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
do our subtraction it says our final

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.020 
do our subtraction it says our final
answer<00:02:25.010> will<00:02:25.340> be<00:02:26.170> 190<00:02:27.910> 5830

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
answer will be 190 5830

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.440 
answer will be 190 5830
and<00:02:29.390> I<00:02:30.080> think<00:02:30.260> I'll<00:02:30.349> do<00:02:30.500> Part<00:02:30.769> B<00:02:30.830> here<00:02:31.360> just<00:02:32.360> as

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
and I think I'll do Part B here just as

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.200 
and I think I'll do Part B here just as
a<00:02:32.480> separate<00:02:32.930> example
