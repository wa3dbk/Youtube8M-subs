00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
um so one out of every four Americans

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.890 
um so one out of every four Americans
thinks<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.759> Sun<00:00:27.029> revolves<00:00:27.570> around<00:00:27.660> the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
thinks that the Sun revolves around the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.450 
thinks that the Sun revolves around the
earth<00:00:27.960> what<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.529> think<00:00:31.369> what<00:00:32.369> do<00:00:32.430> you

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
earth what do you think what do you

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.680 
earth what do you think what do you
think<00:00:33.560> okay<00:00:34.560> awesome<00:00:34.710> thank<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.730> think<00:00:36.540> I'm

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
think okay awesome thank you I think I'm

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.940 
think okay awesome thank you I think I'm
just<00:00:36.720> like<00:00:36.990> picture<00:00:37.350> what<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.620> wanted<00:00:37.860> to

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
just like picture what you wanted to

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:46.490 
just like picture what you wanted to
like<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.780> model<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:43.699> think<00:00:44.699> that<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:46.170> Sun

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
like that model I think that the Sun

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.639 
like that model I think that the Sun
does<00:00:46.739> not<00:00:46.770> revolve<00:00:47.340> around<00:00:47.550> here<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.649> think

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
does not revolve around here I think

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.260 
does not revolve around here I think
that<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:49.890> pretty<00:00:50.100> much<00:00:50.280> proven<00:00:50.699> fact<00:00:51.030> at

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
that it's pretty much proven fact at

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.650 
that it's pretty much proven fact at
this<00:00:51.420> point<00:00:51.750> anyone<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.230> proves<00:00:52.620> otherwise

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
this point anyone that proves otherwise

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.160 
this point anyone that proves otherwise
doesn't<00:00:54.660> really<00:00:54.719> know<00:00:54.899> what<00:00:54.930> they're<00:00:55.109> talking

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
doesn't really know what they're talking

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.860 
doesn't really know what they're talking
about<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:56.039> think<00:00:56.789> all<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:56.969> minerals<00:00:57.149> rumors<00:00:57.750> I

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
about I think all the minerals rumors I

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.110 
about I think all the minerals rumors I
know<00:00:58.019> that<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.260> think<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.100> got<00:00:59.309> them<00:00:59.519> isn't<00:01:00.000> this

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
know that I think I got them isn't this

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.029 
know that I think I got them isn't this
end<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> central<00:01:00.930> part<00:01:01.199> yeah<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.649> know<00:01:01.710> y'all

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
end the central part yeah I know y'all

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.619 
end the central part yeah I know y'all
about<00:01:02.219> over<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> Sun<00:01:03.000> guys<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.359> all<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
about over on the Sun guys like all the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.240 
about over on the Sun guys like all the
planets<00:01:03.960> go<00:01:04.140> out<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.379> like<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> line<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.100> like

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
planets go out in like a line in like

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.710 
planets go out in like a line in like
the<00:01:05.370> diagram<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.850> they'll<00:01:05.970> come<00:01:06.060> right<00:01:06.540> yeah

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the diagram and they'll come right yeah

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.810 
the diagram and they'll come right yeah
that's<00:01:07.440> what<00:01:07.620> we<00:01:07.710> did<00:01:07.890> yeah<00:01:08.100> i<00:01:08.400> would<00:01:08.640> say

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
that's what we did yeah i would say

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.920 
that's what we did yeah i would say
twenty-five<00:01:09.479> percent<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.900> u.s.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
twenty-five percent of the u.s.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.860 
twenty-five percent of the u.s.
population

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.300 

I<00:01:15.220> think<00:01:16.220> that's<00:01:16.400> kind<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:16.790> ridiculous<00:01:18.310> kind

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
I think that's kind of ridiculous kind

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.920 
I think that's kind of ridiculous kind
of<00:01:19.400> lost<00:01:19.580> my<00:01:19.730> faith<00:01:19.880> in<00:01:20.060> humanity<00:01:20.090> I<00:01:20.600> didn't

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
of lost my faith in humanity I didn't

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:33.910 
of lost my faith in humanity I didn't
know<00:01:21.020> that<00:01:31.690> they're<00:01:32.690> not<00:01:32.720> they're<00:01:33.590> not<00:01:33.620> Blue's

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
know that they're not they're not Blue's

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.800 
know that they're not they're not Blue's
Clues<00:01:34.040> anymore<00:01:34.730> are<00:01:34.940> we<00:01:35.060> not<00:01:35.210> teaching<00:01:35.630> that

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
Clues anymore are we not teaching that

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.920 
Clues anymore are we not teaching that
to<00:01:36.050> little<00:01:36.320> kids<00:01:36.940> I<00:01:37.940> mean<00:01:38.240> I<00:01:38.270> could<00:01:38.570> see<00:01:38.750> that

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
to little kids I mean I could see that

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.930 
to little kids I mean I could see that
because<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.740> Sun<00:01:40.010> looks<00:01:40.340> like<00:01:40.520> it's<00:01:40.700> moving

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
because the Sun looks like it's moving

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.480 
because the Sun looks like it's moving
within<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.540> sky<00:01:41.810> but<00:01:42.770> clearly<00:01:43.070> they<00:01:43.250> didn't

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
within the sky but clearly they didn't

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.950 
within the sky but clearly they didn't
learn<00:01:43.580> that<00:01:43.640> in<00:01:43.850> school<00:01:43.940> that<00:01:44.480> we<00:01:44.660> revolve

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
learn that in school that we revolve

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.190 
learn that in school that we revolve
around<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.380> sucking<00:01:45.800> so<00:01:46.100> they<00:01:47.000> should<00:01:47.240> look

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
around the sucking so they should look

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.930 
around the sucking so they should look
that<00:01:48.350> up<00:01:48.410> on<00:01:48.620> Google<00:01:51.280> some<00:01:52.280> doesn't<00:01:52.640> revolve

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
that up on Google some doesn't revolve

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.340 
that up on Google some doesn't revolve
around<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.330> earth<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:56.420> planets<00:01:56.930> rotate

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
around the earth the planets rotate

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.450 
around the earth the planets rotate
around

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
around

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.149 
around
its<00:01:59.460> gravitational<00:02:00.329> pull<00:02:02.840> I<00:02:04.009> believe<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
its gravitational pull I believe the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.600 
its gravitational pull I believe the
Earth<00:02:05.310> revolves<00:02:05.610> around<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.970> Sun<00:02:07.459> Sun<00:02:08.459> is

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
Earth revolves around the Sun Sun is

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.780 
Earth revolves around the Sun Sun is
more<00:02:08.789> gravity<00:02:09.470> formidable<00:02:10.470> mechanics<00:02:10.920> on

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
more gravity formidable mechanics on

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.940 
more gravity formidable mechanics on
that<00:02:12.030> from<00:02:12.209> kerbal<00:02:12.750> space<00:02:12.780> day<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.590> seems

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
that from kerbal space day it seems

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.240 
that from kerbal space day it seems
ridiculous<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.880> people<00:02:15.300> would<00:02:15.810> think<00:02:16.019> that

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
ridiculous that people would think that

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.759 
ridiculous that people would think that
the<00:02:17.599> Sun<00:02:18.599> revolves<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.230> earth<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:21.769> believe

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
the Sun revolves on the earth I believe

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.780 
the Sun revolves on the earth I believe
that<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.910> Earth<00:02:24.150> revolves<00:02:24.870> around<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.380> Sun

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
that the Earth revolves around the Sun

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.250 
that the Earth revolves around the Sun
because<00:02:26.790> I<00:02:26.940> was<00:02:27.090> taught<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.360> in<00:02:27.720> elementary

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
because I was taught that in elementary

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.120 
because I was taught that in elementary
school<00:02:28.530> Sam<00:02:29.190> Sam<00:02:30.110> they<00:02:31.110> need<00:02:31.290> access<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.799> the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
school Sam Sam they need access to the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.220 
school Sam Sam they need access to the
Internet<00:02:32.489> I<00:02:32.760> think<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.870> Earth<00:02:33.989> revolves

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
Internet I think that the Earth revolves

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.009 
Internet I think that the Earth revolves
around<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.560> Sun<00:02:35.239> it's<00:02:36.239> just<00:02:36.480> kind<00:02:36.810> of<00:02:36.840> what

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
around the Sun it's just kind of what

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.620 
around the Sun it's just kind of what
we're<00:02:37.170> taught<00:02:37.830> growing<00:02:38.100> up<00:02:38.430> is<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.880> we<00:02:39.540> were

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
we're taught growing up is that we were

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.600 
we're taught growing up is that we were
all<00:02:39.720> rounded<00:02:40.250> they're<00:02:41.250> not<00:02:41.400> very<00:02:41.610> smart

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
all rounded they're not very smart

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.300 
all rounded they're not very smart
because<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.880> can<00:02:45.060> obviously<00:02:45.390> tell<00:02:46.160> one<00:02:47.160> in

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
because you can obviously tell one in

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.740 
because you can obviously tell one in
four<00:02:47.519> Americans<00:02:47.640> like<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.269> center<00:02:48.600> of<00:02:48.630> all

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
four Americans like the center of all

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.050 
four Americans like the center of all
