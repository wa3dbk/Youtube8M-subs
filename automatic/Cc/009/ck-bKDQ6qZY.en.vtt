00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 we untied we signalized in 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:07.649
 minecraft a tip 7.10 let's see a 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.440
 mod but before we have here a jungle and 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.740
 not far from the jungle it appeared that 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.320
 appeared around more or less then 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.850
 let's look first what there is 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.070
 gossip and maybe we get one 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.560
 little thing of the mod 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.220
 d 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.939
 plus 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.939
 Beach 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.279
 hurt 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.220
 others instead of an arrow was ready 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.970
 seriously 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.970
 from here too 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.520
 what good god 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:48.260
 good 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.260
 and here it would not be so many 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.829
 because it loses its time 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.579
 the one of this hand you for sale 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.030
 quite often the bookstore 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.539
 to see mola knows all the time that is 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.539
 different 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.079
 but it seems that I disappear 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.490
 some is good 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.549
 I still had not said that I was going to the boat 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.460
 but the rest bothers me the 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:21.030
 question is that this mode adds these 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.590
 Luttwak sachets is called with tear 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.290
 disappeared one I do not know why he has 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.050
 missing 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:32.270
 but all this well 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:37.030
 right now and there were the dispensers 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.030
 because it's one that 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.159
 efficiency 4 protection 3 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.619
 fashion 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.479
 takes a lot and tells us the percentage of 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.979
 let it be released by the monsters a 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:53.200
 40% the many passive cows chickens 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.399
 and that 20 percent and other players 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.009
 10 percent 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.240
 yes yes we can put the skills and the 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.460
 kill other people because they can give us 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.530
 this 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:08.200
 ok this did not have much 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:11.130
 he's cool as the bike is worth gold 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.130
 these and here 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.290
 let's try killing chickens of these 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.960
 Take the first one before, the more you let go 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.110
 third so 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.730
 They are white and the bags are cool 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.860
 I have a lot of vice 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.650
 drop little things like that a lot 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.569
 wait with him I almost forgot the 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.760
 seed 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:39.700
 and the east temple we're going to put the 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:42.280
 coordinates here and so ready but no no 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:47.200
 do not 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:50.010
 these have a 20 chance that 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.659
 put the coordinates 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:58.260
 right here not x 293 and well it does not matter 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:59.909
 because the bicycle height 227 in case 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.010
 it interests the time this the jungle that 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:03.780
 I never found them 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.640
 I find rare seeds again 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.049
 he never has not given me what 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.519
 have my against these temples but good 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:13.099
 here that there is good is not bad to see 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:16.349
 in many cases it is more your villa 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.819
 that also has to be said but it is 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:21.569
 pretty white and today we're going to take off 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.100
 everything we put this and zombie by 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.120
 example 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.489
 I really rocks 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:32.040
 because if you have a spam you have this 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.040
 infinite if you want or not 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.100
 these have 40% of this is more likely 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.350
 let us go go kick bag 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.970
 for you 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.110
 I do not know if he can let us know he is not going to 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.050
 drop so far never diamond 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.030
 so 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.540
 and now it turns out that I get it earlier in the 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.540
 chickens that these 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:00.230
 and three iron is also worth it costs me 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.510
 A few 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:08.340
 and I want to check a potato out 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.220
 is the horse also for being cool 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.400
 but out wants to check pants 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.480
 of irons and diamond a hair ander 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.930
 governments as other anything in 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.609
 one of these gold 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.090
 and good to make the iron 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.360
 the blue row and iron 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:31.080
 nothing interesting is worth all the 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.150
 bags are all all this one had 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.070
 diamond three diamonds there is everything 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.030
 from iron peaks the most arid 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:41.160
 it also counts one armor left 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.800
 of diamond horse also apart from 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.810
 gold 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.849
 something I love I lie if every mind that 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.069
 I get a little bit more waste 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:52.460
 what else but it's funny but good 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:56.720
 it's curious 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:59.150
 it's pretty white and any bug we 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.430
 you can drop this and it comes out in all 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.349
 the chests and you have seen it even in 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.680
 the dispensers I was expecting a flex 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:10.190
 It turns out a sack but good I hope that 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.900
 you have liked to wait for 1.7 point 10 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.139
 it is installed with forge et cetera as 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.139
 forever 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.270
 bye
