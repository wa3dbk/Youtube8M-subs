00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.909
 150 of butter 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:22.429
 his competitor hbos

 250 grams of flour 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:26.829
 2nd step 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.039
 and of course the relief fund 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.210
 in a first real time 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.789
 why his life 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.710

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.710
 flour 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.660
 if united in plots is released beforehand 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.810
 ten minutes 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.290
 in recipes 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.079
 we will see then in the viewfinder of the om will be made the Saharawi people 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.820
 I will mix in a simple way it's gone 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.200
 and while we look in the mixer to richard laberge 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.560
 mix all the insurance that most often the top 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.700
 once the mayor 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.470
 julien sanded 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.760
 like this one 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.760
 you will be able to start catching up 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.790
 55 years ago a job 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.750
 and the other hen 2 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.060
 whose act so it's well added 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.790
 to the mix to the youngest 2 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.240
 and for the continent 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.400
 annexed of course 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.400
 all forms round tension underneath 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.420
 a little after 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.010
 while the modem like this 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.010
 you can start 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.440
 the body 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.230
 and drop them in a favorite dish 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.140
 to rework 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.940
 a little bit to the death 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.760
 It may have happened in addition to being a bit too 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.530
 h kits 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.249
 to note a few drops of water 

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:57.079
 and in politics suspected by m do not hesitate who worked 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.220
 appliances 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.720
 mix well 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.210
 it's true this recipe of this concert mixer of course 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.360
 So here is 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.990
 as we can see the kretschmer homeland i'm working in the 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.990
 plan at the bar so that everything is homogeneous 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:16.399
 so all you have left is 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:20.249
 and to the philosophy of this state take your dough drop them in a movie 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:21.969
 alimentary 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.969
 and preserve there for you 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:29.919
 I do not know why they are as I put you to his sovereignty 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:33.979
 for that the engines so a little talk for the lemon pie or 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:37.669
 sure used for chauray chick for purposes of investigated 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.849
 So that's the gesture the Sudan players take over 

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:06.229
 c 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:11.400
