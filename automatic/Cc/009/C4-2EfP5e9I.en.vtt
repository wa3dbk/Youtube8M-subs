when<00:02:53.110> they<00:02:53.290> zoom<00:02:53.980> in<00:02:54.220> showing<00:02:54.670> flash<00:02:54.940> in<00:02:55.330> the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
when they zoom in showing flash in the

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.399 
when they zoom in showing flash in the
mid<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:56.020> late<00:02:56.290> game<00:02:56.620> he<00:02:57.220> is<00:02:57.340> just<00:02:57.459> completely

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
mid to late game he is just completely

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.369 
mid to late game he is just completely
focused<00:02:59.969> I'd<00:03:00.969> say<00:03:01.269> he's<00:03:01.510> probably<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.140> best

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
focused I'd say he's probably the best

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.830 
focused I'd say he's probably the best
at<00:03:02.650> late<00:03:02.980> game<00:03:03.280> of<00:03:03.579> any<00:03:04.239> player

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
at late game of any player

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.960 
at late game of any player
out<00:03:04.870> there<00:03:05.110> just<00:03:05.800> because<00:03:06.040> he<00:03:06.340> can<00:03:06.489> just<00:03:06.730> focus

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
out there just because he can just focus

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.119 
out there just because he can just focus
so<00:03:07.390> well<00:03:07.660> do<00:03:07.930> so<00:03:08.230> many<00:03:08.349> different<00:03:08.590> things<00:03:08.800> at

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
so well do so many different things at

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.820 
so well do so many different things at
once<00:03:09.599> so<00:03:10.599> that's<00:03:10.750> why<00:03:10.900> I<00:03:10.930> thinks<00:03:11.290> free<00:03:11.590> should

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
once so that's why I thinks free should

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.430 
once so that's why I thinks free should
go<00:03:11.980> for<00:03:12.310> the<00:03:13.150> gate<00:03:13.330> for<00:03:13.629> the<00:03:13.660> game<00:03:13.989> Enders

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
go for the gate for the game Enders

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.880 
go for the gate for the game Enders
early<00:03:15.040> go<00:03:15.790> try<00:03:16.330> to<00:03:16.360> end<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.080> game<00:03:17.110> a<00:03:17.379> little

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
early go try to end the game a little

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.339 
early go try to end the game a little
bit<00:03:18.069> earlier<00:03:18.580> than<00:03:19.300> most<00:03:19.480> Protoss<00:03:19.900> players<00:03:20.140> do

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
bit earlier than most Protoss players do

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.009 
bit earlier than most Protoss players do
I<00:03:20.440> mean<00:03:20.590> most<00:03:20.739> Protoss<00:03:21.580> players<00:03:22.019> unusually

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
I mean most Protoss players unusually

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.710 
I mean most Protoss players unusually
will<00:03:23.260> try<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.590> compete<00:03:24.069> with<00:03:24.280> flash<00:03:24.580> as<00:03:24.940> far<00:03:25.569> as

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
will try to compete with flash as far as

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.619 
will try to compete with flash as far as
the<00:03:26.220> macro<00:03:27.220> goes<00:03:27.430> they'll<00:03:27.640> try<00:03:27.760> to<00:03:27.819> out<00:03:28.000> macro

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
the macro goes they'll try to out macro

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.330 
the macro goes they'll try to out macro
flash<00:03:28.900> keep<00:03:29.200> up<00:03:29.349> with<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.530> number<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.920> faces

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
flash keep up with the number of faces

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.400 
flash keep up with the number of faces
and<00:03:30.489> I<00:03:30.970> think<00:03:31.209> that's<00:03:31.390> suicide<00:03:31.930> I<00:03:31.959> mean<00:03:32.230> there

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
and I think that's suicide I mean there

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.860 
and I think that's suicide I mean there
is<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.530> small<00:03:32.890> window<00:03:33.160> there<00:03:33.580> if<00:03:33.970> you're

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
is a small window there if you're

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.059 
is a small window there if you're
keeping<00:03:35.019> up<00:03:35.260> with<00:03:35.349> a<00:03:35.410> macro<00:03:35.769> if<00:03:35.890> you're<00:03:36.040> a

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
keeping up with a macro if you're a

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.500 
keeping up with a macro if you're a
little<00:03:36.220> bit<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.610> for<00:03:36.760> your<00:03:36.849> couple<00:03:37.180> bases

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
little bit you for your couple bases

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.440 
little bit you for your couple bases
over<00:03:37.750> flash<00:03:38.049> there<00:03:38.799> is<00:03:38.950> a<00:03:38.980> window<00:03:39.790> there<00:03:40.150> that

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
over flash there is a window there that

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.300 
over flash there is a window there that
you<00:03:40.540> can<00:03:40.780> attack<00:03:41.170> and<00:03:41.440> take<00:03:41.590> flash<00:03:41.860> out<00:03:42.099> but

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
you can attack and take flash out but

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.430 
you can attack and take flash out but
it's<00:03:42.430> such<00:03:42.549> a<00:03:42.579> small<00:03:42.819> window<00:03:43.209> and<00:03:43.569> flash<00:03:44.079> is<00:03:44.290> so

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
it's such a small window and flash is so

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.170 
it's such a small window and flash is so
good<00:03:44.650> at<00:03:44.769> going<00:03:44.860> out<00:03:45.069> with<00:03:45.190> those<00:03:45.340> pushes<00:03:45.940> and

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
good at going out with those pushes and

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.720 
good at going out with those pushes and
taking<00:03:47.049> down<00:03:47.260> two<00:03:47.560> maybe<00:03:47.829> three<00:03:48.160> bases<00:03:48.579> at

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
taking down two maybe three bases at

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.759 
taking down two maybe three bases at
once<00:03:48.970> with<00:03:49.450> one<00:03:49.750> push<00:03:50.079> that<00:03:50.379> is<00:03:50.530> what<00:03:50.680> he's

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
once with one push that is what he's

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.759 
once with one push that is what he's
best<00:03:51.010> at<00:03:51.690> especially<00:03:52.690> at<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.840> Protoss<00:03:53.170> is<00:03:53.410> out

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
best at especially at the Protoss is out

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.390 
best at especially at the Protoss is out

sorry<00:04:01.120> I<00:04:01.329> had<00:04:01.840> to<00:04:01.870> all<00:04:02.799> right<00:04:03.010> back<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.400> the

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
sorry I had to all right back to the

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.619 
sorry I had to all right back to the
game<00:04:04.590> gateway<00:04:05.590> coming<00:04:06.160> up<00:04:06.310> and<00:04:06.549> flash<00:04:07.450> is

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
game gateway coming up and flash is

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.500 
game gateway coming up and flash is
actually<00:04:07.930> walling<00:04:08.290> off<00:04:08.440> into<00:04:09.069> his<00:04:09.510> natural

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
actually walling off into his natural

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.800 
actually walling off into his natural
expansion<00:04:10.840> so<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:11.410> looks<00:04:11.560> like<00:04:11.620> he's<00:04:11.829> going<00:04:12.010> to

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
expansion so it looks like he's going to

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.520 
expansion so it looks like he's going to
expand<00:04:13.810> pretty<00:04:14.049> quick<00:04:15.150> now<00:04:16.150> free<00:04:16.570> free<00:04:17.229> free

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
expand pretty quick now free free free

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.050 
expand pretty quick now free free free
free<00:04:17.859> are<00:04:18.130> you<00:04:18.250> going<00:04:18.549> to<00:04:18.669> do<00:04:18.760> something

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
free are you going to do something

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.270 
free are you going to do something
tricky<00:04:19.600> you<00:04:20.530> could<00:04:20.680> definitely<00:04:20.799> do<00:04:21.099> it<00:04:21.130> on

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
tricky you could definitely do it on

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.089 
tricky you could definitely do it on
this<00:04:21.400> map<00:04:21.639> this<00:04:21.940> would<00:04:22.060> be<00:04:22.090> a<00:04:22.180> good<00:04:22.330> map<00:04:22.539> to<00:04:23.099> put

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
this map this would be a good map to put

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.100 
this map this would be a good map to put
a<00:04:24.130> proxy<00:04:24.729> robotics<00:04:25.210> facility<00:04:25.300> down<00:04:25.840> I<00:04:25.870> think

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
a proxy robotics facility down I think

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.050 
a proxy robotics facility down I think
there<00:04:26.800> are<00:04:26.950> little<00:04:27.130> areas<00:04:27.520> to<00:04:27.669> the<00:04:27.700> side<00:04:28.030> of

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
there are little areas to the side of

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.430 
there are little areas to the side of
the<00:04:28.300> bases<00:04:28.690> where<00:04:29.139> flash<00:04:29.410> might<00:04:29.830> not<00:04:30.099> scout

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
the bases where flash might not scout

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.170 
the bases where flash might not scout
bar<00:04:32.440> grand<00:04:32.889> I<00:04:33.220> think<00:04:33.610> that<00:04:33.729> was<00:04:33.849> a<00:04:33.910> different

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
bar grand I think that was a different

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.580 
bar grand I think that was a different
language<00:04:34.479> that<00:04:34.660> I<00:04:34.690> don't<00:04:34.960> understand<00:04:35.349> but<00:04:35.530> the

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
language that I don't understand but the

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.310 
language that I don't understand but the
cybernetics<00:04:36.039> core<00:04:36.220> on<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.520> way<00:04:36.750> then<00:04:37.750> free<00:04:38.169> is

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
cybernetics core on the way then free is

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.810 
cybernetics core on the way then free is
going<00:04:38.620> out<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.889> scout<00:04:39.130> he's<00:04:39.340> gonna<00:04:39.490> scout<00:04:39.700> in

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
going out the scout he's gonna scout in

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.070 
going out the scout he's gonna scout in
the<00:04:39.849> very<00:04:40.210> last<00:04:40.510> direction<00:04:41.039> unfortunately

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
the very last direction unfortunately

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.270 
the very last direction unfortunately
but<00:04:44.080> yeah<00:04:44.229> I<00:04:44.260> was<00:04:44.410> thinking<00:04:44.770> about<00:04:44.830> fries

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
but yeah I was thinking about fries

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.670 
but yeah I was thinking about fries
chances<00:04:45.760> going<00:04:45.940> into<00:04:46.330> this<00:04:46.450> series<00:04:46.870> and<00:04:47.080> they

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
chances going into this series and they

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.100 
chances going into this series and they
are<00:04:47.830> slim<00:04:48.250> don't<00:04:48.880> get<00:04:49.000> me<00:04:49.120> wrong<00:04:49.150> i<00:04:49.630> think<00:04:49.660> the

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
are slim don't get me wrong i think the

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.969 
are slim don't get me wrong i think the
flesh<00:04:50.349> will<00:04:50.620> win<00:04:50.800> this<00:04:50.950> series<00:04:51.190> too<00:04:52.020> but<00:04:53.020> he

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
flesh will win this series too but he

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.940 
flesh will win this series too but he
can't<00:04:54.310> discount<00:04:54.669> all<00:04:54.910> the<00:04:55.030> fries

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
can't discount all the fries

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.990 
can't discount all the fries
accomplishments<00:04:56.950> moving<00:04:57.220> through<00:04:57.370> the<00:04:57.430> so<00:04:57.639> SL

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
accomplishments moving through the so SL

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.360 
accomplishments moving through the so SL
he's<00:04:58.210> had<00:04:58.360> a<00:04:58.389> great<00:04:58.630> first<00:04:59.349> OSL<00:05:00.010> by<00:05:00.190> the<00:05:00.250> way

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
he's had a great first OSL by the way

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.390 
he's had a great first OSL by the way
this<00:05:00.550> is<00:05:00.610> freeze<00:05:01.180> first<00:05:01.660> OSL<00:05:02.590> technically<00:05:03.250> i

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
this is freeze first OSL technically i

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.950 
this is freeze first OSL technically i
mean<00:05:03.700> he's<00:05:03.820> been<00:05:03.910> through<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.240> prelims<00:05:04.660> a<00:05:04.810> lot

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
mean he's been through the prelims a lot

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.600 
mean he's been through the prelims a lot
always<00:05:05.260> lost<00:05:05.410> in<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:05.680> prelims<00:05:05.889> lost<00:05:06.400> in<00:05:06.550> the

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
always lost in the prelims lost in the

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.450 
always lost in the prelims lost in the
prelims<00:05:06.789> and<00:05:07.210> this<00:05:08.139> is<00:05:08.289> his<00:05:08.410> first<00:05:08.680> OSL<00:05:09.190> from

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
prelims and this is his first OSL from

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.950 
prelims and this is his first OSL from
the<00:05:09.580> round<00:05:09.760> of<00:05:09.880> 36<00:05:10.330> and<00:05:10.570> he<00:05:10.690> has<00:05:10.780> gone

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
the round of 36 and he has gone

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.719 
the round of 36 and he has gone
undefeated<00:05:11.320> that<00:05:12.250> is<00:05:12.520> a<00:05:12.550> huge<00:05:12.669> accomplishment

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:14.729 
undefeated that is a huge accomplishment

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.899 
undefeated that is a huge accomplishment
and<00:05:15.569> he's<00:05:16.110> riding<00:05:16.469> on<00:05:16.589> a<00:05:16.620> wave<00:05:17.069> of<00:05:17.339> confidence

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
and he's riding on a wave of confidence

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:21.170 
and he's riding on a wave of confidence
that<00:05:18.089> I<00:05:18.240> think<00:05:18.689> he<00:05:18.809> can<00:05:19.050> take<00:05:19.319> down<00:05:19.499> flash<00:05:19.889> as<00:05:20.879> I

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
that I think he can take down flash as I

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.820 
that I think he can take down flash as I
said<00:05:21.419> it's<00:05:21.659> going<00:05:21.839> to<00:05:21.960> be<00:05:22.020> a<00:05:22.050> very<00:05:22.259> slim<00:05:22.800> chance

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
said it's going to be a very slim chance

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.339 
said it's going to be a very slim chance
but<00:05:23.370> I<00:05:23.490> think<00:05:23.759> he<00:05:23.849> can<00:05:24.029> do<00:05:24.180> it<00:05:24.330> he's<00:05:25.020> going<00:05:25.199> to

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:25.349 
but I think he can do it he's going to

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.730 
but I think he can do it he's going to
have<00:05:25.439> have<00:05:25.710> to<00:05:25.860> exploit<00:05:26.990> flashes<00:05:27.990> weaknesses

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
have have to exploit flashes weaknesses

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.709 
have have to exploit flashes weaknesses
I<00:05:29.249> mean<00:05:29.699> flash<00:05:29.939> doesn't<00:05:30.150> have<00:05:30.360> very<00:05:30.509> many

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 
I mean flash doesn't have very many

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:32.570 
I mean flash doesn't have very many
weaknesses<00:05:30.990> especially<00:05:31.740> when<00:05:31.889> he<00:05:31.979> starts

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
weaknesses especially when he starts

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.369 
weaknesses especially when he starts
turtling<00:05:33.059> up<00:05:33.300> it<00:05:33.689> becomes<00:05:33.809> almost<00:05:34.169> impossible

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:34.379 
turtling up it becomes almost impossible

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:37.249 
turtling up it becomes almost impossible
to<00:05:35.009> attack<00:05:35.339> throws<00:05:36.089> down<00:05:36.300> those<00:05:36.509> supply<00:05:36.870> depot

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 
to attack throws down those supply depot

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:39.799 
to attack throws down those supply depot
walls<00:05:37.589> so<00:05:38.219> so<00:05:38.580> annoying<00:05:38.909> for<00:05:39.210> any<00:05:39.419> kind<00:05:39.629> of<00:05:39.719> a

00:05:39.799 --> 00:05:39.809 
walls so so annoying for any kind of a

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:42.260 
walls so so annoying for any kind of a
player<00:05:39.990> to<00:05:40.139> deal<00:05:40.289> with<00:05:40.439> that<00:05:41.150> he's<00:05:42.150> been

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
player to deal with that he's been

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.119 
player to deal with that he's been
starting<00:05:42.449> to<00:05:42.659> do<00:05:42.719> that<00:05:42.870> vs<00:05:43.139> zerg<00:05:43.349> now<00:05:43.620> too<00:05:43.680> I

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:44.129 
starting to do that vs zerg now too I

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:46.309 
starting to do that vs zerg now too I
mean<00:05:44.520> he<00:05:44.580> doesn't<00:05:44.849> use<00:05:44.939> supply<00:05:45.300> depot<00:05:45.719> blocks

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:46.319 
mean he doesn't use supply depot blocks

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:47.989 
mean he doesn't use supply depot blocks
as<00:05:46.559> much<00:05:46.830> but<00:05:47.099> when<00:05:47.219> he's<00:05:47.339> going<00:05:47.580> Mac<00:05:47.789> he'll

00:05:47.989 --> 00:05:47.999 
as much but when he's going Mac he'll

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:50.600 
as much but when he's going Mac he'll

turrets in this game against zero I'm

00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:59.360 
turrets in this game against zero I'm
not<00:05:57.300> kidding<00:05:57.360> but<00:05:58.319> the<00:05:58.499> factory<00:05:58.919> on<00:05:59.099> the<00:05:59.129> way

not kidding but the factory on the way

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.619 
not kidding but the factory on the way
for<00:05:59.430> flash<00:05:59.789> it<00:06:00.089> looks<00:06:00.330> like<00:06:00.419> a<00:06:00.449> pretty

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:00.629 
for flash it looks like a pretty

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:03.040 
for flash it looks like a pretty
standard<00:06:01.080> opening<00:06:01.229> from<00:06:01.589> him<00:06:01.800> so<00:06:02.099> far<00:06:02.339> I'm

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
standard opening from him so far I'm

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.209 
standard opening from him so far I'm
free<00:06:04.050> I<00:06:04.080> didn't<00:06:04.469> get<00:06:04.559> a<00:06:04.620> chance<00:06:04.680> to<00:06:04.919> see<00:06:05.069> that

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:05.219 
free I didn't get a chance to see that

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:07.369 
free I didn't get a chance to see that
cybernetics<00:06:06.029> core<00:06:06.180> very<00:06:06.389> well<00:06:06.599> I<00:06:06.839> didn't<00:06:07.259> see

00:06:07.369 --> 00:06:07.379 
cybernetics core very well I didn't see

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:09.320 
cybernetics core very well I didn't see
if<00:06:07.439> it<00:06:07.559> was<00:06:07.680> spinning<00:06:08.069> or<00:06:08.189> not<00:06:08.339> hopefully<00:06:09.059> it

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
if it was spinning or not hopefully it

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.700 
if it was spinning or not hopefully it
is<00:06:09.449> so<00:06:09.659> he<00:06:09.749> can<00:06:09.899> put<00:06:10.139> on<00:06:10.229> a<00:06:10.259> little<00:06:10.469> bit<00:06:10.620> of

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
is so he can put on a little bit of

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.889 
is so he can put on a little bit of
pressure<00:06:10.919> at<00:06:11.129> the<00:06:11.279> front<00:06:11.580> the<00:06:12.449> buildings<00:06:12.779> are

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:12.899 
pressure at the front the buildings are

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:15.889 
pressure at the front the buildings are
kind<00:06:13.110> of<00:06:13.169> far<00:06:13.559> out<00:06:13.999> there<00:06:14.999> yet<00:06:15.599> that

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:15.899 
kind of far out there yet that

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:17.389 
kind of far out there yet that
cybernetics<00:06:16.469> core<00:06:16.620> is<00:06:16.770> spinning<00:06:17.189> so<00:06:17.309> we'll

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:17.399 
cybernetics core is spinning so we'll

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:18.769 
cybernetics core is spinning so we'll
have<00:06:17.520> that<00:06:17.639> chacune<00:06:17.969> range<00:06:18.240> at<00:06:18.389> the<00:06:18.419> front<00:06:18.689> and

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:18.779 
have that chacune range at the front and

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:19.969 
have that chacune range at the front and
probably<00:06:19.020> be<00:06:19.139> able<00:06:19.229> to<00:06:19.349> pick<00:06:19.469> at<00:06:19.589> the<00:06:19.649> barracks

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
probably be able to pick at the barracks

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.969 
probably be able to pick at the barracks
a<00:06:20.069> little<00:06:20.279> bit<00:06:20.370> longer<00:06:20.550> I<00:06:21.409> at<00:06:22.409> least<00:06:22.499> get<00:06:22.709> flash

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 
a little bit longer I at least get flash

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:24.739 
a little bit longer I at least get flash
to<00:06:23.159> float<00:06:23.430> that<00:06:23.639> back<00:06:23.939> so<00:06:24.180> he<00:06:24.270> can<00:06:24.360> get<00:06:24.599> in

00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:24.749 
to float that back so he can get in

00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:26.779 
to float that back so he can get in
maybe<00:06:25.080> try<00:06:25.379> to<00:06:25.409> push<00:06:25.709> through<00:06:26.039> with<00:06:26.219> more

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:26.789 
maybe try to push through with more

there in the tank will be out soon of

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:17.779 
there in the tank will be out soon of
course<00:07:16.349> flash<00:07:16.649> he<00:07:16.919> didn't<00:07:17.189> go<00:07:17.279> for<00:07:17.490> his<00:07:17.580> tank

00:07:17.779 --> 00:07:17.789 
course flash he didn't go for his tank

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:19.850 
course flash he didn't go for his tank
right<00:07:17.999> away<00:07:18.240> he<00:07:18.629> put<00:07:19.229> down<00:07:19.379> the<00:07:19.529> second

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:19.860 
right away he put down the second

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.469 
right away he put down the second
factory<00:07:20.219> instead<00:07:20.550> used<00:07:20.819> his<00:07:20.969> minerals<00:07:21.300> for

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 
factory instead used his minerals for

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:24.469 
factory instead used his minerals for
that<00:07:21.629> so<00:07:22.289> the<00:07:22.409> tank<00:07:22.740> on<00:07:22.889> the<00:07:22.949> way<00:07:23.159> now<00:07:23.479> sees

00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 
that so the tank on the way now sees

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:27.940 
that so the tank on the way now sees
range<00:07:24.839> is<00:07:25.379> being<00:07:25.889> researched<00:07:26.250> now<00:07:26.610> so<00:07:26.969> free

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:27.950 
range is being researched now so free

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.140 
range is being researched now so free
I<00:07:27.980> don't<00:07:28.160> know<00:07:28.220> if<00:07:28.310> he<00:07:28.400> comes<00:07:28.550> in<00:07:28.730> with<00:07:28.760> one

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.150 
I don't know if he comes in with one

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.120 
I don't know if he comes in with one
more<00:07:29.450> jiggin<00:07:29.900> he<00:07:30.170> might<00:07:30.350> be<00:07:30.470> able<00:07:30.560> to<00:07:30.680> take<00:07:30.920> out

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.130 
more jiggin he might be able to take out

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.150 
more jiggin he might be able to take out
at<00:07:31.760> least<00:07:31.820> the<00:07:32.120> supply<00:07:32.510> depot<00:07:32.920> the<00:07:33.920> flash

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 
at least the supply depot the flash

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.370 
at least the supply depot the flash
still<00:07:34.400> repairing<00:07:34.790> this<00:07:34.910> he<00:07:35.060> has<00:07:35.180> is<00:07:35.420> a<00:07:35.450> bunker

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:36.380 
still repairing this he has is a bunker

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.040 
still repairing this he has is a bunker
in<00:07:36.560> the<00:07:36.590> second<00:07:37.340> machine<00:07:37.670> shop<00:07:37.940> on<00:07:38.180> the<00:07:38.210> way<00:07:38.510> so

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.050 
in the second machine shop on the way so

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:41.230 
in the second machine shop on the way so
I<00:07:39.080> think<00:07:39.230> flash<00:07:39.680> is<00:07:39.920> going<00:07:40.070> to<00:07:40.190> push<00:07:40.460> out<00:07:40.700> soon

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240 
I think flash is going to push out soon

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.650 
I think flash is going to push out soon
as<00:07:41.540> soon<00:07:41.690> as<00:07:41.840> he<00:07:41.930> can<00:07:42.140> anyway<00:07:42.590> and<00:07:42.830> try<00:07:43.760> to<00:07:43.820> take
