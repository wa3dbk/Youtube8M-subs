00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
there could have been a little bit more

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.440 
there could have been a little bit more
in<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.470> kind<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.250> feel<00:01:38.430> empty<00:01:38.759> for<00:01:38.939> me<00:01:39.030> maybe

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
in just kind of feel empty for me maybe

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.270 
in just kind of feel empty for me maybe
it's<00:01:39.689> just<00:01:39.750> me<00:01:39.990> if<00:01:40.079> something<00:01:40.350> maybe<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:41.070> was<00:01:41.250> a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
it's just me if something maybe it was a

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.609 
it's just me if something maybe it was a
slow<00:01:41.610> pace<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.390> chapter<00:01:42.810> i'm<00:01:43.200> not<00:01:43.470> really

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
slow pace of the chapter i'm not really

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.460 
slow pace of the chapter i'm not really
sure<00:01:43.740> exactly<00:01:44.009> as<00:01:44.490> well<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.000> chapter<00:01:45.329> was

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
sure exactly as well as in chapter was

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.990 
sure exactly as well as in chapter was
missing<00:01:46.470> something<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.159> kind<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.880> would

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
missing something that kind of would

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.850 
missing something that kind of would
make<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.329> spark<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.659> little<00:01:48.869> bit<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.140> at<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
make it spark a little bit and at the

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.620 
make it spark a little bit and at the
same<00:01:50.009> time<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.460> felt<00:01:50.610> slow<00:01:51.030> pace<00:01:51.329> what<00:01:51.540> was

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
same time it felt slow pace what was

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.359 
same time it felt slow pace what was
going<00:01:51.840> on<00:01:51.930> or<00:01:51.990> maybe<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.409> didn't<00:01:53.220> have

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
going on or maybe I just didn't have

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.859 
going on or maybe I just didn't have
enough<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.970> was<00:01:54.090> going<00:01:54.299> on<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.720> went

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
enough that was going on but it went

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.200 
enough that was going on but it went
fast<00:01:55.219> very<00:01:56.219> complicated<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.790> know<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.030> way<00:01:57.119> I'm

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
fast very complicated I know the way I'm

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.700 
fast very complicated I know the way I'm
explaining<00:01:57.570> but<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:58.049> was<00:01:58.259> like<00:01:58.320> oh<00:01:58.500> it's

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
explaining but like I was like oh it's

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.760 
explaining but like I was like oh it's
over<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:59.460> it<00:02:00.030> dragged<00:02:00.479> on<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:01.469> then<00:02:01.619> not

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
over like it dragged on but then not

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.319 
over like it dragged on but then not
much<00:02:01.950> really<00:02:02.219> happened<00:02:02.729> just<00:02:03.030> at<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.240> end

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
much really happened just at the end

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.240 
much really happened just at the end
like<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.509> wanted<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.810> see<00:02:03.990> at<00:02:04.079> least<00:02:04.250> something

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
like I wanted to see at least something

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.429 
like I wanted to see at least something
happen<00:02:05.850> other<00:02:06.000> than<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.479> like<00:02:06.600> soon<00:02:06.899> abbazia

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
happen other than just like soon abbazia

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.050 
happen other than just like soon abbazia
and<00:02:07.799> then<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:08.340> knock<00:02:08.610> somebody<00:02:09.000> down

which<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.450> kind<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.780> cool<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.020> was<00:02:10.259> cool<00:02:10.470> that

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
which is kind of cool that was cool that

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.490 
which is kind of cool that was cool that
they<00:02:11.280> took<00:02:11.430> already<00:02:11.700> one<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.090> them

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
they took already one of them

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.140 
they took already one of them
you<00:02:12.560> now<00:02:12.700> probably<00:02:13.700> wish<00:02:13.820> we<00:02:13.970> would<00:02:14.120> have

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
you now probably wish we would have

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.550 
you now probably wish we would have
stopped<00:02:14.420> like<00:02:14.720> we<00:02:14.870> could<00:02:15.050> get<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.260> little<00:02:15.440> bit

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
stopped like we could get a little bit

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.980 
stopped like we could get a little bit
more<00:02:15.710> like<00:02:15.920> seeing<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.730> blast<00:02:17.000> him<00:02:17.300> or<00:02:17.540> some

craziness but I guess you guys take the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.580 
craziness but I guess you guys take the
good<00:02:20.240> with<00:02:20.330> the<00:02:20.360> bad<00:02:20.450> at<00:02:20.720> least<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.020> action<00:02:21.440> is

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
good with the bad at least the action is

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.800 
good with the bad at least the action is
starting<00:02:22.070> which<00:02:22.220> is<00:02:22.400> definitely<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.270> plus<00:02:23.600> in

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
starting which is definitely a plus in
