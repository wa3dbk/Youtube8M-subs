00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:17.699

 Let's talk about great art auto gta 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.390
 for the intimates a success 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.619
 billionaire and a cultural icon 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.320
 So much so if you started your 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.869
 adventures in series now with gta5 your 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.420
 three characters if you are a gt3 veteran 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.980
 or even one of the crazy ones that played and 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.610
 enjoy the first two games of 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.030
 franchise 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.450
 We doubt that you know everything from 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.550
 gt know now ten bizarre facts and 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.950
 about the game universe 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.120
 most popular on the planet a gta only exists 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.940
 because of a dog 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.600
 the idea of gta was born of a bug in the game 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.370
 racing x never heard was the project 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.100
 of the first team of creators 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.899
 gta in the game you can enter the role 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.939
 of police and chased by car 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.850
 bandits ie the bad guys and get away from 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.450
 police but one of the developers stepped 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.280
 on the ball 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.770
 the police cars controlled by the 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.659
 computer should only be in the car. 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.250
 of the villain he would already be in jail 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.830
 but the mistake to make the cars 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.210
 repeatedly hit the vehicle almost 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.549
 taking it off the road 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.439
 the result was so much fun that the 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.520
 whole game was modified by that 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.650
 we met two with forest GTA5 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.890
 is four times larger than the island of 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.650
 manhattan gta5 has a series weapon and 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.810
 It lives up to open term world about 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.640
 of 160 square kilometers 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.140
 it is four times larger than the island of 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.990
 manhattan in new york 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.909
 in the comparison protest auto san andreas 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.520
 the largest map in the series until then had 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.390
 only 36 square kilometers and the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.320
 revolutionary gta 3 even smaller - out of 5 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.320
 square kilometers 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.960
 3 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.719
 the rockstar might owe the pants 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.460
 in court if rockstar lost all 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.680
 the proceedings they have in court for 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.849
 cause of the gta franchise would have to close 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.470
 the doors 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.040
 adding the value of all the indemnities 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.140
 of more than 1 billion 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.900
 dollars the way to sue the company 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.159
 began ten years ago when the infamous 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.250
 florida developer 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:24.109
 jack thompson asked almost 250 million 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.599
 dollars to conquer the 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:29.209
 motive is supposed to have 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.620
 influenced two young people to steal cars 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.689
 and kill motorists 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.000
 unfortunately until today the rockstar has been 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:40.400
 considered innocent of the charges and 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.269
 had to pay 94 rockstar paid for the 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.340
 controversy 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.709
 think rockstar was a victim in the 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.319
 The courts were pitiful. 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.549
 she looked for it in the beginning of 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.319
 series career 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.439
 the developer hired a guru of 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.659
 marketing called max clifford the crazy 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:58.909
 he was adept at the theory of evil but 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.620
 talk about me and have 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:03.650
 fifth grade newspapers 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.810
 his goal was to create the talking suit 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.750
 about that game of criminals 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.639
 the strategy gave right groups right 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.530
 and activists have fought for years against 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:15.579
 franchise generating media attention 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.579
 stimulating sales 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.120
 five talking we understand each other 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:24.530
 GTA5 is 160 thousand lines and even dialogues 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.540
 month effect 3 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.879
 the final episode of the rpg franchise 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.489
 space has a quarter of the amount of 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.479
 dialogs available in gta5 and look 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.690
 it's a rpg 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:38.120
 What this means are more than 2500 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.400
 pages because they were dubbed 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.349
 by actors in the rockstar studios you 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.180
 I would have to join more than 40 films 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.460
 cinema will only achieve this 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:53.710
 total amount of dialogue 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:57.640
 6 gta5 is more expensive than 99.9 99 999 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:04:00.100
 999 99 percent of the effects movies already 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.960
 We are talking about cinema only one 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.200
 film cost more than the production of 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.240
 gt so while the game spent 267 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.860
 millions of dollars to be developed 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.740
 Pirates of the Caribbean at the End of the World 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.410
 made 300 million dollars to be 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:19.420
 filmed and we know very well which of the 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:22.810
 two gave much more profit than the 7 gta 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.300
 sold a lot of the very same kind 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.730
 even before the launch of gta5 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.100
 franchise had already sold more than 150 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.240
 millions of copies worldwide in 16 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.190
 platforms 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.470
 assuming all have been sold 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.930
 in boxes and you get these boxes 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.330
 of dvd stacked if no one was going to play 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.120
 Nothing more but we would have a tower of 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.340
 2,100 meters high almost three times 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.250
 the size of the largest building in the world 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.140
 success does not stop there the last game 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.330
 raised $ 1 billion in 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.460
 first three days in stores 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.450
 Avatar is the most lucrative movie 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.669
 Cinema's history 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:03.820
 It took 19 days to generate this money. 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:06.310
 all eight shared universe 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.290
 Believe if you want but other games of 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.040

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.530

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.930
 the city jail where it goes 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.610

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.460
 franchise radio stations
