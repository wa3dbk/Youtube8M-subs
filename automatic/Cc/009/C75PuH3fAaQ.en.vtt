so<00:00:27.539> basically<00:00:28.140> with<00:00:28.529> these<00:00:28.740> stats<00:00:29.119> agents<00:00:30.119> are

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
so basically with these stats agents are

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.459 
so basically with these stats agents are

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
wasting 750 call this is why you're

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.560
