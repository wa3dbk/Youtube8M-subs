00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
actually sometimes fill the tree tops

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.259 
actually sometimes fill the tree tops
between<00:03:35.590> you<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.769> debate<00:03:37.069> but<00:03:37.760> if<00:03:38.000> you'll

up<00:03:41.840> in<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.019> air<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.410> apply<00:03:43.280> pressure<00:03:43.310> you<00:03:44.239> can

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
up in the air and apply pressure you can

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:45.940 
up in the air and apply pressure you can
generally<00:03:44.690> get<00:03:44.780> that<00:03:44.959> fish<00:03:45.200> to<00:03:45.380> race<00:03:45.590> three
