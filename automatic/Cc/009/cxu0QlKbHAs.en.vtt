00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.640
 hi friends of mesic off I am ciro 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.290
 manna and in this new video we will see 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.509
 of exercises for companies for 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.650
 improve the groove especially of the 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.320
 right hand 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.840
 many times we focus mainly 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.760
 on the left thinking it is the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.309
 left to do everything and instead the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.140
 most of the work is the attack on 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.420
 groove timing and everything else 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.730
 in short, they are mostly kept 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.379
 from the right hand and then practicing 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.260
 we will do a series of exercises now vi 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.970
 I will illustrate with whom I practice 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.309
 we can increase anyway 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:02:02.310
 improve control of the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:02:04.140
 dynamic and your rhythmic sense a 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.540
 those you have just listened to are 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.539
 then exercises developed on 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.810
 sixteenth notes and we have conceived them 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.000
 practically using the first in the 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.239
 first practice section we had two 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.159
 notes and three notes and a ghost using 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.620
 practically August on the first seed 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.599
 chroma second third and fourth and then in the 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.520
 second part we practically had the 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.580
 two 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.250
 2 ghost and then two notes and then 3 cost e 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.080
 a note so we developed more or 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.850
 minus all possible figures 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.880
 of course you can have fun at 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.230
 mix the different quatrains between 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.120
 therefore also in a creative way 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:03:23.210
 creating riffs like we will in 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:03:26.570
 second part is ok this part you have 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.220
 then listened to the triplets in the part 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.260
 next now we will have fun 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.930
 to combine the different figures a little 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.380
 so you can have fun in 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.380
 creative way 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.920
 the works 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.159
 as soon as 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.580
 the 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.250
 better 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.060
 1 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.389
 tell me what ever 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.389
 more 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.560
 and neither 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.780
 is 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.380
 well 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.710
 the 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.920
 to me 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.070
 n 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.400
 the sea 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.790
 here 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.790
 a little bit 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.419
 Well
