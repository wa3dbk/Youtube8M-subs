actually<00:04:30.150> we<00:04:30.600> rigged<00:04:30.840> this<00:04:30.990> up<00:04:31.140> just<00:04:31.200> a<00:04:31.470> little

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
actually we rigged this up just a little

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.190 
actually we rigged this up just a little
bit<00:04:31.770> it's<00:04:32.010> pretty<00:04:32.670> quick<00:04:32.880> and<00:04:33.030> easy<00:04:33.270> what<00:04:34.050> we

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
bit it's pretty quick and easy what we

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.050 
bit it's pretty quick and easy what we
have<00:04:34.440> here<00:04:34.470> is<00:04:34.770> we<00:04:35.010> have<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.370> bunch<00:04:35.610> of<00:04:35.700> zombie

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
have here is we have a bunch of zombie

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.940 
have here is we have a bunch of zombie
spawner<00:04:36.180> back<00:04:36.660> there<00:04:36.840> so<00:04:37.500> if<00:04:37.680> you<00:04:37.770> come<00:04:37.920> in

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
spawner back there so if you come in

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.230 
spawner back there so if you come in
here<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:38.520> just<00:04:38.610> flick<00:04:38.910> switch<00:04:39.830> like<00:04:40.830> it

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
here and just flick switch like it

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.370 
here and just flick switch like it
that'll<00:04:42.240> turn<00:04:42.390> the<00:04:42.540> lights<00:04:42.720> off<00:04:42.900> and<00:04:43.200> the

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
that'll turn the lights off and the

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.290 
that'll turn the lights off and the
zombies<00:04:44.160> will<00:04:44.190> obviously<00:04:44.670> start<00:04:45.120> spawning

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
zombies will obviously start spawning

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.510 
zombies will obviously start spawning
the<00:04:46.020> reason<00:04:46.260> why<00:04:46.440> I<00:04:46.470> have<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.950> light<00:04:47.220> switches

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
the reason why I have the light switches

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.400 
the reason why I have the light switches
up<00:04:47.790> there<00:04:48.000> so<00:04:48.210> that<00:04:48.270> month<00:04:48.750> you<00:04:49.050> know<00:04:49.170> mom's

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
up there so that month you know mom's

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.230 
up there so that month you know mom's
obviously<00:04:50.010> aren't<00:04:50.220> spawning<00:04:50.610> all<00:04:50.880> the<00:04:51.000> time

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
obviously aren't spawning all the time

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.720 
obviously aren't spawning all the time
and<00:04:51.480> it<00:04:51.600> slows<00:04:52.200> the<00:04:52.380> server<00:04:52.620> down<00:04:52.890> even<00:04:53.640> though

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
and it slows the server down even though

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.150 
and it slows the server down even though
I<00:04:53.760> wouldn't<00:04:54.060> expect<00:04:54.270> it<00:04:54.660> to<00:04:54.900> so<00:04:55.170> servers<00:04:55.620> down

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
I wouldn't expect it to so servers down

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.460 
I wouldn't expect it to so servers down
because<00:04:56.490> we<00:04:56.670> have<00:04:57.450> so<00:04:57.570> many<00:04:57.660> gigabytes<00:04:58.080> of<00:04:58.230> RAM

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
because we have so many gigabytes of RAM

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.710 
because we have so many gigabytes of RAM
running<00:04:58.890> the<00:04:58.980> server<00:04:59.160> but<00:04:59.520> just<00:05:00.240> to<00:05:00.420> prevent

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
running the server but just to prevent

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.190 
running the server but just to prevent
any<00:05:01.550> cause<00:05:02.550> of<00:05:02.820> that<00:05:02.970> happening<00:05:03.390> I<00:05:03.630> had<00:05:04.170> a

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
any cause of that happening I had a

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.010 
any cause of that happening I had a
light<00:05:04.470> switch<00:05:04.710> so<00:05:05.130> you<00:05:05.790> come<00:05:06.300> in<00:05:06.480> turn<00:05:06.780> it<00:05:06.870> off

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
light switch so you come in turn it off

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.630 
light switch so you come in turn it off
and<00:05:07.050> let<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.680> zombie<00:05:07.980> spawn<00:05:08.220> and<00:05:08.400> when<00:05:08.550> you

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
and let the zombie spawn and when you

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.480 
and let the zombie spawn and when you
walk<00:05:08.820> out<00:05:08.970> is<00:05:09.180> BP<00:05:10.050> you<00:05:10.380> know<00:05:10.440> be<00:05:10.740> courteous<00:05:11.130> and

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
walk out is BP you know be courteous and

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.810 
walk out is BP you know be courteous and
turn<00:05:11.670> it<00:05:11.790> off<00:05:11.910> or<00:05:12.800> I<00:05:13.800> should<00:05:14.040> say<00:05:14.070> turn<00:05:14.700> the

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
turn it off or I should say turn the

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.180 
turn it off or I should say turn the
switch<00:05:14.910> the<00:05:15.900> other<00:05:16.050> way<00:05:16.260> so<00:05:16.320> the<00:05:16.800> whole<00:05:16.980> lights

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
switch the other way so the whole lights

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.270 
switch the other way so the whole lights
turn<00:05:17.430> on<00:05:17.460> okay<00:05:18.530> moving<00:05:19.530> from<00:05:19.860> there<00:05:20.010> we<00:05:20.160> have

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
turn on okay moving from there we have

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.120 
turn on okay moving from there we have
just<00:05:20.490> a<00:05:20.580> nice<00:05:20.730> little<00:05:20.760> piggy<00:05:21.180> form<00:05:21.390> and<00:05:22.130> then

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
over here we have a forest farm when I

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.550 
over here we have a forest farm when I
can<00:05:26.790> come<00:05:26.970> in<00:05:27.150> and<00:05:27.300> just<00:05:27.420> generic<00:05:27.960> trees<00:05:28.290> or

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
mine set up over here and we actually

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.140 
mine set up over here and we actually
have<00:05:43.650> a<00:05:43.680> portal<00:05:44.220> that<00:05:44.250> I'm<00:05:44.580> going<00:05:44.760> that<00:05:45.090> I

there<00:05:47.640> when<00:05:48.150> I<00:05:48.180> set<00:05:48.420> up<00:05:48.480> the<00:05:48.570> portal<00:05:48.900> networks

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
there when I set up the portal networks

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.970 
there when I set up the portal networks
that<00:05:49.680> way<00:05:49.860> it<00:05:50.100> teleports<00:05:50.670> you<00:05:50.790> to<00:05:51.030> a<00:05:51.060> random<00:05:51.980> or

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 
that way it teleports you to a random or

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.920 
that way it teleports you to a random or
not<00:05:53.400> really<00:05:53.669> a<00:05:53.700> random<00:05:54.030> but<00:05:54.150> random<00:05:54.180> locations

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
not really a random but random locations

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.800 
not really a random but random locations
and<00:05:55.020> I've<00:05:55.110> chosen<00:05:55.410> to<00:05:56.310> place<00:05:56.910> the<00:05:57.210> portal<00:05:57.690> down
