at the moment the transit screw is

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.629 
at the moment the transit screw is
holding<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.989> whole<00:02:55.290> light<00:02:55.560> unit<00:02:56.010> into<00:02:56.340> place

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:56.639 
holding the whole light unit into place

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.620 
holding the whole light unit into place
and<00:02:57.090> as<00:02:57.569> soon<00:02:57.810> as<00:02:57.959> that's<00:02:58.139> removed<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:59.040> your

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
and as soon as that's removed and your

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.970 
and as soon as that's removed and your
automatic<00:03:00.630> adjuster<00:03:01.260> pin<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.620> boulder's

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.460 
automatic adjuster pin and boulder's
fitters<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.940> then<00:03:03.150> takes<00:03:03.510> up<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.870> slack<00:03:04.169> so

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
fitters it then takes up the slack so

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.050 
fitters it then takes up the slack so
therefore<00:03:04.919> allowing<00:03:05.220> you<00:03:05.489> to<00:03:05.639> be<00:03:05.760> able<00:03:05.880> to

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
therefore allowing you to be able to

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.449 
therefore allowing you to be able to
move<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.419> headlight<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.200> then<00:03:07.919> just<00:03:08.190> finally

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
move the headlight and then just finally

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.210 
move the headlight and then just finally
your<00:03:09.060> adjusters<00:03:09.660> here<00:03:10.139> which<00:03:10.680> would<00:03:10.829> just<00:03:11.069> do

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
your adjusters here which would just do

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.909 
your adjusters here which would just do
your<00:03:11.400> finalizing<00:03:12.209> up<00:03:12.419> and<00:03:12.660> down<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.200> left<00:03:13.680> to

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
your finalizing up and down and left to

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.699 
your finalizing up and down and left to
right<00:03:14.069> adjustment<00:03:14.930> also<00:03:15.930> on<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.290> back<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.620> the

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
right adjustment also on the back of the

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.690 
right adjustment also on the back of the
lights<00:03:16.919> you<00:03:17.579> have<00:03:17.609> four<00:03:18.599> white<00:03:19.049> caps<00:03:19.700> these

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
lights you have four white caps these

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.210 
lights you have four white caps these
are<00:03:20.970> breathing<00:03:21.450> caps<00:03:21.780> which<00:03:22.290> must<00:03:22.650> be<00:03:22.769> pushed

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
are breathing caps which must be pushed

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.659 
are breathing caps which must be pushed
in<00:03:23.810> facing<00:03:24.810> downwards<00:03:25.410> which<00:03:26.069> then<00:03:26.340> Alette

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
in facing downwards which then Alette

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.210 
in facing downwards which then Alette
allows<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.510> correct<00:03:28.109> amount<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:28.620> air<00:03:28.859> to<00:03:28.889> come

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
allows the correct amount of air to come

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.430 
allows the correct amount of air to come
in<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.609> light<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.660> that<00:03:30.690> they<00:03:30.959> can<00:03:31.169> breathe

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
in to the light so that they can breathe

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.610 
in to the light so that they can breathe
without<00:03:31.950> causing<00:03:32.459> conversation<00:03:33.359> also<00:03:34.109> this

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
without causing conversation also this

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.430 
without causing conversation also this
box<00:03:35.160> on<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.579> bottom<00:03:35.730> here<00:03:36.239> is<00:03:36.450> your<00:03:36.840> resistor

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
box on the bottom here is your resistor

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.159 
box on the bottom here is your resistor
box<00:03:37.680> which<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:38.819> is<00:03:39.299> all<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:39.690> do<00:03:39.840> with<00:03:39.870> your

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
box which that is all to do with your

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.739 
box which that is all to do with your
DRL<00:03:40.709> lights
