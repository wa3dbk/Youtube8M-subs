00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.510
 sit and watch who does not 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.849
 I could see right 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.949
 the conference will start from the 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.399
 Let's do that fast Turk by 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.879

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.260
 figures versions of characters also from 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.710
 other breads here, for example, is the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.710
 Fourth year to open channels here the bar 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.000
 theme is the villain of the new game where you are 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.579

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.120
 June 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.940
 What else do we have here? 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.470
 O 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:14.390
 the epilogue of the kingdom or five are 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.760
 Modified representations are never 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.580
 same people you think this 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.110
 characteristic of modifying 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.110
 characters they reproduce 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.049
 here we have also marketing 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.049
 a modified gray color 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.160
 we have the arlequina harlequina of the veto 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.670
 but here I do not think it's over 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.590
 next to her version in the game comes with 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.380
 a second head has a new head with 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.970
 other hand expression and maybe always 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.290
 this kind of accessory for you 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.990
 modify your little doll that hits 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.910
 Liver haka night that s also a 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.720
 A little more faithful to the character is 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.720
 showing the game 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.260
 here begins the new clothes equality 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.260
 rational 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:11.380
 is that the man will also sing and 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.380
 play kitchen in the study of sun 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.890
 Let's now see the other end of the 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.990
 square enix we see a path that 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.010
 is a pity I pass here behind that 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.980
 We do not disturb people for 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.990
 tina we enter the part 200 which 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.030
 she is doing you can see the posters 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.130
 they have been working very hard with 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.840
 from gas are here in law 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.820
 especially with God is to discuss the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.710
 causes are two of the largest teams 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.910
 they are playing now we have here 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:44.820

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.640
 my ex and get the three victims 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.740
 the new one of lara croft way we run is that 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.400
 it has nothing to do with appeal and so 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.960
 large but the old one in the pantry is more 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.760
 intimate there 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.400
 and then we have several more things 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.330
 wonderful g star ocean organ 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.340
 fantasy 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.400
 both announced during the 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.330
 pre-conference the drug does not know the 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.360
 ons 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.730
 laÃ­s front and is also already has been a 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.620
 success to the new episode at the front and 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.600
 also marina bernardi which is the 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.830
 substitute is the spiritual successor of the 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.690
 medicine was one of the creators of 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.530
 payment since I do not want to know the 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.989
 there is an alternative version of a 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.980
 camera and let's take a look then that 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:32.500
 the people who are playing solve us 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.489
 we have a multitude of stations to 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.950
 play 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.000
 the new panel 1414 exhibition that the 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.750
 resort 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.489
 then seeing if there challenging personal 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:47.319
 really the exposure by bringing a 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:49.660
 novelty to make 14 which is the 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:53.620
 final series fantasy and science 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:58.000
 already on this side of here we have panties 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:01.420
 knows the defendants also that demonstrated in 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.220
 Tuesday pre-conference 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.000
 I'll see if on the other side they were also 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.000
 almost today 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.269
 also this seemingly 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.009
 which does not have much variety 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.650
 but the games that she has put the 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:24.440
 play several stations to take the same 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.440
 or rather the smaller queues possible 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.820
 we have ahead there 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.400
 apparently is going here in the demo 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.620
 is episode one that has already been released already 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.389
 a few months ago but it should be 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.190
 likely to publicize the staff 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.560
 who knows no default 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:45.780

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:48.030

 after all, the instant of square enix the game 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.180
 episodes will still be released if 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.289
 it will be five episodes 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.320
 so anyone who does not know can see that 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:58.169
 also play a little bit to that side 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.880
 from here we have marina bernardi which is the 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.620
 spiritual successor to Mega melo 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.470
 galley's there seeing the opportunity to 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:08.990
 put your hands in the game was f launched 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.990
 through a false 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.660

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.840
 arguing with her talking to five 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.780
 teachers talked to the 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.310
 producers discussing a series of 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.990
 issues related to customers 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.910
 were announced 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.830
 and then we have the other presenters 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.400
 decision to choose the one with this 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.200
 service 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.460

 We have no way to film and now we have more. 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.100
 It has a little room there in the middle which is where 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.180
 unique content scrolls what 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.290

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.330
 with us until now was the company that 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:26.440
