off<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.239> board<00:00:39.629> same<00:00:40.469> with<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.800> backside

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
off of the board same with the backside

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.830 
off of the board same with the backside
180<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.790> actually<00:00:42.180> same<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.660> pop

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
180 and actually same with the pop

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.410 
180 and actually same with the pop
shuvit<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.340> not<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> very<00:00:44.940> good<00:00:45.000> sign

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
shuvit that is not a very good sign

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.209 
shuvit that is not a very good sign
because<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.350> means<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.710> need<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.890> actually

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
because that means we need to actually

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.569 
because that means we need to actually
increase<00:00:47.940> your<00:00:48.510> board<00:00:48.899> control<00:00:49.500> it's<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.340> very

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
increase your board control it's a very

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.970 
increase your board control it's a very
very<00:00:50.940> big<00:00:51.210> issue<00:00:51.449> that<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:52.199> kickflip<00:00:52.770> right

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
very big issue that that kickflip right

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.340 
very big issue that that kickflip right
there<00:00:53.160> was<00:00:53.280> actually<00:00:53.610> quite<00:00:53.670> close<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.780> like

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
there was actually quite close but like

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.510 
there was actually quite close but like
you<00:00:55.559> explained<00:00:56.309> later<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.440> as<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.770> see<00:00:58.829> my

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you explained later so as you can see my

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.220 
you explained later so as you can see my
main<00:00:59.699> problem<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.629> whenever<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
main problem is that whenever I do the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.549 
main problem is that whenever I do the
kickflip<00:01:01.820> it<00:01:02.820> either<00:01:02.969> goes<00:01:03.870> somewhere<00:01:04.350> far

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
kickflip it either goes somewhere far

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.020 
kickflip it either goes somewhere far
away<00:01:04.710> from<00:01:04.769> me<00:01:05.010> where<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.189> can't<00:01:05.400> land<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.760> or

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
away from me where I can't land it or

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.080 
away from me where I can't land it or
when<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.479> does<00:01:06.630> stay<00:01:06.810> next<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> me<00:01:07.200> um<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.939> was

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
when it does stay next to me um it was

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.310 
when it does stay next to me um it was
just<00:01:09.270> under<00:01:09.510> flips<00:01:09.780> or<00:01:09.930> something<00:01:10.170> like<00:01:10.260> that

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320

close by the way but also with the ollie
and<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.950> 180<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.759> pop<00:01:50.970> shuvit

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
and the 180 and the pop shuvit

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.880 
and the 180 and the pop shuvit
is<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.659> bring<00:01:51.960> your<00:01:52.140> back<00:01:52.350> foot<00:01:52.649> off
