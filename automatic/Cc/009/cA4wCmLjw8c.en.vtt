00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.620
 and 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.809
 saved guys welcome to south vélez 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.180
 we go with a slow combat that burga mb 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.920
 fine alpha and before you get lost I'm going to 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.510
 catch up as you know we had 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.029
 a multi link that we have tried very 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.150
 little that are flower advisors give me 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.730
 achievements and three plus and a half because if I 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.340
 I really wanted to create another multi team 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.439
 the pair that are a little more a little more 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.869
 rare to see I wanted to believe me that 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.850
 team and I've been testing the truth 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.350
 who are founding incredible is a 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.730
 pretty weird team I think that I 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.559
 I dare to say that it is a team of 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.150
 more rare that I built myself because 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.129
 none in particular has a function 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.500
 given for example there is no tank 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.970
 special there is no physical tank but to 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.559
 the time there are two pokemon that 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.960
 develops in that function quite well 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.790
 which is the case of the polygon and chrysler and 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.140
 another four more that is a pass of 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.100
 we can and that is working very but 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.780
 that very well and has dared me 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.790
 try them on metal in with pokemon 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.710
 much more powerful is supposed and is 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.690
 doing enough havoc on all the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.710
 pokemon as he presented today even in 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.570
 a brief combat 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.430
 I have more of him and I want it to be about 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.020
 little by little the gods all that can 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.549
 get to do so I do not want you to 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.110
 you lose because I will try this team and 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.180
 will also try the other team 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.010
 his flowers megan achievement and as always 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.660
 I need your help and your 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.580
 opinions to know what object is going to 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.170
 come more to cruise in this case and 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.570
 other pokemon that I went to say so 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.240
 guys we go with the fight that does not have 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.340
 waste let's go there my rival takes out 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.140
 kinder to this water dragon type pokemon 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.030
 it is very dangerous since normally 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.640
 he has sniper and hits a few hits 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.920
 brutal critics over recently 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.110
 energy as you see the first pokemon that 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.020
 he has taken me out, he is one of the weirdos 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.540
 clan a pokémon that is little valued 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.880
 because it is very powerful I make change of 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.509
 up and speed up two 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.560
 two very many and one the physical attack 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.540
 logically I'm already faster than 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.220
 lake walk I already know that it can be that 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.500
 cling me fall as I have the object 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.930
 remains and firm nature with all 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.399
 sets in ps and in physical attack because with 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.800
 Gear shift already proved very much 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.009
 the speed more than a liter combat that 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.660
 neutral but a critical hit so 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.130
 cling in this fight can not 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.979
 dazzle too much but at least 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.760
 has appeared at Kim Dry Sack or accepts the 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.920
 Boys 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.780
 this mega I really wanted to 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.310
 Try it and use me as a special attacker 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.720
 clinton is a fish attacker 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.670
 this team that I am discussing 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.590
 I splurged again and so is an attacker 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.599
 special and very, very strong I have 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.030
 scary nature with all that is the 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.530
 special attack and speed I am more 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.270
 quick that he is very clear and apart from 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.800
 sets speed is paralyzed 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.440
 element a pulse of dragon attack is 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.060
 super effective and that has weakened has 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.519
 very much attack especially you accept 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.010
 cuidadito him eat guys cuidadito 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.050
 Gazette when you see and I get done 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.209
 logically me for the fire type 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.370
 because having a steel and a plant is very 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.170
 highly recommended to have a pokémon type 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.540
 water and even pokemon that you are going to see 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.400
 then sme gadget hoist and with also me 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.080
 I spent style even though I was more 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.400
 quick that he does not have any attack that 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.410
 It can take away a lot of life because the 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.810
 hidden power skill that I have is kind 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.280
 fire hidden in that mega c time you 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.260
 I do a dragon pulse more than anything 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.180
 annoy him and I do not want to sacrifice 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.069
 pokemon that comes after he put something what 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.049
 he left quite tocadito makes me a cut 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.370
 air goes until it's super effective with 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.500
 tammy mega act the one that does not have great 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.660
 special defense and it weakens me from so 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.299
 just a mega mega-hit and like 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.299
 It is always very, very dangerous 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.300
 attention that comes out the crack cross reads this 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.610
 pokemon I repeat is doing that many 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.410
 get pissed off and turn off the console makes me 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.390
 flamethrower and it's not very effective because 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.240
 I am rock to the grief that has been said I am 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.000
 Rock neutralized it, endured with robustness 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.100
 and attention that comes here breaks the breast 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.200
 few people endure what is going to happen 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.000
 then I'm under the defense the 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.580
 special defense but I increased 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.930
 very much attack him the attack 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.540
 special that I tell myself to put to use 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.030
 but without the speed and my cross is 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.190
 as a goal in all sets in speed 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.140
 nature cheerful tail white grass 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.310
 I ass of the states lowered because no 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.620
 I'm interested in losing state in defense 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.180
 because it is a long flame blanket is 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.130
 the team tank pokemon so 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.990
 say it puts a stone thrown me 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.660
 characterize and that has weakened and 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.310
 attention that takes to be period its 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.910
 last let's put guys we'll see what's going 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.730
 to pass I do sting attack time 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.250
 bug I am faster that is serious and 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.459
 attention because cross makes you get 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.810
 the victory guys quietly like this 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.400
 what guys this has been the combat 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.350
 online this week I hope you have 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.750
 very much liked and I have to tell you the 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.750
 why is there no other combat being 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.450
 better and cruise law because they do not stop 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.190
 arm the console with him yesterday he had the 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.900
 hope that they do not turn me off to the 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.690
 console when I was going to do more than 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.160
 same more wreckage with this pokemon and 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.450
 I'll tell you battle though not 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.280
 you are seeing it's worth because I ask you 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.570
 apologies because they do not let me save it 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.280
 I have to record directly with the 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.020
 calculator and even if I turn it off it 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.680
 will be saved to the children what 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.090
 I promise yesterday in the fight was polito in 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.270
 the one that came out in the fight against 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.540
 hungary ninja a mega char y and y unge 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.310
 back left polito lmn agree ninja me 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.950
 change pokemon poison charley friend 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.470
 zhari and then when it fell polito it's happened 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.480
 the same take out cross I made him break 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.850
 breastplate and I lay down on a mega stone 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.610
 perform and from a sting I ninja and from 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.980
 an earthquake backward logically that 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.050
 let's say baked I can not stand it the rival 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.210
 and I turned off the console was not respectful 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.550
 because when I lose I do not have to 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.560
 turn off the console nothing happens but the 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.780
 rival me the payment I wanted to combine that 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.430
 combat with this one here but it did not let me 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.350
 guys and I wasted my time like this 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.940
 from here I apologize for the pro 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.740
 but he liked this fight a lot 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.850
 although it has been intense but beautiful it has 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.110
 could teach a little the letter of 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.720
 presentation as well 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.960
 from cross is pokemon that nobody repeat 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.300
 nobody would look and in fact almost nobody would 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.310
 he knows not even the guys who are neither 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.170
 what he's going to do cross you want him to go 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:51.330
 to make a rock trap wait for us 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:53.010
 go out to hit directly and a 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.870
 ask that you like more grass 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.700
 white for chrysler or insurance 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.870
 weakness I've thought about it again 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.490
 attacks usually always stick with me 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.810
 a long time ago but for example in this 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.910
 case against Chávez to him I would not be worth 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.380
 male flamethrower was not super efficient not 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.400
 I would have jumped sure weakness so 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.990
 less white grass has made me 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.340
 recover the pantries but also os 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.800
 I say one thing if I stay with a drink 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.660
 just give me gets defenses image 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.220
 I do not have an anti flame heel wow 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.020
 I hope your opinions guys from 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.340
 here a very strong ties I want a lot 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:19.560
 thanks for being with me and you know 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.680
 as strikes and comments a lot like that 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.680
 what
