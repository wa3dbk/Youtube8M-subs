the<00:00:37.420> quality<00:00:38.049> is<00:00:38.260> if<00:00:38.470> recording<00:00:38.949> with<00:00:39.100> loud

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339 
the quality is if recording with loud

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.520 
the quality is if recording with loud
audio<00:00:39.820> so<00:00:40.570> basically<00:00:40.870> I'm<00:00:40.989> here<00:00:41.110> inside<00:00:41.350> my

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
audio so basically I'm here inside my

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.649 
audio so basically I'm here inside my
car<00:00:41.799> I'm<00:00:42.040> not<00:00:42.100> driving<00:00:42.670> at<00:00:42.760> the<00:00:42.790> moment<00:00:43.180> as<00:00:43.479> you

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
can see I'm sitting here in the parking

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.640 
can see I'm sitting here in the parking
lot<00:00:44.979> and<00:00:45.369> I'm<00:00:45.640> gonna<00:00:45.760> play<00:00:45.970> a<00:00:46.180> audio<00:00:47.140> snippet

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
lot and I'm gonna play a audio snippet

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.509 
lot and I'm gonna play a audio snippet
from<00:00:48.430> my<00:00:48.610> lumia<00:00:48.970> 1520<00:00:49.720> here<00:00:50.470> so<00:00:51.159> let<00:00:51.280> me<00:00:51.369> get<00:00:51.489> my

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
from my lumia 1520 here so let me get my

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.369 
from my lumia 1520 here so let me get my
aux<00:00:51.850> cable<00:00:52.059> plugged<00:00:52.420> in<00:00:52.570> and<00:00:52.809> we<00:00:52.900> will<00:00:53.049> see<00:00:53.229> how

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
aux cable plugged in and we will see how

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.619 
aux cable plugged in and we will see how
this<00:00:53.589> goes<00:00:53.650> I'm<00:00:54.580> leaving<00:00:54.970> my<00:00:55.030> car<00:00:55.239> running<00:00:55.540> so

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
this goes I'm leaving my car running so

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.140 
this goes I'm leaving my car running so
there'd<00:00:55.869> be<00:00:55.960> some<00:00:56.110> additional<00:00:56.320> noise<00:00:57.150> so

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
there'd be some additional noise so

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.240 
there'd be some additional noise so
we'll<00:00:58.269> go<00:00:58.390> ahead<00:00:58.479> and<00:00:58.659> play<00:00:58.780> this<00:00:58.930> and<00:00:59.199> see<00:00:59.979> if

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
we'll go ahead and play this and see if

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.070 
we'll go ahead and play this and see if
it<00:01:00.400> comes<00:01:00.549> out<00:01:00.760> with<00:01:00.879> a<00:01:00.939> lot<00:01:01.119> of<00:01:01.150> distortion<00:01:01.750> or

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
it comes out with a lot of distortion or

00:01:02.080 --> 00:02:48.530 
it comes out with a lot of distortion or
other<00:01:02.650> audio<00:01:02.939> artifacts

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.330 

okay<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.840> was<00:02:49.960> a<00:02:49.990> quick<00:02:50.170> audio<00:02:50.560> test<00:02:50.890> there<00:02:51.130> I

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
okay that was a quick audio test there I

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.040 
okay that was a quick audio test there I
move<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:51.970> camera<00:02:52.120> around<00:02:52.390> just<00:02:52.690> so<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.870> be<00:02:53.020> a

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
move the camera around just so to be a

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.930 
move the camera around just so to be a
little<00:02:53.230> bit<00:02:53.350> more<00:02:53.500> interesting<00:02:54.130> than<00:02:54.310> just

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
little bit more interesting than just

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.880 
little bit more interesting than just
sitting<00:02:55.150> here<00:02:55.360> looking<00:02:55.510> at<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.870> aux<00:02:56.170> screen

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
sitting here looking at the aux screen

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.300 
sitting here looking at the aux screen
on<00:02:57.250> my<00:02:57.280> car<00:02:57.990> so<00:02:58.990> hopefully<00:02:59.560> you<00:03:00.010> got<00:03:00.100> a<00:03:00.160> chance

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
on my car so hopefully you got a chance

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.740 
on my car so hopefully you got a chance
to<00:03:00.430> look<00:03:00.550> at<00:03:00.670> some<00:03:00.820> of<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:00.970> excellent<00:03:01.210> digital

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
to look at some of the excellent digital

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.690 
to look at some of the excellent digital
zoom<00:03:01.960> as<00:03:02.140> well<00:03:02.350> you<00:03:02.950> know<00:03:03.130> this<00:03:03.310> isn't<00:03:03.670> a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
zoom as well you know this isn't a

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.970 
zoom as well you know this isn't a
preview<00:03:04.090> device<00:03:04.450> doesn't<00:03:05.200> have<00:03:05.350> Carl<00:03:05.770> Zeiss

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
preview device doesn't have Carl Zeiss

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.800 
preview device doesn't have Carl Zeiss
lens<00:03:06.930> lenses<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.230> components<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:10.210> is<00:03:10.600> a

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
lens lenses and components and it is a

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.590 
lens lenses and components and it is a
lowly<00:03:11.200> 5<00:03:11.530> megapixels<00:03:12.280> there<00:03:13.030> still<00:03:13.270> seems<00:03:13.510> to

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
lowly 5 megapixels there still seems to

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.150 
lowly 5 megapixels there still seems to
be<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.720> pretty<00:03:13.840> good<00:03:14.050> amount<00:03:14.200> of<00:03:14.350> zoom<00:03:14.530> so<00:03:15.130> I

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
be a pretty good amount of zoom so I

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.220 
be a pretty good amount of zoom so I
haven't<00:03:15.490> listened<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.790> this<00:03:15.940> video<00:03:16.240> yet<00:03:16.570> but

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
haven't listened to this video yet but

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.710 
haven't listened to this video yet but
I'm<00:03:17.350> just<00:03:17.470> gonna<00:03:17.710> go<00:03:17.890> ahead<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.220> stop<00:03:19.210> it<00:03:19.240> here

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
I'm just gonna go ahead and stop it here

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.040 
I'm just gonna go ahead and stop it here
and<00:03:19.960> we<00:03:20.620> will<00:03:20.650> see<00:03:20.980> how<00:03:21.160> everything<00:03:21.190> turns<00:03:21.700> out

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
and we will see how everything turns out

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.840 
and we will see how everything turns out
hopefully<00:03:23.050> it's<00:03:23.170> better<00:03:23.380> than<00:03:23.620> expected<00:03:23.980> once

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
hopefully it's better than expected once

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.920 
hopefully it's better than expected once
