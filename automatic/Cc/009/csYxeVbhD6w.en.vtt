it's inevitable it's kind of a
no-brainer<00:02:32.690> once<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:33.470> can<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:33.890> it's<00:02:34.040> so

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
no-brainer once you can and it's so

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.980

other day at things were just left alone

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.240 
other day at things were just left alone
absolutely<00:03:25.190> we'd<00:03:25.790> have<00:03:25.940> deflation<00:03:27.250> but

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
absolutely we'd have deflation but

absolutely we'd have deflation but
things<00:03:28.700> aren't<00:03:28.880> just<00:03:28.970> going<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.269> be<00:03:29.330> left
