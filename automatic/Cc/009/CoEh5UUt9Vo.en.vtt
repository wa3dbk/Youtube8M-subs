00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
really struggle with and honestly when I

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.460 
really struggle with and honestly when I
first<00:03:48.130> stopped<00:03:48.790> using<00:03:49.000> toughness<00:03:49.630> I<00:03:49.810> hated<00:03:50.260> it

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
first stopped using toughness I hated it

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.080

I<00:03:50.620> couldn't<00:03:50.980> do<00:03:51.160> it<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.430> challenge<00:03:51.850> is<00:03:51.970> where

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
I couldn't do it the challenge is where

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.550 
I couldn't do it the challenge is where
i<00:03:52.120> had<00:03:52.300> to<00:03:52.420> do<00:03:52.540> no<00:03:52.690> perks<00:03:52.930> were<00:03:53.140> impossible

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
because i didn't have toughness but

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.050 
because i didn't have toughness but
after<00:03:56.590> i<00:03:56.620> stopped<00:03:57.130> playing<00:03:57.280> with<00:03:57.730> it<00:03:57.850> for<00:03:57.880> a

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060
