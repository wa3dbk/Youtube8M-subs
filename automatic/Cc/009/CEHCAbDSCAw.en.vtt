00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
to do that because the soap dries the

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.760 
to do that because the soap dries the
area<00:00:32.910> around<00:00:33.149> your<00:00:33.360> mouth<00:00:33.540> down<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:34.170> even

area around your mouth down and even
though<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.010> lotions<00:00:35.640> sometimes<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.510> soap<00:00:36.780> is

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
though you lotions sometimes the soap is

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.330 
though you lotions sometimes the soap is
just<00:00:37.170> drying<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.440> out<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.739> much<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:37.950> even<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
just drying it out so much that even the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.799 
just drying it out so much that even the
lotion<00:00:38.700> doesn't<00:00:39.000> help<00:00:39.149> so<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.510> when<00:00:39.600> you<00:00:39.660> put

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
lotion doesn't help so that when you put

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.880 
lotion doesn't help so that when you put
on<00:00:39.930> your<00:00:40.020> makeup<00:00:40.160> it's<00:00:41.160> kind<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:41.579> cakey<00:00:42.260> so<00:00:43.260> I

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
on your makeup it's kind of cakey so I

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
removing it and this is what I found

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.439 
removing it and this is what I found
that<00:00:48.360> works<00:00:48.539> best<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.670> anyways<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.910> would<00:00:51.329> not

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
that works best so anyways I would not

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.450 
that works best so anyways I would not
normally<00:00:51.629> wear<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.170> lipstick<00:00:52.620> out<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.340> my
