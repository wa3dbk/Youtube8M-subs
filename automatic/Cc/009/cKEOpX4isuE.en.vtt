00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hansa rostock will make the subject easy 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.940
 do not let go in the game against the second 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.220
 team of borussia dortmund flew 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.809
 a bower thrown on the field of 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.090
 a chaotic from the hansa block 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.769
 that alone is worth a lot 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.900
 but then it makes for incomprehension 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.800
 reaction or better the non-reaction 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.230
 from player coach and club leadership 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.350
 the 71- minute game in the Dortmunder 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.810
 arena a banger popping so violently that 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.490
 the camera tripod staggering the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.830
 banger explodes on the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.320
 Torauslinie and came from the hansa 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.870
 fanblock the suffering dortmund 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.120
 zlatan alomerovic the culprit for a short time 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.100
 beheaded, the umpire interrupts 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.500
 the game and hansa trainer marc fascher 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.539
 and captain sebastian pelzer try 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.829
 the fans calm the behavior 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.820
 they do not want that chaotic 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:55.620
 do not say condemn 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.320
 this last end with the point here 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.559
 Satisfied in the question of the alcohol tariff 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.640
 Home I stood next to it as correct 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.640
 fear it goes through mark and leg 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.760
 sorry but I still want to 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.460
 express 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.440
 so the club sympathizes and playful 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.360
 must be punished again with a fine 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.400
 the dfb count and employee my 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.350
 colleague and hansa reporter jan the tube 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.910
 gaitÃ¡n how did you experience the incident 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.710
 luckily, I sat on my reporter 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.390
 Place at safe distance 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.860
 you have to say maybe that is 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.990
 immediately before this bÃ¶ller ignited 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.700
 There has been quite a stir in the 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.470
 hansa block because on the day came a fan 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.300
 train with rostocker trailers too late 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.460
 and then they came with several 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.260
 a hundred man in this blog rhine and im 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.000
 this restlessness is because of this 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.710
 Boulders really just thrown there 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.320
 a few meters next to the dortmunder 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.610
 Goalkeeper is then exploded and there 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.320
 everybody has big ones 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.550
 get scared and you can really 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.620
 only earlier that does not happen anymore 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.090
 It certainly was a one offender 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.979
 but even a bÃ¶ller thrower is 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.600
 Of course, so much else happens 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.150
 such incidents at hansa rostock 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.740
 it is always new 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.960
 coach player and club leadership 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.700
 really not clear that happen why 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.020
 I expect everyone 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.220
 individual players now on this position 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.679
 but at least I think 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.420
 captain and coach and also 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.430
 the club leaders have to 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.870
 show clear edge and say that one 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.190
 clearly condemned such an incident 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.060
 that did not happen there 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.739
 been kept silent 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.060
 the only one who said what was 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.290
 hansa press officer and who has in 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.489
 his statements then one more 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.090
 more or less unhappy figure 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.070
 submitted 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.840
 yes why is that so i have more or 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.760
 less the impression than learning is the 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.170
 radical fan scene actually succeeded 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.360
 is so much pressure on the club 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.620
 to train that nobody there 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.060
 anything more dares anything at all 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.010
 critical to say that anyway 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.700
 heated mood not even further 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.140
 worsen 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.550
 in three weeks is then still 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.019
 members' meeting there you want too 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.610
 have a nice atmosphere 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.140
 reasonably nice atmosphere 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.940
 but I'm afraid that the fc hansa 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.170
 by the silence or by the 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.060
 not solve a single problem 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.980
 are you actually hoping 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.570
 that hansa even has this topic fan 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.730
 Problem still in the handle to get 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.840
 I'm afraid that the fc hansa still 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.850
 very very long with this problematic 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.140
 will attach there are some 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.120
 fundamental discussions 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.830
 for example the discussion about this 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.090
 Burning pyrotechnics in the stadium that 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.560
 is a special hansa problem 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.080
 that is a nationwide but concerns 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.970
 just the fc hansa then there are the 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.260
 closed south tribune the active one 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.360
 fanszene wants the south grandstand 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.340
 is opened again and there I see 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.320
 only very difficult possibilities 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.850
 the solution can be found with those 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.800
 either 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.540
 the fans as well as the club live well 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.640
 can and as long as there is not one 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.050
 common strategy is being worked on 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.430
 and it will be implemented 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.110
 Again and again a few chaotics give the 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.620
 to inflict serious harm on 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.260
 become 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.530
 thanks a lot for yours 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.530
 assessment
