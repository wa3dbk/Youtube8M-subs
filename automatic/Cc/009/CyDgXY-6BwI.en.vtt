00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
gigahertz processor so if we take a look

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.290 
gigahertz processor so if we take a look
around<00:00:38.350> the<00:00:38.589> system<00:00:38.769> it<00:00:38.979> is<00:00:39.010> running<00:00:39.460> let's

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
around the system it is running let's

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.020 
around the system it is running let's
take<00:00:40.479> a<00:00:40.510> look<00:00:40.719> here<00:00:40.749> at<00:00:41.229> the<00:00:41.530> about<00:00:41.969> tablet<00:00:42.969> you

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
take a look here at the about tablet you

take a look here at the about tablet you
can<00:00:43.089> see<00:00:43.269> it's<00:00:43.420> running<00:00:43.659> a<00:00:44.019> lovely<00:00:44.949> version<00:00:45.309> of

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
can see it's running a lovely version of

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.069 
can see it's running a lovely version of
Ice<00:00:45.549> Cream<00:00:45.789> Sandwich<00:00:45.819> let's<00:00:46.569> find<00:00:46.809> out<00:00:46.929> which

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
Ice Cream Sandwich let's find out which

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.280 
Ice Cream Sandwich let's find out which
one<00:00:47.999> four-point-oh<00:00:48.999> point<00:00:49.269> for<00:00:49.690> so<00:00:50.229> very<00:00:50.649> nice

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
one four-point-oh point for so very nice

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.050 
one four-point-oh point for so very nice
so<00:00:52.800> if<00:00:52.950> you<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.250> kind<00:00:53.400> of<00:00:53.460> go<00:00:53.580> back<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.970> take

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
so if you just kind of go back and take

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.400 
so if you just kind of go back and take
a<00:00:54.120> little<00:00:54.270> look<00:00:54.480> around<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.870> system<00:00:55.050> let's

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
a little look around the system let's

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.590 
a little look around the system let's
see<00:00:55.530> if<00:00:55.590> we<00:00:55.650> can<00:00:55.770> pull<00:00:55.920> up<00:00:56.010> any<00:00:56.160> photos<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:57.450> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
see if we can pull up any photos in the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.990 
see if we can pull up any photos in the
gallery<00:00:58.550> there<00:00:59.550> are<00:00:59.700> any

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.340 

you<00:01:02.480> can<00:01:02.600> see<00:01:02.750> it's<00:01:02.930> actually<00:01:03.230> pretty

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
you can see it's actually pretty

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.470 
you can see it's actually pretty
responsive<00:01:04.070> it<00:01:04.640> hasn't<00:01:04.910> been<00:01:04.970> many<00:01:05.150> photos

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
responsive it hasn't been many photos

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.880 
responsive it hasn't been many photos
taken<00:01:05.840> so<00:01:05.870> you<00:01:06.020> can<00:01:06.140> see<00:01:06.290> there's<00:01:06.440> one<00:01:06.470> here

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
taken so you can see there's one here

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.670 
taken so you can see there's one here
the<00:01:07.730> rear<00:01:07.940> facing<00:01:08.210> camera<00:01:08.840> does<00:01:09.140> have<00:01:09.350> a<00:01:09.380> three

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
the rear facing camera does have a three

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.950 
the rear facing camera does have a three
point<00:01:09.950> it<00:01:10.220> just<00:01:10.250> have<00:01:10.580> a<00:01:10.610> 3.2<00:01:11.360> megapixel

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
point it just have a 3.2 megapixel

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.430 
point it just have a 3.2 megapixel
shooter<00:01:12.140> and<00:01:12.979> here<00:01:13.220> we<00:01:13.370> have<00:01:13.400> a<00:01:13.900> point<00:01:14.900> three

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
shooter and here we have a point three

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.750 
shooter and here we have a point three
megapixel<00:01:15.650> shooter<00:01:16.160> so<00:01:16.430> does<00:01:16.550> have<00:01:16.700> a

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
megapixel shooter so does have a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.030 
megapixel shooter so does have a
capacitive<00:01:17.360> multi-touch<00:01:18.080> screen<00:01:18.619> as<00:01:18.770> you<00:01:18.800> can

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
capacitive multi-touch screen as you can

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.740 
capacitive multi-touch screen as you can
see<00:01:19.250> here<00:01:19.550> but<00:01:20.060> it<00:01:20.240> starts<00:01:20.510> to<00:01:20.600> get<00:01:20.690> really

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
see here but it starts to get really

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.969 
see here but it starts to get really
interesting<00:01:21.140> when<00:01:21.440> we<00:01:21.530> take<00:01:21.710> a<00:01:21.740> walk<00:01:21.950> around

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
interesting when we take a walk around

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.100 
interesting when we take a walk around
the<00:01:22.369> side<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.180> that's<00:01:23.300> a<00:01:23.390> power<00:01:23.600> button<00:01:23.869> of

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
the side so that's a power button of

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.170 
the side so that's a power button of
volume<00:01:24.440> rocker<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:25.130> then<00:01:25.670> if<00:01:25.760> we<00:01:25.910> kind<00:01:26.119> of

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
volume rocker and then if we kind of

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.660 
volume rocker and then if we kind of
flip<00:01:26.390> this<00:01:26.540> open<00:01:26.900> here

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.480 

you<00:01:32.180> can<00:01:32.330> see<00:01:32.479> that<00:01:32.509> we<00:01:32.750> have<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:32.930> sim<00:01:33.229> card<00:01:33.530> slot

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
you can see that we have a sim card slot

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.300 
you can see that we have a sim card slot
so<00:01:34.520> this<00:01:34.850> does<00:01:35.060> have<00:01:35.299> 3g<00:01:36.049> and<00:01:36.770> then<00:01:36.950> we<00:01:37.130> also

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
so this does have 3g and then we also

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.810 
so this does have 3g and then we also
have<00:01:37.490> a<00:01:38.140> micro<00:01:39.140> sim<00:01:39.320> a<00:01:39.560> micro<00:01:40.100> SD<00:01:40.310> card<00:01:40.520> here<00:01:40.640> to

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
have a micro sim a micro SD card here to

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.389 
have a micro sim a micro SD card here to
expand<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.360> memory<00:01:41.540> it<00:01:42.259> has<00:01:42.409> four<00:01:42.799> gigs<00:01:43.100> of

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
expand the memory it has four gigs of

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.149 
expand the memory it has four gigs of
internal<00:01:43.490> memory<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:44.390> 512mb<00:01:45.110> of<00:01:45.290> ram<00:01:45.619> so

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
internal memory and 512mb of ram so

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.889 
internal memory and 512mb of ram so
because<00:01:46.670> it<00:01:46.759> only<00:01:46.850> has<00:01:47.000> four<00:01:47.210> gigs<00:01:47.390> it's

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
because it only has four gigs it's

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.330 
because it only has four gigs it's
actually<00:01:48.229> a<00:01:48.259> very<00:01:48.350> affordable<00:01:48.710> way<00:01:49.009> to<00:01:49.039> kind

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
actually a very affordable way to kind

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.120 
actually a very affordable way to kind
of<00:01:49.369> expand<00:01:50.229> expand<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.350> memory<00:01:51.500> there<00:01:51.860> and

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
of expand expand the memory there and

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.529 
of expand expand the memory there and
since<00:01:52.369> we<00:01:52.460> want<00:01:52.549> to<00:01:52.700> be<00:01:52.789> accessing<00:01:53.149> that<00:01:53.330> very

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
since we want to be accessing that very

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:54.880 
since we want to be accessing that very
often<00:01:53.750> that's<00:01:54.170> why<00:01:54.320> come<00:01:54.530> to<00:01:54.560> this<00:01:54.710> little

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
often that's why come to this little

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.340
