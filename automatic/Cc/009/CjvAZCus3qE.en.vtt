00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 2nd 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.110
 hello everyone is steven and today 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.410
 I present you a new cydia tweak 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.549
 called simplepass code button and 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.260
 who as his name says goes us 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.640
 allow to modify the buttons that 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.800
 are used to enter the code of 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.280
 unlocking under ios here on the screen 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.050
 locking 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.700
 so there you can see we have them 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.740
 numbers and letters just below 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.150
 inside each circle so the 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.530
 ten keys that are present on your 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.460
 lock screen when you have 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.050
 selected a code 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.510
 so I show you how to edit 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.280
 all this with this tweak you have three 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.440
 choice of display possible by default 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.390
 hidden the letters or so all hidden 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.340
 so far it was the display by 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.780
 defect there if I check the letters where 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.700
 you and I always have the circle with 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.079
 the figure inside but there is 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.760
 plus the three letters below 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.350
 every touch so that changes it's a 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.760
 little bit different you can 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.160
 select that if you want or 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.510
 so hide everything I unlock my 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.489
 iphone and look now 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.840
 the display that I have nothing more to 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.850
 inside the keys we simply 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.410
 the circle that defines the outlines and 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.300
 more numbers more letters to 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.280
 inside it will look like that so 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.600
 it's rather original and it prevents you 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.499
 not unlock one each key 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.520
 always works the same way 

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:10.229
 as if there was the figure to 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.590
 inside if you have selected by 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.630
 fault 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.799
 so that's how it works here 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.060
 in the configuration panel of the 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.499
 tweak among the two options of 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.149
 customization available you 

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:19.619
 select the one you prefer 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.380
 so if you're interested 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.700
 install simplepass beat beatles this is 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.530

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.659
 free on cydia on the source of 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.310
 big boss is only compatible with 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.289
 the ios is obviously more than there 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.969
 saw it is the new interface of 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.689
 unlocking with security code of 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.509
 bone 7 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.799
 with these particular circles so 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.479
 it's not bad at all like little tweak 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.899

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.639

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.079
 it will interest them so tell me what 

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:44.310
