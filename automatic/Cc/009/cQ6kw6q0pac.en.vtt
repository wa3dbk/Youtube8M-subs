00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.759
 Hello my dear, today I want you 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.870
 show how to make a French braid 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:16.320
 So you can braid first you need 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:19.859
 a few hair ties and maybe one 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.260
 couple clinging to hairclips 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:33.239
 fixing but what would be good is one 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:38.850
 Brush and so a flush with it leaves 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:43.140
 it all came from it 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.550
 draw sami first you have to now 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.550
 the jaunt into the green 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:02.900
 evenly with the brush served so 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.910
 that there are no girls left because that 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.770
 is very important for the French 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:15.500
 braid and then looks after all 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:18.320
 Neat from the good thing about this 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.250
 structure is not just that hair 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:26.000
 simply recognizable no would have helped 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.920
 also for hair sprays it uses it for 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.200
 for every now and very healthy as 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.750
 but it does not mean that much 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.700
 jump on it otherwise have that 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.200
 finished very quickly or looks ready 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:43.460
 from no more than seven times 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:49.780
 spraying was important as well 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.780
 very delicious and very very fresh 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:58.929
 if you have removed all knots then 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:03.560
 as I now with my girlfriend the 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:07.550
 Now you have to look back 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:12.320
 you divide the hair and that one 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:16.670
 You take the upper part of it for a quarter of the time 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.580
 part in the hair and jammed the john 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.200
 then everything backwards 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.650
 This is the beginning of the French 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.650
 braid off 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.170
 not exactly for those who are not 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.470
 I know how to explain the night 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:41.290
 that everything is nice again 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:44.370
 and so comb that in detail 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:49.720
 most important with as well a nice one 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.940
 so many people get it all in three 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:03:00.280
 strands on as well as the common 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:10.500
 plat puts a rove for 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:13.510
 others over the others the strands 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.989
 then again about the other 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.540
 that's normal braiding is coming now 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:23.680
 the special 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:28.600
 you take a strand from behind 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:35.100
 So from the very front and sends 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:42.630
 this then to the strand outside 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:45.970
 add and weaves which then with a 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:54.340
 exactly the same on the other 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:56.860
 All this back on the page 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.880
 repeat the other side and always 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.440
 everything also nice smooth FÃ¼rstensohn not 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.900
 even with my hands like me now 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.780
 make it nice too 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.720
 gets neat though if a few 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.620
 hang out hair that's not right 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:22.110
 there is a needle for it I have 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:26.669
 The same ends for you to pick up again 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:29.669
 Add stranded hair 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.669
 weave 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.300
 braids in the hair add lichen 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:49.190
 Strands in the hair add bad 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:59.890
 now there are no hair left 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:59.890
 still braiding until the peak years 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.280
 See it up now 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:17.410
 Now you take the rubbers you around 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:25.450
 a wrist has fastened and that 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:29.400
 she wiggled around the braid camera 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.400
 however, the tripod came 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.090
 OK 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:41.290
 the French braid itself is now 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:44.530
 actually done now we lead the 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:49.860
 I'm not involved with them 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.860
 but still have to add with brackets 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:15.320
 and all this you then fasten beautifully 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:19.070
 with hairspray and yours is done 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.070
 French braid
