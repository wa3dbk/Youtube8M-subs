 It's a difficult place yes 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:09.250
 How is the start timing of this section 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:12.180
 Because the start is a little more than a home one can not go at full speed 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.980
 Better in four words back 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:22.550
