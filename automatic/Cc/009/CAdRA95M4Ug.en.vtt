00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.580 
don't know because I heard it's hella
long<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:45.740> right<00:01:46.700> now<00:01:46.909> you<00:01:47.510> know<00:01:47.659> might<00:01:48.290> not<00:01:48.440> be

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
long and right now you know might not be

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.080 
long and right now you know might not be
the<00:01:48.710> best<00:01:48.890> time<00:01:48.979> but<00:01:49.250> I<00:01:49.310> definitely<00:01:49.549> want<00:01:50.030> to

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
the best time but I definitely want to

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.990 
the best time but I definitely want to
try<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:50.330> out<00:01:50.570> for<00:01:50.990> ten<00:01:51.200> bucks<00:01:51.470> I<00:01:51.860> got<00:01:52.220> dark<00:01:52.700> void

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
try it out for ten bucks I got dark void

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.060 
try it out for ten bucks I got dark void
which<00:01:53.540> is<00:01:53.720> crazy<00:01:53.960> because<00:01:54.320> this<00:01:54.650> just<00:01:54.830> came

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
which is crazy because this just came

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.740 
which is crazy because this just came
out<00:01:55.310> earlier<00:01:55.850> this<00:01:55.909> year<00:01:56.119> I<00:01:56.299> want<00:01:56.540> to<00:01:56.630> say

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
out earlier this year I want to say

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.140 
out earlier this year I want to say
maybe<00:01:56.960> january<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:57.890> i<00:01:58.430> guess<00:01:58.610> it<00:01:58.760> didn't<00:01:59.000> sell

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
maybe january and i guess it didn't sell

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.880 
maybe january and i guess it didn't sell
that<00:01:59.299> well<00:01:59.450> because<00:01:59.930> it's<00:02:00.200> only<00:02:00.380> ten<00:02:00.680> bucks

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
that well because it's only ten bucks

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.310 
that well because it's only ten bucks
but<00:02:01.310> from<00:02:02.240> what<00:02:02.360> I<00:02:02.420> play<00:02:02.689> to<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.960> demo<00:02:03.200> I

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
but from what I play to the demo I

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.050 
but from what I play to the demo I
didn't<00:02:03.650> really<00:02:03.740> like<00:02:04.009> it<00:02:04.070> too<00:02:04.310> much<00:02:04.340> but<00:02:04.850> the

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
didn't really like it too much but the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.030 
didn't really like it too much but the
fact<00:02:05.299> that<00:02:05.360> it<00:02:05.540> was<00:02:05.630> ten<00:02:05.869> dollars<00:02:06.229> alone<00:02:06.560> was

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
fact that it was ten dollars alone was

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.469 
fact that it was ten dollars alone was
enough<00:02:07.159> for<00:02:07.340> me<00:02:07.490> to<00:02:07.670> pick<00:02:07.820> it<00:02:07.939> up<00:02:08.060> brand-new

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
enough for me to pick it up brand-new

up<00:03:38.390> system<00:03:38.420> so<00:03:39.290> that's<00:03:39.530> really<00:03:39.739> good<00:03:40.070> but<00:03:40.940> the

up system so that's really good but the

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.720 
up system so that's really good but the
game<00:03:41.480> is<00:03:41.630> hard<00:03:41.959> it's<00:03:42.440> hard<00:03:42.830> and<00:03:43.160> I<00:03:43.370> consider

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.949 
myself pretty good at racing games and I
still<00:03:45.980> think<00:03:46.220> it's<00:03:46.340> hard<00:03:46.549> so<00:03:47.239> I<00:03:47.690> definitely

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
still think it's hard so I definitely

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.870 
still think it's hard so I definitely
have<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:48.530> spend<00:03:48.769> more<00:03:48.890> time<00:03:48.950> with<00:03:49.160> this<00:03:49.459> try<00:03:49.820> to
