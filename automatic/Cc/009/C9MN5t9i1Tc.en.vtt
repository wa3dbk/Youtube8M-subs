00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.420
 now a sure report of her nero that if a person who had who 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.820
 maybe had a system for all computers and amiga computers 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.959
 watari 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.339
 hops broke down sir alassane 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:19.369
 but this market will stand to us citizens since it is the reader 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.810
 floppy yale the plastiki it's so much better 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.509
 how many copies 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.319
 and the hall 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.319
 last year deposits in central banks 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.040
 we are bridled on this chain 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.130
 christelle 148 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.130
 if we are currently ap 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.000
 click here this second place 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.190
 we giving him under 14 who spent his team did not get 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.979
 worried 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:50.620
 in a few days the fiji but not too much 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.050
 it is still packaged 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.050
 to let them know what I saw 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.700
 oh that's my engine is the same as with my heart of the Camargue 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.510
 percent and that I had put away for me 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.940
 studies 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.300
 and gerard louis leyrat need here 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.740
 and I started wanting to use but the judges 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.440
 to fly away with some animals 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.980
 new demo that darkens and regularly 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.380
 but I soon realized that 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.120
 until when and the disc landed too much 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.280
 I thought why not directly transferred the program down al-atar 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.180
 line 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.540
 by a cap 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.520
 how many old machines hang in the cupboards because no one 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.690
 can touch disks 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.400
 it's a plan all the time it's very slow the readers are often 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.920
 broke down short it's a horror while on pc one can easily 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.140
 store thousands of virtual tours what's called taking 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.180
 disk image 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.570
 the idea of ​​saying so was to create an electronic card that allows to 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.090
 transform the disk images stored on a hiking pc directly 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.580
 understandable by the family electronics this is the prototype that 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.450
 I believed outside 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.240
 In a week 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.240
 so it's connected to the port by the bbc 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.200
 sunday morning outside a diet and pc to get laid 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.049
 disks floppies on the size this way 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.319
 I make a page or happy that had a lower rise point the 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.079
 project with the interface by ms ebadi had a lot of reactions including from 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.249
 the sonata iii 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:25.139
 it is understandable but 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.829
 when you know that it's almost impossible to recreate a visit to 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.519
 paris edited from a pc 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.349
 and it's even worse with the friendly 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.219
 that uses a magnetic encoding 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.379
 treatment different from that of other matches 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.709
 jet thus realizes an English version of the film electors map 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.079
 master of cooking open source on his site 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.179
 that very few action scenes that the successor cms would be crazy enough 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.669
 they are often difficult wishing that the accused 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:53.719
 four other branches 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.069
 everything else is 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.429
 the characters and their electronic form 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:00.759
 the job in the matter 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:02.969
 he knocked down 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.969
 you also need to know that the floppy disk 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:09.979
 their favorites 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:11.669
 now live on the flanks 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.669
 so in a few years some time the fact that women 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:20.549
 the interested party especially to be able to continue to use 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.799
 9th China 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.479
 when we see the house 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:28.479
 ouattara simply plugs into ok 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.439
 face to face 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.049
 just promising punch 

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:45.809
 and pcf side 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.549
 everything started the application 

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:54.589
 and to change the picture all want to take three 

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:57.079
 your know-how of our favorites 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.719
 and this high school 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:02.719
 on Normandy at the window 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:06.229
 to start your opinion 

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:11.289
 Let's go 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.269
 so where we could see in photo I'm 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.239
 I want to implement 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.239
 titled red to indicate the position actually reading note 

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:33.490
 so this is the only chance canceled 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.990
 the rise of vancouver fuels is evident that the images of the games are 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.240
 stored on them 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.020
 but this card works autonomously 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.620
 with size or color 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.620
 olsen debate in europe 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:48.419
 violent between 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.419
 besides this standalone version the version 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.979
 the cake to the pc 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.960
 the people who of course preferred 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.979
 a few days before anything 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.809
 not only will I be able to change the air for the very movies 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:04.900
 quickly 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.900
 on the evening off safely 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:11.969
 several injured police officers 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:15.819
 yes a lot of requests proof that it is so far in lyon for others 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:16.889
 appliances 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.270
 of synthesizers the bomb of some European companies% of the machines 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.349
 tooling 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.999
 I must add in addition that 5 of this kind of it is this autonomous theme 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.940
 the us would be responsible for doing something like 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:32.650
 it's cheap 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:33.590
 you would have understood it 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.080
 this floppy emulator is indeed compatible with a large 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.089
 variety of china like the cpc the most popular mygale rica 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:43.259
 if some models of synthesizers 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.259
 so thank you tf1 to revive all our old bikes 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:50.219
 There's more to getting out of soldering iron 

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:00.059
 secondly because I started with the film mostra in 

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:03.549
 had bought the balloon mostra at the game consoles and another at 6128 

00:06:03.549 --> 00:06:04.969
 1628 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:07.659
 besides, the only thing that really makes me want to sing 

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:09.210
 video games what 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.330
 but I did not have the career that I had the amiga I chose the right way 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.879
 all these players 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:17.129
 so for me it's not conceivable that I think 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:19.960
 I think we need to take into account the needs of the banks again 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.680
 so the costs 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.430
 I can like you 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.430
 orienting lost 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.500
