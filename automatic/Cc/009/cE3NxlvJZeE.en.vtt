00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
alright I gonna do a quick review on the

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.450 
alright I gonna do a quick review on the
sharp<00:00:06.540> Magnum<00:00:07.020> which<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.529> blood<00:00:07.890> just<00:00:08.040> Sharpie

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
sharp Magnum which is blood just Sharpie

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.839 
sharp Magnum which is blood just Sharpie
at<00:00:08.580> least<00:00:08.730> that<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:09.000> know<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:12.290> the<00:00:13.290> nibs

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
at least that I know of the nibs

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:19.130 
at least that I know of the nibs
probably<00:00:16.400> 15<00:00:17.400> millimeters<00:00:17.970> i<00:00:18.180> would<00:00:18.960> say

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
probably 15 millimeters i would say

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.980 
probably 15 millimeters i would say
chisel<00:00:20.100> tip<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.490> side<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.600> its<00:00:21.750> like<00:00:21.960> a

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
chisel tip and side of its like a

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:27.859 
centimeters to 10 millimeters being

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.260 
centimeters to 10 millimeters being
maybe<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.980> little<00:00:29.070> bit<00:00:29.220> less<00:00:29.400> but<00:00:31.969> can<00:00:32.969> do<00:00:33.090> some

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
maybe a little bit less but can do some

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.270 
maybe a little bit less but can do some
nice<00:00:33.420> riding<00:00:33.719> with<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.110> only<00:00:34.920> on<00:00:35.010> flat

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
nice riding with it only on flat

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.830 
nice riding with it only on flat
surfaces<00:00:36.920> I<00:00:37.969> think<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.059> does<00:00:39.210> work<00:00:39.420> on<00:00:39.600> glass

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
surfaces I think it does work on glass

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.350 
surfaces I think it does work on glass
and<00:00:40.219> metal<00:00:41.219> but<00:00:41.520> probably<00:00:41.879> it's<00:00:42.030> pretty

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
and metal but probably it's pretty

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.440 
and metal but probably it's pretty
probably<00:00:42.809> easy<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.230> buff<00:00:43.850> anyone<00:00:44.850> semi-hard

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
probably easy to buff anyone semi-hard

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.240 
probably easy to buff anyone semi-hard
services<00:00:46.020> as<00:00:46.620> long<00:00:46.860> as<00:00:46.980> there's<00:00:47.129> nothing

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
services as long as there's nothing

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.010 
services as long as there's nothing
gagging<00:00:47.850> because<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.329> will<00:00:48.420> just<00:00:48.600> catch<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
gagging because it will just catch the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:01:04.150 
gagging because it will just catch the
felt<00:00:49.230> on<00:00:49.410> here<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.710> start<00:00:49.950> wrecking<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.250> apart

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.190 

this<00:01:05.160> is<00:01:05.460> unlike<00:01:05.940> kind<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.360> what<00:01:06.540> an<00:01:06.870> almost

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
this is unlike kind of what an almost

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:18.469 
this is unlike kind of what an almost
six<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:07.680> writing<00:01:08.010> as<00:01:08.070> well<00:01:09.620> paper<00:01:17.150> it's<00:01:18.150> tricky

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
six on writing as well paper it's tricky

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.580 
six on writing as well paper it's tricky
because<00:01:18.870> it<00:01:19.410> doesn't<00:01:19.680> flow<00:01:19.830> very<00:01:20.070> well<00:01:20.570> um

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
because it doesn't flow very well um

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.930 
because it doesn't flow very well um
it's<00:01:22.590> not<00:01:22.740> really<00:01:22.950> cheap<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.520> what<00:01:23.550> you<00:01:23.760> get

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
it's not really cheap for what you get

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.450 
it's not really cheap for what you get
so<00:01:24.590> I'll<00:01:25.590> personally<00:01:25.800> I<00:01:26.040> don't<00:01:26.130> think<00:01:26.250> it's

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
so I'll personally I don't think it's

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.480 
so I'll personally I don't think it's
very<00:01:26.520> much<00:01:26.820> worth<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.979> maybe<00:01:28.979> if<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.160> took<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
very much worth it maybe if it took the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.400 
very much worth it maybe if it took the
nip<00:01:29.670> out<00:01:29.790> or<00:01:29.970> something<00:01:30.330> did<00:01:30.930> something<00:01:31.290> with

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
nip out or something did something with

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:39.830 
nip out or something did something with
that<00:01:32.390> see<00:01:33.390> if<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.540> can<00:01:33.630> do<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:38.660> can't<00:01:39.660> get

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
that see if you can do that I can't get

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.810 
that see if you can do that I can't get
mine<00:01:40.050> but<00:01:40.410> I'm<00:01:40.950> sure<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.369> filled<00:01:41.580> with<00:01:41.729> you

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
mine but I'm sure if you filled with you

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.040 
mine but I'm sure if you filled with you
might<00:01:41.970> be<00:01:42.060> able<00:01:42.149> to<00:01:42.240> fill<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.630> something

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
might be able to fill up something

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.830 
might be able to fill up something
better<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:44.729> marker<00:01:45.119> could<00:01:45.300> be<00:01:45.390> nice<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:45.810> you

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
better the marker could be nice if you

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.440 
better the marker could be nice if you
put<00:01:46.440> some<00:01:46.560> kind<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.740> felt<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.100> there<00:01:47.250> because

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
put some kind of felt in there because

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.260 
put some kind of felt in there because
it's<00:01:48.450> durable<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.020> everything<00:01:49.850> you<00:01:50.850> put<00:01:51.090> like

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
it's durable and everything you put like

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.480 
it's durable and everything you put like
smash<00:01:51.660> ink<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.080> there<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.440> it<00:01:53.040> won't<00:01:53.220> bother

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
smash ink in there and it won't bother

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.570 
smash ink in there and it won't bother
the<00:01:54.770> metal<00:01:55.770> or<00:01:55.890> anything<00:01:56.160> you<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.460> worry

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
the metal or anything you have to worry

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.130 
the metal or anything you have to worry
about<00:01:56.670> what's<00:01:56.970> on<00:01:57.060> top<00:01:57.330> but<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.990> use

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
about what's on top but you use

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.889 
about what's on top but you use
something<00:01:58.380> cheap<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.509> dish<00:02:00.509> washing

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
something cheap like the dish washing

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.960 
something cheap like the dish washing
cloth<00:02:01.140> thing<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.560> showed<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.770> in<00:02:02.070> my<00:02:02.460> door

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
cloth thing that I showed you in my door

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.840 
cloth thing that I showed you in my door
sman<00:02:03.560> probably<00:02:04.560> work<00:02:04.680> just<00:02:04.710> fine<00:02:05.660> so<00:02:06.660> it

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
sman probably work just fine so it

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.570 
sman probably work just fine so it
really<00:02:08.850> all<00:02:09.030> depends<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:12.980> whether<00:02:13.980> or<00:02:14.160> not<00:02:14.250> you

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
really all depends on whether or not you

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.180 
really all depends on whether or not you
can<00:02:14.819> get<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.660> top<00:02:15.930> off<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.500> make<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.800> worth<00:02:16.980> it

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
can get the top off to make it worth it

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.880 
can get the top off to make it worth it
I<00:02:17.420> wouldn't<00:02:18.420> buy<00:02:18.569> it<00:02:18.600> just<00:02:19.170> get<00:02:19.350> regular<00:02:19.530> mops

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
I wouldn't buy it just get regular mops

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:27.470 
I wouldn't buy it just get regular mops
on<00:02:20.100> with<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:22.880> I'll<00:02:23.880> test<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.420> ink<00:02:26.480> just

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
on with that I'll test the ink just

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.960 
on with that I'll test the ink just
going<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.720> put<00:02:27.840> some<00:02:27.870> bursal<00:02:28.610> on<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.640> piece<00:02:29.940> of

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
going to put some bursal on a piece of

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.150 
going to put some bursal on a piece of
scratchy<00:02:30.660> scratchy<00:02:30.930> paper<00:02:31.319> with<00:02:31.800> on<00:02:31.920> paper

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
scratchy scratchy paper with on paper

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.400 
scratchy scratchy paper with on paper
but<00:02:32.750> this<00:02:33.750> thing<00:02:34.020> over<00:02:34.170> here<00:02:36.020> it's<00:02:37.020> a<00:02:37.140> lot<00:02:37.290> of

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
but this thing over here it's a lot of

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:46.199 
but this thing over here it's a lot of
arsal<00:02:37.740> by<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.950> way<00:02:38.209> so

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:53.430 

it's<00:02:47.709> taking<00:02:48.709> like<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.980> black<00:02:49.190> finish<00:02:49.610> on<00:02:49.790> but

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.790 

I'm<00:02:54.440> doing<00:02:54.680> much<00:02:54.860> I<00:02:55.959> take<00:02:56.959> a<00:02:56.989> lot<00:02:57.080> to<00:02:57.290> rub<00:02:57.769> that

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
I'm doing much I take a lot to rub that

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.449 
I'm doing much I take a lot to rub that
off<00:02:58.160> so<00:02:59.019> it<00:03:00.019> only<00:03:00.140> skip<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.620> buffs<00:03:00.830> trouble<00:03:01.370> if

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
off so it only skip the buffs trouble if
