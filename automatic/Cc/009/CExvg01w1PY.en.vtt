to get the best quality audio on set so
that<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.830> have<00:00:29.279> less<00:00:29.490> work<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.090> do<00:00:30.330> in

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
that you have less work to do in

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.179 
that you have less work to do in
post-production<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.590> lot<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.769> people<00:00:32.070> will

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.400 
post-production and a lot of people will
say<00:00:32.430> oh<00:00:32.669> we'll<00:00:33.059> just<00:00:33.270> fix<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.809> post

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
say oh we'll just fix it in post

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.760 
say oh we'll just fix it in post
really<00:00:34.739> one<00:00:35.489> minute<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.880> work<00:00:36.149> on<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.719> set<00:00:36.989> can

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
really one minute of work on the set can

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.160 
really one minute of work on the set can
save<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.340> 20<00:00:39.149> minutes<00:00:39.329> or<00:00:39.629> more<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
save you 20 minutes or more in the

save you 20 minutes or more in the
studio<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.940> saves<00:00:42.180> time<00:00:42.270> on

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
studio and so that saves time on

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.350 
studio and so that saves time on
production<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.230> also<00:00:43.800> money<00:00:44.489> there<00:00:45.270> are

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
production and also money there are

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.490 
production and also money there are
different<00:00:45.629> types<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.960> sounds<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.469> can

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
different types of sounds that you can

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.840 
different types of sounds that you can
record<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.399> set

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
record on the set

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.850 
record on the set
there<00:00:48.270> are<00:00:48.390> sync<00:00:48.629> sounds<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.320> there<00:00:49.410> are<00:00:49.500> wild

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
there are sync sounds and there are wild

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.889 
there are sync sounds and there are wild
sounds<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.760> your<00:00:50.910> same<00:00:51.120> sounds<00:00:51.539> will<00:00:51.629> be<00:00:51.750> your

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
sounds so your same sounds will be your

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.459 
sounds so your same sounds will be your
dialogue<00:00:52.289> tracks<00:00:52.620> or<00:00:53.059> any<00:00:54.059> sort<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.480> actual

dialogue tracks or any sort of actual
sounds<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:55.980> you'll<00:00:56.100> need<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.309> sync<00:00:56.610> up<00:00:56.730> with

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
sounds that you'll need to sync up with

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.209 
sounds that you'll need to sync up with
a<00:00:56.910> picture<00:00:57.329> your<00:00:57.989> wild<00:00:58.320> sounds<00:00:58.770> could<00:00:58.890> be<00:00:59.039> your

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
a picture your wild sounds could be your

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.720 
a picture your wild sounds could be your
room<00:00:59.489> tone<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.359> could<00:01:00.780> be<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.520> hard<00:01:02.520> sound

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
room tone it could be a hard sound

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.969 
room tone it could be a hard sound
effect<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.750> need<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.049> record<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.680> set

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
effect that you need to record on set

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.060 
effect that you need to record on set
because<00:01:05.479> you<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> specific<00:01:07.200> object<00:01:07.799> or

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
right on set that gives people in

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.660 
right on set that gives people in
post-production<00:01:13.049> freedom<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:14.070> either<00:01:14.369> use

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
post-production freedom to either use

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.789 
post-production freedom to either use
that<00:01:14.700> sound<00:01:15.180> or<00:01:15.450> they<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.140> create<00:01:16.439> their<00:01:16.619> own

that sound or they can create their own

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.770 
that sound or they can create their own
so<00:01:17.460> let's<00:01:17.640> talk<00:01:17.790> about<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.210> gear<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.630> you'll

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
so let's talk about the gear that you'll

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.410 
so let's talk about the gear that you'll
need<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.020> record<00:01:19.590> audio<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:20.040> set<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.390> a

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
need to record audio on set so this is a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.030 
need to record audio on set so this is a
common<00:01:21.750> microphone<00:01:22.200> used<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> film<00:01:22.979> set

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
common microphone used on a film set

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.460 
common microphone used on a film set
it's<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.580> shotgun<00:01:23.820> mic<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:25.080> means<00:01:25.229> it'll

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
it's a shotgun mic and it means it'll

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.770 
it's a shotgun mic and it means it'll
capture<00:01:25.890> right<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.189> front<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.850> reject

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
capture right in front of it and reject

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.990 
capture right in front of it and reject
a<00:01:27.869> lot<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.229> sounds<00:01:28.619> around<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.939> is

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
a lot of the sounds around it so this is

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.920 
a lot of the sounds around it so this is
really<00:01:30.270> good<00:01:30.570> when<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.409> noisy<00:01:31.710> set<00:01:32.250> or

mic<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.210> tiny<00:01:51.689> microphone<00:01:52.049> that

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
mic and this is a tiny microphone that

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.289 
mic and this is a tiny microphone that
you<00:01:52.530> can<00:01:52.680> hide<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.130> an<00:01:53.250> actor<00:01:53.610> or<00:01:53.790> actresses

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
you can hide in an actor or actresses

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.260 
you can hide in an actor or actresses
clothing<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:56.040> good<00:01:56.250> for<00:01:56.280> wide<00:01:56.909> shots

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
clothing and it's good for wide shots

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.910 
clothing and it's good for wide shots
where<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.630> need<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.990> still<00:01:58.200> get<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.469> dialogue

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
where you need to still get the dialogue

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.980 
where you need to still get the dialogue
so<00:01:59.340> if<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.880> what's<00:02:00.360> called<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.659> single

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
so if you have what's called a single

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.170 
so if you have what's called a single
system<00:02:01.439> setup<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:02.490> means<00:02:02.700> you're<00:02:02.850> recording

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
system setup that means you're recording

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.359 
system setup that means you're recording
the<00:02:03.659> audio<00:02:03.780> straight<00:02:04.290> into<00:02:04.500> your<00:02:04.560> camera<00:02:04.860> so

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
the audio straight into your camera so

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.859 
the audio straight into your camera so
everything<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.820> automatically<00:02:06.270> insane

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
everything is automatically insane

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.210 
everything is automatically insane
another<00:02:07.200> thing<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.530> can<00:02:07.649> do<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:07.979> get<00:02:08.190> a

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
another thing you can do is get a

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.100 
another thing you can do is get a
digital<00:02:08.610> recorder<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.509> separate<00:02:09.899> this

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
digital recorder that is separate this

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.229 
digital recorder that is separate this
is<00:02:10.289> called<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.530> double<00:02:10.800> system<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.879> sync<00:02:12.150> it

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
is called a double system so to sync it

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.030 
is called a double system so to sync it
up<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.540> post

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
up and post

clapper at the beginning of a scene that

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.940 
clapper at the beginning of a scene that

you started in production Audio one
thing<00:02:25.909> that's<00:02:26.060> often<00:02:26.420> overlooked<00:02:26.959> when

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
thing that's often overlooked when

thing that's often overlooked when
you're<00:02:27.620> doing<00:02:27.829> production<00:02:28.250> audio<00:02:28.400> is<00:02:28.760> the

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
you're doing production audio is the

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.630 
you're doing production audio is the
location<00:02:30.049> itself<00:02:30.379> so<00:02:31.129> say<00:02:31.310> you're<00:02:31.489> working

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
location itself so say you're working

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.190 
location itself so say you're working
with<00:02:31.909> a<00:02:31.939> director<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.599> you're<00:02:32.720> scouting<00:02:33.140> a

with a director and you're scouting a

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.679 
with a director and you're scouting a
location<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:34.430> director<00:02:34.909> very<00:02:35.150> often<00:02:35.569> is

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
location the director very often is

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.509 
location the director very often is
looking<00:02:36.019> for<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:36.349> perfect<00:02:36.590> shot<00:02:36.980> that

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
looking for that perfect shot that

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.929 
looking for that perfect shot that
perfect<00:02:38.030> scenery<00:02:38.900> but<00:02:39.769> it's<00:02:40.040> also<00:02:40.280> important

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:40.939 
perfect scenery but it's also important

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.020 
perfect scenery but it's also important
to<00:02:41.090> consider<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.599> sound<00:02:42.319> on<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:42.680> set<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:43.129> you

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
to consider the sound on the set so you

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.390 
to consider the sound on the set so you
might<00:02:44.239> have<00:02:44.389> a<00:02:44.420> beautiful<00:02:45.319> shot<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.769> there's

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
might have a beautiful shot and there's

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.670 
might have a beautiful shot and there's
an<00:02:46.489> airfield<00:02:46.700> right<00:02:47.510> next<00:02:47.900> door<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:48.590> you

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
an airfield right next door and so you

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.229 
an airfield right next door and so you
always<00:02:48.889> have<00:02:49.129> airplanes<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:49.909> out<00:02:50.030> and

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
always have airplanes in and out and

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.250 
always have airplanes in and out and
that'll<00:02:50.450> be<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.569> problem<00:02:50.810> when<00:02:51.139> you're

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
that'll be a problem when you're

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.960 
that'll be a problem when you're
recording<00:02:51.530> your<00:02:51.829> dialogue<00:02:52.310> so<00:02:52.760> it's<00:02:52.879> very

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
recording your dialogue so it's very

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.729 
recording your dialogue so it's very
important<00:02:53.419> to<00:02:53.510> consider<00:02:53.689> what<00:02:54.470> kind<00:02:54.620> of

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
important to consider what kind of

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.940 
important to consider what kind of
extraneous<00:02:55.069> sounds<00:02:55.909> are<00:02:56.090> near<00:02:56.659> your<00:02:56.810> set<00:02:57.109> what

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
extraneous sounds are near your set what

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.740 
extraneous sounds are near your set what

audio a couple things to consider when

you're recording your production sound
is<00:03:07.250> consider<00:03:07.909> audio<00:03:08.329> perspective<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:09.290> audio

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
is consider audio perspective and audio

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:12.159 
is consider audio perspective and audio

your<00:03:29.299> microphone<00:03:29.629> based<00:03:30.199> on<00:03:30.470> this<00:03:31.129> new<00:03:31.400> camera

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
your microphone based on this new camera

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.000 
your microphone based on this new camera
angle<00:03:32.150> and<00:03:32.329> so<00:03:32.810> because<00:03:33.109> of<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.290> your<00:03:33.650> audio

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
angle and so because of that your audio

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.530 
angle and so because of that your audio
will<00:03:34.190> sound<00:03:34.370> different<00:03:34.849> from<00:03:34.879> take<00:03:35.209> to<00:03:35.329> take

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
will sound different from take to take

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.300 
will sound different from take to take
so<00:03:36.049> you<00:03:36.109> really<00:03:36.379> want<00:03:36.560> to<00:03:36.650> be<00:03:36.739> careful<00:03:37.129> of<00:03:37.280> that

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
so you really want to be careful of that

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.469 
so you really want to be careful of that
so<00:03:38.150> if<00:03:38.269> I<00:03:38.359> was<00:03:38.540> in<00:03:39.109> dialogue<00:03:39.709> with<00:03:39.889> someone<00:03:40.129> and

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:40.479 
so if I was in dialogue with someone and

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:43.719 
so if I was in dialogue with someone and
the<00:03:41.479> shot<00:03:41.690> goes<00:03:41.930> from<00:03:42.109> a<00:03:42.199> close-up<00:03:42.590> of<00:03:42.709> me<00:03:42.949> to<00:03:43.699> a

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:43.729 
the shot goes from a close-up of me to a

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:46.990 
the shot goes from a close-up of me to a
two-shot<00:03:44.000> of<00:03:44.720> both<00:03:44.959> of<00:03:45.109> us<00:03:45.199> talking<00:03:45.819> you<00:03:46.819> want

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
two-shot of both of us talking you want

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.030 
two-shot of both of us talking you want
to<00:03:47.090> be<00:03:47.180> very<00:03:47.389> careful<00:03:47.900> about<00:03:48.169> the<00:03:48.560> changes<00:03:49.010> in

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
to be very careful about the changes in

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.759 
to be very careful about the changes in
audio<00:03:49.430> my<00:03:50.000> dialogue<00:03:50.900> should<00:03:51.079> probably<00:03:51.290> sound

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
audio my dialogue should probably sound

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.189 
audio my dialogue should probably sound
the<00:03:51.919> same<00:03:52.099> from<00:03:52.489> my<00:03:52.669> shot<00:03:52.940> that's<00:03:53.239> close<00:03:53.690> up<00:03:53.900> to

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
the same from my shot that's close up to

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.409 
the same from my shot that's close up to
the<00:03:54.319> two-shot<00:03:54.530> if<00:03:55.340> it<00:03:55.519> sounds<00:03:55.790> different<00:03:56.209> that

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
the two-shot if it sounds different that

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.629 
the two-shot if it sounds different that
could<00:03:56.599> cause<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.989> listener<00:03:57.409> to<00:03:57.590> focus<00:03:58.159> on<00:03:58.310> the

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
could cause the listener to focus on the

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.339 
could cause the listener to focus on the
change<00:03:58.879> in<00:03:59.030> perspective<00:03:59.269> rather<00:03:59.930> than<00:04:00.199> what

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
change in perspective rather than what

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.259 
change in perspective rather than what
I'm<00:04:00.439> actually<00:04:00.620> saying<00:04:00.829> as<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.519> sound<00:04:01.849> recorder

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
I'm actually saying as a sound recorder

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.300 
I'm actually saying as a sound recorder
you<00:04:02.510> want<00:04:02.689> to<00:04:02.780> capture<00:04:03.169> the<00:04:03.290> audio<00:04:03.560> onset<00:04:04.040> that

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
you want to capture the audio onset that

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.219 
you want to capture the audio onset that
best<00:04:04.549> conveys<00:04:04.939> the<00:04:05.150> story<00:04:05.449> that's<00:04:05.930> really

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:06.229 
best conveys the story that's really

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:08.500 
best conveys the story that's really
what<00:04:06.379> it's<00:04:06.500> all<00:04:06.620> about<00:04:06.680> so<00:04:07.269> capturing<00:04:08.269> good

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
what it's all about so capturing good

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.990 
what it's all about so capturing good
clean<00:04:08.930> dialogue<00:04:09.500> really<00:04:10.220> goes<00:04:10.459> a<00:04:10.489> long<00:04:10.759> way

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
clean dialogue really goes a long way

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.379 
clean dialogue really goes a long way
and<00:04:11.509> reduces<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:12.109> need<00:04:12.259> for<00:04:12.400> ADR<00:04:13.400> additional

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
and reduces the need for ADR additional

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.090 
and reduces the need for ADR additional
sound<00:04:14.599> effects<00:04:14.930> and<00:04:15.199> noise

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
sound effects and noise

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:29.990 
sound effects and noise
