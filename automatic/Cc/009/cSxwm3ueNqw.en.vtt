sitting<00:01:45.420> here<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.810> box<00:01:46.049> not<00:01:46.829> screwed<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.369> and

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
sitting here in a box not screwed in and

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.980 
sitting here in a box not screwed in and
just<00:01:47.640> kind<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.880> dropped<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.840> hear

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
just kind of dropped in so if you hear

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.980 
just kind of dropped in so if you hear
any<00:01:49.140> residual<00:01:49.560> noise<00:01:50.000> it's<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.270> air<00:01:51.720> going

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
any residual noise it's just air going
