will bring lighting from the loft and it
actually<00:03:26.160> does<00:03:26.579> help<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.910> little<00:03:27.090> bit<00:03:27.359> but<00:03:27.930> this

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
actually does help a little bit but this

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.630 
actually does help a little bit but this
is<00:03:28.410> what<00:03:29.070> I<00:03:29.100> do<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.459> mean<00:03:29.850> it's<00:03:30.030> very<00:03:30.239> simple<00:03:30.720> and

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
is what I do I mean it's very simple and

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.120 
is what I do I mean it's very simple and
I<00:03:32.640> think<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.120> key<00:03:33.390> is<00:03:33.420> finding<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.799> right

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
I think the key is finding the right

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.630 
I think the key is finding the right
lighting<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.769> experimenting<00:03:37.769> with<00:03:37.799> it<00:03:38.130> but

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
lighting and experimenting with it but

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.890 
lighting and experimenting with it but
setting<00:03:39.090> up<00:03:39.350> doesn't<00:03:40.350> take<00:03:40.500> me<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:40.709> long<00:03:40.920> and

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
setting up doesn't take me that long and

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.660 
setting up doesn't take me that long and
this<00:03:42.900> is<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.200> equipment<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.799> use<00:03:43.890> a<00:03:44.310> nikon
