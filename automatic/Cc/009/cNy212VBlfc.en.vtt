00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:13.819
 H 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.949
 H 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.589
 So constructive, the alpine actually claim 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.969
 a vehicle will be on the racetrack and of course it will be on Wednesday 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:33.500
 were finished manufacture 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.700
 Photos Werner did not want to build any more, it's a completely different car 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.140
 drive the current car set the principle of the group and light 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.230
 method of construction 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.950
 that's a rough score the guest gets to block off 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.390
 I would play the group and drive 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.390
 I do not want to drive a car 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.770
 Basically, we offer everything differently and was prohibited under Ben Ali 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:56.450
 we build 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.660
 From this we should build cages over and motors and powertrains after all 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.370
 Gear that's her all the way to the whole car 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.860
 is started from the maintenance to preparation for the racetrack of the 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.210
 Customer can come fight put in the car drive back to us and come 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.210
 to inform 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.880
 my father founded the company 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.270
 1954 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.520
 At that time, a 15 4 million only for over 50 years was important for the company since 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.160
 1978 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.050
 then namely promised and word 91 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.040
 I then had my 100 set as I was Ryan Murphy 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.060
 European champions whether residents first participants and by car 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.909
 Marko Pantelic VR would run such technical problems as you need 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.420
 needs to improve 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.280
 the origin of my career was clean 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.090
 to have been in the summer 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.400
 Approximately 1000 pounds of converted half hour drive from Ramon 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.530
 RAM scuffed in the foreground, that's one he will not be alone with 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.080
 among the women 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.369
 we build 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.849
 from experience now all parts have something to do with anise 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.289
 improved before strong execution in a Super Start or missing on 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:26.689
 the plan 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.909
 the speech has always been very vulnerable originally will be built first 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.039
 today formation percent 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:35.189
 Percent that is dangerous but I'm holding that Klaus 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:40.000
 Percent of farmers following in series goes back up to the latest 6 5 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:44.670
 Percent on looking at St is polling what not to use this Widget 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.239
 dpa 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:57.540
 these abstained 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.010
 Percent 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.559
 to eliminate them 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.979
 highest bid to raise to a tight spot 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:05.349
 was worth it 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.549
 and about the benefits and has been from zero to a hundred deaths Lambert has 50 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.549
 cent 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:35.359
 Unfortunately, there are no origin alpine from the seventies and sixties 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.150
 In principle, we try the production vehicles as accurately as possible 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:41.809
 it does not always have to be a racing car so we have the 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:43.789
 Possibility percent 

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:47.739
 Also serial cars after connect to the share so that the customer only 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.810
 through one that is 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.810
 continuation 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:12.989
