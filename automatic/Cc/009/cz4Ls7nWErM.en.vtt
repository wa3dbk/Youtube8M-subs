couple of things that really are
standing<00:00:24.960> out<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.199> me<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.710> most<00:00:25.890> likely<00:00:25.980> of

standing out to me so most likely of
course<00:00:26.670> will<00:00:26.880> be<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.090> wind<00:00:27.300> ups<00:00:27.480> which<00:00:27.660> are

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
course will be the wind ups which are

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.179 
course will be the wind ups which are
now<00:00:27.930> making<00:00:28.080> some<00:00:28.320> kind<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.619> competitive

wind-ups they kind of go and oppose and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.920 
wind-ups they kind of go and oppose and
the<00:00:58.469> people<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.829> were<00:00:58.920> siding<00:00:59.280> Maxie<00:01:00.270> they

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
won't be able to use it as efficiently

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.310 
won't be able to use it as efficiently
because<00:01:02.399> mine<00:01:02.910> ups<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.180> evolved<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.140> thing

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
because mine ups have evolved the thing

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.500 
because mine ups have evolved the thing
is<00:01:04.530> with<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.769> one<00:01:05.250> end<00:01:05.549> all<00:01:05.850> answer<00:01:06.240> people

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
is with that one end all answer people

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.080 
is with that one end all answer people
we<00:01:07.140> think<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.500> that's<00:01:07.650> more<00:01:07.950> laughs<00:01:08.640> that's

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
we think that that's more laughs that's

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.320 
we think that that's more laughs that's
sufficient<00:01:09.689> enough<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> boost<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.950> deck<00:01:11.240> but<00:01:12.240> of

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
sufficient enough to boost a deck but of

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.090 
sufficient enough to boost a deck but of
course<00:01:12.420> wind-ups<00:01:12.930> I've<00:01:13.020> evolved<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.530> ever

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
course wind-ups I've evolved and ever

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.800 
course wind-ups I've evolved and ever
since<00:01:14.400> they<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:15.000> been<00:01:15.030> biding<00:01:15.390> their<00:01:15.750> time

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
since they have been biding their time

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.770 
since they have been biding their time
and<00:01:16.439> changing<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.549> builds<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.150> course<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.600> have

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
and changing and builds of course I have

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.240 
and changing and builds of course I have
reflected<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.650> competitive<00:01:19.920> play

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
reflected that in this competitive play

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.530 
reflected that in this competitive play
so<00:01:20.610> if<00:01:20.670> some<00:01:20.880> people<00:01:21.119> are<00:01:21.210> not<00:01:21.360> using

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
so if some people are not using

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.690 
so if some people are not using
factories<00:01:22.290> some<00:01:22.470> people<00:01:22.830> are<00:01:23.189> using<00:01:23.520> more

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
factories some people are using more

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
like I'm so of course when they have

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.280 
like I'm so of course when they have
been<00:01:29.159> using<00:01:29.310> Maxie<00:01:29.790> against<00:01:30.360> them<00:01:30.540> then<00:01:30.960> it

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
been using Maxie against them then it

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.690 
been using Maxie against them then it
hasn't<00:01:31.530> made<00:01:31.740> as<00:01:31.860> much<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.159> an<00:01:32.220> impact<00:01:32.460> and

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
hasn't made as much of an impact and

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.249 
hasn't made as much of an impact and
we'll<00:01:32.909> say<00:01:33.090> if<00:01:33.210> able<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.659> buy<00:01:33.780> around<00:01:34.110> is

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
we'll say if able to buy around is

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.990 
we'll say if able to buy around is
somewhat<00:01:34.590> so<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.189> really<00:01:35.310> nice<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.549> see<00:01:35.790> wind

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
somewhat so it's really nice to see wind

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.429 
somewhat so it's really nice to see wind
up<00:01:36.119> making<00:01:36.210> some<00:01:36.479> kind<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.630> an<00:01:36.750> impact<00:01:37.200> on<00:01:37.380> a

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439

look<00:04:03.019> which<00:04:04.019> is<00:04:04.200> amazing<00:04:04.560> so<00:04:05.280> if<00:04:05.340> it<00:04:05.430> was<00:04:05.459> your

look which is amazing so if it was your

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.460 
look which is amazing so if it was your

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
will come to the conclusion that they

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.410 
will come to the conclusion that they
haven't<00:04:10.799> got<00:04:11.010> really<00:04:11.190> many<00:04:11.340> answers<00:04:11.910> to<00:04:12.090> get

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
haven't got really many answers to get

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.910 
haven't got really many answers to get
rid<00:04:12.600> of<00:04:12.630> it<00:04:12.780> so<00:04:13.109> they've<00:04:13.260> got<00:04:13.290> their<00:04:13.530> big<00:04:13.650> power

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920

they think will get hit and knots I
don't<00:06:23.970> really<00:06:24.090> mind<00:06:24.330> what<00:06:24.600> gets<00:06:24.840> hit<00:06:25.020> to<00:06:25.140> be

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.230 
don't really mind what gets hit to be

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.570 
don't really mind what gets hit to be
fair<00:06:25.470> the<00:06:25.650> only<00:06:25.830> things<00:06:25.980> I<00:06:26.070> don't<00:06:26.280> want<00:06:26.400> to<00:06:26.490> get

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
fair the only things I don't want to get

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:27.890 
fair the only things I don't want to get
hit<00:06:26.700> is<00:06:26.880> of<00:06:27.030> course<00:06:27.180> these<00:06:27.540> because<00:06:27.810> I

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
hit is of course these because I

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.180 
hit is of course these because I
actually<00:06:27.960> add<00:06:28.230> them<00:06:28.380> now<00:06:28.410> but<00:06:28.710> I<00:06:28.890> would

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
actually add them now but I would

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.410 
actually add them now but I would
understand<00:06:29.640> if<00:06:29.700> they've<00:06:29.850> got<00:06:29.910> some<00:06:30.090> kind<00:06:30.120> of<00:06:30.330> a

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:30.420 
understand if they've got some kind of a

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.630 
understand if they've got some kind of a
same<00:06:30.600> limit<00:06:30.840> the<00:06:31.530> thing<00:06:31.650> is<00:06:31.770> we've<00:06:31.950> tall<00:06:32.430> guys

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
same limit the thing is we've tall guys

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.450 
same limit the thing is we've tall guys
though<00:06:32.910> I<00:06:33.150> can<00:06:33.990> play<00:06:34.140> it<00:06:34.410> real<00:06:34.620> easy<00:06:34.680> to<00:06:35.250> sort

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
though I can play it real easy to sort

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.610 
though I can play it real easy to sort
out<00:06:35.640> I<00:06:35.670> mean<00:06:35.880> triple<00:06:36.420> Baylor's<00:06:36.840> and<00:06:37.140> so<00:06:37.530> many

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
out I mean triple Baylor's and so many

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.930 
out I mean triple Baylor's and so many
other<00:06:37.860> ways<00:06:37.980> you<00:06:38.010> get<00:06:38.280> rid<00:06:38.370> of<00:06:38.430> the<00:06:38.580> actually

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:38.940 
other ways you get rid of the actually

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.719 
other ways you get rid of the actually
diseases<00:06:39.240> I<00:06:39.360> mean

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:39.729 
diseases I mean

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:41.040 
diseases I mean
can<00:06:39.849> play<00:06:39.999> around<00:06:40.120> zenmaines<00:06:40.569> really<00:06:40.870> quite

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
can play around zenmaines really quite

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.570 
can play around zenmaines really quite
easily<00:06:41.259> I<00:06:41.469> mean<00:06:41.740> if<00:06:41.830> you're<00:06:41.949> using<00:06:42.099> wats<00:06:42.430> you

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
easily I mean if you're using wats you

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.860 
easily I mean if you're using wats you
can<00:06:42.699> use<00:06:42.789> what<00:06:42.969> pheasant<00:06:43.360> and<00:06:43.449> that's<00:06:43.719> the

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870 
can use what pheasant and that's the

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.860 
can use what pheasant and that's the
best<00:06:44.259> answer<00:06:44.499> for<00:06:44.710> it<00:06:44.860> ever<00:06:45.419> but<00:06:46.419> we<00:06:46.539> talked

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
best answer for it ever but we talked

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:47.969 
best answer for it ever but we talked
about<00:06:46.960> suppose<00:06:47.229> you've<00:06:47.349> got<00:06:47.439> feylis<00:06:47.830> you've

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:47.979 
about suppose you've got feylis you've

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:49.320 
about suppose you've got feylis you've
got<00:06:48.069> loads<00:06:48.309> of<00:06:48.490> ways<00:06:48.639> you<00:06:48.699> can<00:06:48.939> get<00:06:49.059> around

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
got loads of ways you can get around

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.839 
got loads of ways you can get around
though<00:06:50.169> the<00:06:50.740> plays<00:06:51.189> that<00:06:51.219> you<00:06:51.400> can<00:06:51.550> make<00:06:51.669> with

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:51.849 
though the plays that you can make with

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:54.869 
though the plays that you can make with
it<00:06:52.439> which<00:06:53.439> really<00:06:53.650> does<00:06:53.830> help<00:06:54.039> but<00:06:54.610> of<00:06:54.729> course

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:54.879 
it which really does help but of course

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:56.549 
it which really does help but of course
I<00:06:54.969> can<00:06:55.089> do<00:06:55.210> see<00:06:55.360> it<00:06:55.449> being<00:06:55.930> hit<00:06:56.169> in<00:06:56.199> some<00:06:56.409> ways

00:06:56.549 --> 00:06:56.559 
I can do see it being hit in some ways

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:58.619 
I can do see it being hit in some ways
so<00:06:56.800> Samuel<00:06:57.189> it<00:06:57.309> I<00:06:57.550> don't<00:06:58.120> think<00:06:58.300> it<00:06:58.360> will<00:06:58.449> get<00:06:58.599> a

00:06:58.619 --> 00:06:58.629 
so Samuel it I don't think it will get a

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:00.809 
so Samuel it I don't think it will get a
limit<00:06:58.960> I<00:06:59.080> think<00:06:59.319> maybe<00:07:00.039> similar<00:07:00.460> MIT<00:07:00.639> that's

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:00.819 
limit I think maybe similar MIT that's

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:02.100 
limit I think maybe similar MIT that's
why<00:07:00.909> I'm<00:07:00.999> thinking<00:07:01.360> I<00:07:01.509> don't<00:07:01.749> think<00:07:01.990> it<00:07:02.080> should

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
why I'm thinking I don't think it should

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.529 
why I'm thinking I don't think it should
get<00:07:02.409> hit<00:07:02.620> any<00:07:02.800> further<00:07:03.069> than<00:07:03.309> that<00:07:03.370> i'm<00:07:03.969> simply

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:04.539 
get hit any further than that i'm simply

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:07.049 
get hit any further than that i'm simply
because<00:07:04.809> it's<00:07:05.020> so<00:07:05.199> easy<00:07:05.379> to<00:07:05.499> stop<00:07:06.069> and<00:07:06.430> of

00:07:07.049 --> 00:07:07.059 
because it's so easy to stop and of

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:08.459 
because it's so easy to stop and of
course<00:07:07.270> it<00:07:07.419> would<00:07:07.569> actually<00:07:07.629> if<00:07:07.930> it<00:07:08.199> did<00:07:08.319> gets

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:08.469 
course it would actually if it did gets
