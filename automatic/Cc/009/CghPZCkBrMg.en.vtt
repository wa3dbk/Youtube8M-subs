00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.650 

a<00:00:14.200> lot<00:00:15.200> of<00:00:15.230> stuff<00:00:15.850> why<00:00:16.850> did<00:00:17.000> I<00:00:17.090> do<00:00:17.150> that<00:00:17.420> because

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
a lot of stuff why did I do that because

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.780 
a lot of stuff why did I do that because
I<00:00:17.810> need<00:00:18.080> to<00:00:18.170> check<00:00:18.320> everything<00:00:18.619> I<00:00:19.430> went

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:19.790 
I need to check everything I went

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.100 
I need to check everything I went
through<00:00:19.880> the<00:00:20.029> harness<00:00:20.240> the<00:00:20.810> good<00:00:20.960> thing<00:00:21.080> about

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
through the harness the good thing about

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.140 
through the harness the good thing about
Hyundai<00:00:21.529> that<00:00:21.770> I<00:00:21.800> like<00:00:22.040> is<00:00:22.460> you<00:00:22.820> can<00:00:22.939> go<00:00:23.119> on

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
Hyundai that I like is you can go on

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.290 
Hyundai that I like is you can go on
their<00:00:23.510> website<00:00:23.630> and<00:00:23.960> they<00:00:24.230> have<00:00:24.770> a<00:00:25.070> just<00:00:25.760> a<00:00:25.910> ton

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
their website and they have a just a ton

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.870 
their website and they have a just a ton
of<00:00:26.330> data<00:00:26.689> on<00:00:27.349> their<00:00:27.619> cars<00:00:27.860> they<00:00:28.340> have<00:00:28.520> all<00:00:28.730> the

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
of data on their cars they have all the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.939 
of data on their cars they have all the
schematics<00:00:29.480> anything<00:00:30.350> you<00:00:30.470> want<00:00:30.619> to<00:00:30.710> see<00:00:30.860> in

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
schematics anything you want to see in

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.530 
schematics anything you want to see in
terms<00:00:31.160> of<00:00:31.279> your<00:00:31.400> car<00:00:31.610> you<00:00:32.000> can<00:00:32.029> find<00:00:32.419> out

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
terms of your car you can find out

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.240 
terms of your car you can find out
Hyundai<00:00:32.840> websites<00:00:33.260> really<00:00:33.650> nice<00:00:33.800> actually

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
Hyundai websites really nice actually

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.939 
Hyundai websites really nice actually
it's<00:00:35.000> a<00:00:35.239> pic<00:00:35.600> of<00:00:35.629> Hyundai<00:00:36.110> tech<00:00:36.440> or<00:00:36.650> something

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
it's a pic of Hyundai tech or something

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:38.439 
it's a pic of Hyundai tech or something
like<00:00:37.040> that<00:00:37.220> if<00:00:37.610> I<00:00:37.730> remember<00:00:38.030> correctly<00:00:38.239> Bay

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:38.449 
like that if I remember correctly Bay

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.660 
like that if I remember correctly Bay
anyway<00:00:38.660> so<00:00:39.290> I've<00:00:39.620> gone<00:00:39.980> through<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:40.280> cabling

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
anyway so I've gone through the cabling

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.830 
anyway so I've gone through the cabling
and<00:00:40.820> stuff<00:00:40.970> like<00:00:41.090> that<00:00:41.239> I<00:00:41.269> actually<00:00:41.420> had<00:00:41.690> to<00:00:41.750> go

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
and stuff like that I actually had to go

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.090 
and stuff like that I actually had to go
look<00:00:41.989> up<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.140> harness<00:00:42.410> stuff<00:00:42.680> because<00:00:42.920> I<00:00:42.980> was

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
look up the harness stuff because I was

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.650 
look up the harness stuff because I was
I<00:00:43.280> was<00:00:43.400> sure<00:00:43.610> that<00:00:43.640> what<00:00:43.970> these<00:00:44.090> two<00:00:44.269> cables

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
I was sure that what these two cables

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.450 
I was sure that what these two cables
right<00:00:44.780> here<00:00:44.840> were<00:00:45.199> one<00:00:45.769> was<00:00:45.949> starter<00:00:46.250> and<00:00:46.309> one

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
right here were one was starter and one

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.049 
right here were one was starter and one
was<00:00:46.610> one<00:00:47.030> was<00:00:47.210> from<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.449> alternator<00:00:49.000> like<00:00:50.000> I

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
was one was from the alternator like I

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.430 
was one was from the alternator like I
said<00:00:50.210> again<00:00:50.300> you've<00:00:50.540> got<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.780> ground<00:00:50.960> system

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
said again you've got the ground system

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.490 
said again you've got the ground system
and<00:00:51.559> stuff<00:00:51.739> and<00:00:52.580> here<00:00:53.120> this<00:00:53.750> is<00:00:53.960> just<00:00:54.170> simply<00:00:54.409> a

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
and stuff and here this is just simply a

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.070 
and stuff and here this is just simply a
shunt<00:00:54.890> resistor<00:00:55.339> is<00:00:55.970> what<00:00:56.269> this<00:00:56.449> is<00:00:56.659> this<00:00:56.930> is<00:00:57.049> a

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:57.080 
shunt resistor is what this is this is a

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.020 
shunt resistor is what this is this is a
shunt<00:00:57.440> and<00:00:57.589> the<00:00:58.309> reason<00:00:58.519> why<00:00:58.610> I<00:00:58.640> can't<00:00:58.879> take

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
shunt and the reason why I can't take

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.640 
shunt and the reason why I can't take
this<00:00:59.180> apart<00:00:59.570> is<00:00:59.690> because<00:00:59.870> of<00:01:00.229> the<00:01:00.320> shunt<00:01:00.530> the

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
this apart is because of the shunt the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.350 
this apart is because of the shunt the
shunt<00:01:00.890> is<00:01:00.979> actually<00:01:01.370> part<00:01:01.610> of<00:01:01.699> the<00:01:01.760> electrical

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
shunt is actually part of the electrical

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.509 
shunt is actually part of the electrical
system<00:01:02.690> of<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:02.839> car<00:01:03.019> and<00:01:03.229> so<00:01:03.830> it's<00:01:04.339> either

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
system of the car and so it's either

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.280 
system of the car and so it's either
part<00:01:04.850> of<00:01:05.000> some<00:01:05.210> sort<00:01:05.449> of<00:01:05.510> a<00:01:05.630> feedback<00:01:05.840> system

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
part of some sort of a feedback system

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.260 
part of some sort of a feedback system
so<00:01:06.680> that<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.070> alternator<00:01:07.729> knows<00:01:07.909> exactly

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
so that the alternator knows exactly

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.390 
so that the alternator knows exactly
what<00:01:08.750> to<00:01:08.930> put<00:01:09.140> out<00:01:09.290> in<00:01:09.440> terms<00:01:09.470> of<00:01:09.799> ground<00:01:09.979> which

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
what to put out in terms of ground which

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.310 
what to put out in terms of ground which
is<00:01:10.430> really<00:01:10.909> nice<00:01:11.060> actually<00:01:11.330> because<00:01:11.720> if<00:01:12.140> that

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
is really nice actually because if that

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.719 
is really nice actually because if that
is<00:01:12.500> what<00:01:12.710> that<00:01:12.890> is<00:01:13.040> and<00:01:13.220> I'm<00:01:13.310> gonna<00:01:13.400> look<00:01:13.549> up

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
is what that is and I'm gonna look up

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.490 
is what that is and I'm gonna look up
I'm<00:01:13.940> gonna<00:01:14.090> look<00:01:14.210> it<00:01:14.330> up<00:01:14.420> later<00:01:14.659> on<00:01:14.750> but<00:01:15.140> if

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
I'm gonna look it up later on but if

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.500 
I'm gonna look it up later on but if
that<00:01:15.650> is<00:01:15.799> what's<00:01:15.979> going<00:01:16.159> on<00:01:16.369> here<00:01:16.670> that's

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
that is what's going on here that's

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.060 
that is what's going on here that's
really<00:01:17.899> nice<00:01:18.049> because<00:01:18.320> that<00:01:18.590> means<00:01:18.710> that<00:01:18.859> the

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
really nice because that means that the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.740 
really nice because that means that the
entire<00:01:19.340> electrical<00:01:19.700> system<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:20.030> car<00:01:20.299> is

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
entire electrical system the car is

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.330 
entire electrical system the car is
programmed<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.469> stay<00:01:21.740> at<00:01:21.859> a<00:01:21.890> certain<00:01:22.100> voltage

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
programmed to stay at a certain voltage

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.029 
programmed to stay at a certain voltage
and<00:01:22.759> as<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.780> short<00:01:24.049> resistor<00:01:24.380> sees<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:24.770> load

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
and as the short resistor sees the load

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.060 
and as the short resistor sees the load
being<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:26.180> know<00:01:26.270> applied<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:27.560> wants<00:01:27.950> to

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
being you know applied it wants to

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.940 
being you know applied it wants to
adjust<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:28.969> alternator<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.570> output<00:01:29.929> so<00:01:30.799> that

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
adjust the alternator to output so that

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.919 
adjust the alternator to output so that
we<00:01:31.070> end<00:01:31.219> up<00:01:31.340> with<00:01:31.399> the<00:01:31.969> appropriate<00:01:32.359> voltage

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
we end up with the appropriate voltage

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:34.660 
we end up with the appropriate voltage
and<00:01:33.109> stuff<00:01:33.289> so<00:01:33.770> I'm<00:01:33.979> going<00:01:34.100> to<00:01:34.159> keep<00:01:34.280> this<00:01:34.460> but

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
and stuff so I'm going to keep this but

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.919 
and stuff so I'm going to keep this but
I'm<00:01:34.759> going<00:01:34.969> to<00:01:35.030> redo<00:01:35.329> some<00:01:35.390> of<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.719> ground

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
I'm going to redo some of the ground

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.020 
I'm going to redo some of the ground
stuff<00:01:36.259> I<00:01:36.530> don't<00:01:36.740> like<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.189> painted<00:01:37.640> surface

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
stuff I don't like the painted surface

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.459 
stuff I don't like the painted surface
stuff<00:01:38.270> you<00:01:38.450> know<00:01:38.539> where<00:01:38.689> they<00:01:38.780> put<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:39.170> bolt<00:01:39.350> on

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
stuff you know where they put a bolt on

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.349 
stuff you know where they put a bolt on
top<00:01:39.619> and<00:01:39.859> I'm<00:01:40.100> just<00:01:40.130> not<00:01:40.460> a<00:01:40.490> fan<00:01:40.700> of<00:01:40.729> that<00:01:40.909> I'm

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359 
top and I'm just not a fan of that I'm

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:42.459 
top and I'm just not a fan of that I'm

there's<00:01:42.679> gonna<00:01:42.799> be<00:01:42.950> my<00:01:43.070> central<00:01:43.460> ground

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
there's gonna be my central ground

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.480 
there's gonna be my central ground
source<00:01:44.320> one<00:01:45.320> of<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.499> things<00:01:45.710> I<00:01:45.859> was<00:01:46.100> hunting

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
source one of the things I was hunting

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.029 
source one of the things I was hunting
for<00:01:46.520> was<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.149> ground<00:01:47.420> wire<00:01:47.689> from<00:01:48.439> the<00:01:48.679> motor

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
for was the ground wire from the motor

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.980 
for was the ground wire from the motor
to<00:01:49.729> the<00:01:49.820> chassis<00:01:50.060> that<00:01:50.359> was<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.689> one<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:50.840> was

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
to the chassis that was the one I was

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.660 
to the chassis that was the one I was
looking<00:01:51.079> for<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.439> most<00:01:51.649> because<00:01:52.039> I<00:01:52.219> always

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
looking for the most because I always

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.899 
looking for the most because I always
know<00:01:52.999> that<00:01:53.030> I<00:01:53.600> have<00:01:54.170> no<00:01:54.469> idea<00:01:54.499> why<00:01:55.189> why<00:01:55.670> they<00:01:55.850> do

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
know that I have no idea why why they do

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.819 
know that I have no idea why why they do
this<00:01:56.149> but<00:01:56.359> they<00:01:56.990> always<00:01:57.200> put<00:01:57.350> the<00:01:57.439> cheapest

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
this but they always put the cheapest

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.559 
this but they always put the cheapest
thing<00:01:57.979> in<00:01:58.130> there<00:01:58.280> and<00:01:58.429> sure<00:01:58.759> enough<00:01:58.789> here<00:01:59.450> it

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
thing in there and sure enough here it

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.380 
thing in there and sure enough here it
is<00:01:59.689> it's<00:02:00.350> a<00:02:00.560> freakin<00:02:01.219> eight<00:02:01.490> gauge<00:02:01.729> cable<00:02:02.030> I

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
is it's a freakin eight gauge cable I

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.739 
is it's a freakin eight gauge cable I
mean<00:02:02.719> you<00:02:03.140> cannot<00:02:03.679> supply<00:02:04.130> enough<00:02:04.670> current

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749 
mean you cannot supply enough current

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:08.230 
mean you cannot supply enough current
off<00:02:05.749> the<00:02:06.229> alternator<00:02:06.530> into<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.399> chassis<00:02:07.640> to

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
off the alternator into the chassis to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.999 
off the alternator into the chassis to
do<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.690> work<00:02:08.840> it's<00:02:09.229> just<00:02:09.289> not<00:02:09.500> possible

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
okay you know yeah it might be bolted

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.300 
okay you know yeah it might be bolted

problems<00:02:39.250> from<00:02:39.519> the<00:02:39.640> alternator<00:02:40.030> here<00:02:40.650> again

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
problems from the alternator here again

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.759 
problems from the alternator here again
it<00:02:42.430> also<00:02:42.640> turns<00:02:43.000> out<00:02:43.180> that<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.810> factory

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
it also turns out that the factory

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.250 
it also turns out that the factory
cabling<00:02:45.250> is<00:02:45.459> actually<00:02:46.209> a<00:02:46.239> four<00:02:46.599> gauge<00:02:46.810> which

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
cabling is actually a four gauge which

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.039 
cabling is actually a four gauge which
is<00:02:47.440> also<00:02:47.680> another<00:02:48.190> major<00:02:48.400> plus<00:02:48.930> because<00:02:49.930> it

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
is also another major plus because it

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.600 
is also another major plus because it
being<00:02:50.260> a<00:02:50.379> four<00:02:50.590> gauge<00:02:50.769> it's<00:02:51.129> a<00:02:51.220> it's<00:02:51.459> a<00:02:51.579> very

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
being a four gauge it's a it's a very

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.930 
being a four gauge it's a it's a very
good<00:02:52.180> quality<00:02:52.420> copper<00:02:53.019> in<00:02:53.140> there<00:02:53.290> it's<00:02:53.409> not

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
good quality copper in there it's not

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.759 
good quality copper in there it's not
copper<00:02:54.940> clad<00:02:55.269> aluminum<00:02:55.450> crap<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.500> you<00:02:56.560> get

you buy a four gauge technically you're

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.170 
you buy a four gauge technically you're
more<00:03:14.109> or<00:03:14.140> less<00:03:14.260> buying<00:03:14.620> an<00:03:14.799> eight<00:03:14.920> gauge

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
more or less buying an eight gauge

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.399 
more or less buying an eight gauge
you're<00:03:16.180> not<00:03:16.299> really<00:03:16.540> buying<00:03:16.870> a<00:03:17.079> four<00:03:17.260> gauge

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
you're not really buying a four gauge

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.619 
you're not really buying a four gauge
you're<00:03:17.590> buying<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:17.859> bit<00:03:18.040> smaller<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:18.629> even

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
you're buying a bit smaller and even

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.839 
you're buying a bit smaller and even
what's<00:03:19.810> even<00:03:20.019> worse<00:03:20.290> is<00:03:20.620> that<00:03:21.459> the<00:03:21.640> Chinese

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
what's even worse is that the Chinese

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.119 
what's even worse is that the Chinese
have<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.269> really<00:03:22.870> good<00:03:23.109> date<00:03:23.590> they<00:03:23.769> have<00:03:23.859> a<00:03:23.920> neat

have a really good date they have a neat

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.520 
have a really good date they have a neat
little<00:03:24.280> ploy<00:03:24.579> they<00:03:25.209> say<00:03:25.569> it's<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:25.840> 4<00:03:26.019> gauge<00:03:26.260> they

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
little ploy they say it's a 4 gauge they

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.170 
little ploy they say it's a 4 gauge they
put<00:03:26.709> it<00:03:26.799> in<00:03:26.890> a<00:03:26.950> jacket<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.549> looks<00:03:27.730> like<00:03:27.849> a<00:03:27.909> 4

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
put it in a jacket that looks like a 4

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.300 
put it in a jacket that looks like a 4
gauge<00:03:28.359> with<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:28.989> actual<00:03:29.530> count<00:03:29.859> of<00:03:30.099> the

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.949 
coppers in the interior or the aluminum
inside<00:03:32.709> is<00:03:32.889> smaller<00:03:33.579> than<00:03:33.880> a<00:03:33.910> 4<00:03:34.120> gauge<00:03:34.299> so<00:03:34.720> not

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
inside is smaller than a 4 gauge so not

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.969 
cos it's a very flexible type material
too<00:04:21.760> high<00:04:21.940> you<00:04:22.360> know<00:04:22.479> it<00:04:22.750> has<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.080> high<00:04:23.289> copper

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
too high you know it has a high copper

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.830 
too high you know it has a high copper
content<00:04:24.130> in<00:04:24.699> the<00:04:24.760> middle<00:04:24.910> which<00:04:25.539> the<00:04:25.720> only

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
content in the middle which the only

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.290 
content in the middle which the only
problem<00:04:26.110> with<00:04:26.229> that<00:04:26.260> is<00:04:26.380> you<00:04:26.620> also<00:04:26.800> lose<00:04:27.300> you

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
problem with that is you also lose you

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.810 
problem with that is you also lose you
also<00:04:28.479> lose<00:04:28.810> current<00:04:29.740> because<00:04:30.039> of<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.340> high

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
also lose current because of the high

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.310 
also lose current because of the high
copper<00:04:31.210> content<00:04:31.360> meaning<00:04:31.990> that<00:04:32.110> the

copper content meaning that the

individual strands to make it flexible

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.450 
individual strands to make it flexible
you<00:04:34.780> actually<00:04:35.110> lose<00:04:35.289> current<00:04:35.680> there<00:04:35.890> to<00:04:36.159> also

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
you actually lose current there to also

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.110 
you actually lose current there to also
a<00:04:36.820> more<00:04:37.539> solid<00:04:37.960> cable<00:04:38.320> would<00:04:38.409> be<00:04:38.560> actually<00:04:38.919> a

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
a more solid cable would be actually a

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.689 
a more solid cable would be actually a
or<00:04:39.360> a<00:04:39.389> lesser<00:04:39.810> number<00:04:40.620> but<00:04:41.040> because<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.520> motor

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
or a lesser number but because the motor

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.909 
or a lesser number but because the motor
has<00:04:41.970> to<00:04:42.000> move<00:04:42.360> a<00:04:42.540> lot<00:04:42.720> you<00:04:43.290> know<00:04:43.410> if<00:04:43.590> you<00:04:43.740> do

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
has to move a lot you know if you do

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.860 
has to move a lot you know if you do
that<00:04:44.130> they<00:04:44.310> would<00:04:44.460> just<00:04:44.639> break<00:04:44.820> you<00:04:45.630> know<00:04:45.720> in

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
that they would just break you know in

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.180 
that they would just break you know in
long<00:04:46.080> term<00:04:46.320> so<00:04:46.530> that's<00:04:46.620> the<00:04:46.770> reason<00:04:46.860> why<00:04:46.979> they

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
long term so that's the reason why they

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.070 
long term so that's the reason why they
do<00:04:47.250> it<00:04:47.340> this<00:04:47.460> way<00:04:47.729> but<00:04:48.330> because<00:04:48.540> it's<00:04:48.810> a<00:04:48.900> good

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
do it this way but because it's a good

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.990 
do it this way but because it's a good
grade<00:04:49.290> quad<00:04:49.620> copper<00:04:50.310> we<00:04:50.520> don't<00:04:50.639> have<00:04:50.729> to<00:04:50.820> worry

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
grade quad copper we don't have to worry

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.879 
grade quad copper we don't have to worry
about<00:04:51.240> that<00:04:51.449> but<00:04:51.780> like<00:04:51.960> I<00:04:52.050> said<00:04:52.139> I'm<00:04:52.650> gonna

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
about that but like I said I'm gonna

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:54.350 
about that but like I said I'm gonna
change<00:04:53.250> out<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.580> main<00:04:53.760> ground<00:04:54.030> source

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
change out the main ground source

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.650 
change out the main ground source
upgrade<00:04:55.320> it<00:04:55.410> here<00:04:55.850> I'm<00:04:56.850> not<00:04:57.030> gonna<00:04:57.210> change<00:04:57.449> out

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
upgrade it here I'm not gonna change out

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.480 
upgrade it here I'm not gonna change out
the<00:04:57.750> cabling<00:04:58.139> here<00:04:58.470> because<00:04:58.650> this<00:04:58.800> is<00:04:58.889> a<00:04:58.919> this

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
the cabling here because this is a this

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.010 
the cabling here because this is a this
basically<00:04:59.910> it's<00:05:00.090> almost<00:05:00.300> a<00:05:00.419> two<00:05:00.570> gauge<00:05:00.780> right

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
basically it's almost a two gauge right

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.469 
basically it's almost a two gauge right
here<00:05:01.370> factory<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.669> so<00:05:03.120> I'm<00:05:03.180> gonna<00:05:03.300> go<00:05:03.419> ahead

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
here factory and so I'm gonna go ahead

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.480 
here factory and so I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:05:03.600> reconfigure<00:05:04.560> this<00:05:04.710> whole<00:05:04.919> ground<00:05:05.190> area

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
and reconfigure this whole ground area

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.340 
and reconfigure this whole ground area
rebuild<00:05:06.000> all<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.389> way<00:05:06.690> that<00:05:06.840> the<00:05:06.900> wiring<00:05:07.110> was

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
rebuild all the way that the wiring was

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.350 
rebuild all the way that the wiring was
coming<00:05:07.680> in<00:05:07.800> looping<00:05:08.220> in<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:08.490> stuff<00:05:08.669> put<00:05:09.240> on

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
coming in looping in and stuff put on

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.750 
coming in looping in and stuff put on
new<00:05:09.540> one<00:05:09.720> I'll<00:05:10.380> have<00:05:10.410> to<00:05:10.710> keep<00:05:10.919> this<00:05:11.220> that<00:05:11.639> you

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
new one I'll have to keep this that you

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.980 
new one I'll have to keep this that you
know<00:05:11.880> this<00:05:12.030> one<00:05:12.210> on<00:05:12.300> here<00:05:12.479> I<00:05:12.539> can't<00:05:12.780> make<00:05:12.870> it

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
know this one on here I can't make it

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.540 
know this one on here I can't make it
all<00:05:13.110> pretty<00:05:13.350> and<00:05:13.410> everything<00:05:13.680> technically<00:05:14.520> I

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
all pretty and everything technically I

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.610 
all pretty and everything technically I
could<00:05:14.850> if<00:05:15.090> I<00:05:15.180> had<00:05:15.210> a<00:05:15.360> shunt<00:05:15.690> resistor<00:05:16.289> and<00:05:16.530> I

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
could if I had a shunt resistor and I

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.740 
could if I had a shunt resistor and I
could<00:05:16.770> you<00:05:16.979> know<00:05:17.010> rebuild<00:05:17.430> this<00:05:17.610> or<00:05:18.120> maybe<00:05:18.419> put

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
could you know rebuild this or maybe put

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.750 
could you know rebuild this or maybe put
a<00:05:18.780> lug<00:05:19.289> somewhere<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:19.830> hide<00:05:20.039> it<00:05:20.190> off<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.520> side

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
a lug somewhere and hide it off the side

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.670 
a lug somewhere and hide it off the side
but<00:05:21.479> I'm<00:05:21.720> not<00:05:21.870> going<00:05:22.050> to<00:05:22.080> do<00:05:22.199> that<00:05:22.380> I<00:05:22.410> think<00:05:22.590> it

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
but I'm not going to do that I think it

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.779 
but I'm not going to do that I think it
would<00:05:22.770> just<00:05:22.919> go<00:05:23.039> ahead<00:05:23.160> and<00:05:23.250> be<00:05:23.310> better<00:05:23.490> to<00:05:23.669> go

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
would just go ahead and be better to go

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.879 
would just go ahead and be better to go
and<00:05:23.940> leave<00:05:24.120> the<00:05:24.270> system<00:05:24.449> like<00:05:24.720> it<00:05:24.870> was<00:05:25.050> so<00:05:25.770> that

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
and leave the system like it was so that

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.680 
and leave the system like it was so that
we<00:05:25.979> get<00:05:26.070> a<00:05:26.130> good<00:05:26.400> value<00:05:26.610> it<00:05:26.970> always<00:05:27.300> reads

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
we get a good value it always reads

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.540 
we get a good value it always reads
correctly<00:05:28.320> that's<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.860> main<00:05:29.010> thing<00:05:29.190> is<00:05:29.370> this

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
correctly that's the main thing is this

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.010 
correctly that's the main thing is this
needs<00:05:29.760> to<00:05:29.880> read<00:05:30.180> correctly<00:05:30.479> so<00:05:30.810> that<00:05:30.840> the

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
needs to read correctly so that the

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.230 
needs to read correctly so that the
alternator<00:05:31.470> and<00:05:31.710> the<00:05:32.130> computer<00:05:32.520> can<00:05:32.669> adjust

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
alternator and the computer can adjust

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.379 
alternator and the computer can adjust
appropriately<00:05:33.710> the<00:05:34.710> output<00:05:35.190> voltage<00:05:35.580> and

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
appropriately the output voltage and

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.570 
appropriately the output voltage and
current<00:05:36.960> of<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.680> alternator<00:05:38.130> and<00:05:38.220> stuff<00:05:38.460> like

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
current of the alternator and stuff like

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.740 
current of the alternator and stuff like
that<00:05:38.699> you<00:05:38.820> don't<00:05:38.850> want<00:05:39.180> to<00:05:39.360> lose<00:05:39.539> that

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
that you don't want to lose that

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.010 
that you don't want to lose that
obviously<00:05:40.169> and<00:05:40.350> stuff<00:05:40.590> so<00:05:41.180> also<00:05:42.180> the<00:05:42.570> the

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
obviously and stuff so also the the

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.529 
obviously and stuff so also the the
factory<00:05:43.470> wiring<00:05:44.460> going<00:05:44.760> here<00:05:45.000> to<00:05:45.150> four<00:05:45.360> gauge

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
factory wiring going here to four gauge

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.180 
factory wiring going here to four gauge
I'm<00:05:45.780> not<00:05:45.900> going<00:05:46.050> to<00:05:46.110> change<00:05:46.289> it<00:05:46.590> going<00:05:46.919> into

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
I'm not going to change it going into

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.890 
I'm not going to change it going into
the<00:05:47.280> main<00:05:47.430> bus<00:05:47.940> but<00:05:48.270> I'm<00:05:48.330> going<00:05:48.450> to<00:05:48.510> shorten<00:05:48.870> it

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
the main bus but I'm going to shorten it

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.020 
the main bus but I'm going to shorten it
up<00:05:49.050> I'm<00:05:49.770> gonna<00:05:49.919> bring<00:05:50.130> it<00:05:50.280> so<00:05:50.430> that<00:05:50.580> it<00:05:50.669> goes

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
up I'm gonna bring it so that it goes

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.210 
up I'm gonna bring it so that it goes
right<00:05:51.300> here<00:05:51.590> instead<00:05:52.590> I'd<00:05:52.710> be<00:05:52.800> doing<00:05:53.010> what<00:05:53.130> it

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
right here instead I'd be doing what it

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.710 
right here instead I'd be doing what it
did<00:05:53.310> before<00:05:53.639> which<00:05:53.820> is<00:05:53.849> this<00:05:54.060> big<00:05:54.270> loop<00:05:54.510> around

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
did before which is this big loop around

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.210 
did before which is this big loop around
and<00:05:55.169> stuff<00:05:55.530> like<00:05:55.650> that<00:05:55.830> I'm<00:05:55.979> going<00:05:56.099> to<00:05:56.130> go

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 
and stuff like that I'm going to go

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.980 
and stuff like that I'm going to go
ahead<00:05:56.310> and<00:05:56.490> shorten<00:05:56.639> it<00:05:56.849> so<00:05:56.970> that<00:05:57.090> we<00:05:57.180> have<00:05:57.330> you

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
ahead and shorten it so that we have you

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.320 
ahead and shorten it so that we have you
know<00:05:58.080> a<00:05:58.110> shorter<00:05:58.830> run<00:05:59.070> which<00:05:59.849> will<00:06:00.000> give<00:06:00.150> us<00:06:00.180> a

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
know a shorter run which will give us a

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.330 
know a shorter run which will give us a
better<00:06:00.510> overall<00:06:00.870> current<00:06:01.169> capability<00:06:01.740> but

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
better overall current capability but

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:03.860 
better overall current capability but
other<00:06:02.520> than<00:06:02.669> that<00:06:02.729> that's<00:06:03.030> it<00:06:03.270> for<00:06:03.510> right<00:06:03.630> now

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
other than that that's it for right now

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.409 
other than that that's it for right now
here's<00:06:04.500> the<00:06:04.820> factory<00:06:05.820> piece<00:06:06.000> you<00:06:06.210> know<00:06:06.270> and<00:06:06.360> I

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
here's the factory piece you know and I

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:08.560 
here's the factory piece you know and I
just<00:06:06.450> when<00:06:06.840> cut<00:06:07.169> it<00:06:07.260> off<00:06:07.410> and<00:06:07.590> everything

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
just when cut it off and everything

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.610 
just when cut it off and everything
right<00:06:09.570> now<00:06:09.630> that'll<00:06:09.990> be<00:06:10.020> it<00:06:10.169> now<00:06:10.320> I'll<00:06:10.410> show

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
right now that'll be it now I'll show

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.460 
right now that'll be it now I'll show
you<00:06:10.680> when<00:06:10.889> I'm<00:06:11.010> done
