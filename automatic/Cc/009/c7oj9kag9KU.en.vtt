00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:56.670
 we have nick killer 2001 he noticed 99 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.680
 strange chemical david strong ghosts 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.629
 sparky we lose giuseppe montagna e 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.280
 alessia that practically follows us from 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.790
 brother's cells from the cell phone of 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.439
 brother 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.570
 then guys who will be executives 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.729
 today we go to see fashion then 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.220
 vanilla fashion as we said that 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.580
 we came to the car one command 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.140
 pure drive a balcarce one command ok bem 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.720
 let's go see it has done is a 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.729
 minecraft therefore a large a large da 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.350
 true because I like the already minecraft 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.939
 because it always puts possibilities with the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.680
 pulses full of taking objects not 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.810
 we stop to learn so many hands 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.850
 Americans don't and many Italians do 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.040
 they do not do the same 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.860
 ok let's go see mom 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.960
 we took the reds tinet items 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:46.079
 play ok by veb car command baiso 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.840
 minecraft the Trojans RaiClick ok let's go 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.500
 to see how they are used 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.259
 them 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.439
 we throw no from there we have to throw 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.530
 perfect then how to do it 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:03.360
 I feel nabbo 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.710
 from age or perfect perfect I do not 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.630
 I imagined I could do so sooner 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.899
 bang without remembering how it always goes to 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.750
 ok we place our car can that 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.100
 cool that we have a car 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.930
 as if it increases the speed is a bit 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.569
 strange the ride as you click look 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.000
 not even fast though actually like 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:27.610
 the challenge is increased 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:31.510
 ap ok has me a little stat 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.970
 we are walking expects 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.720
 we raise a thing and as you can see from the outside 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.060
 and that in practice is the modification of the 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.560
 skin of a cart can be given a 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.690
 tot of speed from what I understand 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.460
 you can't go more than five 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:51.610
 let's see if I am right yes 15 al 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.230
 maximum ok then we also have the 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.209
 possibility as well as to guide him in 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.220
 normal way we have the possibility 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.870
 precisely to stop it from the can 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:03.790
 always or to send it in over mode 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.250
 so the over motion is the one that flutters 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.150
 let's go to 5 wait wait for it to stop 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.370
 I look too open 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.100
 ok they don't feel for motta 5 you go a lot 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.020
 more free, of course, that cool and ea di 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.940
 euro closed airport running well 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.680
 in fact from the outside if he sees that in the 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.239
 boy in camel look is 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.470
 faster than me 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.630
 ok then let's see if we go down cover 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.600
 off mode we have to go down the 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.070
 tano verification goes down by a bang ok 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.200
 we can go down 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.820
 I would say that this fashion would be nice 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.040
 to use it maybe you don't know about those 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.290
 maps with the track use all the 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.720
 toy cars in this manner of each 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.850
 for one then a person and make us one 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.930
 race imagine making these a race 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.090
 toy cars would be cool real tv ris di 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.010
 the ones we usually do 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.420
 on the other server, however, it is that 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.310
 these machines would be to do that 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.690
 divide propose it others ask 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.070
 anyway below if you want that offer 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.430
 the others a race with these cars 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.560
 strange then hitting the central thing 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.510
 then the central kart we can 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.040
 resume the place called carlo e 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.810
 so being able to bring along 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.459
 boys so there is no problem 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.080
 if you set yourself, go to the wall and break it 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.730
 of getting back on the road and starting again 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.650
 so a very simple fashion a lot 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.500
 pretty and that to integrate a car 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.940
 drivable using the logic of the kart 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.350
 and giving it a very toned structure 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.360
 particular and can be used 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.520
 also as hovercraft and boys then 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.100
 very particular as usual we have 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.290
 button to make everything disappear well 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.120
 it turns everything off and this era disappears 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.590
 precisely a vanilla fashion says minecraft 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.419
 I hope you enjoyed it as usual 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.960
 leave so many statutes to respect say 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.180
 down here 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.440
 I also want to see many nice thumbs 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.970
 many 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.470
 and which are the boys more pollicioni us 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.540
 I am and the more I understand you like them 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.830
 these videos are fine guys from later 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.210
 this were there only see you there 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.210
