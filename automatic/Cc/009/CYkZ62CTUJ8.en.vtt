00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
decapitation so we'll see how well this

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.210 
decapitation so we'll see how well this
acts<00:02:10.800> work

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
acts work

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:20.150 
acts work

hardly<00:02:20.760> on<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.030> decapitation<00:02:21.900> test<00:02:22.170> the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
hardly on the decapitation test the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
hardly on the decapitation test the
zombie<00:02:23.160> could<00:02:23.370> um<00:02:23.550> still<00:02:24.510> keep<00:02:24.750> attacking

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
zombie could um still keep attacking

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.720 
zombie could um still keep attacking
even<00:02:26.810> when<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.840> keep<00:02:28.740> on<00:02:28.980> hacking<00:02:29.310> at<00:02:29.610> the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
even when you keep on hacking at the

even when you keep on hacking at the
neck<00:02:29.880> with<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.270> so<00:02:30.900> on<00:02:31.670> decapitation<00:02:32.670> this

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
neck with this so on decapitation this

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.920 
neck with this so on decapitation this
is<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.210> down<00:02:34.850> okay<00:02:35.850> now<00:02:36.210> we're<00:02:36.360> going<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.660> try

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
is a down okay now we're going to try

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.699 
is a down okay now we're going to try
hacking<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.740> chest<00:02:41.000> now<00:02:42.380> it's<00:02:43.380> no<00:02:43.530> good

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
hacking it in the chest now it's no good

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.300 
hacking it in the chest now it's no good
this<00:02:44.250> did<00:02:44.490> even<00:02:44.760> worst<00:02:45.060> on<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.450> chest<00:02:45.900> um<00:02:46.310> it

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
this did even worst on the chest um it

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.630 
this did even worst on the chest um it
didn't<00:02:47.610> even<00:02:47.670> make<00:02:47.910> any<00:02:47.970> marks<00:02:48.570> on<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:48.990> so

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
didn't even make any marks on it so

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.310 
didn't even make any marks on it so
you're<00:02:50.640> really<00:02:50.850> not<00:02:51.060> going<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.750> be<00:02:51.900> able<00:02:51.930> to

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
you're really not going to be able to

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.010 
you're really not going to be able to
use<00:02:52.560> this<00:02:52.910> when<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.090> tacking<00:02:54.480> zombie<00:02:54.870> in<00:02:54.959> a

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
use this when the tacking zombie in a

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.610 
use this when the tacking zombie in a
chest<00:02:55.380> or<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.459> neck<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:57.030> either<00:02:57.930> way<00:02:58.230> this<00:02:58.440> is

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
chest or the neck so either way this is

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.010 
chest or the neck so either way this is
a<00:02:58.650> big<00:02:59.520> downer<00:02:59.790> I<00:03:00.000> would<00:03:00.180> not<00:03:00.330> use<00:03:00.360> this<00:03:00.780> in

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
a big downer I would not use this in

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.070 
a big downer I would not use this in
zombie<00:03:01.410> invasion<00:03:01.500> at<00:03:01.890> all<00:03:02.070> now<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.870> um<00:03:04.170> axed<00:03:05.100> um

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
zombie invasion at all now so um axed um

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.620 
zombie invasion at all now so um axed um
I'd<00:03:07.080> give<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.320> a<00:03:07.610> zero<00:03:08.610> because<00:03:09.270> if<00:03:09.510> it's

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
I'd give it a zero because if it's

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.260 
I'd give it a zero because if it's
heaviness<00:03:09.990> and<00:03:10.260> it's<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.560> week<00:03:10.800> its<00:03:11.670> weak<00:03:11.940> power

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
heaviness and it's a week its weak power

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.009 
heaviness and it's a week its weak power
so<00:03:12.720> no<00:03:13.670> axe<00:03:14.670> next<00:03:15.510> up<00:03:15.600> we're<00:03:15.750> going<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.930> be

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
so no axe next up we're going to be

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.009 
so no axe next up we're going to be
using<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.440> Colt<00:03:16.709> revolver<00:03:17.400> now<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.570> colt<00:03:18.810> was

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
using the Colt revolver now the colt was

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.040 
using the Colt revolver now the colt was
first<00:03:19.260> invented<00:03:19.500> by<00:03:20.370> artist<00:03:21.330> colt<00:03:21.660> who

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
first invented by artist colt who

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.520 
first invented by artist colt who
designed<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:23.070> in<00:03:23.250> 1487<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.780> fight<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.110> vikings

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
designed it in 1487 to fight the vikings

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.280 
designed it in 1487 to fight the vikings
with<00:03:25.769> so<00:03:26.730> we're<00:03:27.420> going<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.600> see<00:03:27.810> if<00:03:28.080> this<00:03:28.230> is

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
with so we're going to see if this is

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.780 
with so we're going to see if this is
really<00:03:28.709> useful<00:03:29.070> um<00:03:29.700> it's<00:03:30.239> very<00:03:30.510> heavy<00:03:31.790> it

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
really useful um it's very heavy it

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.870 
really useful um it's very heavy it
doesn't<00:03:33.600> have<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.750> very<00:03:34.019> good<00:03:34.260> ammo<00:03:34.470> capacity

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
doesn't have a very good ammo capacity

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.880 
doesn't have a very good ammo capacity
about<00:03:35.880> three<00:03:36.150> or<00:03:36.180> four<00:03:36.410> bullets<00:03:37.410> uh<00:03:37.910> /<00:03:38.910> 43

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
about three or four bullets uh / 43

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:47.150 
about three or four bullets uh / 43
trender<00:03:40.890> poles<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:43.040> also<00:03:45.140> um<00:03:46.140> if<00:03:46.440> you<00:03:46.860> fire

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
trender poles and also um if you fire

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.520 
trender poles and also um if you fire
this<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.549> wrong<00:03:47.670> way<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:48.150> can<00:03:48.450> take<00:03:48.810> your<00:03:49.049> both

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
this the wrong way it can take your both

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.080 
this the wrong way it can take your both
of<00:03:49.739> your<00:03:49.860> arms<00:03:49.890> off<00:03:50.340> even<00:03:50.700> if<00:03:50.790> you're<00:03:50.910> using

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
one hand so yeah right now this is just

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.930 
one hand so yeah right now this is just
going<00:03:55.380> down<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.709> drain<00:03:55.890> because<00:03:56.160> of<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.730> UM

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
going down the drain because of the UM

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.860 
going down the drain because of the UM
how<00:03:57.810> danger<00:03:58.320> it<00:03:58.350> it<00:03:58.500> is<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:59.190> use<00:03:59.370> so<00:03:59.700> we'll<00:04:00.690> see

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
how danger it it is to use so we'll see

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.170 
how danger it it is to use so we'll see
if<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:01.080> does<00:04:01.230> any<00:04:01.500> better<00:04:01.739> fighting<00:04:02.610> a<00:04:02.790> zombie

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
if it does any better fighting a zombie

is<00:04:45.139> so<00:04:45.740> powerful<00:04:46.070> that<00:04:46.699> um<00:04:47.570> I<00:04:49.630> have<00:04:50.630> to<00:04:50.840> use<00:04:50.960> a

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
is so powerful that um I have to use a

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.379 
is so powerful that um I have to use a
smaller<00:04:51.470> version<00:04:51.770> of<00:04:52.070> it<00:04:52.250> instead<00:04:53.120> of<00:04:53.180> the

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
smaller version of it instead of the

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.969 
smaller version of it instead of the
normal<00:04:53.840> big<00:04:54.139> one<00:04:54.350> so<00:04:55.120> yeah<00:04:56.120> um<00:04:56.650> we're<00:04:57.650> going<00:04:57.889> to

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
normal big one so yeah um we're going to

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.210 
normal big one so yeah um we're going to
be<00:04:58.070> using<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:59.270> Apple<00:04:59.830> now<00:05:00.830> this<00:05:01.070> was

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
be using the Apple now this was

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.689 
be using the Apple now this was
originally<00:05:01.460> invented<00:05:01.970> by<00:05:02.270> Thomas<00:05:02.300> Jefferson

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:03.699 
originally invented by Thomas Jefferson

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.140 
originally invented by Thomas Jefferson
for<00:05:04.699> use<00:05:04.820> in<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.240> Civil<00:05:05.600> War<00:05:05.870> so<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:07.639> soldiers

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
for use in the Civil War so the soldiers

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.560 
for use in the Civil War so the soldiers
would<00:05:08.539> have<00:05:08.750> a<00:05:09.110> good<00:05:09.680> throwing<00:05:10.400> weapon<00:05:10.880> a<00:05:11.090> good

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
would have a good throwing weapon a good

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.779 
would have a good throwing weapon a good
close-range<00:05:12.139> weapon<00:05:12.580> something<00:05:13.580> that<00:05:13.699> was

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
close-range weapon something that was

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.700 
close-range weapon something that was
light<00:05:14.000> and<00:05:14.030> durable<00:05:14.270> and<00:05:14.840> also<00:05:15.470> could<00:05:15.680> be

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
light and durable and also could be

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.300 
light and durable and also could be
eaten<00:05:16.280> for<00:05:16.700> good<00:05:16.849> protein<00:05:17.389> and<00:05:17.599> energy<00:05:17.979> um<00:05:18.979> and

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
eaten for good protein and energy um and

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.159 
eaten for good protein and energy um and
you<00:05:20.030> know<00:05:20.060> is<00:05:20.419> safe<00:05:21.169> to<00:05:21.380> eat<00:05:21.410> so<00:05:22.160> um<00:05:22.930> here<00:05:23.930> it<00:05:24.080> is

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
absolutely perfect let's try the torso

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.890 
absolutely perfect let's try the torso
alright<00:06:00.950> just<00:06:01.520> to<00:06:01.639> prove<00:06:01.880> how<00:06:01.940> powerful<00:06:02.150> this

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
alright just to prove how powerful this

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.740 
alright just to prove how powerful this
is<00:06:02.960> we've<00:06:03.650> changed<00:06:04.280> the<00:06:04.460> torso<00:06:04.910> from<00:06:05.479> the

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
is we've changed the torso from the

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:11.439 
is we've changed the torso from the
human<00:06:07.060> the<00:06:08.060> human<00:06:08.090> density<00:06:09.490> cinder<00:06:10.490> blocks<00:06:10.760> to

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 
human the human density cinder blocks to

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.400 
human the human density cinder blocks to
a<00:06:12.039> pillow<00:06:13.039> which<00:06:13.370> is<00:06:13.580> ten<00:06:14.300> times<00:06:14.330> more<00:06:14.930> dense

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
a pillow which is ten times more dense

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.159 
a pillow which is ten times more dense
than<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:15.860> average<00:06:16.340> cinder<00:06:16.699> block<00:06:16.910> so<00:06:17.720> if<00:06:17.990> this

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169 
than the average cinder block so if this

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.010 
than the average cinder block so if this
can<00:06:18.380> take<00:06:18.530> that<00:06:18.800> out<00:06:19.039> this<00:06:19.580> can<00:06:20.210> easily<00:06:20.539> take

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
can take that out this can easily take

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.970 
can take that out this can easily take
out<00:06:21.200> three<00:06:21.560> to<00:06:21.710> four

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:21.980 
out three to four

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:30.250 
out three to four
human<00:06:22.340> torsos<00:06:22.820> so<00:06:23.690> let's<00:06:24.170> test<00:06:28.060> did<00:06:29.060> oh<00:06:29.300> my<00:06:29.990> god

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
human torsos so let's test did oh my god

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:37.600 
human torsos so let's test did oh my god
she's<00:06:31.180> that<00:06:32.180> oh<00:06:34.270> wow<00:06:36.160> now<00:06:37.160> that<00:06:37.340> was

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
she's that oh wow now that was

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.150 
she's that oh wow now that was
impressive<00:06:37.640> this<00:06:38.570> just<00:06:38.840> took<00:06:39.290> it<00:06:39.350> right<00:06:39.620> out<00:06:39.680> I

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
impressive this just took it right out I

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.460 
impressive this just took it right out I
mean<00:06:40.430> if<00:06:40.910> you<00:06:41.120> were<00:06:41.240> to<00:06:41.390> use<00:06:41.450> this<00:06:41.720> against

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 
mean if you were to use this against

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.890 
mean if you were to use this against
regular<00:06:43.130> human<00:06:43.520> torsos<00:06:43.880> you<00:06:44.360> could<00:06:44.510> take<00:06:44.690> out

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:44.900 
regular human torsos you could take out

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.640 
regular human torsos you could take out
five<00:06:45.680> to<00:06:45.890> six<00:06:46.130> people<00:06:46.370> with<00:06:46.700> one<00:06:47.060> swipe<00:06:47.650> so

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
five to six people with one swipe so

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.520 
five to six people with one swipe so
yeah<00:06:49.070> this<00:06:49.370> is<00:06:49.580> obviously<00:06:50.380> terrific<00:06:51.380> when

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:51.530 
yeah this is obviously terrific when

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.190 
yeah this is obviously terrific when
taking<00:06:51.950> out<00:06:52.100> zombies<00:06:52.130> but<00:06:53.120> also<00:06:53.330> if<00:06:53.750> there's

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.200 
taking out zombies but also if there's

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.670 
taking out zombies but also if there's
any<00:06:54.470> people<00:06:55.460> who<00:06:56.150> try<00:06:56.600> to<00:06:56.660> steal<00:06:56.810> something

any people who try to steal something
from<00:06:57.710> you<00:06:58.130> if<00:06:58.340> they<00:06:58.910> have<00:06:59.120> an<00:06:59.240> open<00:06:59.570> wound<00:06:59.780> if

from you if they have an open wound if

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.150 
from you if they have an open wound if
you<00:07:00.500> rub<00:07:00.800> this<00:07:01.040> in<00:07:01.960> in<00:07:02.960> that<00:07:03.200> wound<00:07:03.440> they<00:07:03.980> can

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 
you rub this in in that wound they can

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.580 
you rub this in in that wound they can
contract<00:07:04.850> a<00:07:05.030> horrible<00:07:05.630> disease<00:07:05.810> known<00:07:06.560> as

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:06.590 
contract a horrible disease known as

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.130 
contract a horrible disease known as
Apple<00:07:07.250> ptosis<00:07:07.760> which<00:07:08.000> can<00:07:08.240> either<00:07:08.810> wait<00:07:09.020> for

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:09.140 
Apple ptosis which can either wait for

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.410 
Apple ptosis which can either wait for
flesh<00:07:09.470> and<00:07:09.680> minutes<00:07:10.010> but<00:07:10.640> it's<00:07:10.940> safe<00:07:11.150> for<00:07:11.300> you

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:11.420 
flesh and minutes but it's safe for you

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:15.580 
flesh and minutes but it's safe for you
to<00:07:11.450> eat<00:07:11.810> so<00:07:12.260> if<00:07:12.380> you<00:07:12.500> run<00:07:12.710> out<00:07:12.740> of<00:07:12.920> food<00:07:14.590> it's
