00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.290
 place so try to choose from 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.090
 determine a domain of your existence 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.220
 in which you feel you have the most 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.730
 difficulties so it can be by 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.870
 example on the relationship in love 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.200
 could for example think that that's it 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:30.150
 despite your desire to find a 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.219
 harmonious relationship of living a 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.620
 harmonious and fulfilling relationship 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.710

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.840
