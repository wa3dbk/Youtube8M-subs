the<00:00:42.680> situation<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.700> have<00:00:44.940> various

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
the situation is that you have various

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.680 
the situation is that you have various
types<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.500> what<00:00:46.770> we<00:00:47.100> normally<00:00:47.520> call<00:00:47.940> Gray's<00:00:48.329> we

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
types of what we normally call Gray's we

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.930 
types of what we normally call Gray's we
didn't<00:00:48.989> call<00:00:49.140> them<00:00:49.200> raised<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.680> military

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
didn't call them raised in the military

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.670 
didn't call them raised in the military
but<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.059> had<00:00:51.270> at<00:00:51.480> least<00:00:51.719> three<00:00:51.899> types<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.530> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
but you had at least three types of the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.520 
but you had at least three types of the
grades<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.280> had<00:00:53.969> some<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.690> were<00:00:54.930> much

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
grades you had some that were much

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.950 
grades you had some that were much
taller<00:00:55.860> than<00:00:55.949> we<00:00:56.250> were<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:57.600> unique<00:00:57.899> thing

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
taller than we were the unique thing

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.020 
taller than we were the unique thing
that<00:00:58.920> I'd<00:00:59.010> like<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.280> point<00:00:59.430> out<00:00:59.579> for<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.850> most

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
that I'd like to point out for the most

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.880 
that I'd like to point out for the most
part<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.960> entities<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.649> did

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
part is that the entities that we did

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.969 
part is that the entities that we did
catalogue<00:01:02.460> were<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.570> fact<00:01:03.809> humanoid<00:01:04.379> now<00:01:04.769> this

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
catalogue were in fact humanoid now this

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.969 
catalogue were in fact humanoid now this
created<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.640> situation<00:01:06.229> where<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> scientific

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
created a situation where the scientific

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.070 
created a situation where the scientific
community<00:01:08.100> was<00:01:08.670> trying<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.210> figure<00:01:09.479> out<00:01:09.600> why

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
community was trying to figure out why

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.320 
community was trying to figure out why
that<00:01:10.380> would<00:01:10.560> be<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> case<00:01:10.850> because<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.210> would

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
that would be the case because you would

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.940 
that would be the case because you would
expect<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.900> if<00:01:13.020> life<00:01:13.260> evolved<00:01:13.710> with<00:01:13.799> other

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
expect that if life evolved with other

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.580 
expect that if life evolved with other
planets<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.700> they<00:01:15.360> would<00:01:15.509> take<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.780> some

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
planets that they would take on some

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.710 
planets that they would take on some
type<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.860> other<00:01:19.610> beings<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.060> speak<00:01:21.390> not

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
type of other beings so to speak not

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.070 
type of other beings so to speak not
necessarily<00:01:22.170> look<00:01:22.470> humanoid<00:01:23.280> are<00:01:23.610> be<00:01:24.270> bipedal

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
necessarily look humanoid are be bipedal

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.060 
necessarily look humanoid are be bipedal
such<00:01:25.439> as<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.830> are<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.970> apparently<00:01:27.890> we've<00:01:28.890> got

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
such as we are but apparently we've got

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.380 
such as we are but apparently we've got
quite<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.340> few<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> species<00:01:30.000> out<00:01:30.329> there

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
quite a few of the species out there

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.990 
quite a few of the species out there
that<00:01:30.869> are<00:01:30.900> humanoid<00:01:31.619> appearance<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.400> that

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
that are humanoid appearance and that

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.660 
that are humanoid appearance and that
creates<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.840> question<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.890> yet<00:01:35.159> has<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.549> be

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
creates a question that yet has to be
