little bit but they're light it's a
bright<00:03:13.750> side<00:03:14.110> I'm<00:03:15.069> pregnant<00:03:15.459> right<00:03:15.670> now

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.300 

this<00:03:20.690> is<00:03:20.810> really<00:03:21.019> no<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.290> said<00:03:21.560> we<00:03:21.680> tried<00:03:21.890> I<00:03:22.069> mean

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:02.940 

I'm<00:03:55.610> joking<00:03:56.030> happens<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:57.709> guides<00:03:57.980> my<00:03:58.159> left

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.900 

rushon<00:04:03.879> Oh

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.650 

I<00:04:08.400> take<00:04:09.400> it<00:04:09.550> back<00:04:09.610> there<00:04:09.850> is<00:04:10.000> mistake<00:04:10.180> that<00:04:10.510> I

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
I take it back there is mistake that I

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:11.790 
I take it back there is mistake that I
think<00:04:10.900> I'll<00:04:10.990> fight<00:04:11.230> too

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
think I'll fight too

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.100 
think I'll fight too
for<00:04:12.550> me<00:04:12.700> I<00:04:12.730> find<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.150> physics<00:04:13.480> it's<00:04:13.720> really

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
for me I find the physics it's really

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.110 
for me I find the physics it's really
slippery<00:04:16.739> even<00:04:17.739> when<00:04:17.890> the<00:04:18.010> tracks<00:04:18.280> started<00:04:19.030> to

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
slippery even when the tracks started to

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.750 
slippery even when the tracks started to
rub<00:04:19.269> around<00:04:20.010> cause<00:04:21.010> you<00:04:21.160> seem<00:04:21.340> to<00:04:21.430> be<00:04:21.519> really

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
rub around cause you seem to be really

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:33.220 
rub around cause you seem to be really
really<00:04:22.060> snippy

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.580 

my<00:04:33.770> forte

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.770 

it's<00:04:38.220> pretty<00:04:38.580> hard<00:04:38.850> to<00:04:39.030> say<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.270> points<00:04:39.540> are

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
it's pretty hard to say the points are

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:58.330 
it's pretty hard to say the points are
they<00:04:39.960> very<00:04:40.950> good

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.990 

unfortunately<00:04:59.340> I<00:04:59.370> don't<00:04:59.460> know<00:04:59.760> if<00:04:59.850> there's

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
unfortunately I don't know if there's

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.300 
unfortunately I don't know if there's
anyone<00:05:00.210> further<00:05:01.050> up<00:05:01.320> and<00:05:01.590> I<00:05:01.770> haven't<00:05:01.950> got<00:05:02.160> the

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
anyone further up and I haven't got the

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.530 
anyone further up and I haven't got the
scoreboard<00:05:05.310> on<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.550> screen<00:05:05.910> visible<00:05:06.360> I<00:05:06.420> have

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
scoreboard on the screen visible I have

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.080 
scoreboard on the screen visible I have
to<00:05:06.660> own<00:05:06.810> a<00:05:07.050> store<00:05:07.110> D<00:05:07.530> there's<00:05:08.370> a<00:05:08.430> multi<00:05:08.910> user

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
to own a store D there's a multi user

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.330 
to own a store D there's a multi user
interface<00:05:09.740> to<00:05:10.740> get<00:05:10.950> it<00:05:11.100> so<00:05:11.910> that<00:05:12.120> it's<00:05:13.340> more

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
interface to get it so that it's more

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.680 
interface to get it so that it's more
visible<00:05:14.520> with<00:05:15.510> the<00:05:15.600> oculus<00:05:15.780> rift

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.600 

I'm<00:05:21.020> so<00:05:21.320> excited<00:05:21.380> that<00:05:21.920> she's<00:05:22.280> got<00:05:22.520> my<00:05:22.700> left

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:39.760 

fast<00:05:26.319> racing<00:05:27.319> Oh

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:39.770 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:54.700 

so<00:05:40.460> slightly<00:05:40.820> later

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:00.350 

it's<00:05:55.250> a<00:05:55.400> faster<00:05:56.060> rate

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:27.990 

point<00:06:00.840> eight<00:06:01.680> eight

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.300 

while<00:06:28.600> it<00:06:28.690> looks<00:06:28.900> like<00:06:29.050> the<00:06:29.200> ratings<00:06:29.710> over<00:06:30.130> for

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
while it looks like the ratings over for

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:36.750 
while it looks like the ratings over for
this<00:06:30.960> but<00:06:31.960> at<00:06:32.080> least<00:06:32.230> to<00:06:32.440> get<00:06:35.340> from<00:06:36.340> the<00:06:36.460> start

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 
this but at least to get from the start

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.510 
this but at least to get from the start
of<00:06:36.820> this<00:06:36.940> it's<00:06:37.180> possible<00:06:37.540> to<00:06:37.630> say<00:06:37.810> you<00:06:38.350> can

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.280 

raise<00:06:42.520> with<00:06:42.550> people<00:06:43.120> even<00:06:43.540> with<00:06:43.840> the<00:06:43.900> deposit

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
raise with people even with the deposit

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.960 
raise with people even with the deposit
in<00:06:44.470> this<00:06:44.860> shoddy<00:06:45.460> reservation<00:06:46.240> so<00:06:47.050> hopefully

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
in this shoddy reservation so hopefully

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.140 
in this shoddy reservation so hopefully
when<00:06:48.970> the<00:06:49.090> HD<00:06:49.480> one<00:06:49.690> comes<00:06:49.930> out<00:06:50.790> it'll<00:06:51.790> be<00:06:51.850> a<00:06:51.940> big

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
when the HD one comes out it'll be a big

00:06:52.150 --> 00:07:02.750 
when the HD one comes out it'll be a big
improvement

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:02.760 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.580 

rather<00:07:03.360> than<00:07:03.660> boy<00:07:03.900> you<00:07:03.960> would<00:07:04.230> laugh<00:07:04.320> after

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.590 
rather than boy you would laugh after

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.920 
rather than boy you would laugh after
that<00:07:04.770> off<00:07:05.040> me<00:07:05.190> driving<00:07:05.580> by<00:07:05.700> myself<00:07:05.910> I'm<00:07:06.720> gonna

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
that off me driving by myself I'm gonna

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.930 
that off me driving by myself I'm gonna
end<00:07:07.110> the<00:07:07.200> video<00:07:07.350> there<00:07:07.470> I'm<00:07:08.220> gonna<00:07:08.550> get<00:07:08.700> on<00:07:08.850> our

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 
end the video there I'm gonna get on our

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.970 
end the video there I'm gonna get on our
factor<00:07:09.390> another<00:07:09.720> time<00:07:09.990> when<00:07:10.170> this<00:07:10.290> server<00:07:10.710> has

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:10.980 
factor another time when this server has

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.560 
factor another time when this server has
more<00:07:11.190> people<00:07:11.370> in<00:07:11.610> it<00:07:11.820> and<00:07:11.850> hopefully<00:07:12.360> we<00:07:12.510> can

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:12.570 
more people in it and hopefully we can

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.780 
more people in it and hopefully we can
do<00:07:12.720> some<00:07:12.900> more<00:07:12.930> side-by-side<00:07:13.590> racing<00:07:13.830> but

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:14.790 
do some more side-by-side racing but

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.240 
do some more side-by-side racing but
it's<00:07:15.030> definitely<00:07:15.330> worth<00:07:15.810> trying<00:07:16.410> out<00:07:17.010> our

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.250 
it's definitely worth trying out our

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.610 
it's definitely worth trying out our
factor<00:07:17.730> two<00:07:17.940> if<00:07:18.420> you<00:07:18.630> have<00:07:18.960> it<00:07:19.140> off<00:07:19.230> his<00:07:19.380> rift

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 
factor two if you have it off his rift

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.360 
factor two if you have it off his rift
and<00:07:20.240> use<00:07:21.240> a<00:07:21.270> try<00:07:21.840> death<00:07:22.140> to<00:07:22.650> get<00:07:23.070> it<00:07:23.160> working

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.370 
and use a try death to get it working

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.990 
and use a try death to get it working
