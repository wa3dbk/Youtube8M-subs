00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.529
 you do not have any more to send one 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.480
 first broadcast 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.189
 that's why i 'm about to google 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.779
 allowed small lac is one to make but 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.130
 not during the broadcast from the studio 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.810
 go out java phones 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.940
 because I thought so honestly that 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.890
 really do not like to see me 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.620
 they even thank you forward or equally good 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.570
 powerless I always have a big empty one 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.280
 Milk bottle in the studio. Old trick of 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:52.340

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.570

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.900
 I have an impression here somehow 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.300
 schoolmasterly but tip is so facto 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.040
 It's like that when you grow it that way 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.540
 structures come for you 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.610
 Number dominate then one does oneself as 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.560
 Newbie but good if you first time 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.630
 in the position of the learner 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.630
 put into it and you know 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.890
 Imitation is simply the most honest 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.729
 form of recognition 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.469

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.359
 where it is not for sale 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.770
 incite your critical consciousness 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:26.299
 that would not be my style that 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.249

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.869

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:39.319

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:40.789

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:48.560
