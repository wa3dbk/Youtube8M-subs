how it runs on this map board pro so I'm
going<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.910> talk<00:00:24.060> too<00:00:24.300> much<00:00:24.330> about<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.930> design

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
going to talk too much about the design

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.140 
going to talk too much about the design
of<00:00:25.439> this<00:00:25.529> macbook<00:00:25.920> pro<00:00:26.130> because<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.609> exactly

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
of this macbook pro because is exactly

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.670 
of this macbook pro because is exactly
the<00:00:27.240> same<00:00:27.449> as<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.810> last<00:00:27.990> generation<00:00:28.500> MacBook

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
the same as the last generation MacBook

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.740 
the same as the last generation MacBook
Pro<00:00:29.010> they've<00:00:29.460> just<00:00:29.670> updated<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> internals

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
Pro they've just updated the internals

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.900 
Pro they've just updated the internals
with<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:30.990> new<00:00:31.199> 2012<00:00:31.590> release<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.610> I'm<00:00:32.669> sure<00:00:32.880> a

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
with this new 2012 release so I'm sure a

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.459 
with this new 2012 release so I'm sure a
lot<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.450> already<00:00:33.660> seen<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.140> design

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
lot of you have already seen this design

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.500 
lot of you have already seen this design
before<00:00:34.620> it's<00:00:35.340> all<00:00:35.460> made<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.760> aluminium<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.420> it

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
before it's all made of aluminium and it

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.030 
before it's all made of aluminium and it
looks<00:00:36.690> very<00:00:36.870> similar<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.500> new<00:00:37.649> retina

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
looks very similar to the new retina

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.190 
looks very similar to the new retina
MacBook<00:00:38.340> Pro<00:00:38.550> although<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.570> bit<00:00:39.719> chunkier

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
MacBook Pro although it's a bit chunkier

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.959 
MacBook Pro although it's a bit chunkier
because<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.530> has<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.800> accommodate<00:00:41.040> for<00:00:41.760> things

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
because it has to accommodate for things

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:42.680 
because it has to accommodate for things
like<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> disc<00:00:42.420> drive

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
like the disc drive

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.880 
like the disc drive
and<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.989> course<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.320> standard<00:00:43.649> hard<00:00:43.829> drive

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
and of course the standard hard drive

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.040 
and of course the standard hard drive
which<00:00:44.129> are<00:00:44.280> much<00:00:44.430> thicker<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:45.420> again<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.870> is

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
which are much thicker but again it is

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.450 
which are much thicker but again it is
still<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> very<00:00:46.440> modern<00:00:46.800> design<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.280> looks

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
still a very modern design and looks

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.479 
still a very modern design and looks
very<00:00:47.550> elegant<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.360> any<00:00:48.960> desk<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.530> any<00:00:49.680> room<00:00:49.890> so

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
very elegant on any desk in any room so

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.279 
very elegant on any desk in any room so
yes<00:00:50.700> no<00:00:51.030> complaints<00:00:51.510> about<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.870> actual<00:00:52.110> look

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
yes no complaints about the actual look

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.900 
yes no complaints about the actual look
of<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> device<00:00:52.800> there<00:00:53.340> are<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.520> few<00:00:53.730> key

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
of the device there are a few key

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.490 
of the device there are a few key
elements<00:00:54.000> about<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.600> design<00:00:54.930> which<00:00:55.110> actually

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
elements about the design which actually

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.170 
elements about the design which actually
really<00:00:55.649> loves<00:00:56.010> such<00:00:56.250> as<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.579> MagSafe<00:00:56.820> power

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
really loves such as the MagSafe power

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.060 
really loves such as the MagSafe power
adapter<00:00:57.449> here<00:00:58.020> along<00:00:58.410> with<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> battery

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
adapter here along with the battery

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.560

to see the battery level even when the
device<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.550> off<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> ports<00:01:04.229> are<00:01:04.350> exactly

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
device is off so the ports are exactly

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.350 
device is off so the ports are exactly
the<00:01:04.799> same<00:01:05.010> as<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> previous<00:01:05.640> model<00:01:05.970> with<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the same as the previous model with the

now been upgraded to USB 3.0 which is

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.230 
now been upgraded to USB 3.0 which is
faster<00:01:11.220> than<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> previous<00:01:11.670> version<00:01:11.909> which

has<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.670> backlit<00:01:27.090> chiclet<00:01:27.150> keys<00:01:27.750> which<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.350> can

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
has the backlit chiclet keys which I can

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.200 
has the backlit chiclet keys which I can
honestly<00:01:28.650> say<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.400> best<00:01:29.579> keyboard<00:01:30.060> that

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
honestly say is the best keyboard that

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.910 
honestly say is the best keyboard that
I've<00:01:30.299> used<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.810> laptop<00:01:31.350> today

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
I've used on a laptop today

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.130 
I've used on a laptop today
so<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.520> mod<00:01:32.700> lyov<00:01:33.030> here<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.659> baseline

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
so the mod lyov here is the baseline

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.399 
so the mod lyov here is the baseline
MacBook<00:01:34.650> Pro<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.340> quad-core<00:01:35.700> i7<00:01:36.409> 2.3

Geekbench<00:01:42.210> now<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.509> give<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:42.960> an<00:01:43.049> indication

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
Geekbench now to give you an indication

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.980 
Geekbench now to give you an indication
of<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.070> performance<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.119> Mac<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.689> should

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
of the performance of this Mac I should

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.569 
of the performance of this Mac I should
also<00:01:46.140> mention<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.710> I'm<00:01:46.890> only<00:01:47.040> running<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
also mention that I'm only running the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.539 
also mention that I'm only running the
32-bit<00:01:48.270> benchmark<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.649> will<00:01:49.860> also<00:01:50.189> use<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
32-bit benchmark but I will also use the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.550 
32-bit benchmark but I will also use the
results<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.210> compare<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.899> all<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.530> other

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
results and compare it to all the other

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.490 
results and compare it to all the other
Macs<00:01:52.950> running<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.909> same<00:01:54.210> 32-bit<00:01:55.049> benchmark

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
Macs running the same 32-bit benchmark

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.050 
Macs running the same 32-bit benchmark
so<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.740> will<00:01:55.829> give<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.130> an<00:01:56.340> indication<00:01:56.640> of

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
so it will give you an indication of

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.940 
so it will give you an indication of
where<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.360> places<00:01:57.840> against<00:01:58.229> other<00:01:58.409> Mac's<00:01:58.710> on

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
where it places against other Mac's on

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.950 
where it places against other Mac's on
the<00:01:59.159> market<00:01:59.579> still<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.240> as<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.600> see<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the market still so as you can see the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.780 
the market still so as you can see the
MacBook<00:02:01.320> got<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> pretty<00:02:01.860> respectable<00:02:02.189> score

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
MacBook got a pretty respectable score

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.609 
MacBook got a pretty respectable score
so<00:02:03.509> if<00:02:03.630> we<00:02:03.719> compare<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.290> some<00:02:04.560> other

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
so if we compare that to some other

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.319 
so if we compare that to some other
Mac's<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.189> still<00:02:05.460> on<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.579> market<00:02:05.790> today<00:02:06.149> you

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
Mac's that still on the market today you

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.300 
Mac's that still on the market today you
can<00:02:06.570> see<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.990> places<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.619> between<00:02:08.099> a

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
can see that it places in between a

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.330 
can see that it places in between a
27-inch<00:02:09.179> iMac<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.690> 2011<00:02:10.470> model<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:10.920> a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
27-inch iMac the 2011 model and a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.460 
27-inch iMac the 2011 model and a
17-inch<00:02:11.849> late<00:02:12.390> 2011

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
17-inch late 2011

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.500 
17-inch late 2011
MacBook<00:02:13.920> Pro<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.550> yeah<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.150> terms<00:02:15.330> of

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
MacBook Pro so yeah in terms of

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.150 
MacBook Pro so yeah in terms of
performance<00:02:15.930> it's<00:02:16.140> still<00:02:16.350> a<00:02:16.380> very<00:02:16.620> very<00:02:16.890> solid

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
performance it's still a very very solid

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.890 
performance it's still a very very solid
performer<00:02:17.760> considering<00:02:18.510> this<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:18.780> the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
performer considering this is the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.660 
performer considering this is the
baseline<00:02:19.260> model<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.770> again<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.250> must<00:02:20.460> just

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
baseline model and again I must just

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.030 
baseline model and again I must just
stress<00:02:20.880> that<00:02:20.910> this<00:02:21.210> was<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.420> 32-bit<00:02:22.260> benchmark

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
stress that this was a 32-bit benchmark

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.440 
stress that this was a 32-bit benchmark
so<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.280> will<00:02:23.520> see<00:02:23.700> better<00:02:23.880> results<00:02:23.970> with<00:02:24.420> a

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
so you will see better results with a

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.140 
so you will see better results with a
64-bit<00:02:25.260> benchmark<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.280> also<00:02:26.400> run<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.760> disk

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
64-bit benchmark so I also run a disk

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.580 
64-bit benchmark so I also run a disk
speed<00:02:27.390> test<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.840> you<00:02:27.960> can<00:02:28.110> see<00:02:28.320> that<00:02:28.470> the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
speed test and you can see that the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.050 
speed test and you can see that the
average<00:02:28.710> read<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.310> write<00:02:29.430> speeds<00:02:29.790> and

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
average read and write speeds and

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.540 
average read and write speeds and
nowhere<00:02:30.540> near<00:02:30.570> SSD<00:02:31.290> standard<00:02:31.800> but<00:02:32.310> it's<00:02:32.430> still

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
nowhere near SSD standard but it's still

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.920 
nowhere near SSD standard but it's still
found<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.030> operating<00:02:33.420> system<00:02:33.750> was<00:02:33.840> very

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
found that the operating system was very

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.110 
found that the operating system was very
fluid<00:02:34.470> mountain<00:02:35.100> lion<00:02:35.250> seems<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.700> run<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:35.940> lot

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
fluid mountain lion seems to run a lot

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.180 
fluid mountain lion seems to run a lot
faster<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.780> little<00:02:36.960> bit<00:02:37.170> faster<00:02:37.530> than<00:02:37.680> lion<00:02:37.920> did

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
faster a little bit faster than lion did

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.100 
faster a little bit faster than lion did
and<00:02:38.400> everything<00:02:39.000> kind<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.390> seems<00:02:39.570> very<00:02:39.720> fluid

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
and everything kind of seems very fluid

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.600 
and everything kind of seems very fluid
and<00:02:40.170> even<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.500> boot<00:02:40.680> up<00:02:40.860> times<00:02:41.100> are<00:02:41.280> fairly

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
and even the boot up times are fairly

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.550 
and even the boot up times are fairly
quick<00:02:41.850> even<00:02:42.540> considering<00:02:42.960> that<00:02:43.110> it<00:02:43.230> doesn't

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
quick even considering that it doesn't

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.710 
quick even considering that it doesn't
have<00:02:43.710> an<00:02:43.800> SSD<00:02:44.100> in<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:44.580> system<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.480> I'm<00:02:45.540> not<00:02:45.660> a

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
have an SSD in the system so I'm not a

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.630 
have an SSD in the system so I'm not a
huge<00:02:45.780> fan<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.230> testing<00:02:46.770> system<00:02:47.160> performance

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
huge fan of testing system performance

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.550 
huge fan of testing system performance
with<00:02:47.760> benchmarks<00:02:48.360> I'd<00:02:48.660> rather<00:02:48.900> actually<00:02:49.140> do

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
with benchmarks I'd rather actually do

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.930 
with benchmarks I'd rather actually do
something<00:02:49.950> on<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.160> system<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:50.670> I'm<00:02:50.760> going

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
something on the system that I'm going

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.530 
something on the system that I'm going
to<00:02:50.970> do<00:02:51.180> with<00:02:51.360> it

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
to do with it

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.480 
to do with it
so<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:52.050> actually<00:02:52.200> ran<00:02:52.560> Photoshop<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.400> was

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
so I actually ran Photoshop and I was

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.400 
so I actually ran Photoshop and I was
editing<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.850> few<00:02:54.060> RAW<00:02:54.240> files<00:02:54.510> which<00:02:55.050> actually

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
editing a few RAW files which actually

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.050 
editing a few RAW files which actually
used<00:02:55.560> in<00:02:55.680> this<00:02:55.800> video<00:02:56.100> so<00:02:56.640> these<00:02:56.730> are<00:02:56.880> pretty

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
used in this video so these are pretty

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.060 
used in this video so these are pretty
high<00:02:57.330> resolution<00:02:57.480> RAW<00:02:58.080> files<00:02:58.320> from<00:02:58.530> an<00:02:58.650> SLR

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
high resolution RAW files from an SLR

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.830 
high resolution RAW files from an SLR
camera<00:02:59.520> so<00:02:59.940> they're<00:03:00.090> pretty<00:03:00.330> big<00:03:00.480> in<00:03:00.600> file

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
camera so they're pretty big in file

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.050 
camera so they're pretty big in file
size<00:03:01.080> but<00:03:01.770> they<00:03:01.890> open<00:03:02.190> very<00:03:02.400> quickly<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:03.000> I

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
size but they open very quickly and I

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.250 
size but they open very quickly and I
was<00:03:03.150> able<00:03:03.240> to<00:03:03.390> edit<00:03:03.570> them<00:03:03.840> without<00:03:04.020> any

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
was able to edit them without any

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.410 
was able to edit them without any
lagging<00:03:04.560> or<00:03:04.890> or<00:03:05.100> things<00:03:05.550> like<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.270> I<00:03:06.300> am

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
lagging or or things like that so I am

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.420 
lagging or or things like that so I am
running<00:03:06.570> Photoshop<00:03:07.110> cs6<00:03:07.500> on<00:03:08.010> this<00:03:08.220> system

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
running Photoshop cs6 on this system

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.520 
running Photoshop cs6 on this system
it's<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.000> latest<00:03:09.300> version<00:03:09.480> so<00:03:10.200> obviously

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
it's the latest version so obviously

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.230 
it's the latest version so obviously
it's<00:03:10.709> a<00:03:10.770> bit<00:03:10.920> more<00:03:11.070> optimized<00:03:11.580> for<00:03:11.880> things

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
it's a bit more optimized for things

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.870 
it's a bit more optimized for things
like<00:03:12.300> 64-bit<00:03:13.140> processors<00:03:13.709> but<00:03:14.280> as<00:03:14.459> I<00:03:14.580> said<00:03:14.760> it

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
like 64-bit processors but as I said it

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.820 
like 64-bit processors but as I said it
runs<00:03:15.060> very<00:03:15.240> fast<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.900> compressing<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.590> files

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
runs very fast and compressing the files

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.890 
runs very fast and compressing the files
and<00:03:17.100> things<00:03:17.250> was<00:03:17.790> very<00:03:18.060> quick<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.600> have<00:03:18.720> no

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
and things was very quick and I have no

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.570 
and things was very quick and I have no
complaints<00:03:19.410> about<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.620> system<00:03:20.100> performance

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
complaints about the system performance

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.150 
complaints about the system performance
so<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.209> model<00:03:21.450> has<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.900> 1440<00:03:22.709> by<00:03:22.739> 900

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
so this model has the 1440 by 900

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.100 
so this model has the 1440 by 900
display<00:03:23.820> so<00:03:23.880> obviously<00:03:24.480> it's<00:03:24.600> not<00:03:24.690> retina

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
display so obviously it's not retina

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.020 
display so obviously it's not retina
standard<00:03:25.500> but<00:03:25.920> still<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.250> perfectly<00:03:26.760> usable

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
standard but still a perfectly usable

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.090 
standard but still a perfectly usable
resolution<00:03:27.600> for<00:03:27.750> everyday<00:03:28.050> stuff<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:28.980> they

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
resolution for everyday stuff and they

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.680 
resolution for everyday stuff and they
also<00:03:29.220> found<00:03:29.489> out<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.730> cool<00:03:29.940> accuracy<00:03:30.480> is

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
also found out the cool accuracy is

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.930 
also found out the cool accuracy is
pretty<00:03:30.870> decent<00:03:31.170> on<00:03:31.470> this<00:03:31.650> monitor<00:03:31.950> so<00:03:32.670> very

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
pretty decent on this monitor so very

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.520 
pretty decent on this monitor so very
good<00:03:33.150> for<00:03:33.360> doing<00:03:33.480> video<00:03:33.660> work<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.230> photo

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
good for doing video work and photo

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.199 
good for doing video work and photo
editing<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.310> only<00:03:35.519> complaint<00:03:35.940> I<00:03:36.060> have

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
editing so the only complaint I have

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.910 
editing so the only complaint I have
about<00:03:36.390> the<00:03:36.570> display<00:03:36.959> is<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.200> viewing<00:03:37.590> angles

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
about the display is the viewing angles

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.920 
about the display is the viewing angles
the<00:03:38.370> not<00:03:38.580> brilliant<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.239> farmer<00:03:39.570> suffer

just<00:03:40.080> in<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.350> display<00:03:40.739> quite<00:03:41.040> a<00:03:41.070> lot<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:41.430> I

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
just in the display quite a lot so I

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.979 
just in the display quite a lot so I
could<00:03:41.610> actually<00:03:41.910> clearly<00:03:42.239> see<00:03:42.510> what<00:03:42.750> was<00:03:42.870> on

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
could actually clearly see what was on

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.780 
could actually clearly see what was on
the<00:03:43.110> screen<00:03:43.320> so<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:43.680> wanted<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:44.040> give<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.340> special

mention<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.299> the<00:03:45.420> trackpad<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:46.049> really<00:03:46.380> do<00:03:46.530> love

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
mention to the trackpad I really do love

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.229 
mention to the trackpad I really do love
using<00:03:46.980> this<00:03:47.190> trap<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:47.549> it's<00:03:47.730> very<00:03:47.910> easy<00:03:47.970> to

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
using this trap and it's very easy to

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.449 
using this trap and it's very easy to
use<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:49.019> actually<00:03:49.200> found<00:03:49.590> myself<00:03:49.830> using<00:03:50.370> the

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
use and actually found myself using the

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.310 
use and actually found myself using the
trackpad<00:03:50.730> quite<00:03:51.150> often<00:03:51.360> and<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.870> only<00:03:52.080> time<00:03:52.290> I

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
trackpad quite often and the only time I

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.320 
trackpad quite often and the only time I
felt<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.860> need<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.190> use<00:03:53.310> a<00:03:53.340> mouse<00:03:53.580> was<00:03:54.120> when<00:03:54.239> I

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
felt the need to use a mouse was when I

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.759 
felt the need to use a mouse was when I
was<00:03:54.420> doing<00:03:54.510> some<00:03:54.660> precision<00:03:55.200> work<00:03:55.350> such<00:03:55.620> as

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
was doing some precision work such as

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.860 
was doing some precision work such as
photo<00:03:56.010> editing<00:03:56.430> or<00:03:56.580> video<00:03:56.700> editing<00:03:57.150> so<00:03:57.720> yeah

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
photo editing or video editing so yeah

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.900 
photo editing or video editing so yeah
also<00:03:58.110> supports<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.920> multi-touch<00:03:59.370> gestures

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
also supports the multi-touch gestures

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.090 
also supports the multi-touch gestures
which<00:04:00.750> are<00:04:00.989> compatible<00:04:01.380> with<00:04:01.560> line<00:04:01.860> and

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
which are compatible with line and

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.830 
which are compatible with line and
mountain<00:04:02.459> line<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:03.209> they're<00:04:03.360> really<00:04:03.660> great

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
mountain line and they're really great

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.570 
mountain line and they're really great
is<00:04:04.049> really<00:04:04.260> responsive<00:04:04.950> on<00:04:05.040> this<00:04:05.160> trackpad

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
is really responsive on this trackpad

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.770 
is really responsive on this trackpad
and<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:05.850> makes<00:04:06.060> getting<00:04:06.330> around<00:04:06.450> the

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
and it makes getting around the

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.810 
and it makes getting around the
operating<00:04:07.110> system<00:04:07.560> that<00:04:08.040> much<00:04:08.220> more<00:04:08.430> fluid

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
operating system that much more fluid

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.699 
operating system that much more fluid
and<00:04:08.970> quicker<00:04:09.540> there's<00:04:10.290> quite<00:04:10.470> a<00:04:10.500> lot<00:04:10.680> of

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
and quicker there's quite a lot of

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.440 
and quicker there's quite a lot of
different<00:04:11.100> gestures<00:04:11.580> to<00:04:11.760> do<00:04:11.910> on<00:04:12.090> this<00:04:12.209> Mac

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
different gestures to do on this Mac

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.729 
different gestures to do on this Mac
which<00:04:12.690> once<00:04:12.900> you<00:04:12.989> get<00:04:13.170> used<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.440> them<00:04:13.560> is

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
which once you get used to them is

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.590 
which once you get used to them is
actually<00:04:14.220> quite<00:04:14.549> easy<00:04:14.580> to<00:04:14.880> remember<00:04:15.180> them<00:04:15.450> and

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
actually quite easy to remember them and

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.150 
actually quite easy to remember them and
get<00:04:15.720> around<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:16.019> operating<00:04:16.260> system<00:04:16.680> but<00:04:17.070> of

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
get around the operating system but of

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.349 
get around the operating system but of
course<00:04:17.370> all<00:04:17.609> these<00:04:17.760> gestures<00:04:18.030> can<00:04:18.209> be

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
course all these gestures can be

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.690 
course all these gestures can be
completely<00:04:18.870> customized<00:04:19.470> in<00:04:19.709> these<00:04:20.310> settings

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
completely customized in these settings

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.120 
completely customized in these settings
so<00:04:21.359> one<00:04:21.510> new<00:04:21.720> addition<00:04:21.840> to<00:04:22.260> Mountain<00:04:22.680> Lion<00:04:22.830> is

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
so one new addition to Mountain Lion is

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.460 
so one new addition to Mountain Lion is

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
more on the new Retina MacBook Pro it's

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.760 
more on the new Retina MacBook Pro it's
about<00:04:44.400> 300<00:04:44.970> pounds<00:04:45.120> more<00:04:45.510> here<00:04:45.810> in<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:46.050> UK<00:04:46.500> and

for that you get faster flash storage
you<00:04:49.320> get<00:04:49.500> more<00:04:49.680> RAM<00:04:49.980> and<00:04:50.250> you<00:04:50.310> also<00:04:50.460> get<00:04:50.790> a
