00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello there are ideas for you again 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.319
 the editorial 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.890
 I wish you much fun 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.890
 look at 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.139
 I'll show you today like cloud right 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.580
 I work at Luqing 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.519
 I have posted so 17 people 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:27.029
 and taken on the needle how to do it 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.920
 show you in another video in 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:35.750
 my channel under stop at new king 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:39.090
 And now you first pull these helps 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.360
 through to all stitches on the needle 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.989
 lie 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.940
 until all the stitches are on the paths 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.469
 and now you start with a series 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.989
 left mesh 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.899
 because yes, some are missing here too 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.969
 already on the left , the right-hand stitch looks like 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.140
 then be on top of that 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:05.040
 On the back you will find a sting from the right 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.780
 and sees the thread behind 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:13.020
 as he pierced the right from the right 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.799
 thread forward and backward 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.799
 pull through 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.710
 so give the left in the 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.660
 principle also like knitting 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:57.450
 one has only the possibility here 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:57.450
 with the have the thread better to grasp 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:28.480
 and also the last team left 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:35.560
 knit the thread first 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:39.370
 pull through and tighten again so 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:46.810
 that the mesh back on the paths 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:51.610
 lie in the sufficient now also the 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:55.320
 edge stitch right stretch a sting 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.320
 to get the thread 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.520
 it is important that the thread of so 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.720
 down does not bring to pick but always 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.720
 come from below 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:36.460
 then pull out the auxiliary thread again 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:39.150
 and the stitches again on the paths 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.150
 lay 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:44.370
 Now the left ones are on the back 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.370
 line 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:25.460
 more techniques to this further 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:29.000
 You can find samples of this technique in 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:33.460
 my channel or in the book hitler 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.460
 greeting looking release date october 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.460
 2013 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:29.650
 You can already see that here 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:36.310
 Most of every second row left slightly 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:39.409
 slightly panned in the picture appear 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:43.870
 If you do not want to do that, there are still some 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.870
 another video in our channel 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:51.229
 then you have to do the left something 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.030
 work more complicated but I like it 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:58.729
 that with this mesh image actually 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:06:11.090
 That's why I wanted you to do that 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:12.949
 also show again on the left you can see 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.520
 So here you are also pretty fast 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:15.520
 Ahead 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.680
 and I still think it's totally 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:26.280
 exciting that one here through this 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:29.030
 Technique a knitted mesh picture 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.030
 can generate 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.520
 I wish you much fun with it
