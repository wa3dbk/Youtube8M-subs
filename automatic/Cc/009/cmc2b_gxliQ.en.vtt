because they thought that Doritos needed

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.980 
because they thought that Doritos needed
to<00:00:28.680> be<00:00:28.890> more<00:00:29.279> huffy<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.029> full<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.330> air<00:00:30.539> all

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
right so those things went away but now

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.400 
right so those things went away but now
they're<00:00:32.460> reimagining<00:00:33.239> them<00:00:33.420> by<00:00:33.899> taking<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
they're reimagining them by taking the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.610 
they're reimagining them by taking the
Doritos<00:00:34.829> 3ds<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.960> getting<00:00:36.960> rid<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.260> an

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
Doritos 3ds and getting rid of that an

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.810 
Doritos 3ds and getting rid of that an
apostrophe<00:00:38.160> cuz<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.489> doesn't<00:00:38.730> actually

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
apostrophe cuz that doesn't actually

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.090 
apostrophe cuz that doesn't actually
belong<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:40.290> think<00:00:40.500> it's<00:00:40.590> not<00:00:40.680> possessive

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
belong and I think it's not possessive

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.119 
belong and I think it's not possessive
it's<00:00:41.250> not<00:00:41.399> 3ds<00:00:42.090> it's<00:00:42.570> not<00:00:42.660> owned<00:00:42.870> by<00:00:43.050> 3d<00:00:43.590> its

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
dimension so they're already 3d but now

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.160 
dimension so they're already 3d but now
instead<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.710> being<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.430> pillow<00:01:03.420> puff<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
instead of being a pillow puff of a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.260 
instead of being a pillow puff of a
function<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.619> 3d<00:01:04.949> Dorito<00:01:05.400> now<00:01:05.850> it's<00:01:06.060> more<00:01:06.240> of

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
function in 3d Dorito now it's more of

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.510 
function in 3d Dorito now it's more of
like<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.540> like<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.320> blueprint<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.010> Dorito<00:01:08.310> that

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
looks like it has sound structural

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.570 
looks like it has sound structural
integrity

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
integrity

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.179

on the plus side they stay intact in the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.370 
on the plus side they stay intact in the

crunchy

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
crunchy

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.590 
crunchy
the<00:01:34.020> downside<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.470> unfortunately<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:36.390> they

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the downside is unfortunately that they

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.600 
the downside is unfortunately that they
don't<00:01:36.840> taste<00:01:37.140> good<00:01:37.290> they<00:01:38.070> said<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.460> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
don't taste good they said that the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.800 
don't taste good they said that the
pepper<00:01:38.880> jack<00:01:39.090> flavor<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.600> sort<00:01:39.780> of

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
pepper jack flavor is sort of

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.590 
pepper jack flavor is sort of
non-existent<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:41.070> it's<00:01:41.189> basically<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.670> crunchy

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
non-existent so it's basically a crunchy
