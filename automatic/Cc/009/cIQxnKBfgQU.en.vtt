00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.170

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.990
 the family and with the people of my 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:27.070
 trust and good the truth that 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.140
 happy to be here good and already 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.450
 doing the medical exams and good and 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.500
 really wanting to start now 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.490
 train me and with great enthusiasm not 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.340
 that were this reason for tomorrow 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.200
 it's not blue cross is a big club mexico 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.140
 who always fight for goals 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.560
 important and that is also known to 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.010
 level at the international level 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.860
 plus the call of the leadership of the 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.230
 own technician I think that all that to a 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.230
 player motivates him not 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:15.060
 and good of features a player of 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.009
 power that always tries to be close 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.490
 of the goal and convert goals and make goals 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.759
 and what good and what is sacrificed for the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.590
 team until the last minute I'm going to 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.229
 give everything for the team you can leave 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.960
 good or bad things but the sacrifice 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.960
 I always always will 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.190
 talk about what other teams have 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.410
 participated in debut in the year 2000 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.890
 students the silver when I was 18 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.420
 years until 2007 I was a 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.710
 student 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.409
 where I was a canterano from there after 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.960
 2007 I bought the real Betis football 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.409
 where where I was three years until the 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.810
 2010 what good happened to loan 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.909
 above 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:10.330
 until 2011 1 2010 2011 and then there 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.849
 my power remained with my passion and I go to a 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.980
 year to loan to lanús that good was the 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.980
 previous club to come here cross blue 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:25.680
 renowned knows what it means to study 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:30.060
 even blue for mexico 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.670
 it's obvious a good one already knows it 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.120
 that one at the international level 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.650
 that already finalizes the liberators and 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.260
 well you have to always fight the 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.010
 championship out there now they're going to 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.189
 age 15 if I remember 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.639

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:50.400

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.769
 international 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.900
 why also what he said 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.629
 previously the idea of ​​calling in a 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.090
 important team mexico always for 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.530

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.470
 year grows 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.280
 and good is is important is a step 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.280
 cute my career 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:20.240
 if you have the giménez chaco we agree 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.310
 in the basic strength of mouth 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.410
 and well there we were for two years 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.330
 it's a category one year bigger than 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.930
 me but good live 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.410

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:38.560
 amaranth to face in the mouth 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.560
 students and athletic betis madrid 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.650
 generation 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:53.959
 between sergeants be 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:56.580
 I was born there, well, I was raised between 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.260
 I played football in my grandfather's bar 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.900
 with my cousin josé basata that is 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.280
 playing now in striped monterrey and 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.800
 after good between a little school of 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.870
 soccer girls with carmen de areco up 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.230
 good until you reach 11 years there 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.200
 between 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.209
 in shoots join the basic forces 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.940
 then good to be two years in the mouth 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.280
 juniors who did not know Cristian there 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.889
 and then good to call on the student 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.489
 of silver is my debut in the first 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.489
 I mentioned 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.949
 face this settlement 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.260
 the truth is a great player has 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:38.880
 touched the axes but it's not a 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:41.910
 good brand player of very strong in 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.700
 the fast hand to hand that goes too 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.370
 well above the truth is a player 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.620
 Good thing, it was not for many years 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.620
 in Europe they play Colombian national team 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.710
 and I think it's not going to be good because 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:59.030
 good has experience is a player a 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:02.569
 important player so the truth that 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:05.479
 congratulations for having it as a companion 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:09.100
 you think there is a big 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:11.000
 which is coming 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.130
 then it seems 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.620
 I think that the difference in 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.050
 argentina maybe the matches to 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.560
 times they become more locked 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:24.139
 and a lot of physical friction, although not all 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.569
 the leagues and but good in Argentina for 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:30.379
 there and today maybe there's no 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:33.979
 so many matches where maybe you 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:36.110
 there may be then if you call it good 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:39.110
 football but they are made to match very hard 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.780
 very stuck and here so I could see 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.169
 so my cousin told me 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:48.289
 christian how good it is to play 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:50.660
 more to come out playing more from below not 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.730
 we play by hitting the ball 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.470
 and provide a little more show for 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.710
 that the parties out there end up 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.270
 times with many goals from both sides 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.310
 out there a little the difference but good 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.920
 the argentine league is also a league 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.500
 League very strong as it is 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.810
 doing the Mexican so it's obvious that 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.200
 there was going to be an adaptation but 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:15.630
 they are very competitive leagues 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:20.550
 the mexican sense fan 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:23.040
 it's like you know you know what the 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:29.040
 council session so I have been 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:30.940
 I had no chance to see her 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.910
 personally not because it has not touched me 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.669
 face it but but it is very 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:39.570
 follower that good warms up your team 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:42.009
 and good also with desire to power 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:45.750
 enjoy it with your ante not that it's going to 

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:45.750
 be when the black starts 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:53.259
 what it is that I am very happy 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.030
 be in the club to defend these 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.979
 colors and how nice that I'm going to give 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:07:00.400
 everything to contribute my bit 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:02.380
 so that the blue cross is the highest 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:04.660
 I do not think there's a good group and a good 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.300
 campus and I think that we can all 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.220
 we can get to that blue cross 

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.040
 can be at the top of football 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:14.280
 Mexican 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.360
 thank you then welcome to this your house 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.979
