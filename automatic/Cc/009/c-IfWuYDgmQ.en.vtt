every<00:00:39.360> hard<00:00:39.570> every<00:00:39.840> energy<00:00:39.989> tank<00:00:40.670> everything

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
every hard every energy tank everything

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.630 
every hard every energy tank everything
we<00:00:42.690> weapon<00:00:43.140> all<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.629> and<00:00:46.370> make<00:00:47.370> sure<00:00:47.399> your

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
energy tanks are full and then come back

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.750 
energy tanks are full and then come back
to<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.719> stage<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.399> you're<00:00:53.399> going<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.610> do

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
to this stage and you're going to do

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.779 
to this stage and you're going to do
something<00:00:54.000> extremely<00:00:54.570> monotonous<00:00:55.170> but<00:00:55.789> you

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
something extremely monotonous but you

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:07.280 
something extremely monotonous but you
will<00:00:56.969> appreciate<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.840> when<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.140> get<00:00:58.260> it

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.470 

and<00:01:07.440> this<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.490> kind<00:01:08.730> of<00:01:08.790> further<00:01:09.090> proof

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.480 
and this is just kind of further proof

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.450 
and this is just kind of further proof
that<00:01:09.510> all<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.530> weapons<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:10.980> this<00:01:11.070> game<00:01:11.280> for

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
that all the weapons in this game for

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.690 
that all the weapons in this game for
the<00:01:11.520> most<00:01:11.730> part<00:01:11.940> in<00:01:12.330> some<00:01:13.230> form<00:01:13.590> or<00:01:13.800> other<00:01:13.980> very

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the most part in some form or other very

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.490 
the most part in some form or other very
useful<00:01:15.180> as<00:01:15.360> regular<00:01:15.960> weapons<00:01:18.050> never<00:01:19.050> total

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
useful as regular weapons never total

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.370 
useful as regular weapons never total
replacement<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:20.190> your<00:01:20.600> Mega<00:01:21.600> Buster<00:01:21.810> but

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
replacement for your Mega Buster but

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.300 
replacement for your Mega Buster but
certainly<00:01:23.100> make<00:01:24.380> parts<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.530> levels<00:01:25.830> go<00:01:25.950> that

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
certainly make parts of levels go that

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.090 
certainly make parts of levels go that
much<00:01:26.460> faster

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.469 

and<00:01:31.100> this<00:01:31.310> guy<00:01:31.460> is<00:01:31.490> just<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.790> fucking<00:01:32.180> but<00:01:32.330> any

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
and this guy is just a fucking but any

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.719 
and this guy is just a fucking but any
big<00:01:32.960> ass<00:01:33.170> enemy<00:01:33.560> can<00:01:33.770> actually<00:01:34.250> be<00:01:34.400> more

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
big ass enemy can actually be more

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.600 
big ass enemy can actually be more
easily<00:01:35.060> taken<00:01:35.420> out<00:01:35.570> by<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:35.810> flame<00:01:36.140> thing<00:01:36.610> but

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
easily taken out by the flame thing but

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.520 
easily taken out by the flame thing but
i<00:01:37.850> believe<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.450> flamethrower<00:01:38.990> takes<00:01:39.290> a<00:01:39.380> bit

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
i believe the flamethrower takes a bit

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.440 
i believe the flamethrower takes a bit
more<00:01:39.560> energy<00:01:40.040> than<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:40.340> storm<00:01:40.759> eagles<00:01:41.090> weapon

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
more energy than the storm eagles weapon

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.310 
more energy than the storm eagles weapon
so<00:01:41.780> it's<00:01:42.649> kind<00:01:42.799> of<00:01:42.860> a<00:01:43.030> whichever<00:01:44.030> one<00:01:44.320> you

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
so it's kind of a whichever one you

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.700 
so it's kind of a whichever one you
would<00:01:45.470> prefer<00:01:46.450> now<00:01:47.450> here's<00:01:47.720> where<00:01:47.960> you<00:01:48.560> need

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
would prefer now here's where you need

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.080 
would prefer now here's where you need
to<00:01:48.799> pay<00:01:48.890> attention<00:01:51.070> when<00:01:52.070> you<00:01:52.159> come<00:01:52.369> here<00:01:52.610> make

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090
