craft a combination of the three basic

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.140 
craft a combination of the three basic
tools<00:00:15.930> which<00:00:16.590> would<00:00:16.710> be<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.070> shovel<00:00:17.610> pig<00:00:17.940> ex

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
tools which would be the shovel pig ex

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.120 
tools which would be the shovel pig ex
and<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.570> X<00:00:18.619> let's<00:00:19.619> go<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:19.830> get<00:00:19.890> into<00:00:20.010> these

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
and the X let's go and get into these

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.130 
and the X let's go and get into these
categories<00:00:20.460> um<00:00:20.940> there's<00:00:21.810> four<00:00:22.110> different

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
categories um there's four different

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.050 
categories um there's four different
ones<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.590> can<00:00:22.740> graph<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.279> basically<00:00:23.670> just<00:00:23.849> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
ones you can graph I basically just the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.080 
ones you can graph I basically just the
combination<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.779> these<00:00:25.320> three<00:00:25.380> tool<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.160> first

an axe all combined which basically just
makes<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.739> really<00:00:56.129> awesome<00:00:56.370> tool<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.030> with

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
makes a really awesome tool so with

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.560 
makes a really awesome tool so with
these<00:00:57.840> tools<00:00:58.140> on<00:00:58.879> there<00:00:59.879> just<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.239> basic

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
these tools on there just the basic

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.990 
these tools on there just the basic
tools<00:01:00.719> just<00:01:00.989> have<00:01:01.170> combined<00:01:01.730> with<00:01:02.730> each<00:01:02.850> other

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
tools just have combined with each other

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.310 
tools just have combined with each other
so<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.359> way<00:01:03.480> they<00:01:03.660> don't<00:01:03.719> take<00:01:03.960> up<00:01:03.989> as<00:01:04.260> much

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
so this way they don't take up as much

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.570 
so this way they don't take up as much
room<00:01:04.590> in<00:01:05.100> your<00:01:06.230> inventory<00:01:07.230> else<00:01:07.980> you<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.370> just

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
room in your inventory else you can just

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.240 
room in your inventory else you can just

say i'll use the what's it called the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.899 
say i'll use the what's it called the
shacks<00:01:13.200> i<00:01:13.470> believe<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.549> can<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:14.790> with

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.539 
corresponding materials but I mean I'm
just<00:01:48.750> using<00:01:48.899> diamonds<00:01:49.469> for<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.680> example<00:01:50.369> of

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
just using diamonds for the example of

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.730 
just using diamonds for the example of
this<00:01:50.700> video<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.840> isn't<00:01:52.079> long<00:01:52.229> guys<00:01:52.439> pretty

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
this video this isn't long guys pretty

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.380 
this video this isn't long guys pretty
simple<00:01:53.130> there's<00:01:53.250> not<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> whole<00:01:53.640> lot<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.090> I

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
simple there's not a whole lot to it I

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.690 
simple there's not a whole lot to it I
mean<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:55.049> basic<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.770> mean<00:01:55.920> with<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.490> can

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
mean it's basic I mean with it can

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.550
