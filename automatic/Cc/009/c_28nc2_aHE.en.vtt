00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.880
 hello classmates let's find what is 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.320
 the jetpack is said that in this game there 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.660
 appears and this can be our map 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.580
 well I do not know that it is really no no what 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.699
 I understand I found it I had not 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.349
 seen in other videos but I did not understand 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.880
 there are three symbols on this end and 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.349
 third in particular is one of those that I 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.039
 it draws attention where a 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:28.319
 subject with something with an artifact that 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.649
 fly club for me it seems it could be the 

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.649
 jetpack 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:40.530
 it's practically a myth maybe in a 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.370
 time may the rockstar put what is 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.899
 the jet paq but right now it is not said 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.360
 right now they say a lot of things that 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.450
 they were going in a while going to put one 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.250
 a patch for the jetpack to exist 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:01:00.920
 but right now it's a myth this image is 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.070
 I do not know if it would reveal what the 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.590
 location of the jet paq to me it seems 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.259
 what 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.390
 Well, possibly there will be a 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.990
 jetpack but not at that time 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.859
 or not in the game at this time 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.480
 possibly in a good a patch that 

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:21.780
 come included later 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.000
 but I would like 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.670
 know what you think about this 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.590
 discovery about what the jet is 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.780
 if you have already found it 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.780
 seen enough 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.690
 enough videos 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.140
 and they have not found it I guess I do not 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.140
 there must be 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.060
 good friends I'll leave here the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.370
 mystery number 1 from 7 to 5 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:53.030
 I will continue to rise more more mysteries 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.610
 If you liked leave your comments your 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:01.450
 like and see you next time 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.450
 I'm 23 in 91 and I'll see you for the next
