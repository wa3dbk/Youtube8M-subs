00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
let's say this one took kind of a while

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.310 
let's say this one took kind of a while
but<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.000> was<00:01:00.120> all<00:01:00.270> worth<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:00.989> I'm<00:01:01.170> going<00:01:01.289> to

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
but it was all worth it so I'm going to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.500 
but it was all worth it so I'm going to
say<00:01:01.469> about<00:01:01.559> 20<00:01:01.920> minutes<00:01:02.219> or<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.300> throw

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
say about 20 minutes or so and the throw

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.630 
say about 20 minutes or so and the throw
kicked<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.870> shortly<00:01:04.439> after<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.339> everything

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
kicked in shortly after so everything

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.800 
kicked in shortly after so everything
kind<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.820> fell<00:01:05.970> together<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.479> kicked<00:01:06.659> into

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
kind of fell together and kicked into

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.050 
kind of fell together and kicked into
gear<00:01:06.869> first<00:01:07.680> day<00:01:07.890> for<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:08.430> I'm<00:01:08.820> going<00:01:08.939> to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
gear first day for this one I'm going to

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.270 
gear first day for this one I'm going to
say<00:01:09.270> let's<00:01:09.869> just<00:01:10.020> give<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.200> 40<00:01:10.799> minutes<00:01:11.070> top

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
say let's just give it 40 minutes top

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.270 
say let's just give it 40 minutes top
for<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.939> complete<00:01:12.299> full<00:01:12.540> effect<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:14.100> wicks

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
for the complete full effect the wicks

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.820 
for the complete full effect the wicks
have<00:01:14.460> formed<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.760> mushroom<00:01:15.060> top<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:16.470> you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
have formed a mushroom top and as you

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.310 
have formed a mushroom top and as you
can<00:01:16.979> see<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.400> wick<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.970> little<00:01:18.750> ball<00:01:19.170> of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
can see on that wick a little ball of

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.859 
can see on that wick a little ball of
set<00:01:19.530> that's<00:01:20.250> basically<00:01:20.540> what<00:01:21.540> we<00:01:21.630> call<00:01:21.840> a

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
set that's basically what we call a

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.600 
set that's basically what we call a
mushroom<00:01:22.229> top<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.680> always<00:01:22.979> helps<00:01:23.369> to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
mushroom top and that always helps to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.679 
mushroom top and that always helps to
ensure<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> flames<00:01:24.330> are<00:01:24.390> going<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.600> get

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
ensure that the flames are going to get

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.990 
ensure that the flames are going to get
a<00:01:24.720> lot<00:01:24.930> bigger<00:01:25.140> thicker<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.130> wider<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.490> you

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
a lot bigger thicker and wider is you

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.480 
a lot bigger thicker and wider is you
see<00:01:27.180> right<00:01:27.360> there<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.890> it<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:29.100> melts<00:01:29.369> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
see right there and it just melts the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.510 
see right there and it just melts the
wax<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:30.030> lot<00:01:30.659> more<00:01:31.079> smoothly<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.979> consistently

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
wax a lot more smoothly and consistently

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.660 
wax a lot more smoothly and consistently
giving<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.329> better<00:01:33.509> burn<00:01:34.250> my<00:01:35.250> theory<00:01:35.640> about

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
giving you a better burn my theory about

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.370 
giving you a better burn my theory about
the<00:01:35.909> throw<00:01:36.240> has<00:01:36.450> kind<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.780> gone<00:01:36.930> out<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
the throw has kind of gone out of the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.660 
the throw has kind of gone out of the
window<00:01:37.409> so<00:01:37.920> I'm<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.070> going<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.250> say<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.430> gives

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
window so I'm just going to say it gives

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.289 
window so I'm just going to say it gives
you<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.820> better<00:01:39.000> burn<00:01:39.299> every<00:01:39.720> single<00:01:40.020> time<00:01:40.200> so

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
you a better burn every single time so

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.410 
you a better burn every single time so
pretty<00:01:42.299> much<00:01:42.560> repeat<00:01:43.560> step<00:01:43.920> day<00:01:44.759> one<00:01:45.000> repeats

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
pretty much repeat step day one repeats

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.800 
pretty much repeat step day one repeats
on<00:01:45.750> day<00:01:46.380> two<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.740> three<00:01:47.090> flawless<00:01:48.090> consistent

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
on day two and three flawless consistent

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.230 
on day two and three flawless consistent

a-- cream but mostly like a sweet cream
note<00:03:19.319> with<00:03:20.040> like<00:03:20.250> kind<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.269> like<00:03:21.389> a<00:03:21.419> white

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720

chocolate<00:03:22.049> as<00:03:22.290> well<00:03:22.319> too<00:03:22.620> but<00:03:23.220> for<00:03:23.819> the<00:03:23.879> most

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
chocolate as well too but for the most

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.409 
chocolate as well too but for the most
part<00:03:24.120> it's<00:03:24.389> the<00:03:24.449> same<00:03:24.659> set<00:03:24.900> but<00:03:25.229> i<00:03:26.299> think<00:03:27.299> i

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
part it's the same set but i think i

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:28.969 
part it's the same set but i think i
would<00:03:27.569> go<00:03:27.690> with<00:03:27.720> this<00:03:27.989> one<00:03:28.049> because<00:03:28.319> i<00:03:28.530> like

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
the wicks a lot better than the other

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.129 
the wicks a lot better than the other
one<00:03:30.959> but<00:03:31.169> you<00:03:31.440> know<00:03:31.560> that's<00:03:32.099> then<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:32.790> is<00:03:32.909> now

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
one but you know that's then this is now

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.180 
one but you know that's then this is now
so<00:03:34.139> that's<00:03:34.349> pretty<00:03:34.530> much<00:03:34.620> all<00:03:34.859> i<00:03:34.919> have<00:03:35.069> to<00:03:35.099> say
