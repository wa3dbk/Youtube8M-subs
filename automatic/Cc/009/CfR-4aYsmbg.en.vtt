00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.750
 a nativity hello, I'm all skillful 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.240
 panasonic and we are here in Havana 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.300
 100,000 convention 2014 and I wanted you 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.790
 teach this new camera the 850 w that 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.680
 presents a very peculiar possibility 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.330
 what is the double camera 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.400
 actually as you see here I am 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.200
 recording abel because it is here already 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.020
 myself at the same time with a second camera 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.850
 the main camera is here and 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.780
 a secondary camera is simply 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.030
 published where the screen then 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.800
 This allows me, for example, to be 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.530
 recording myself and at the same time 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.960
 we are recording to belen allows to be 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.150
 recording for example a show and the 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.270
 person who would be next in this case 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.250
 or allows to be recording in wide angle 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:58.270
 with the small screen and for example 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.910
 zoom with the main camera 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.460
 then this function is very comfortable and 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.950
 I can move to my pleasure consider 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.340
 simply the double camera function 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.710
 whenever you want 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.049
 this camera apart from this very function 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.170
 novel and very interesting is a great 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:18.890
 camera incorporates a b6 sensor and a new 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.929
 processor and also incorporates a 50 x 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.700
 zoom to finish something that is very 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:24.799
 important when one uses the 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.860
 camcorder is the sound system here 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.659
 this is why it incorporates a very 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.600
 powerful that avoids all the 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.159
 wind noises or parasitic noises 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.810
 when I'm recording a video 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.149
 to finish we also have the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.069
 wifi functionality that allows us to be 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.990
 connected for example with that is 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:43.909
 happening in our house we leave the 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.619
 camera here and I with the smartphone can 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.959
 see what is being recorded I can 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.789
 use to monitor your baby or to 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:53.560
 many other functions like share 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:53.560
 my live images thanks
