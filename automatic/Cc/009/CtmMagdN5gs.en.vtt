why I'm saying people probably hate on
me<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.299> still<00:01:18.750> think<00:01:19.080> Treyarch<00:01:19.860> should<00:01:20.310> think

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
me I still think Treyarch should think

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.100 
me I still think Treyarch should think
of<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.759> concepts<00:01:21.450> for<00:01:21.600> all<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.930> games

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
of the concepts for all the games

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.690 
of the concepts for all the games
because<00:01:22.560> they<00:01:22.650> make<00:01:22.830> much<00:01:23.040> more<00:01:23.070> balanced

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
because they make much more balanced

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.760 
because they make much more balanced
call<00:01:23.939> duty<00:01:24.119> games<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:24.840> let<00:01:24.990> Infinity<00:01:25.500> Ward

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
call duty games but let Infinity Ward

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.070 
call duty games but let Infinity Ward
actually<00:01:26.520> make<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.330> game<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.720> think<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:28.020> should

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
actually make the game I think I should

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.410 
actually make the game I think I should
work<00:01:28.380> together<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.979> way<00:01:29.159> because<00:01:29.820> treyarch

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
work together that way because treyarch

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.450 
work together that way because treyarch

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
was a great game and rolled out war was

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.950 
was a great game and rolled out war was
a<00:04:44.760> decent<00:04:45.180> game<00:04:45.270> because<00:04:45.600> they<00:04:45.690> didn't<00:04:45.930> have

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
a decent game because they didn't have

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.110 
a decent game because they didn't have
any<00:04:46.170> overpowered<00:04:46.890> kill<00:04:47.070> streaks<00:04:47.370> I<00:04:47.550> mean<00:04:48.030> if

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
any overpowered kill streaks I mean if

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.520 
any overpowered kill streaks I mean if
any<00:04:48.330> waters<00:04:48.600> trying<00:04:48.870> to<00:04:48.990> think<00:04:49.140> of<00:04:49.230> that<00:04:49.350> new

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
any waters trying to think of that new

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.930 
any waters trying to think of that new
thing<00:04:49.740> of<00:04:49.860> having<00:04:50.070> like<00:04:50.190> an<00:04:50.250> assault<00:04:50.640> kill

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
thing of having like an assault kill

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.520 
thing of having like an assault kill
streak<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.630> all<00:04:51.720> that<00:04:51.900> with<00:04:52.050> different<00:04:52.440> types

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
streak and all that with different types

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.500 
streak and all that with different types
so<00:04:52.830> you<00:04:52.890> catch<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.610> ultimate<00:04:54.060> spawn<00:04:54.330> right

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
so you catch the ultimate spawn right

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.060 
so you catch the ultimate spawn right
but<00:04:54.660> I<00:04:54.810> guess<00:04:55.140> that's<00:04:55.170> going<00:04:55.620> to<00:04:55.680> be<00:04:55.770> a<00:04:55.800> little

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
but I guess that's going to be a little

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.880 
but I guess that's going to be a little
bit<00:04:56.190> okay<00:04:56.670> but<00:04:57.420> it's<00:04:57.570> always<00:04:57.960> just<00:04:58.260> too<00:04:58.710> many

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
bit okay but it's always just too many

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.010 
bit okay but it's always just too many
attachments<00:04:59.280> too<00:05:00.120> much<00:05:00.270> bullshit<00:05:00.870> in<00:05:00.960> the

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
attachments too much bullshit in the

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.230 
attachments too much bullshit in the
