basically the everything that the car

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:26.870 
basically the everything that the car

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
providers so that they can build

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.430 
providers so that they can build
services<00:00:56.329> one<00:00:57.329> example<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.929> that<00:00:57.989> would<00:00:58.320> be

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
services one example of that would be

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.660 
services one example of that would be
the<00:00:58.949> phenomenom<00:00:59.429> of<00:00:59.660> usage-based<00:01:00.660> insurance

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
the phenomenom of usage-based insurance

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.939 
the phenomenom of usage-based insurance
basically<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.850> pay<00:01:03.809> your<00:01:04.019> insurance<00:01:04.290> premium

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
depending on how you drive that is a set

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.469 
depending on how you drive that is a set
of<00:01:07.500> data<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.579> the<00:01:08.610> cloud<00:01:09.270> can

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
of data that that the the cloud can

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.910 
of data that that the the cloud can
extract<00:01:09.780> from<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.049> car<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.560> with<00:01:10.799> the

about<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.400> service<00:04:06.300> cloud<00:04:06.510> around<00:04:07.170> one<00:04:07.709> car

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
about the service cloud around one car

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.559 
about the service cloud around one car
what<00:04:08.489> if<00:04:08.640> you<00:04:08.819> know<00:04:08.910> when<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.239> starts<00:04:09.540> to

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
what if you know when that starts to

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.809 
what if you know when that starts to
interact<00:04:09.989> with<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.739> type<00:04:10.950> of<00:04:10.980> service<00:04:11.489> clouds

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
interact with the type of service clouds

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.820 
interact with the type of service clouds
that<00:04:12.030> are<00:04:12.090> coming<00:04:12.480> up<00:04:12.600> in<00:04:12.830> intelligent

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
that are coming up in intelligent

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.520 
that are coming up in intelligent
transport<00:04:14.280> or<00:04:14.549> or<00:04:14.790> or<00:04:14.819> road<00:04:15.239> safety<00:04:15.600> or<00:04:16.290> other

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
transport or or or road safety or other

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.710 
transport or or or road safety or other
car<00:04:16.919> manufacturers<00:04:17.430> doing<00:04:17.820> their<00:04:17.940> own<00:04:18.060> so

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
car manufacturers doing their own so

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.319 
car manufacturers doing their own so
obviously<00:04:19.290> there's<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.650> collaborative<00:04:20.329> aspect

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
obviously there's a collaborative aspect

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.450 
obviously there's a collaborative aspect
to<00:04:21.600> it<00:04:21.630> which<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:22.109> I<00:04:22.410> mean<00:04:22.590> inevitably<00:04:23.160> going

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
to it which you I mean inevitably going

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.060 
to it which you I mean inevitably going
to<00:04:23.550> come<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:24.389> hopefully<00:04:24.600> sooner<00:04:25.229> rather<00:04:25.410> than

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
to come and hopefully sooner rather than

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.690 
to come and hopefully sooner rather than
later<00:04:26.180> but<00:04:27.180> if<00:04:27.960> you<00:04:28.200> go<00:04:28.380> back<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:28.919> car<00:04:29.250> then

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
later but if you go back to the car then

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.370 
later but if you go back to the car then
there<00:04:30.120> is<00:04:31.010> maybe<00:04:32.010> nothing<00:04:32.760> from<00:04:33.300> erickson<00:04:33.870> but

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
there is maybe nothing from erickson but

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.610 
there is maybe nothing from erickson but
the<00:04:34.590> ericsson<00:04:35.070> is<00:04:35.630> somewhere<00:04:36.630> else<00:04:36.810> yes<00:04:37.350> and

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
the ericsson is somewhere else yes and

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.490 
the ericsson is somewhere else yes and
you<00:04:38.010> are<00:04:38.040> connected<00:04:38.880> first<00:04:39.450> to<00:04:39.660> ericsson<00:04:40.289> and

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
you are connected first to ericsson and

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.760 
you are connected first to ericsson and
after<00:04:40.919> that<00:04:41.070> so<00:04:41.729> I'm<00:04:41.820> other<00:04:41.970> places<00:04:42.450> yes<00:04:42.990> so

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
after that so I'm other places yes so

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.100 
after that so I'm other places yes so
you're<00:04:44.190> right<00:04:44.600> ericsson<00:04:45.600> is<00:04:45.630> everything

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
you're right ericsson is everything

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.630 
you're right ericsson is everything

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
manufactures I think that this is there

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:36.989 
manufactures I think that this is there
are<00:05:34.689> many<00:05:35.499> many<00:05:35.799> aspects<00:05:36.189> of<00:05:36.279> how<00:05:36.459> you<00:05:36.759> know

00:05:36.989 --> 00:05:36.999 
are many many aspects of how you know

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:39.779 
are many many aspects of how you know
where's<00:05:37.689> the<00:05:37.809> money<00:05:37.959> for<00:05:38.259> them<00:05:38.399> both<00:05:39.399> in<00:05:39.639> terms

where's the money for them both in terms
of<00:05:40.059> which<00:05:40.539> is<00:05:40.719> very<00:05:40.929> important<00:05:41.849> starting<00:05:42.849> to

00:06:27.329 --> 00:06:27.339 
many cars you can start to do this type

changing or i think is it's going to be
well<00:06:37.209> no<00:06:37.479> one<00:06:37.599> knows<00:06:37.749> but<00:06:38.079> with<00:06:38.319> the<00:06:38.409> one<00:06:38.559> thing

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:38.709 
well no one knows but with the one thing

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:41.309 
well no one knows but with the one thing
we<00:06:38.860> do<00:06:38.979> know<00:06:39.249> that<00:06:39.399> it<00:06:39.759> will<00:06:39.909> be<00:06:39.969> it<00:06:40.449> will<00:06:40.839> be<00:06:41.110> a

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:41.319 
we do know that it will be it will be a

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:42.989 
we do know that it will be it will be a
faster<00:06:41.769> development<00:06:41.979> to<00:06:42.369> more<00:06:42.549> than<00:06:42.579> today

00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:42.999 
faster development to more than today

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:45.329 
faster development to more than today
let<00:06:43.839> me<00:06:43.899> just<00:06:44.110> give<00:06:44.259> you<00:06:44.319> an<00:06:44.409> example<00:06:44.739> of<00:06:45.039> how

let me just give you an example of how

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:48.199 
let me just give you an example of how
you<00:06:45.549> can<00:06:45.759> use<00:06:45.909> these<00:06:46.539> concepts<00:06:47.110> to<00:06:47.529> innovate

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:48.209 
you can use these concepts to innovate

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:52.289 
you can use these concepts to innovate
one<00:06:49.209> thing<00:06:49.479> that<00:06:49.689> the<00:06:49.869> door<00:06:50.049> would<00:06:50.259> tried<00:06:51.299> this

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:52.299 
one thing that the door would tried this

00:06:52.299 --> 00:06:54.629 
one thing that the door would tried this
spring<00:06:52.659> was<00:06:53.019> just<00:06:53.259> to<00:06:53.379> say<00:06:53.499> that<00:06:53.709> what<00:06:53.889> if<00:06:54.039> we

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 
spring was just to say that what if we

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:56.669 
spring was just to say that what if we
could<00:06:54.789> combine<00:06:55.059> the<00:06:56.019> fact<00:06:56.289> that<00:06:56.379> you<00:06:56.529> can

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:56.679 
could combine the fact that you can

00:06:56.679 --> 00:06:58.049 
could combine the fact that you can
locate<00:06:56.859> your<00:06:57.159> car<00:06:57.369> you<00:06:57.519> can<00:06:57.669> actually<00:06:57.759> find

00:06:58.049 --> 00:06:58.059 
locate your car you can actually find

00:06:58.059 --> 00:06:59.549 
locate your car you can actually find
where<00:06:58.269> it<00:06:58.359> is<00:06:58.449> and<00:06:58.629> you<00:06:58.719> can<00:06:58.749> open<00:06:59.259> the<00:06:59.349> car

00:06:59.549 --> 00:06:59.559 
where it is and you can open the car

00:06:59.559 --> 00:07:02.549 
where it is and you can open the car
remotely<00:07:00.159> and<00:07:00.669> combine<00:07:01.449> that<00:07:01.479> with<00:07:01.839> someone

00:07:02.549 --> 00:07:02.559 
remotely and combine that with someone

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:05.309 
remotely and combine that with someone
who's<00:07:02.829> actually<00:07:02.979> distributing<00:07:03.909> goods<00:07:04.139> we<00:07:05.139> buy

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:05.319 
who's actually distributing goods we buy

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:06.809 
who's actually distributing goods we buy
something<00:07:05.649> on<00:07:05.739> the<00:07:05.859> internet<00:07:05.949> if<00:07:06.459> you<00:07:06.609> put

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:06.819 
something on the internet if you put

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:09.149 
something on the internet if you put
those<00:07:06.909> two<00:07:07.119> together<00:07:07.269> and<00:07:07.749> it<00:07:08.499> took<00:07:08.859> them<00:07:09.039> two

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:09.159 
those two together and it took them two

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:11.809 
those two together and it took them two
months<00:07:09.489> to<00:07:09.639> actually<00:07:09.729> do<00:07:10.029> that<00:07:10.239> mixture<00:07:11.169> on

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:11.819 
months to actually do that mixture on

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:14.609 
months to actually do that mixture on
the<00:07:12.819> cloud<00:07:13.119> and<00:07:13.389> it<00:07:13.509> means<00:07:13.749> now<00:07:14.019> that<00:07:14.319> if<00:07:14.469> you

00:07:14.609 --> 00:07:14.619 
the cloud and it means now that if you

00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:17.209 
the cloud and it means now that if you
they<00:07:15.609> have<00:07:15.759> 100<00:07:16.089> cars<00:07:16.329> testing<00:07:16.809> the<00:07:16.899> service

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:17.219 
they have 100 cars testing the service

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:20.339 
they have 100 cars testing the service
so<00:07:18.219> if<00:07:18.339> you<00:07:18.429> order<00:07:18.729> you<00:07:18.939> know<00:07:19.059> food<00:07:19.479> deliveries

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:20.349 
so if you order you know food deliveries

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:22.259 
so if you order you know food deliveries
you<00:07:20.739> can<00:07:20.919> have<00:07:21.069> them<00:07:21.249> sent<00:07:21.669> to<00:07:21.909> your<00:07:21.999> car

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:22.269 
you can have them sent to your car

00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:25.019 
you can have them sent to your car
basically<00:07:23.259> you<00:07:23.439> give<00:07:23.709> the<00:07:24.669> distribution

00:07:25.019 --> 00:07:25.029 
basically you give the distribution

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:28.930 
basically you give the distribution
company<00:07:25.749> the<00:07:25.899> right<00:07:26.109> to<00:07:26.739> locate<00:07:27.639> your<00:07:27.759> car<00:07:28.059> you
