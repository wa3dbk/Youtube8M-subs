 videoblogera the moment of romance comes 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.650
 I understand that we need more 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.599
 quality words when you only 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.580

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.410
 camera mic vlad and now they 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.099
 killed of you enough quality 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.739
 stereo sound 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.270
 built cardboard will suit you if 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.460
 the sound source is far from 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.270
 cameras or if you want to shoot me 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.580
 primary 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.260
 lack of windshield weak 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.300
 focus and high level 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.730
 intrinsic noise will cause 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.260
 almost no voice can be heard 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.399
 this situation you can not do without 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.829
 external microphone 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.390
 for my own reasons 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.360
 desirable 2 microphone lavalier 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.930
 microphone gun I still take into account the buttonhole 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.640
 audio technica and those 30 and 50 true 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.830
 purchase from cardboard everything was not very 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.300
 smoothly at first and tried to buy very 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.450
 For the official distributor in Russia 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.119
 as it turned out, and very vain services 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.009
 pasha office the same parshin and day 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.560
 did not have it further through under all 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:19.619
 details of this link in the end 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.050
 buy on ebay and how it entered senge 30 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.390
 US dollars to compare Russian 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.330
 online stores ask for it 40 45 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.190
 dollars before buying a microphone you 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.640
 must understand that a good sound is worth 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:35.780
 also very good normal microphones 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.780
 for 100 rubles does not happen 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.869
 I have been looking for a suitable person for a very long time. 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.210
 model so that is not very expensive but also 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:54.009
 quality matched 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:56.170
 stopped at audio-technica atr3350 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.549
 these in japanese are quite famous 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.799
 for a long time on the market did not offer 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.399
 Chinese equivalent is twice cheaper but I 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.399
 turned up 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.609
 audio these 3350 miniature 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.379
 speakerphone lapel microphone which 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.439
 The diagnosis is suitable for video shooting 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.329
 thanks to 6 meters between the growth managed you 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:47.010
 you can easily connect it to your 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:48.959
 photo or camcorder microphone 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.909
 capacitor they require phantom 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.409
 power since in the design 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.620
 provided its own source 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.269
 energy 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.250
 6 gram weight is small and 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.159
 convenient fastening allows unnoticed 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.239
 place the microphone on the clothes 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:08.189
 there are special kits for this 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:10.109
 clip since the microphone 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:12.030
 omnidirectional sinking and here's some 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.569
 special targeting when attaching it 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.569
 backed by 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.930
 but 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.950
 what other features worth highlighting 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.010
 mono sound windbreak and procession 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.200
 with mostly with not so unambiguous one 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.070
 the sides of it are long this is good on the other 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.360
 sides of 6 meters studio home supposedly 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.640
 it would be much better if bundled 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.740
 2 cords went long and short and 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.410
 microphone design provided 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.990
 exam that we will start testing 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.540
 I will first record the sound of the tuned camera 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.350
 microphone state about how you 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.450
 can hear 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.600
 it turns out very peculiar with 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.310
 high background noise and now sound 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.910
 recorded on audio 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.630
 these f33 50 sound should be cleaner and 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.640
 it is better 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.950
 it should be clearer and 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.570
 legible due to the fact that the microphone 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.270
 is now much closer to 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.590
 sound source but any conclusions 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.680
 do on patterns 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:28.620
 Like it all subscribe 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.620
 on the canal and see you soon sketch next
