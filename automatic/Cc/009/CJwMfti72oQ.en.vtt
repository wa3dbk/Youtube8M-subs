00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
is shaped if so this looks bright red

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.990 
is shaped if so this looks bright red
but<00:03:13.350> believe<00:03:13.950> me<00:03:13.980> it's<00:03:14.400> much<00:03:14.820> more

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
but believe me it's much more

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.300 
but believe me it's much more
translucent<00:03:15.450> than<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:15.990> it's<00:03:16.890> more<00:03:17.100> of<00:03:17.160> a

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
translucent than that it's more of a

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.170 
translucent than that it's more of a
really<00:03:17.870> succulent<00:03:19.190> strawberry<00:03:20.190> lip<00:03:20.550> bar<00:03:20.820> that

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
really succulent strawberry lip bar that

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.440 
really succulent strawberry lip bar that
makes<00:03:21.360> sense<00:03:21.770> so<00:03:22.770> it's<00:03:22.920> just<00:03:23.070> next<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.430> it<00:03:23.580> see

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
makes sense so it's just next to it see

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.510 
makes sense so it's just next to it see
how<00:03:24.690> that's<00:03:25.380> got<00:03:25.560> hardly<00:03:25.770> any<00:03:25.830> color<00:03:26.130> but<00:03:26.190> and

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
how that's got hardly any color but and

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.960 
how that's got hardly any color but and
thing<00:03:27.330> is<00:03:27.450> much<00:03:27.810> more<00:03:28.650> wet<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.430> it's<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:29.760> much

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
thing is much more wet so it's a much

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.380 
thing is much more wet so it's a much
lighter<00:03:30.830> application<00:03:31.830> so<00:03:32.760> it's<00:03:32.910> kind<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.180> more

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
lighter application so it's kind of more

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.460 
lighter application so it's kind of more
for<00:03:33.900> every<00:03:34.110> day<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.490> last<00:03:35.700> three<00:03:36.090> things
