anyway if you guys haven't noticed this
isn't<00:01:30.979> black<00:01:31.979> ops<00:01:32.220> 1<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.850> isn't<00:01:33.380> cod<00:01:34.380> 4

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
isn't black ops 1 and this isn't cod 4

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.130 
isn't black ops 1 and this isn't cod 4
on<00:01:34.770> console<00:01:35.220> its<00:01:35.579> god<00:01:35.729> for<00:01:35.970> definitely<00:01:36.960> caught

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
on console its god for definitely caught

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.630 
on console its god for definitely caught
forward<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:39.710> it's<00:01:40.710> caught<00:01:40.890> for<00:01:40.920> on<00:01:41.189> PC<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
forward and it's caught for on PC and

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.520 
forward and it's caught for on PC and
it's<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.950> bolt-action<00:01:43.950> only<00:01:45.020> server<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.170> think

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
it's a bolt-action only server I think

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.120 
it's a bolt-action only server I think
and<00:01:47.659> there's<00:01:48.659> two<00:01:49.229> Maps<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.710> think<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.040> it

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
and there's two Maps I think that it

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.069 
and there's two Maps I think that it
rotates<00:01:50.460> back<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.000> forth<00:01:51.210> from<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.630> custom

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
rotates back and forth from a custom

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.530 
rotates back and forth from a custom
nuketown<00:01:52.500> map<00:01:52.770> which<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.430> one<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.850> a

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
nuketown map which is this one and a

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.859 
nuketown map which is this one and a
custom<00:01:54.990> rust<00:01:55.320> map<00:01:55.560> which<00:01:56.570> it's<00:01:57.570> kind<00:01:57.810> of

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
custom rust map which it's kind of

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.569 
custom rust map which it's kind of
boring<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.290> got<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> better<00:01:58.770> gameplay<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.460> was

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
boring I got a better gameplay on it was

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.600 
boring I got a better gameplay on it was
like<00:01:59.610> 41<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.479> 12<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.350> one's<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:01.710> 36

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
like 41 and 12 and this one's like 36

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.219 
like 41 and 12 and this one's like 36
and<00:02:02.939> 10<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:04.049> I'm<00:02:04.140> like<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:05.869> but<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.899> decided

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
and 10 so I'm like that but I decided

they<00:02:30.599> are<00:02:30.629> stock<00:02:31.140> in<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.470> game<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:32.430> know<00:02:32.549> that

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
they are stock in the game you know that

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.750 
they are stock in the game you know that
same<00:02:33.110> scope<00:02:34.110> in<00:02:34.349> or<00:02:34.680> sway<00:02:35.010> on<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.370> gun<00:02:35.549> and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
same scope in or sway on the gun and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.199 
same scope in or sway on the gun and
then<00:02:35.870> there's<00:02:36.980> unscoped<00:02:37.980> snipers<00:02:38.849> which

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
then there's unscoped snipers which

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.640 
then there's unscoped snipers which
literally<00:02:39.900> they<00:02:40.379> remove<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.129> scope

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
literally they remove the scope

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.460 
literally they remove the scope
animation<00:02:43.650> on<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:43.950> gun<00:02:44.629> or<00:02:45.629> the<00:02:45.900> animated

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
animation on the gun or the animated

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.780 
animation on the gun or the animated
scope<00:02:46.769> that's<00:02:47.010> on<00:02:47.159> the<00:02:47.250> gun<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.640> it's

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
scope that's on the gun so it's

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.430 
scope that's on the gun so it's
literally<00:02:48.090> just<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.480> barrel<00:02:49.049> there's<00:02:49.319> no

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440

literally just the barrel there's no
sights<00:02:49.739> or<00:02:49.920> anything<00:02:50.129> when<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:50.609> just<00:02:50.760> scope

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
sights or anything when you just scope

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.330 
sights or anything when you just scope
in<00:02:51.239> it's<00:02:51.959> just<00:02:52.260> there's<00:02:52.560> no<00:02:52.650> crosshairs<00:02:53.190> or

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
in it's just there's no crosshairs or

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.479 
in it's just there's no crosshairs or
anything<00:02:53.549> your<00:02:53.940> sights<00:02:54.209> it's<00:02:54.690> weird<00:02:55.280> but<00:02:56.280> um

anything your sights it's weird but um

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.849 
anything your sights it's weird but um
and<00:02:56.790> then<00:02:57.780> I<00:02:57.810> use<00:02:58.079> those<00:02:58.290> I<00:02:58.319> actually<00:02:58.590> got<00:02:58.829> a

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
and then I use those I actually got a

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.289 
and then I use those I actually got a
quad<00:02:59.129> feud<00:02:59.370> with<00:02:59.489> one<00:02:59.609> of<00:02:59.730> those<00:02:59.849> but<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.120> wasn't

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
quad feud with one of those but I wasn't

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.940 
quad feud with one of those but I wasn't
the<00:03:00.480> demo<00:03:00.750> recording<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.409> it's<00:03:01.560> kind<00:03:01.739> of<00:03:01.769> dumb

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
the demo recording so it's kind of dumb

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.129 
the demo recording so it's kind of dumb
and<00:03:02.220> if<00:03:02.819> this<00:03:02.970> video<00:03:03.120> looks<00:03:03.450> all<00:03:03.569> janky<00:03:04.049> and

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
and if this video looks all janky and

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.770 
and if this video looks all janky and
skipping<00:03:04.950> and<00:03:05.099> stuff<00:03:05.310> like<00:03:05.430> that<00:03:05.780> it's

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
skipping and stuff like that it's

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.539 
skipping and stuff like that it's
because<00:03:07.079> it<00:03:07.200> was<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.319> demo<00:03:07.590> recording<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:08.280> then

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
because it was a demo recording and then

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.099 
because it was a demo recording and then
there's<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.879> Pro<00:03:09.090> Mod<00:03:09.299> snipers<00:03:09.810> which<00:03:09.989> is

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:11.780 
there's the Pro Mod snipers which is
what<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.290> was<00:03:10.470> using<00:03:10.680> there's<00:03:11.010> no<00:03:11.159> sway<00:03:11.489> and

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
what I was using there's no sway and

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.360 
what I was using there's no sway and
they<00:03:11.940> scoped<00:03:12.269> in<00:03:12.450> quicker<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.290> it's<00:03:13.560> exactly

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
they scoped in quicker so it's exactly

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.879 
they scoped in quicker so it's exactly
