00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.850 
because a lot of people want diamond
Kobe<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.390> those<00:01:24.689> codes<00:01:25.020> go<00:01:25.140> really<00:01:25.380> quick<00:01:25.710> but

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
Kobe and those codes go really quick but

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.590 
Kobe and those codes go really quick but
the<00:01:26.250> biggest<00:01:26.400> difference<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:27.000> Durant<00:01:27.299> stats

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the biggest difference in Durant stats

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.090 
the biggest difference in Durant stats
well<00:01:28.049> other<00:01:28.229> than<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.650> fact<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.890> he's<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
well other than the fact that he's a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.950 
well other than the fact that he's a
 DC<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:29.970> diamond<00:01:30.360> Durant<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
 DC the diamond Durant the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.780 
 DC the diamond Durant the
biggest<00:01:31.170> thing<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.590> his<00:01:31.770> past<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.400> up<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.729> a

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
biggest thing is his past it's up to a

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.340 
biggest thing is his past it's up to a
bow<00:01:32.850> than<00:01:33.060> 81<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.840> could<00:01:33.960> run<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.290> that

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
bow than 81 you could run like that

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.560 
bow than 81 you could run like that
Scottie<00:01:34.740> Pippen<00:01:35.159> point<00:01:35.460> forward<00:01:35.850> roll<00:01:36.420> with

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
Scottie Pippen point forward roll with

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.789 
Scottie Pippen point forward roll with
him<00:01:36.659> know<00:01:36.840> he<00:01:36.960> could<00:01:37.079> give<00:01:37.200> him<00:01:37.290> like<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> dimer

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
him know he could give him like a dimer

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.950 
him know he could give him like a dimer
but<00:01:38.549> I'm<00:01:38.670> sapphire<00:01:39.119> Durant<00:01:39.540> i<00:01:39.600> think<00:01:39.810> is

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
but I'm sapphire Durant i think is

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.810 
but I'm sapphire Durant i think is
slightly<00:01:40.470> better<00:01:40.740> offensively<00:01:41.400> i<00:01:41.520> think<00:01:41.759> his

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
slightly better offensively i think his

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.999 
slightly better offensively i think his
threes<00:01:42.180> are<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.390> bit<00:01:42.570> higher<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.380> other<00:01:43.799> than

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
threes are a bit higher but other than

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.469 
threes are a bit higher but other than
that<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.369> diamond<00:01:44.700> Durant<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.060> anything<00:01:45.390> I

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
that this diamond Durant is anything I

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.240 
that this diamond Durant is anything I
could<00:01:45.630> ever<00:01:45.659> ask<00:01:45.899> for<00:01:46.200> I'm<00:01:46.590> slowly<00:01:46.920> starting

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
could ever ask for I'm slowly starting

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.280 
could ever ask for I'm slowly starting
to<00:01:47.880> kind<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.180> like<00:01:48.360> Kevin<00:01:48.659> Durant<00:01:48.899> becoming<00:01:49.200> a

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
to kind of like Kevin Durant becoming a

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.780 
to kind of like Kevin Durant becoming a
friend<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.590> his<00:01:49.680> even<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.070> think<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.460> streak

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
friend of his even I think this streak

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.700 
friend of his even I think this streak
that<00:01:50.939> he's<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> bit<00:01:51.600> overrated<00:01:51.899> just

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
that he's on is a bit overrated just

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.760 
that he's on is a bit overrated just
because<00:01:53.009> like<00:01:53.220> my<00:01:54.210> my<00:01:54.899> description<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.649> is

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
because like my my description of it is

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.139 
because like my my description of it is
that<00:01:55.799> he's<00:01:56.070> on<00:01:56.189> my<00:01:56.340> player<00:01:56.640> with<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.850> green

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
that he's on my player with the green

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.789 
that he's on my player with the green
light<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.479> shoot<00:01:57.630> as<00:01:57.780> many<00:01:57.960> times<00:01:58.200> as<00:01:58.350> he<00:01:58.500> wants

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
light to shoot as many times as he wants

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.770 
light to shoot as many times as he wants
so<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.159> won't<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.610> surprised<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.119> few<00:02:00.240> drops<00:02:00.390> 40

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
so I won't be surprised a few drops 40

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.730 
so I won't be surprised a few drops 40
every<00:02:00.960> game<00:02:01.079> but<00:02:01.170> that's<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.380> different<00:02:01.469> story

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740
