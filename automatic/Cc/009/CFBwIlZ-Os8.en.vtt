00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.580 
mainly so most of what I know centers
around<00:00:18.850> retouching<00:00:19.420> portraits<00:00:19.870> and<00:00:20.080> working

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
maybe a little bit farther away it looks

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.369 
maybe a little bit farther away it looks
pretty<00:00:49.420> smooth<00:00:49.690> you<00:00:49.899> know<00:00:49.989> I<00:00:50.050> mean<00:00:50.199> looks

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
pretty smooth you know I mean looks

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.829 
pretty smooth you know I mean looks
pretty<00:00:50.589> good<00:00:50.829> it<00:00:51.190> was<00:00:51.339> lit<00:00:51.489> really<00:00:51.789> softly<00:00:52.179> so

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
pretty good it was lit really softly so

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:54.630 
pretty good it was lit really softly so
there's<00:00:53.050> not<00:00:53.140> a<00:00:53.199> whole<00:00:53.379> bunch<00:00:53.589> of<00:00:53.769> really

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
there's not a whole bunch of really

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.360 
there's not a whole bunch of really
jarring<00:00:54.969> texture<00:00:55.539> and<00:00:55.690> skin<00:00:56.039> but<00:00:57.039> as<00:00:57.129> with

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
jarring texture and skin but as with

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.729 
jarring texture and skin but as with
anything<00:00:57.729> we<00:00:58.030> can<00:00:58.149> keep<00:00:58.269> zooming<00:00:58.510> in<00:00:58.780> and<00:00:59.019> as

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
anything we can keep zooming in and as

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.399 
anything we can keep zooming in and as
we<00:00:59.920> get<00:01:00.010> to<00:01:00.129> 100%<00:01:00.460> here<00:01:01.059> it<00:01:01.839> looking<00:01:02.199> it's

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 
we get to 100% here it looking it's

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.799 
we get to 100% here it looking it's
looking<00:01:02.710> pretty<00:01:03.239> textured<00:01:04.239> and<00:01:04.479> you<00:01:04.720> know

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
looking pretty textured and you know

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.180 
looking pretty textured and you know
that's<00:01:04.989> absolutely<00:01:05.350> normal<00:01:05.560> of<00:01:05.770> course<00:01:06.010> there

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
that's absolutely normal of course there

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.219 
that's absolutely normal of course there
should<00:01:06.340> be<00:01:06.490> texture<00:01:06.909> and<00:01:07.060> skin<00:01:07.329> I'm<00:01:07.719> an

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
should be texture and skin I'm an

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.620 
should be texture and skin I'm an
advocate<00:01:08.829> of<00:01:09.009> not<00:01:09.520> blurring<00:01:10.090> away<00:01:10.360> all<00:01:10.540> the

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
advocate of not blurring away all the

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.940 
advocate of not blurring away all the
texture<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:11.140> I'll<00:01:11.200> probably<00:01:11.469> make<00:01:11.619> a<00:01:11.680> video

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
texture and I'll probably make a video

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.609 
texture and I'll probably make a video
about<00:01:12.070> that<00:01:12.159> later<00:01:13.079> but<00:01:14.079> right<00:01:14.229> now<00:01:14.290> we're

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
about that later but right now we're

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.069 
about that later but right now we're
seeing<00:01:14.770> a<00:01:14.920> few<00:01:14.950> things<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.570> if<00:01:16.659> we<00:01:16.810> look<00:01:16.960> up

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
seeing a few things so if we look up

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.429 
seeing a few things so if we look up
here<00:01:17.670> forehead<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:19.360> color<00:01:19.630> here<00:01:19.960> of<00:01:20.049> the<00:01:20.170> skin

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.929 
yellow orange kind of skin tone whereas
if<00:01:26.079> we<00:01:26.140> look<00:01:26.350> here<00:01:26.649> right<00:01:27.189> here<00:01:27.310> between<00:01:27.460> his

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
if we look here right here between his

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.149 
if we look here right here between his
brow<00:01:28.240> there's<00:01:29.079> that<00:01:29.289> little<00:01:29.409> red<00:01:29.710> and<00:01:29.740> there's

brow there's that little red and there's
some<00:01:30.310> red<00:01:30.490> here<00:01:30.909> and<00:01:31.119> there's<00:01:31.390> some<00:01:31.509> redness

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
some red here and there's some redness

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.810 
some red here and there's some redness
around<00:01:32.049> and<00:01:32.500> below<00:01:32.649> his<00:01:32.829> nose<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:34.570> we<00:01:35.020> don't

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
around and below his nose so we don't

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.010 
around and below his nose so we don't
you<00:01:36.820> know<00:01:36.880> we<00:01:36.939> don't<00:01:37.090> always<00:01:37.359> think<00:01:37.479> about<00:01:37.869> it

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
you know we don't always think about it

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.639 
you know we don't always think about it
but<00:01:38.200> it'll<00:01:39.130> look<00:01:39.250> a<00:01:39.399> lot<00:01:39.579> more<00:01:39.850> I<00:01:40.530> don't<00:01:41.530> know

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
but it'll look a lot more I don't know

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.249 
but it'll look a lot more I don't know
kind<00:01:41.890> of<00:01:41.979> there's<00:01:42.280> going<00:01:42.399> to<00:01:42.490> look<00:01:42.609> more

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
kind of there's going to look more

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.859 
kind of there's going to look more
homogeneous<00:01:44.259> I<00:01:44.380> guess<00:01:44.590> if<00:01:44.920> we<00:01:45.640> fix<00:01:46.299> that<00:01:46.479> if<00:01:46.689> we

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
homogeneous I guess if we fix that if we

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.959 
homogeneous I guess if we fix that if we
if<00:01:47.079> we<00:01:47.109> kind<00:01:47.500> of<00:01:47.590> push<00:01:47.799> those<00:01:47.979> tones<00:01:48.310> over<00:01:48.729> back

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
if we kind of push those tones over back

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:50.730 
if we kind of push those tones over back
into<00:01:49.450> the<00:01:49.570> orange<00:01:49.899> yellow<00:01:50.079> the<00:01:50.380> rest<00:01:50.530> of<00:01:50.649> his

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
into the orange yellow the rest of his

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.669 
into the orange yellow the rest of his
skin<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:52.299> to<00:01:52.359> do<00:01:52.539> that<00:01:52.570> I'm<00:01:53.320> going<00:01:53.619> to

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
skin so to do that I'm going to

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.319 
skin so to do that I'm going to
duplicate<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.280> layer<00:01:54.310> that<00:01:54.939> I<00:01:54.969> have<00:01:55.119> right

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
duplicate the layer that I have right

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.499 
duplicate the layer that I have right
here<00:01:55.570> and<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:57.460> can<00:01:57.579> drag<00:01:57.820> that<00:01:58.000> down<00:01:58.210> to<00:01:58.420> the

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
here and you can drag that down to the

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.099 
here and you can drag that down to the
new<00:01:58.630> layer<00:01:58.659> or<00:01:59.140> press<00:01:59.619> command<00:01:59.829> J<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:01.109> I'm

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:02.109 
new layer or press command J and I'm

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:04.950 
new layer or press command J and I'm
going<00:02:02.380> to<00:02:02.499> go<00:02:03.310> to<00:02:03.369> image<00:02:03.960> adjustments

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
and I'm just going to assume kind of

and I'm just going to assume kind of
that<00:02:09.580> you're<00:02:09.729> familiar<00:02:09.910> if<00:02:10.300> you're<00:02:10.390> watching

this with some basic tools like the

working in layers you know if you're not
there's<00:02:17.180> some<00:02:17.299> great<00:02:17.450> tutorials<00:02:17.959> online<00:02:18.290> you

there's some great tutorials online you

can find to familiarize yourself with

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.270 
can find to familiarize yourself with
that<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:23.170> like<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.290> said<00:02:24.349> we're<00:02:24.739> trying<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.129> take

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
that so like I said we're trying to take

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.610 
that so like I said we're trying to take
these<00:02:25.430> red<00:02:25.760> parts<00:02:26.150> in<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.510> skin<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.049> push

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
these red parts in the skin and push

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.979 
these red parts in the skin and push
them<00:02:27.799> back<00:02:27.980> into<00:02:28.370> being<00:02:28.879> like<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.689> rest<00:02:29.720> of

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
them back into being like the rest of

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.199 
them back into being like the rest of
the<00:02:30.110> skin<00:02:30.290> tone<00:02:30.500> more<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.040> an<00:02:31.150> yellow-orange

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
the skin tone more of an yellow-orange

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.210 
the skin tone more of an yellow-orange
because<00:02:33.109> you<00:02:33.439> know<00:02:33.530> in<00:02:33.650> your<00:02:33.769> skin<00:02:34.010> if<00:02:34.129> you

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
because you know in your skin if you

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.520 
because you know in your skin if you
have<00:02:34.370> any<00:02:34.640> some<00:02:34.970> people<00:02:35.180> have<00:02:35.530> darker

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
have any some people have darker

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.039 
have any some people have darker
blemishes<00:02:37.069> you<00:02:37.099> know<00:02:37.430> acne<00:02:38.180> or<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.840> you<00:02:38.959> can

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
blemishes you know acne or and you can

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.809 
blemishes you know acne or and you can
just<00:02:39.200> discoloration<00:02:39.890> depending<00:02:40.220> on<00:02:40.280> age<00:02:40.489> and

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
just discoloration depending on age and

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.330 
just discoloration depending on age and
that<00:02:41.810> it's<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.620> can<00:02:42.769> clear<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.069> up<00:02:43.189> by

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
that it's you can clear that up by

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.610 
that it's you can clear that up by
retouching<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.849> out<00:02:43.970> with<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.150> clone<00:02:44.420> stamp<00:02:45.349> or

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
retouching it out with a clone stamp or

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.190 
retouching it out with a clone stamp or
a<00:02:46.060> healing<00:02:47.060> brush<00:02:47.239> or<00:02:47.389> something<00:02:47.510> and<00:02:47.930> we

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
a healing brush or something and we

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.869 
a healing brush or something and we
probably<00:02:48.470> would<00:02:48.769> probably<00:02:49.220> do<00:02:49.340> that<00:02:49.489> for<00:02:49.549> lots

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
probably would probably do that for lots

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.699 
probably would probably do that for lots
of<00:02:49.940> little<00:02:50.180> things<00:02:50.359> here<00:02:50.659> but<00:02:51.349> as<00:02:51.500> an<00:02:51.590> overall

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
of little things here but as an overall

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.520 
of little things here but as an overall
first<00:02:52.220> step<00:02:52.549> this<00:02:53.480> hue/saturation<00:02:54.260> trick<00:02:54.409> is

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
first step this hue/saturation trick is

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.819 
first step this hue/saturation trick is
pretty<00:02:54.739> cool<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:56.120> right<00:02:56.540> now<00:02:56.720> it's<00:02:57.079> set<00:02:57.799> to

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
pretty cool so right now it's set to

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.890 
pretty cool so right now it's set to
effect<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.370> master<00:02:58.730> saturation<00:02:59.329> so<00:02:59.689> you<00:02:59.750> know

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
effect the master saturation so you know

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.050 
effect the master saturation so you know
you<00:02:59.989> can<00:03:00.109> see<00:03:00.260> if<00:03:00.349> I<00:03:00.409> pull<00:03:00.650> down<00:03:01.060> saturation

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
you can see if I pull down saturation

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.569 
you can see if I pull down saturation
all<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.689> color<00:03:02.840> goes<00:03:03.079> away<00:03:03.400> I'm<00:03:04.400> going<00:03:04.519> to

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
all the color goes away I'm going to

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.059 
all the color goes away I'm going to
reset<00:03:04.849> that<00:03:04.879> and<00:03:05.239> I<00:03:06.049> want<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.319> only<00:03:06.439> affect<00:03:06.620> the

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
reset that and I want to only affect the

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.770 
reset that and I want to only affect the
Reds<00:03:07.340> so<00:03:07.790> I'm<00:03:07.849> going<00:03:07.970> to<00:03:08.030> go<00:03:08.090> down<00:03:08.239> from<00:03:08.420> master

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
Reds so I'm going to go down from master

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.210 
Reds so I'm going to go down from master
to<00:03:09.200> Red's<00:03:10.180> so<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.599> see<00:03:11.780> what<00:03:12.099> constitutes<00:03:13.099> as

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
to Red's so to see what constitutes as

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.619 
to Red's so to see what constitutes as
red<00:03:13.519> in<00:03:13.730> this<00:03:13.909> I'm<00:03:14.180> going<00:03:14.329> to<00:03:14.450> pull<00:03:14.569> the

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
red in this I'm going to pull the

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.020 
red in this I'm going to pull the
saturation<00:03:14.810> down<00:03:15.409> and<00:03:15.709> so<00:03:16.340> now<00:03:16.459> it's<00:03:16.790> d

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
saturation down and so now it's d

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.580 
saturation down and so now it's d
saturated<00:03:17.569> everything<00:03:18.079> in<00:03:18.169> this<00:03:18.260> picture

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
saturated everything in this picture

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.720 
saturated everything in this picture
that<00:03:18.799> is<00:03:19.489> red<00:03:19.970> which<00:03:20.930> is<00:03:21.310> obviously<00:03:22.310> here<00:03:22.519> too

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
that is red which is obviously here too

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.159 
that is red which is obviously here too
much<00:03:22.910> because<00:03:23.239> we<00:03:23.449> don't<00:03:23.599> really<00:03:23.720> have<00:03:23.959> any<00:03:24.139> of

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169 
much because we don't really have any of

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:25.750 
much because we don't really have any of
the<00:03:24.260> skin<00:03:24.530> color<00:03:24.889> showing<00:03:25.250> through<00:03:25.370> we<00:03:25.609> have<00:03:25.699> a

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
the skin color showing through we have a

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.819 
the skin color showing through we have a
little<00:03:26.060> bit<00:03:26.239> on<00:03:26.449> the<00:03:26.840> sides<00:03:27.079> of<00:03:27.199> his<00:03:27.260> face<00:03:27.560> but

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
little bit on the sides of his face but

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.300 
little bit on the sides of his face but
most<00:03:28.310> of<00:03:28.459> it<00:03:28.549> is<00:03:28.639> gone<00:03:28.989> so<00:03:29.989> it's<00:03:30.620> down<00:03:30.799> here<00:03:31.129> we

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
most of it is gone so it's down here we

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.610 
most of it is gone so it's down here we
have<00:03:31.430> this<00:03:31.519> little<00:03:31.699> kind<00:03:31.940> of<00:03:32.260> slider<00:03:33.260> that

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
have this little kind of slider that

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.589

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
are you know that all the texture is

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.350 
are you know that all the texture is
still<00:05:07.949> there<00:05:08.130> but<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.550> color<00:05:08.819> has<00:05:09.210> been

and there you go so this is kind of a
first<00:06:42.850> step<00:06:43.180> or<00:06:43.960> maybe<00:06:44.350> not<00:06:44.470> first<00:06:44.530> depending

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.010 
first step or maybe not first depending

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.100 
first step or maybe not first depending
on<00:06:45.070> in<00:06:45.160> your<00:06:45.310> workflow<00:06:45.700> but<00:06:46.120> you<00:06:46.840> know<00:06:46.930> I<00:06:46.960> like

to kind of do that and get some of the

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.880 
to kind of do that and get some of the
work<00:06:48.700> and<00:06:49.450> makes<00:06:49.990> it<00:06:50.110> simpler<00:06:50.470> because<00:06:50.590> now<00:06:50.830> we

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:50.890 
work and makes it simpler because now we

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.380 
work and makes it simpler because now we
can<00:06:51.130> look<00:06:51.250> at<00:06:51.400> it<00:06:51.550> and<00:06:51.640> say<00:06:51.760> what<00:06:51.880> do<00:06:52.000> we<00:06:52.090> really

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:52.390 
can look at it and say what do we really

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.790 
can look at it and say what do we really
need<00:06:52.540> to<00:06:52.630> retouch<00:06:52.900> because<00:06:53.230> before<00:06:53.530> we<00:06:53.650> could

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
need to retouch because before we could

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.080 
need to retouch because before we could
have<00:06:53.890> gone<00:06:54.010> crazy<00:06:54.250> trying<00:06:54.610> to<00:06:54.700> retouch<00:06:54.910> all

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.090 
have gone crazy trying to retouch all

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.700 
have gone crazy trying to retouch all
these<00:06:55.240> different<00:06:55.600> red<00:06:56.080> spots<00:06:56.350> out<00:06:56.560> or

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:56.710 
these different red spots out or

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.380 
these different red spots out or
whatever<00:06:56.920> and<00:06:57.160> now<00:06:57.250> we<00:06:57.430> look<00:06:57.610> at<00:06:57.730> it<00:06:57.880> and<00:06:58.000> the

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:58.390 
whatever and now we look at it and the

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.460 
whatever and now we look at it and the
red<00:06:58.570> spots<00:06:58.810> look<00:06:59.020> a<00:06:59.050> little<00:06:59.170> more<00:06:59.320> like

00:06:59.460 --> 00:06:59.470 
red spots look a little more like

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.170 
red spots look a little more like
natural<00:06:59.800> threat<00:07:00.310> holes<00:07:00.490> or<00:07:00.610> something<00:07:00.760> so<00:07:01.120> you

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:01.180 
natural threat holes or something so you

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.220 
natural threat holes or something so you
don't<00:07:01.600> have<00:07:01.690> to<00:07:01.750> spend<00:07:01.930> as<00:07:02.050> much<00:07:02.170> time

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:02.230 
don't have to spend as much time

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.620 
don't have to spend as much time
retouching<00:07:03.040> you<00:07:03.640> know<00:07:03.730> here<00:07:04.090> I<00:07:04.270> keep<00:07:04.510> looking

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:04.630 
retouching you know here I keep looking

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.330 
retouching you know here I keep looking
at<00:07:04.870> this<00:07:05.110> little<00:07:05.590> thing<00:07:05.800> between<00:07:05.920> his<00:07:06.190> eyes

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:06.340 
at this little thing between his eyes

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.330 
at this little thing between his eyes
and<00:07:06.610> I<00:07:06.670> probably<00:07:06.940> would<00:07:07.650> heal<00:07:08.650> that<00:07:08.800> out<00:07:09.010> or

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 
and I probably would heal that out or

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.490 
and I probably would heal that out or
clone<00:07:09.940> it<00:07:10.090> out<00:07:10.210> or<00:07:10.420> those<00:07:10.750> little<00:07:10.990> things<00:07:11.140> but

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:11.500 
clone it out or those little things but

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.980 
clone it out or those little things but
overall<00:07:12.010> the<00:07:12.310> complexion<00:07:12.670> has<00:07:13.510> been<00:07:13.720> helped

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 
overall the complexion has been helped

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.800 
overall the complexion has been helped
greatly<00:07:14.410> by<00:07:14.590> just<00:07:15.030> pushing<00:07:16.030> those<00:07:16.180> Reds<00:07:16.540> over

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.810 
greatly by just pushing those Reds over

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.710 
greatly by just pushing those Reds over
into<00:07:17.320> the<00:07:17.440> more<00:07:17.710> yellow<00:07:18.040> orange<00:07:18.490> area<00:07:18.790> so<00:07:19.420> I

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:19.720 
into the more yellow orange area so I

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.020 
into the more yellow orange area so I
hope<00:07:20.560> that<00:07:20.770> you<00:07:20.860> can<00:07:20.980> take<00:07:21.130> this<00:07:21.280> tip<00:07:21.610> and<00:07:21.880> use
