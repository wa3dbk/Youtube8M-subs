00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.320
 what happens worth welcome new to the area 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.770
 I bring you the new skin of luxe is 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.490
 legion looks steel and well let's 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.800
 start 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.980
 analyzing the skin as always 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.389
 a pretty cool rod a new bar 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.439
 they have put is brutal takes a 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.829
 armor of the future a viewer and by the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.939
 good back follows the armor and let's go 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.939
 to teach the war cries 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.680
 the dance 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.360
 but there are looks 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.570
 we see the dance 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.480
 and laughter 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:59.350
 with that showed a little bit they are going laughter 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.350
 the truth that is celebrated on the wall 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.230
 let's put a little more to the center 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:13.009
 and let's go perfect let's put this right 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.070
 to go up a bit and make me like a 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.620
 little a tad further 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.400
 and let's start teaching the cars 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.220
 attacks 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.080
 then how do you pull it from the bar to the 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.320
 rod is like a bar washed with a 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.320
 gun 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.650
 let's throw 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.650
 lakua 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.070
 as it is more rainbow and the cv when it 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.509
 spear has like some rayitos inside already 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.250
 that the effect is very successful 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.549
 to wait for those four seconds that we 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.549
 missing 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.240
 here and here you see that it's like a 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.409
 ray ball let's throw now a bird 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.409
 double the shield you know 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.570
 as you can see are the two balls of always 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.210
 but putting means is as united by 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.300
 rays because it will be the theme of this is 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.430
 as rays as very futuristic we are going to 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.149
 wait for three seconds 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.510
 let's throw it again 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.860
 you can see 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.860
 let's throw now once 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.160
 as you see it does not change much but 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.080
 When does it finish 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.550
 You see that it falls like a ray of heavens 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.440
 explode and I think it's also a 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.000
 little bit more rainbow you have more 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.690
 colors of the rainbow we are going to give some 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.690
 remittances of attacks 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.580
 the w 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.870
 and again there's the one that we're going to throw 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.720
 here so that the effect of the 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.780
 falling ray 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:46.070
 if you see we go up for the fps just to 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.070
 time and finally the best r 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.120
 As you can see, the bar strip is very, very 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.069
 very cool is r I hope you have 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:01.060
 liked it here we are going to 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:01.060
 to teach we are going to teach recall 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.370
 we see that the recall changes 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.959
 and finally as you know the animation 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.849
 of death and then if we are going to be to see 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.900
 if you have recall animation that the 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.110
 true that with all the changes that 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.510
 bring here maybe the have is very difficult 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.310
 very little they bring but if we see with that 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.989
 hope reappearance animation what 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.480
 only one that I remember that they have 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.340
 now there are three 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.500
 an arm omb and that are both the same 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.360
 animation happens that with different 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.950
 exoskeleton that looks 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.950
 we are going to sin 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.860
 to flash 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.860
 and stay tuned 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.080
 how a pretty curious honking stick and 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.300
 it dissolves good what always to say 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.940
 that you subscribe and if it is not and that you 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.860
 leave like if you liked the favorite 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.690
 who has loved to talk about your 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.940
 friends that can to those of my channel and 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.130
 well let's wait these 10 seconds 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.750
 missing 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.260
 to see if it has animation of 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.260
 reappearance 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.319
 1 and there we see that he has nothing 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.549
 that you liked here in as much as 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.170
 I'll see you in the next chapter the 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.830
 zone it has been looks legion of 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.830
 goodbye steel
