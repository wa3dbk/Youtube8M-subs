00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.000
 good afternoon with you android mane and 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.469
 today we look at the game oh was 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.570
 a little bit on video and as you can see 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.540
 a little slow down due to 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.690
 that and right up and on the phone video 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.080
 so there may be such things but if 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.810
 I wrote as if holding the phone in my hands 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.730
 and shooting on some kind of camera yet this 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.000
 It looked very very god thread 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.450
 like it so let's miss say 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.610
 so that's about the pros and cons 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.920
 This game, we now consider of course 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.500
 plus country pros and thought you can 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.920
 see the summit schedule graphics for 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.860
 phone game she already came out pretty 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.690
 long ago it has been possible very good and 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:55.410
 quality is also one of the advantages 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.390
 there is of course a parquet system then 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.370
 I mean you do not choose any 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.960
 a woman or a player or someone else and 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:09.060
 start hitting him you just start 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.740
 beat which is visible and cause damage to guest 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.260
 and hit or not hit the same with 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.909
 all skills for magicians and warriors 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.729
 for whom there is no such thing as 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.200
 chose the bidding you beat i count to the world 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.400
 this is a big plus because 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.080
 are considered starting to be considered important 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.840
 it is the playerâ€™s ability to fall not 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.549
 fall and and such a thing that is you 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.610
 can dodge an opponent's strike 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.350
 they are just choosing targitai and chiselling on 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.939
 f1 button and that's the whole game 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.990
 It ends it naturally also a plus 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.920
 what are the cons of the game 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.479
 minus the game, too, there is the first it is not 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.420
 open world that is what you see 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.820
 this is one of the locations 2 at the end is 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.190
 after teleport 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.370
 type 3 ports and teleport 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.540
 operation from the house after the first 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.280
 overclocking locations you can 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.910
 teleport only to the author location 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.770
 from the gable 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.750
 after the second or third is obtained as 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.850
 a corridor that is the game as it 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.979
 the corridor is a very big minus 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.160
 not there having chosen the fist of the essence 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.450
 Levite teleport forward or backward 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.680
 can't persuade from when such and such 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.680
 space is this what you need 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.360
 leaving in the cores of the mountain 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.170
 year he is a big container 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.020
 Sorry here with him no I am very 10 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.820
 fuck supposed 2 did anyone almost 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.709
 maybe it will fix it 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.570
 there is a little leave here 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.090
 variety where to go from the main 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.520
 cities can go in by some zone 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.100
 there the tower is all over it all over and 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.620
 so much come up and the porn zone is farther away 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.340
 you have no choice you just go on 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.200
 or back up writing is also worth noting 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.840
 boss perhaps more detailed pattern 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.230
 I'll show you all the bosses and so on. 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.970
 Further along the wi-fi zone, that's the same minus 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.880
 by the way, since we started talking about it 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.280
 haruka zone more precisely them here as if 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.790
 say no ie farm zone 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.950
 any where there are mobs where there is a raid boss 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.250
 what is not the Poltava can not 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.519
 beat players in general is not very 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.110
 confused and not that still do not like 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.820
 where can you beat it just blame 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.970
 special location for someone and there 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.610
 all ways are beating everything is so different 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.829
 the court will be like this atelier 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.340
 on command but still it doesn't give that 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.459
 fan 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.950
 as if there were some big residue 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.459
 we lock or something like 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.870
 trying to introduce something like that but for now 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:40.190
 that this is not the level at which 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.049
 I wanted these are my thoughts on this 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.810
 this game 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.209
 if you have another guide and 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.330
 said nothing worth mentioning 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.190
 talk about this comments and 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:55.840
 subscribe with you was android money 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:58.770
