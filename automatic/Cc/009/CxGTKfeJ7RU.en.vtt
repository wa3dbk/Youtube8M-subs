00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.680
 welcome once again to the channel the 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.220
 I bring a new gta 5 video online 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.380
 good in this video I come to bring you a 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.000
 motorcycle a free voucher is about a 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.980
 harley davison that we will have to 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.169
 get here where the ferris wheel is and 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.510
 everything goes where we say the fair and 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.520
 not, well, we'll get off right here 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.530
 below and on the beach you will know all 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.870
 where is the you will see the location by 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.879
 that I have not put it and we will wait 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.010
 with the open cell phone that is 8 o'clock 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.809
 at 8 o'clock an activity is going to open 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.320
 you will see it on the minimap how it is going 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.489
 to open let's say a zone is worth red in 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.949
 which are going to leave us enemies 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.870
 I think there are 20 in total and 20 enemies 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.230
 that you have to kill is worth once 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.940
 So we killed the bikes that 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.819
 true there are two vouchers there are two bikes 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.800
 they will come out just below at the end of 

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:06.870
 finish the activity just below 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.600
 the two bikes will come out so we can 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.520
 take it and take it to the garage or take it 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.800
 to the workshop and you will have explained how 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.120
 we can do this is worth so good 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.650
 As you see, guys, I'm passing it to 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.500
 fast camera so you do not have to 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.390
 swallow as I kill all 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.140
 let's say to all the enemies of the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.220
 activity so what I said just 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.710
 is to kill them guys 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.180
 it does not matter how many times you kill them 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.270
 they can kill you every time 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.530
 you want because you're going to reappear always 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.780
 next door, you're always going to be 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.850
 reappearing here to the side so no 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.340
 you have no problem to lose 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.220
 motorcycles worth good guys as you see has been 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.320
 finished and right now you are seeing it 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.000
 the two bikes are worth two colors 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.619
 you can take the one you want worth no no 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.750
 it is different or they are the same 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.360
 motorcycles only with different colors 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.130
 so once we have the motorcycle 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.630
 we want to keep it in the garage or if 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.700
 we want to put the insurance at all risk 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.710
 or put it in the workshop to make it 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.810
 some changes, just what 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.369
 only thing we have to do is put it 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.740
 in an activity it is worth for example I have 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.259
 chosen this and once we have the motorcycle 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.500
 inside we will go down and start there 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.140
 the activity is worth once we have 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.380
 started the activity simply because 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.690
 we give it to the host or if you want 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.030
 join as you want the case is that 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.670
 we have to get into an activity 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.350
 once you let us out, okay, you guys, what 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.170
 only thing that we will have to do will be to leave 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.430
 and reappear we have just where where 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.020
 we have done the activity 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.750
 there you see the activity where I have 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.819
 put there is my personal vehicle and 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.250
 right behind there you are seeing it there 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.950
 the motorcycle is worth but what happens that this 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.050
 motorcycle right now you can get into the 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.180
 garage or you can take to the workshop how 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.770
 you are going to see below it's worth it 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.270
 do this because if not the truth is that 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.670
 you are going to have enough problems with 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.230
 this topic but as you can see it is very easy 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.380
 we just get into an activity 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.150
 we unite or are the host of one and 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.010
 Then we leave when he leaves us 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.540
 going out is worth it and as you can see, it is not 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.489
 we have no problem to put the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.930
 motorcycle in the workshop and do all the 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.660
 changes to our liking all 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.610
 changes we want 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.800
 I have made the changes 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.900
 The most I 've seen is worth everything 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.490
 you could change it has changed the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.800
 true and I have not had any problems to 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.680
 the time to put it in my garage and that 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.840
 is the guardadito is worth the only 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.820
 you have to do if you want everything 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.850
 risk and so on so you go to the section 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.850
 insurance in the workshop and then you 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.550
 you put the insurance at all risk and jr and the 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.370
 locator that already has it thanks to 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.230
 trick that we just made to be worth like that 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.540
 what good guys you see is very easy 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.270

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.890
