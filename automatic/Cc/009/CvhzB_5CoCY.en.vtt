00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
percent of what it normally was so

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.600 
percent of what it normally was so
instead<00:06:39.650> of<00:06:39.710> getting<00:06:41.800> instead<00:06:42.800> of<00:06:42.890> getting<00:06:43.160> 5

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
instead of getting instead of getting 5

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.660 
instead of getting instead of getting 5
HP<00:06:44.390> each<00:06:44.930> time<00:06:45.350> even<00:06:45.650> HP<00:06:46.040> boost<00:06:46.220> you<00:06:46.340> only<00:06:46.460> get

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:46.670 
HP each time even HP boost you only get

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.170 
HP each time even HP boost you only get
two<00:06:47.500> so<00:06:48.500> by<00:06:48.950> the<00:06:48.980> end<00:06:49.130> of<00:06:49.250> the<00:06:49.370> game<00:06:49.400> you<00:06:49.730> end<00:06:49.940> up

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
two so by the end of the game you end up

00:06:50.180 --> 00:07:00.370 
two so by the end of the game you end up
