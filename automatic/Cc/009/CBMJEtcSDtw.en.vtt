particularly well right throughout the

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.390 
particularly well right throughout the
weekend<00:01:55.570> how<00:01:56.110> was<00:01:56.140> your<00:01:56.409> plan<00:01:56.680> to<00:01:56.979> take<00:01:57.159> him<00:01:57.369> on

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.030 
weekend how was your plan to take him on
the<00:01:57.820> phone<00:01:58.000> yeah<00:01:58.720> I<00:01:58.750> guess<00:01:59.050> watching<00:01:59.770> that<00:01:59.800> we

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
the phone yeah I guess watching that we

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.800 
the phone yeah I guess watching that we
knew<00:02:00.159> that<00:02:00.190> they<00:02:01.000> would<00:02:01.150> have<00:02:01.240> really<00:02:01.540> him<00:02:01.690> to

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
knew that they would have really him to

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.889 
knew that they would have really him to
the<00:02:01.930> tank<00:02:02.790> seen<00:02:03.790> them<00:02:04.030> come<00:02:04.270> out<00:02:04.420> in<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.690> phone

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
the tank seen them come out in the phone

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.240 
the tank seen them come out in the phone
obviously<00:02:05.050> there<00:02:05.380> are<00:02:05.410> for<00:02:05.680> it<00:02:05.740> but<00:02:05.890> we<00:02:06.070> saw<00:02:06.220> a

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
obviously there are for it but we saw a

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.790 
obviously there are for it but we saw a
lot<00:02:06.340> of<00:02:06.460> I<00:02:06.910> guess<00:02:07.060> better<00:02:07.240> than<00:02:07.360> Bruce<00:02:07.800> players

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
lot of I guess better than Bruce players

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.889 
lot of I guess better than Bruce players
so<00:02:09.130> I<00:02:09.160> mean<00:02:09.459> it<00:02:10.360> could<00:02:10.479> have<00:02:10.600> worked<00:02:10.660> you<00:02:10.810> the

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
so I mean it could have worked you the

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.930 
so I mean it could have worked you the
way<00:02:10.989> for<00:02:11.019> them<00:02:11.230> they<00:02:11.350> came<00:02:11.500> out<00:02:11.590> firing<00:02:12.220> got<00:02:12.760> to

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
way for them they came out firing got to

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.880 
way for them they came out firing got to
Z<00:02:13.060> tries<00:02:13.300> on<00:02:13.450> us<00:02:13.570> but<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:13.780> mean<00:02:14.380> usually<00:02:14.500> with<00:02:14.769> us

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
Z tries on us but I mean usually with us

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.090 
Z tries on us but I mean usually with us
as<00:02:15.010> for<00:02:15.220> me<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.370> know<00:02:15.459> that<00:02:16.330> semi-final<00:02:16.930> would

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
as for me you know that semi-final would

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.590 
as for me you know that semi-final would
probably<00:02:18.100> really<00:02:18.340> taken<00:02:18.670> its<00:02:18.790> toll<00:02:18.850> women<00:02:19.330> in

the<00:03:11.410> series<00:03:11.560> like<00:03:11.739> this<00:03:11.769> is<00:03:12.700> good<00:03:13.019> I<00:03:14.019> guess

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
the series like this is good I guess

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.200

the<00:03:16.680> downside<00:03:17.070> is<00:03:17.250> there<00:03:17.610> any<00:03:17.760> way<00:03:17.910> from<00:03:18.120> here

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
the downside is there any way from here

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.110 
the downside is there any way from here
is<00:03:18.330> down<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:18.990> in<00:03:19.440> terms<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.710> our<00:03:19.860> our<00:03:20.670> standards

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
is down so in terms of our our standards

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.170 
is down so in terms of our our standards
it's<00:03:21.930> going<00:03:22.050> to<00:03:22.110> be<00:03:22.200> hot<00:03:22.650> ass<00:03:22.860> to<00:03:23.250> match<00:03:23.370> it<00:03:23.580> for

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
it's going to be hot ass to match it for

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.690 
it's going to be hot ass to match it for
another<00:03:24.360> run<00:03:25.080> or<00:03:25.110> so<00:03:25.320> 20s<00:03:25.680> but<00:03:25.800> I'm<00:03:25.950> like<00:03:26.580> it's

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
another run or so 20s but I'm like it's

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.520 
another run or so 20s but I'm like it's
just<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.850> great<00:03:26.970> start<00:03:27.240> maximum<00:03:28.140> points<00:03:28.350> on<00:03:28.440> the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
just a great start maximum points on the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.290 
just a great start maximum points on the
back<00:03:28.650> for<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:28.950> World<00:03:29.100> Series<00:03:29.160> so<00:03:29.550> hopefully<00:03:29.850> a

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
back for the World Series so hopefully a

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.670 
back for the World Series so hopefully a
good<00:03:30.960> sign<00:03:31.260> of<00:03:31.380> things<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.590> come<00:03:31.670> also
