00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.080 
and you can go ahead and eat them later
but<00:01:28.619> they<00:01:28.770> really<00:01:29.340> do<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.909> cool

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
but they really do like the cool

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.090 
but they really do like the cool
temperatures<00:01:30.600> now<00:01:30.840> as<00:01:31.560> well<00:01:31.770> as<00:01:31.890> something

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
temperatures now as well as something

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.380 
temperatures now as well as something
like<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.340> may<00:01:32.430> notice<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> parsley<00:01:33.000> before

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
like you may notice the parsley before

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.910 
like you may notice the parsley before
and<00:01:33.509> it's<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:33.750> fresh<00:01:34.110> at<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.439> time<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.710> year

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
and it's so fresh at this time of year

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.590 
and it's so fresh at this time of year
and<00:01:35.040> something<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.640> green<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.270> looks

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
and something so green and just looks

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.749 
and something so green and just looks
wonderful<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.350> pot<00:01:37.590> but<00:01:38.130> also<00:01:38.460> something

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
wonderful in a pot but also something

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.490 
wonderful in a pot but also something
you<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.090> eat<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.299> taste<00:01:39.509> good<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.409> think

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
you can eat and taste good and I think

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.480 
you can eat and taste good and I think
that's<00:01:40.710> really<00:01:40.920> important<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.250> think<00:01:41.340> about

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
that's really important to think about

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.920 
that's really important to think about
when<00:01:41.759> you're<00:01:41.880> doing<00:01:42.090> your<00:01:42.119> spring<00:01:42.450> containers

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
when you're doing your spring containers

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.780 
when you're doing your spring containers
to<00:01:43.770> think<00:01:43.979> about<00:01:44.189> having<00:01:44.490> something<00:01:44.670> that

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
to think about having something that

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.880 
to think about having something that
looks<00:01:45.119> good<00:01:45.360> but<00:01:46.049> also<00:01:46.200> something<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.619> can

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
looks good but also something you can

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.560 
looks good but also something you can
enjoy<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.399> eat<00:01:47.549> as<00:01:47.700> well<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.119> if<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.299> put<00:01:48.540> a

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
enjoy and eat as well so if you put a

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.690 
enjoy and eat as well so if you put a
container<00:01:49.049> together<00:01:49.320> think<00:01:50.130> about<00:01:50.250> maybe

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
container together think about maybe

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.760 
container together think about maybe
using<00:01:51.000> something<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.540> some<00:01:51.810> perennials<00:01:52.320> and

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
using something like some perennials and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.740 
using something like some perennials and
then<00:01:53.340> something<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:53.820> again<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.390> spring

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
then something that again is a spring

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.649 
then something that again is a spring
plant<00:01:55.100> some<00:01:56.100> snapdragons<00:01:56.790> which<00:01:56.969> do<00:01:57.240> good<00:01:57.509> in

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
plant some snapdragons which do good in

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.780 
plant some snapdragons which do good in
the<00:01:57.780> cooler<00:01:57.960> weather<00:01:58.140> but<00:01:58.229> also<00:01:58.530> do<00:01:59.280> good<00:01:59.549> in

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
the cooler weather but also do good in

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.039 
the cooler weather but also do good in
the<00:01:59.969> warm<00:02:00.149> weather<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:00.450> that's<00:02:00.719> kind<00:02:00.869> of<00:02:00.899> a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
the warm weather so that's kind of a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.679 
the warm weather so that's kind of a
long<00:02:01.439> extended<00:02:01.950> season<00:02:02.579> flower<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.420> when<00:02:03.600> you

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
long extended season flower so when you

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.929 
long extended season flower so when you
plant<00:02:03.990> plant<00:02:04.710> these<00:02:04.920> different<00:02:05.460> containers

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
plant plant these different containers

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.700 
plant plant these different containers
and<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.149> think<00:02:06.390> about<00:02:06.600> some<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.049> these<00:02:07.140> cooler

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
and you think about some of these cooler

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.609 
and you think about some of these cooler
weather<00:02:08.009> plants<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.390> should<00:02:10.050> your<00:02:10.200> goal<00:02:10.379> to

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
weather plants so should your goal to

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.190 
weather plants so should your goal to
kind<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.009> be<00:02:11.190> different<00:02:12.060> plants<00:02:12.599> maybe<00:02:12.989> you'll

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
kind of be different plants maybe you'll

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.890 
kind of be different plants maybe you'll
be<00:02:13.319> taking<00:02:13.680> some

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
be taking some

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.449 
be taking some
during<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.349> summertime<00:02:14.620> maybe<00:02:14.980> you'll<00:02:15.280> keep

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
during the summertime maybe you'll keep

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.920 
during the summertime maybe you'll keep
some<00:02:15.670> of<00:02:15.700> them<00:02:15.909> in<00:02:16.060> that's<00:02:16.299> right<00:02:16.569> usually

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
some of them in that's right usually

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.539 
some of them in that's right usually
just<00:02:17.349> got<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.709> whole<00:02:17.829> thing<00:02:18.099> and<00:02:18.250> started

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
just got the whole thing and started

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:19.920 
just got the whole thing and started
well<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:18.879> can<00:02:19.000> do<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.180> either<00:02:19.329> way<00:02:19.450> really

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
well you can do it either way really

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.240 
well you can do it either way really
there<00:02:20.110> are<00:02:20.170> some<00:02:20.319> ways<00:02:20.470> sometimes<00:02:21.010> you<00:02:21.129> can

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
there are some ways sometimes you can

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.979 
there are some ways sometimes you can
plan<00:02:21.430> some<00:02:21.640> really<00:02:21.879> nice<00:02:22.000> plants<00:02:22.360> like<00:02:22.510> Ivy's

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
plan some really nice plants like Ivy's

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.270 
plan some really nice plants like Ivy's
which<00:02:23.170> will<00:02:23.409> look<00:02:23.590> good<00:02:23.739> through<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.069> summer

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
which will look good through the summer

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.830 
which will look good through the summer
and<00:02:24.579> then<00:02:24.700> go<00:02:24.819> ahead<00:02:24.909> and<00:02:25.030> just<00:02:25.239> fill<00:02:25.480> in<00:02:25.810> the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
and then go ahead and just fill in the

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.449 
and then go ahead and just fill in the
plants<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:26.379> don't<00:02:26.590> look<00:02:26.769> so<00:02:26.950> good<00:02:27.069> later<00:02:27.310> in

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
plants that don't look so good later in

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.429 
plants that don't look so good later in
the<00:02:27.549> season<00:02:27.760> or<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:28.659> can<00:02:28.840> go<00:02:28.959> ahead<00:02:29.049> and<00:02:29.200> use

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:29.439 
the season or you can go ahead and use

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:30.929 
the season or you can go ahead and use
something<00:02:29.680> like<00:02:29.950> this<00:02:30.099> Columbine<00:02:30.670> like<00:02:30.819> I

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:30.939 
something like this Columbine like I

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.309 
something like this Columbine like I
said<00:02:31.120> before<00:02:31.420> now<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.569> is<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:31.900> spring

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
said before now that is a spring

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.800 
said before now that is a spring
flowering<00:02:32.650> that's<00:02:32.859> a<00:02:32.920> perennial<00:02:33.310> but<00:02:34.299> that

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
flowering that's a perennial but that

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.300 
flowering that's a perennial but that
looks<00:02:35.049> really<00:02:35.230> good<00:02:35.439> now<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.799> won't<00:02:35.950> look<00:02:36.159> in

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
looks really good now it won't look in

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.039 
looks really good now it won't look in
the<00:02:36.430> summer<00:02:36.609> it'll<00:02:36.819> be<00:02:36.879> done<00:02:37.090> blooming<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:37.840> I

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
the summer it'll be done blooming so I

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.330 
the summer it'll be done blooming so I
say<00:02:38.290> go<00:02:38.439> ahead<00:02:38.470> and<00:02:38.650> plant<00:02:38.829> them<00:02:38.950> in<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.099> spring

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
say go ahead and plant them in a spring

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.559 
say go ahead and plant them in a spring
container<00:02:39.640> but<00:02:39.849> then<00:02:39.970> when<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.209> take<00:02:40.359> it<00:02:40.510> out

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
container but then when you take it out

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.140 
container but then when you take it out
put<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.349> in<00:02:41.439> your<00:02:41.590> garden<00:02:41.939> because<00:02:42.939> it's<00:02:43.090> a

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
put it in your garden because it's a

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.940 
put it in your garden because it's a
perennial<00:02:43.420> they'll<00:02:44.109> come<00:02:44.319> back<00:02:44.439> next<00:02:44.650> year<00:02:44.769> so

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
perennial they'll come back next year so

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.020 
perennial they'll come back next year so
you<00:02:45.040> have<00:02:45.189> it<00:02:45.280> in<00:02:45.340> your<00:02:45.459> garden<00:02:45.579> next<00:02:45.879> year<00:02:45.970> as

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
you have it in your garden next year as

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.819 
you have it in your garden next year as
well<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:46.209> you've<00:02:46.329> got<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.480> container<00:02:46.959> plant<00:02:47.230> and

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
well so you've got a container plant and

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.020 
well so you've got a container plant and
