having it's a clipless pedal but it has

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.000 
having it's a clipless pedal but it has
a<00:00:34.040> external<00:00:35.040> cage<00:00:35.450> now<00:00:36.450> who<00:00:37.380> would<00:00:37.559> use<00:00:37.800> this

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
a external cage now who would use this

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.910 
a external cage now who would use this
pedal<00:00:38.480> maybe<00:00:39.480> someone<00:00:40.140> who<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:42.170> does<00:00:43.170> more

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
pedal maybe someone who is does more

clipped in but at the same time wants a
large<00:00:51.960> platform<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:53.070> they<00:00:53.250> could<00:00:53.430> step<00:00:53.699> on

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
large platform that they could step on

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.569 
large platform that they could step on
in<00:00:54.210> case<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.520> they<00:00:56.520> are<00:00:56.789> not<00:00:57.000> clipped<00:00:57.360> in

in case that they are not clipped in

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.920 
in case that they are not clipped in
most<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> people<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.210> will<00:01:00.329> use<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> flat

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
most of the people that will use a flat

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.950 
most of the people that will use a flat
pedal<00:01:01.140> would<00:01:01.559> be<00:01:02.180> someone<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.210> maybe<00:01:03.539> just

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
pedal would be someone that maybe just

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.170 
pedal would be someone that maybe just
rides<00:01:04.470> their<00:01:04.710> mountain<00:01:05.010> bike<00:01:05.159> casually<00:01:05.880> and

rides their mountain bike casually and
doesn't<00:01:06.630> want<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.960> use<00:01:07.290> clipless<00:01:08.070> pedals<00:01:09.560> also

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
doesn't want to use clipless pedals also

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.429 
doesn't want to use clipless pedals also
this<00:01:11.280> pedal<00:01:11.640> itself<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.210> kind<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.630> nicer

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
this pedal itself is kind of a nicer

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.820 
this pedal itself is kind of a nicer
pedal<00:01:14.060> that<00:01:15.060> maybe<00:01:15.450> your<00:01:15.780> real<00:01:16.110> casual<00:01:16.650> riders

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
pedal that maybe your real casual riders

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.370 
pedal that maybe your real casual riders
wouldn't<00:01:17.400> want<00:01:17.610> because<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.630> really<00:01:19.020> sticky

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
wouldn't want because it's really sticky

wouldn't want because it's really sticky
it<00:01:19.740> has<00:01:20.009> these<00:01:20.189> these<00:01:20.540> pins<00:01:21.540> here<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:22.049> really

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
it has these these pins here that really

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.330 
it has these these pins here that really
grip<00:01:22.650> your<00:01:22.890> your<00:01:23.400> foot<00:01:24.890> they<00:01:25.890> may<00:01:26.100> not<00:01:26.280> want

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
this type of pedal with the pins but

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.330 
this type of pedal with the pins but
they<00:01:29.280> would<00:01:29.490> want<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.909> flat<00:01:30.240> pedal<00:01:30.450> now<00:01:31.380> who

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
they would want a flat pedal now who

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.190 
they would want a flat pedal now who
might<00:01:32.640> want<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.060> use<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.540> pedal<00:01:33.810> would<00:01:34.079> be

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
might want to use this pedal would be

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.590 
might want to use this pedal would be
someone<00:01:34.500> who's<00:01:34.680> doing<00:01:35.070> maybe<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:36.299> know<00:01:36.420> like

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
someone who's doing maybe you know like

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.230 
someone who's doing maybe you know like
serious<00:01:37.200> mountain<00:01:37.680> biking<00:01:38.070> either<00:01:38.610> racing

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
serious mountain biking either racing

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.270 
serious mountain biking either racing
downhill<00:01:39.509> or<00:01:40.130> something<00:01:41.130> else<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:43.280> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
downhill or something else like that the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.600 
downhill or something else like that the
advantage<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.780> clipless<00:01:46.290> pedal<00:01:46.890> versus<00:01:47.579> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
advantage of a clipless pedal versus a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.080 
advantage of a clipless pedal versus a
flat<00:01:48.210> pedal<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:49.820> you're<00:01:50.820> actually

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
flat pedal is that you're actually

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.090 
flat pedal is that you're actually
clipped<00:01:51.720> into<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> pedal<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.240> some<00:01:54.240> people

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
clipped into the pedal and some people

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.730 
clipped into the pedal and some people
maybe<00:01:56.450> have<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> little<00:01:57.840> bit<00:01:57.990> more<00:01:58.259> control<00:01:58.710> of

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
maybe have a little bit more control of

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.240 
maybe have a little bit more control of
their<00:01:59.040> bicycle<00:02:00.590> when<00:02:01.590> they're<00:02:01.799> clipped<00:02:02.070> in

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
their bicycle when they're clipped in

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.030 
their bicycle when they're clipped in
versus<00:02:02.820> not<00:02:03.090> clipped<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:04.409> advantage<00:02:04.890> of

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
versus not clipped in the advantage of

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.089 
versus not clipped in the advantage of
this<00:02:05.430> pedal<00:02:05.729> over<00:02:06.060> these<00:02:06.960> two<00:02:07.320> pedals<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.860> is

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
this pedal over these two pedals that is

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.470 
this pedal over these two pedals that is
basically<00:02:08.899> these<00:02:09.899> two<00:02:10.259> petals<00:02:10.530> in<00:02:10.920> one

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
basically these two petals in one

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.320 
basically these two petals in one
it<00:02:12.900> gives<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.920> some<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.640> features<00:02:14.819> of<00:02:15.060> a

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
it gives you some of the features of a

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.900 
it gives you some of the features of a
flat<00:02:15.569> pedal<00:02:15.780> but<00:02:16.500> also<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.130> features<00:02:17.520> of<00:02:17.550> a

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
flat pedal but also the features of a

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.000 
flat pedal but also the features of a
clipless<00:02:18.360> pedal<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.500> know<00:02:19.620> where<00:02:19.800> you're

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
clipless pedal you know where you're

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.770 
clipless pedal you know where you're
clipped<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.430> but<00:02:20.790> also<00:02:21.000> has<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.360> flat<00:02:21.690> platform

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
clipped in but also has a flat platform

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.680 
clipped in but also has a flat platform
the<00:02:24.780> downside<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.650> this<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:26.099> it's<00:02:26.550> heavy<00:02:26.910> it's

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
the downside to this is it's heavy it's

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.380 
the downside to this is it's heavy it's
it's<00:02:28.020> it's<00:02:28.260> probably<00:02:28.680> heavier<00:02:29.459> than<00:02:29.849> both<00:02:30.150> of

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
it's it's probably heavier than both of
