00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.980
 hello and welcome tsum n24 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.890
 triangle and today we'll take a look 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.800
 together the new opel msa da is now 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.169
 So the opel ms of a new engine 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.589
 Under the hood comes everything at the opel 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:25.749
 was so far at 115 ps and a maximum of 170 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:27.579
 newtonmeter torque conclusion of the opel 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:30.999
 ms puts another shit on it and 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.950
 makes 150 ps or has one 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.120
 maximum torque of 220 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.700
 newton meters 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.320
 the legendary opel kadett e gsi at that time 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.970
 had a two-liter gasoline engine under the 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.740
 hood and accelerated at the same 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.380
 Performance the body in under eight 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.990
 seconds from zero to 100 km h the opel 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.990
 takes a little longer because here stops 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.480
 the time acceptance until 85 seconds what 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.210
 I probably the weight because of the 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.630
 opel ms project about 1.2 tons on the 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.640
 Libra 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.190
 he is in the traffic light so not jumping 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.050
 fastest of the 4 500 for example the 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.280
 It's faster, but it comes too 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.049
 not just on the acceleration 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.450
 visually, the difference is 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.880
 opel ms eg at the front through the lower 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.499
 pulled front bumper gives a side 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.049
 it changed the side skirts and 

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:15.909
 also the lms logo on the c pillar at the rear 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.979
 one recognizes the sportier everything to 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.170
 an example of the new rear approach to the 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:21.460
 Chrome tailpipe and most noticeable 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.439
 of course the rear spoiler 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.840
 By the way, that does not only bring something 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.340
 optically while the normal opel the yes 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.499
 also everywhere knew Skoda has 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.259
 the vehicle with 300 newton on the 

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:34.329
 ground press here are 400 newton 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.039
 but how does the opel lms the 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:38.079
 more sporty convinced by 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.359
 great gear the tracks are short 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.850
 and crisp the brakes one way 

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:44.740
 loan from the corsa opc can be great 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.689
 also dose and pack properly 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.850
 the steering is direct and the landing gear 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.130
 exactly as I imagined 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.420
 Sporty taut the hardness was in 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.670
 our case through the optional 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.200
 I am still reinforcing 18-inch models 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.509
 would recommend because eventually falls 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.649
 I also share my eyes and now I tell 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.749
 you something about my very personal 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.149
 highlight these are the seats the recaro 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:06.429
 sports seats these are extra charge 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.379
 and to have from about 1300 euro 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.239
 but still I would necessarily 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.849
 with configure offer namely a 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.590
 great page stop below us the back 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.299
 Seats can be used as a punishment for 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.519
 adult and adult persons 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.209
 can really travel comfortably 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.340
 not there 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.409
 although the two seats are the ones 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.120
 have a total of 5 drinks holder 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.189
 generated fit in and there are 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.810
 However, the isofix attitude is likely 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.390
 that should not be a great pleasure 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.610
 my recommendation can sit out so can 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.459
 also the luggage compartment volume of 170 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.530
 to about 60 63 liters, depending on how 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.450
 so you measure enlarge cage in and 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.829
 off with the opel lms on the track 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.980
 we come to the price question 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.340
 Let's go from just over 18,000 690 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.200
 Euro 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.019
 then you can do something in 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.220
 fall in love with the optional jobs and / or 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.769
 Of course, in the price list 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.079
 lose dutiable as I said the 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.450
 Recaro seats who needs more space 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.069
 So opel ms who so more often three 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.170
 there should be something else on the way 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.090
 Wait because at the latest in game wait there 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.549
 me also the new sportier corsa 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.920
 then the new opel corsa opc 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.360
 sporting driving values ​​should deliver for 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.250
 but those who have a small one 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.739
 city flitzer looking for not boring 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.060
 around the corner might be the ms 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.129
 be an alternative 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.989
 for the extremely sporty ambitious 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.810
 Car drivers still wings the note of 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.519
 opel ms is the first opel m at the man 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.909
 that is how to switch off completely 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.459
 according to the youngest now in the fingers and that 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:32.230
 was the preliminary report to the opel rms if 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.849
 like to let you like it easier 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.290
 Of course, this channel also makes sense 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.670
 to subscribe and if you have questions 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.989
 You are welcome to comment 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.680
 I would say until the next video 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.680
 dance
