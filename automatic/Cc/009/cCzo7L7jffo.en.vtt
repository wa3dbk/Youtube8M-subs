00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 in the time where I am also very strict 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.440
 and low carb enders I have 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.870
 Of course many many alternatives 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.590
 wanted like potatoes, for example 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.330
 bread or rice and just that 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.230
 I want you today a hammer 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.020
 alternative shows like you're wrong 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.640
 Price produces everything you need 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:31.619
 is shows she thinks I'd prefer it 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.279
 the puzzle solution is cauliflower with which 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.140
 we start 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.870
 quite simply if they give us one 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.239
 knife and start now 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.980
 cut off these leaves here 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.460
 you all leaves away that only remains 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.680
 a flowers upside down and now trying 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.180
 you just just florish the individual 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.180
 cut off here 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.770
 that looked like that 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.690
 and these cauliflower florets make the dough 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.449
 I just put my sink in here 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.960
 you clean up the whole and in the end 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.060
 stay like this a stream for over see 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.400
 the broccoli are in my blush 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.630
 washbasin house what I short now you 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.509
 Can you make this recipe 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.350
 of course also frozen 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.470
 use cauliflower 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.619
 However, that does not taste much 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.869
 as well as cabbage with fresh flowers 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.150
 I already have the subject of frozen vegetables 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.680
 recently made a video when you 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.540
 to my opinion may know 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.939
 you get this up here or here somewhere 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.070
 vividly linked that before you the 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.229
 set you your cauliflower in a 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.240
 thermomix or in another recipe 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.790
 I make a us machine pure 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.190
 the big pieces one more 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.370
 very little tick smaller so all 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.530
 about the same size of bluesport 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.970
 is packed if you have a thermomix 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.490
 then you can with the spatula 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.009
 Great work on stage five to six 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.380
 Are you doing broccoli now ? 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.240
 as a small you have always looked purely 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.369
 this is not a mushy pampe that too long 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.470
 but that makes such a nice one 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.500
 consistency gets and another with a 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.300
 movie shredder does that work 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.100
 Of course you can too 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.050
 not all the cauliflower at once 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.190
 It must be easy to do it in portions 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.190
 to two or three but 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.310
 look for it 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:27.129
 the wrong rice is almost ready 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.940
 this cauliflower mail so i want it 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.970
 let's call it 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.590
 Are you doing either in the now ? 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.290
 microwave so a microwave 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.980
 suitable vessel make cover on it and 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.400
 without water 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.360
 at full throttle for five to seven minutes 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.060
 gifts 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.220
 I do not do that I'm not the one 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.870
 biggest in front of the microwave is called 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.450
 not that I do not do anything in it 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.160
 but if I can then I do something like that 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.099
 better in a pot 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:57.430
 or trees like to steam or 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:00.370
 shelves and here I have one 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.540
 cool essay a dempf use and 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.579
 Here you see already how the rear 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.709
 Water is boiling around this damper insert 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.890
 I can just do it on top 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.790
 and I now have my cauliflower 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.790
 mail in 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.470
 that's about half of it 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.900
 Cauliflower here in my damper of 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.639
 finders is important that you 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.579
 now as here simply the lid on it 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.889
 just do it again and again 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.440
 times briefly untouched because thereby that 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:31.389
 this little floral coal mine 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.230
 of course, the pores a bit 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:38.049
 become clogged which is at cauliflower 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.569
 below other than the above so all 12 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.700
 minutes just once shortly before in so 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.970
 simply the cauliflower medic 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.340
 wrong rice gets warm and then that is 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.349
 wonderful thing with the other half 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.970
