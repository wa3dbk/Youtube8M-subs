00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.260
 if it comes to telephoto lenses then 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.719
 Focal comes to mind 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.910
 distance from 70 to 200 millimeters 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.800
 every self-respecting producer in 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.050
 Arsenal has several options for glasses 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.029
 with such tasty and diaphragm 2 and 8 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.519
 third-party producers have to 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.680
 offer similar price lenses 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.420
 in two or even 3 times cheaper for 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.189
 savings have to pay not 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.320
 the highest quality optics average 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.669
 autofocus and more frequent marriage but 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.610
 recently one of these companies 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.950
 introduced 70200 28 without compromise 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.950
 We look at it to find a drop from tamron 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.789
 everyone is accustomed to expect from third-party 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.160
 Optics manufacturers loose 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.030
 designs cheap plastic and gum but 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.980
 it's not like that 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.899
 the body is solid and tight rings 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.610
 focus management and zooms inspire 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.530
 trust manufacturer declares 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.420
 high-quality heat and moisture protection under 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.640
 I did not wash the lens with a crane but in the snow and 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.320
 begging rain took a lot of everything ok 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.909
 you can not worry about the way 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.710
 confidence in this very defense 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.510
 eloquently says branded 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.220
 five year warranty war tna and 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.720
 natural metal mount 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.180
 tripod leg integrated into the body 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.159
 turns and clamped that way 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.110
 as needed in the kit is plastic 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.909
 a blend of impressive size about 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.450
 glare and stray light can not 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.460
 bathe 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.680
 thread under the filter 77 millimeters 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.869
 this is a de facto professional standard 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.090
 segment in the optical circuit is used 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.979
 twenty three elements in 17 groups at 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.960
 focus and zoom sizes 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.240
 Lens do not change nothing 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.590
 scrolling letters type in marking 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.630
 means that in this lens there is 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.310
 optical stabilizer company 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.270
 declares exposure compensation before 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.189
 four steps 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.740
 in practice, the results are close to 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.630
 declared diaphragm here 9 petal 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.759
 therefore circles of unsharpness turn out 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.649
 beautiful evenly shaped big plus when 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.659
 shooting staged and reportage 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.700
 portraits for which this glass is bigger 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.560
 everything fits without a lens almost 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.780
 one and a half kilograms is less than 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.670
 competitors the situation with such dimensions 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.100
 I was most worried about the question 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.290
 speed and accuracy of autofocus for 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.170
 telephoto lens is an important issue and 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.510
 tamron 70200 2 and 8 did not pump up the motor 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.340
 works quickly and silently in household and 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.470
 street photos of this enough for the eyes 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.900
 in sport the lens also behaves 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.760
 confident and is found there where you need from 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.530
 their original fellows behind 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.840
 quite a bit about 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.900
 vignetting and chromatic aberration 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.890
 it worked well for it 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.930
 slight manifestation of such defects 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.160
 easily compensated by automation 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.019
 modern cameras 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.910
 the level of distortion is generally the lowest in 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.080
 class what worries most 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.090
 real buyers 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.000
 Of course, this device indicators 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.590
 sharpness on the open aperture and lo and behold 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.330
 cam'ron here also showed himself well done 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.150
 no detail by no means 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.790
 perfect on aperture 28 especially 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.700
 edges and especially at 200 millimeters but also 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.760
 the original version 70200 28 such 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.099
 could not boast 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.049
 nevertheless on the diaphragm 2 and 8 shoot 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.030
 you can and you just if you want 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.709
 get maximum detail and more 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.629
 strong background blur does not play 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.329
 such a role is better to hide behind 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.849
 4 or even 5 6 in the end this glass 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.799
 is a great alternative 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.810
 original 70200 2 and 8 for people 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:15.909
 who used to count their money and 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.769
 to choose the most successful on the relation 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.489
 price-quality products good sharpness 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.319
 are open 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.359
 efficiency stabilizer minimum 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.790
 optical defects beautiful tanks 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:26.500
 fast autofocus heat and moisture protection 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.750
 tamron has put a maximum 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.269
 effort to go teach you on your 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.349
