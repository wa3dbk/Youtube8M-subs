 scenic plus cuckled the photo the 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.900
 destiny here is the fault I would have

 well his work on the fingers I 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:22.949
 still if the letter a beautiful devil 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:24.660
 that's why a guy or so you can 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.990
 this with a co with no like a 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.080
 magnifying glass 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.990
 wesh boss and lalouch bump with that because 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.600
 that I have the victim s what you 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.920
 human we suppose that same meaning 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.020
 the view that drops t but I prefer 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.930
 the fatah photos is not new go there 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.660
 you and that's a sound that's because 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.430
 karl guitl 5th the wii is this karl so 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.910
 Here expensive ours had a taste 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.960
 superb accor range 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.730
 so he's the one who made you the request 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.020
 you know you plug it in for the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.210
 say that it's only in May that's all 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:59.309
 to reduce the sugar then in France 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.840
 okay so super there are two 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.409
 techniques morning geagea time thierry 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:09.479
 tip it will save me happy from their 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.939
 small so realized there are two techniques 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.979
 in the wood there is the technique of wood 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.049
 on top of the queue wood like that which is 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.680
 so that's a normal plancha we're leaving 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.360
 on the board it's super hero chador 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.150
 and then after the other technique that have 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.369
 thirsty me why that is to say that I 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.860
 am instead of being in the sense of wood 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.030
 like that I'm on the wood fiber 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.340
 on the tracks really damn hard like 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.170
 noise like that and work and 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.189
 little moves from there I work I 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.020
 works in the office as on the road 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.000
 rhinestones as safe as on copper 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.729
 in fact and happens to do things 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.560
 more precise but the art the drawing it is 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.930
 made with wireless 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.360
 after ten years yes yes yes yes 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.710
 that 's wood standing that and it's this 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.750
 which was used to make all the vignettes 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.850
 in fact in the catalogs at the time 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.439
 manufrance illustration gilded be 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.180
 the golden gustave illustrations was 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.880
 engraved like that there must he str 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.250
 and the fables of the fountain the things 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.899
 so there and that allows it actually allows 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.950
 the advantages of wood know that it te 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.959
 allows to stall 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.250
 as you are in relief like the 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.480
 typography that allows me to put 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.550
 the image and the text at the same time and 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.410
 to print both we do not follow the 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.480
 all the leather we are like that between them 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.709
 you can not print the text it's a 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.630
 technique everything is different from the 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.760
 pressure and that at the same time is more 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.239
 beautiful that's it that's what it's for 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.000
 soft waist 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.519
 I made Havana that's stuff 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.440
 I did in Cuba with an engraver 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.730
 to attract to his studio but without doing 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.150
 as they have not since since we did it on 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.150
 plastic 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.709
 he knows but here I actually d5 a 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.530
 end that because he drew to the other 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.569
 other china 1 1 then I remove all 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.450
 the white to keep that his trait I 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.220
 keep that his tract 1 the case of my 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.030
 nose finish like yaz we wait for you 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.290
 put on time it's a trick of two of 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.380
 favorites because I see it's digging 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.660
 an ok I just drew there and after you 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.489
 can be reused as a roof a 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.380
 wood when he is good when he is well 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.510
 stable and where you can shoot five hundred 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.049
 thousand months they worked and I 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.790
 hold that number to cart if you measure 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.790
 wood are 18th 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.610
 indeed in the seventies 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.520
 because it's a fund of a 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.450
 printing press so religious months 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.830
 religious 7th it is is reused for 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.730
 to make posters of built or 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.710
 use some tricks for 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.200
 reworked over yes no no no 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.030
 we were forbidden to visualize the 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.230
 wood of the eighteenth century to make use of the 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.180
 consul is built up to the 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.650
 50's and 60 's okay that's according to the 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.690
 same method it's exactly the same 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.280
 technical 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.770
 it's exactly the same thing but because 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.600
 that at each passage it crushes seen 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.430
 that the focus tender like a poem and a 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.900
 really less pressure than eight 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.790
 brass days so in fact there is a 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.620
 wear that is less on wood than 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.050
 because the lead when you quentin 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.930
 question that matters is the lead 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.610
 it's us too whose voice the evaluation 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.530
 is actually then at the origin of this 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.360
 technique is the pro tak wood and who 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.990
 is an 11th wood that has been found 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:17.160
 calais 1 2 a saint calais church a 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:20.040
 thing he has I know it corresponds to 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.480
 its airlock and thumbnails these different 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:27.150
 we all have a game worked on that and that 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.390
 it's wood that served in my opinion 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.940
 a bonus and not from or from 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.500
 tapestry or fabric 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.090
 originally sees it first woods 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.860
 since there are no papers of course 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.230
 a bright white mink hours 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.490
 was doing on parchment and paper 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.410
 did not exist in the printed matter 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.030
 tissues with the first few months 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.190
 found in sunlight things not 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.830
 only for the arenas of NÃ®mes 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.730
 all saints patterns we see the voice he 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.680
 are halls and drinks 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.710
 so the super guys but who could have 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.210
 to sting and repique and others who 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.190
 did not know skimped actually so and 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.840
 copy writers so zero and then 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.750
 little by little it gets lost its lost in 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:09.090
 quality in definition goes it seems to me 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:14.920
 alas that's a good then the fingers 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:20.290
 are really tired face 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:21.970
 saint georges slaying finally yes low 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:31.650
 and naive is not funny 1000 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:31.650
 victories at the good ben here
