00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
with the kid and it's not like a really

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.280

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
eating only my stuff today not eating

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.780

any other extra snackage no checks Nick

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:51.500 
any other extra snackage no checks Nick
no<00:01:42.150> cupcake<00:01:49.160> I'm<00:01:50.160> actually<00:01:50.400> doing<00:01:51.060> really

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
no cupcake I'm actually doing really

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.370 
no cupcake I'm actually doing really
well

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
well

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.410 
well
calories<00:01:53.040> today<00:01:53.490> pretty<00:01:54.270> impressive<00:01:54.690> now<00:01:55.320> I

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
calories today pretty impressive now I

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.690 
calories today pretty impressive now I
hate<00:01:57.420> really<00:01:57.810> well<00:01:57.960> yesterday<00:01:58.700> impressed

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
hate really well yesterday impressed

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.260 
hate really well yesterday impressed
with<00:01:59.850> myself<00:02:00.080> again

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.770 

so<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.530> think<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:05.189> really<00:02:05.220> does<00:02:05.670> just<00:02:05.700> take<00:02:06.180> you

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
so I think it really does just take you

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.199 
so I think it really does just take you
know<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:07.229> couple<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.710> days<00:02:07.890> maybe<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.399> week<00:02:08.489> to

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
know a couple of days maybe a week to

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.900 
know a couple of days maybe a week to
get<00:02:09.360> yourself<00:02:09.890> back<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.310> know<00:02:11.430> into<00:02:11.790> the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
get yourself back you know into the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.740 
get yourself back you know into the
swing<00:02:12.180> or<00:02:12.599> into<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.349> swing<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.680> begin<00:02:13.950> with

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
swing or into the swing to begin with

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.130 
swing or into the swing to begin with
you<00:02:15.750> know<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.610> get<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.760> ball<00:02:17.790> rolling<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.900> guess

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
you know to get the ball rolling I guess

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.490 
you know to get the ball rolling I guess
in<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.769> right<00:02:19.920> direction<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.880> then<00:02:21.319> it's<00:02:22.319> so

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
in the right direction and then it's so

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.559 
in the right direction and then it's so
much<00:02:22.650> easier<00:02:22.680> once<00:02:23.370> you've<00:02:23.550> started<00:02:23.970> making

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
much easier once you've started making

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.750 
much easier once you've started making
the<00:02:24.660> right<00:02:24.810> choices<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.349> continue<00:02:26.130> doing<00:02:26.489> so

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
the right choices to continue doing so

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.280 
the right choices to continue doing so
you<00:02:27.120> know<00:02:29.330> I'm<00:02:30.330> feeling<00:02:30.510> really<00:02:30.720> down<00:02:31.140> today

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290
