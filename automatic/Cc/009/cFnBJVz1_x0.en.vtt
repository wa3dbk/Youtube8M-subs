00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.520
 i 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:17.480
 and that this is the final product of the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.670
 Advanced body design course 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.279
 Well you have several things for example this 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.510
 automatic slider that is showing photos 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.250
 what 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.380
 we would define it as the place to which 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.840
 we are doing the project in this 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.300
 case is the fictional comet hotel 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.239
 so let's go see how it has 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.850
 this effect parallax then things 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.559
 they move and appear in conformity 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.690
 we're going to be scrolling the 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.059
 page for example let's say that these are 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.250
 the price packages then if you want 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.769
 Read more information here just gives 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.489
 the round and it shows you more data about 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:58.140
 of this in the section of rooms that in 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:01.680
 this case are not rooms are just photos 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.940
 we have filters with css3 in images 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.520
 to create this transition effect 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.390
 here by taxi reservation is the most 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.130
 interesting is the map because right now 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.470
 they saw it because I already granted permits 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.750
 to the page but the page asks you for the 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.440
 geolocation then you draw a 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.470
 route between your point between where are you 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.900
 and the place in this case is the 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.870
 Hotel address no 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.370
 another thing is this slider that is made 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.370
 with pure 63 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.130
 quite 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.830
 is responsive even one of the parties 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.770
 interesting is that 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.980
 because even the map is responsive everything is 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.640
 responsive 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.560
 it looks 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:56.530
 they come in cell phones and computers 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.480
 ok then you will learn a lot of 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.240
 things you will learn 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.250
 then sliders to 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.369
 all part of html all the part of 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.170
 ccs how the page works how 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.119
 the part of the server works 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.069
 from the front on how to upload your page 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.150
 Internet 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:18.220
 and then google maps that in this 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.569
 case is a more advanced than what is 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.000
 want for example on my first page 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.680
 web because we will access the services 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.630
 to trace the route 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.540
 responsive and a lot of other things comes out 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.450

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.340
