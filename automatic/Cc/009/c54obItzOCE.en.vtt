00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.100
 I am with that as they are we are 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:09.219
 seeing these pretty modern reeboks the 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.170
 line girl this model is called wild 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.600
 wild 2 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.170
 well let's talk a little about this 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.400
 model and the components of it has 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.400
 a lot more 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.050
 of this textile mesh 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.960
 pretty good porous ventilated 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.199
 breathable together with these 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.510
 segments of synthetic fibers and that 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:36.430
 they avoid enough stitching on the tongue 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.079
 that we noticed a quite porous revolt 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.360
 It's a sneaker to attract to run 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.900
 on rough terrain as we can see the 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:47.510
 sole and the typical sic sole 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.410
 in zig zag or we will notice that the book 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.510
 well to transmit on it 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.399
 a blow that we have in the heel and 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.469
 transmitted through these waves and 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.589
 make it energy to be able to push there 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.100
 is and the rubber sole with these 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:07.830
 very flexible cuts there is of the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.650
 Cam proportion is 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.920
 considered valid when declaring it we are going to 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.920
 to have 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.290
 well quickly 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.600
 on average three and a half almost pictures 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.990
 let's give it to go around this 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.930
 footwear 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.610
 and I'm sorry you have this chassis 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:37.180
 polyurethane that helped us give 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.460
 good better tread to more stable mass 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.790
 let's see the inside of the 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.790
 template 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:50.720
 the color black is a medium quite like 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.840
 a more comfortable footprint the part of the 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.990
 internal is re meshed orange 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.049
 with black and lightning can be seen the 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.020
 pretty comfortable lining been with the 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.289
