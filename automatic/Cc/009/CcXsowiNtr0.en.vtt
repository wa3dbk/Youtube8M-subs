environment through physical sensation
is<00:02:55.569> perception<00:02:56.569> but<00:02:57.170> then<00:02:57.350> as<00:02:57.650> we<00:02:57.800> also<00:02:58.040> sell

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
is perception but then as we also sell

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.470 
is perception but then as we also sell
perception<00:03:00.230> may<00:03:00.470> not<00:03:00.709> be<00:03:01.010> accurate<00:03:01.330> and<00:03:02.330> when

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
perception may not be accurate and when

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.900 
perception may not be accurate and when
a<00:03:02.510> perception<00:03:03.080> is<00:03:03.230> not<00:03:03.260> accurate<00:03:03.700> then<00:03:04.700> it's

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
a perception is not accurate then it's

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.940 
a perception is not accurate then it's
really<00:03:05.269> a<00:03:05.299> belief<00:03:05.750> more<00:03:06.080> than<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.350> perception

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
really a belief more than a perception

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.009 
really a belief more than a perception
and<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.190> bottom<00:03:07.850> line<00:03:08.030> is<00:03:08.180> this<00:03:08.390> the

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
and the bottom line is this the

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.030 
and the bottom line is this the
conclusion<00:03:09.350> is<00:03:09.799> that<00:03:10.090> beliefs<00:03:11.110> run<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.680> genes

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
conclusion is that beliefs run the genes

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.610 
conclusion is that beliefs run the genes
and<00:03:13.450> we<00:03:14.450> know<00:03:14.630> this<00:03:14.870> in<00:03:15.079> many<00:03:15.290> cases

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
and we know this in many cases

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.020 
and we know this in many cases
especially<00:03:15.769> people<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.310> have<00:03:16.640> terminal

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
especially people that have terminal

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.569 
especially people that have terminal
cancer<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.930> only<00:03:18.380> ones<00:03:18.590> I<00:03:18.769> can<00:03:18.799> really<00:03:19.340> get

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
cancer the only ones I can really get

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.539 
cancer the only ones I can really get
out<00:03:19.850> of<00:03:20.090> that<00:03:20.590> pronouncement<00:03:21.590> of<00:03:21.860> death<00:03:21.980> or

and more health through the process so
the<00:03:37.130> bottom<00:03:37.280> line<00:03:37.459> is<00:03:37.640> the<00:03:38.359> truth<00:03:38.660> is<00:03:38.900> you<00:03:39.019> are

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
the bottom line is the truth is you are

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.599 
the bottom line is the truth is you are
not<00:03:39.290> genetically<00:03:39.650> controlled<00:03:40.130> but<00:03:40.400> you're

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
not genetically controlled but you're

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.550 
not genetically controlled but you're
controlled<00:03:41.000> by<00:03:41.180> your<00:03:41.329> perceptions<00:03:41.989> now<00:03:42.380> when

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
controlled by your perceptions now when

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.140 
controlled by your perceptions now when
I<00:03:42.650> extend<00:03:43.040> this<00:03:43.190> in<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.459> next<00:03:43.579> half<00:03:43.880> what<00:03:44.060> I'm

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
I extend this in the next half what I'm

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.610 
I extend this in the next half what I'm
going<00:03:44.390> to<00:03:44.480> extend<00:03:44.720> on<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:45.079> talk<00:03:45.230> about<00:03:45.470> is

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
going to extend on and talk about is

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.340 
going to extend on and talk about is

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
simply this the signals are in the

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:49.960 
simply this the signals are in the
environment<00:03:48.620> are<00:03:49.040> not<00:03:49.220> just<00:03:49.459> physical

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
environment are not just physical

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.300 
environment are not just physical

biologists believe that energy is

systems<00:03:57.709> and<00:03:57.859> I'll<00:03:57.920> demonstrate<00:03:58.130> that<00:03:58.670> as

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
systems and I'll demonstrate that as

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.530 
systems and I'll demonstrate that as
well<00:03:59.750> as<00:04:00.019> as<00:04:00.470> molecules<00:04:01.070> I<00:04:01.400> will<00:04:01.820> also<00:04:02.209> start

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
well as as molecules I will also start

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.170 
well as as molecules I will also start
to<00:04:02.630> talk<00:04:02.810> about<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.650> role<00:04:03.890> of<00:04:04.190> parents<00:04:05.090> and

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
to talk about the role of parents and

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.910 
to talk about the role of parents and
conscious<00:04:05.720> parenting<00:04:06.049> because<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.590> belief

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
conscious parenting because the belief

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.039 
conscious parenting because the belief
of<00:04:07.069> the<00:04:07.160> parents<00:04:07.640> is<00:04:07.700> now<00:04:08.120> recognized<00:04:08.810> to

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
of the parents is now recognized to

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.590 
of the parents is now recognized to
select<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.590> jeans<00:04:09.859> and<00:04:10.069> the<00:04:10.160> fetus<00:04:10.549> that<00:04:11.299> if

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
select the jeans and the fetus that if

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.140 
select the jeans and the fetus that if
you<00:04:12.049> were<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.230> parent<00:04:12.709> or<00:04:12.890> you<00:04:13.640> were<00:04:13.730> once<00:04:13.970> a

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
you were a parent or you were once a

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.569 
you were a parent or you were once a
baby<00:04:14.480> then<00:04:15.290> that<00:04:15.530> would<00:04:15.739> be<00:04:15.859> very<00:04:15.979> important

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
baby then that would be very important

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.530 
baby then that would be very important
to<00:04:16.699> you<00:04:16.820> for<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.090> following<00:04:17.389> reason<00:04:17.840> it

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
to you for the following reason it

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.160 
to you for the following reason it
feels<00:04:18.890> that<00:04:19.940> we<00:04:20.940> were<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.810> life<00:04:21.990> that<00:04:22.110> we

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
feels that we were the life that we

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.740 
feels that we were the life that we
express<00:04:22.470> today<00:04:22.650> was<00:04:23.310> very<00:04:23.910> very<00:04:24.150> much<00:04:24.390> shaped

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
express today was very very much shaped

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.020 
express today was very very much shaped
by<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.380> belief<00:04:25.800> of<00:04:25.950> our<00:04:26.100> parents<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:26.910> I'll

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
by the belief of our parents and I'll

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.910 
by the belief of our parents and I'll
talk<00:04:27.210> about<00:04:27.270> that<00:04:27.540> and<00:04:27.990> then<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.710> most

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
talk about that and then the most

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.940 
talk about that and then the most
important<00:04:29.460> part<00:04:29.700> how<00:04:30.330> belief<00:04:30.810> can<00:04:31.440> rewrite

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
important part how belief can rewrite

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.650 
important part how belief can rewrite
your<00:04:32.310> jeans<00:04:32.700> and<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.090> will<00:04:33.240> show<00:04:33.270> you<00:04:33.450> the

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
your jeans and I will show you the

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.940 
your jeans and I will show you the
science<00:04:33.870> of<00:04:34.080> that<00:04:34.230> when<00:04:34.380> we<00:04:34.470> come<00:04:34.650> back<00:04:34.800> from

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
science of that when we come back from

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.630 
science of that when we come back from
the<00:04:35.100> short<00:04:35.370> break<00:04:35.610> thank<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.360> very<00:04:36.390> much
