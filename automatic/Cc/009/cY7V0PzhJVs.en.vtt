00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.860
 that our journey comes to an end 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.870
 a year later, it turned into 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.820
 his hometown locktow succeeded 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.110

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.810
 get executed 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.370
 the main road was just like today 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.230
 to the place where that creates 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.420
 is built and although he is with 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.370
 This road was handcuffed 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.770
 along as his triumphal procession 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.220
 I still remember exactly 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.229
 this day after the last day in gold 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.670
 what life the government has it only 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.979

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.880
 grabbed for her power 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.070
 demonstrate 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.110
 the will that can never be broken 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.700
 and still have to bend that's him 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.920
 but as long as people are free 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.940
 thirsts and enters for his right 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.440
 he will live forever 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.450
 for a man of his last way 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.060
 A title is not right 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.770
 fit 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.770
 Roger very happy about it 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.480
 although he started his last walk 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.920
 would have 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.920
 He looked like he was proud 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.049
 but the words some just before the 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.540
 Execution spoke led a great 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.390
 an honorable pirate 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:09.740

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.640

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.640
 to kindle a fire 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.070
