really loose and it took them a while

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.400 
really loose and it took them a while
figure<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.850> out<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.239> eventually<00:00:42.420> they<00:00:42.870> said

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
figure it out and eventually they said

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.750 
figure it out and eventually they said
well<00:00:43.620> we've<00:00:43.860> got<00:00:43.890> all<00:00:44.100> these<00:00:44.219> ropes<00:00:44.489> I'm<00:00:44.670> not

well we've got all these ropes I'm not
just<00:00:44.910> set<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.090> climbing<00:00:45.329> ropes<00:00:45.629> they<00:00:45.930> set<00:00:46.110> up

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
just set up climbing ropes they set up

climbing ropes and they set up webbing

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.010 
climbing ropes and they set up webbing
and<00:00:49.520> eventually<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:51.390> webbing<00:00:51.660> got<00:00:51.780> tighter

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
and eventually the webbing got tighter

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.160 
and eventually the webbing got tighter
and<00:00:52.699> people<00:00:53.699> started<00:00:53.969> getting<00:00:54.120> air<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.539> in

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
and people started getting air and in

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.500 
and people started getting air and in

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
kind of started the trick lining

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.430 
kind of started the trick lining
movement<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.629> ever<00:01:00.629> since<00:01:00.840> then<00:01:01.079> we've<00:01:01.260> had<00:01:01.289> a

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
putting it onto the line and it develops

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.380 
putting it onto the line and it develops
a<00:01:10.110> new<00:01:10.140> style<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.770> slack<00:01:11.070> line<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:12.030> that's<00:01:12.210> the

trick line long line high line those are
the<00:01:16.229> three<00:01:16.530> really<00:01:16.770> big<00:01:17.070> parts<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.909> slack

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
the three really big parts of slack

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.080 
the three really big parts of slack
lining<00:01:18.560> not<00:01:19.560> surprisingly<00:01:20.130> safety<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.820> one<00:01:21.000> of

lining not surprisingly safety is one of

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.640 
lining not surprisingly safety is one of
the<00:01:21.180> biggest<00:01:21.330> factors<00:01:21.840> especially<00:01:22.140> for<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
the biggest factors especially for the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.620 
the biggest factors especially for the
high<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.100> long<00:01:23.310> lines<00:01:23.580> but<00:01:24.150> either<00:01:24.330> when

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
high and long lines but either when

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.179 
high and long lines but either when
you're<00:01:24.780> attached<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.320> safety<00:01:25.799> line<00:01:25.950> it

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
you're attached to the safety line it

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.130 
you're attached to the safety line it
doesn't<00:01:26.520> lessen<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.090> fear<00:01:27.270> factor<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:28.020> those

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
doesn't lessen the fear factor but those

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.370 
doesn't lessen the fear factor but those
who<00:01:28.320> test<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.799> air<00:01:28.950> up<00:01:29.159> there<00:01:30.049> safety<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.170> kind

who test the air up there safety is kind

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.740 
who test the air up there safety is kind
of<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.530> relative<00:01:31.920> term<00:01:32.070> certain<00:01:32.820> people<00:01:32.970> need

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
to be safe for me I can control myself

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.270 
to be safe for me I can control myself
on<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.020> line<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.409> without<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.680> harness<00:01:37.920> I'm

tricks to do on the slackline so we've
got<00:03:03.389> people<00:03:03.510> we've<00:03:03.720> only<00:03:03.840> been<00:03:04.019> slack<00:03:04.230> lining

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
got people we've only been slack lining

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.259 
got people we've only been slack lining
for<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.709> year<00:03:05.010> doing<00:03:05.489> things<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:05.880> took<00:03:06.120> us

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
for a year doing things that took us

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.720 
for a year doing things that took us
five<00:03:06.660> or<00:03:06.840> six<00:03:07.019> years<00:03:07.079> to<00:03:07.380> learn<00:03:07.530> because<00:03:07.829> they

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
five or six years to learn because they

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.729 
five or six years to learn because they
see<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:09.090> they<00:03:09.299> know<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.600> they<00:03:09.690> can<00:03:09.810> study<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.170> so

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
see it they know it they can study it so

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:11.860 
see it they know it they can study it so
now<00:03:10.889> we're<00:03:11.040> getting<00:03:11.250> to<00:03:11.280> this<00:03:11.430> point<00:03:11.519> where

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
now we're getting to this point where

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.270 
now we're getting to this point where
progression<00:03:12.870> is<00:03:13.290> going<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.560> disk<00:03:13.889> i<00:03:14.010> rocket

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
progression is going to disk i rocket

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.300 
progression is going to disk i rocket
and<00:03:14.639> the<00:03:15.569> sport<00:03:15.959> is<00:03:16.200> just<00:03:16.500> going<00:03:16.650> to<00:03:16.709> expand

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
and the sport is just going to expand

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.280 
and the sport is just going to expand
exponentially<00:03:18.150> for<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.569> next<00:03:18.780> five<00:03:18.930> or<00:03:18.959> ten

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
exponentially for the next five or ten

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.379 
exponentially for the next five or ten
years<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.739> then<00:03:20.430> hopefully<00:03:20.819> we'll<00:03:21.060> get<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.299> a

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
years and then hopefully we'll get to a

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.120 
years and then hopefully we'll get to a
point<00:03:21.599> where<00:03:21.750> there's<00:03:22.530> not<00:03:22.680> really<00:03:22.859> much<00:03:23.069> that

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
point where there's not really much that

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.440 
point where there's not really much that
