00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
to look for some gas generators but

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.950 
to look for some gas generators but
couldn't<00:00:26.939> find<00:00:27.060> any<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.359> they<00:00:27.449> were<00:00:27.510> all<00:00:27.630> sold

I<00:00:31.260> went<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:32.270> Walmart

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
I went to Walmart

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.389 
I went to Walmart
I<00:00:34.219> found<00:00:35.219> these<00:00:36.530> this<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> battery<00:00:38.610> inverter

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
I found these this is a battery inverter

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.900 
I found these this is a battery inverter
which<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.640> use<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.090> AC<00:00:42.920> power<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.789> it

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
which you can use this AC power and it

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.430 
which you can use this AC power and it
just<00:00:45.120> hooks<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.140> 12<00:00:46.590> volt<00:00:46.800> battery<00:00:48.379> so<00:00:49.379> I

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
just hooks up to a 12 volt battery so I

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.200 
just hooks up to a 12 volt battery so I
got<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.739> hooked<00:00:50.039> up<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.309> my<00:00:50.430> wave<00:00:50.910> maker

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.389 

you<00:00:55.170> know<00:00:55.350> my<00:00:55.500> way<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.710> make<00:00:55.980> her<00:00:56.070> I'll<00:00:56.219> just

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
you know my way to make her I'll just

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.680 
you know my way to make her I'll just
run<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.730> for<00:00:57.410> 15<00:00:58.410> minutes<00:00:59.149> so<00:01:00.149> it'll<00:01:00.329> run<00:01:00.480> for

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
run it for 15 minutes so it'll run for

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.319 
run it for 15 minutes so it'll run for
15<00:01:01.020> minutes<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.739> then<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.370> won't<00:01:02.579> it'll<00:01:03.090> shut

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
15 minutes and then it won't it'll shut

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.260 
15 minutes and then it won't it'll shut
off<00:01:03.449> for<00:01:03.660> 15<00:01:04.019> minutes<00:01:04.339> so<00:01:05.339> I'll<00:01:05.430> get<00:01:05.580> more<00:01:05.729> life

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
off for 15 minutes so I'll get more life

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.330 
off for 15 minutes so I'll get more life
out<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.479> my<00:01:06.630> battery<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.170> then<00:01:08.070> it'll<00:01:08.250> just

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
out of my battery and then it'll just

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.790 
out of my battery and then it'll just
run<00:01:08.729> one<00:01:09.030> power<00:01:09.299> head<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.530> keep<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
run one power head just to keep the

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.020 
run one power head just to keep the
water<00:01:10.979> circulating<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:12.330> my<00:01:12.390> tank<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.850> it's

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
water circulating in my tank and it's

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.700 
water circulating in my tank and it's
pretty<00:01:15.659> easy<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.990> set<00:01:16.200> up<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.440> just<00:01:16.500> got

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
pretty easy to set up you just got

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.240 
pretty easy to set up you just got
plugging<00:01:17.070> into<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.250> battery<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.070> got<00:01:20.220> a

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
plugging into the battery and it's got a

built-in fan

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.350 
built-in fan
it's<00:01:22.790> pretty<00:01:23.060> noisy<00:01:24.070> but<00:01:25.070> it'll<00:01:25.910> help<00:01:26.060> keep

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
it's pretty noisy but it'll help keep

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.670 
it's pretty noisy but it'll help keep
the<00:01:26.480> water<00:01:26.510> circulating<00:01:27.260> when<00:01:27.440> you<00:01:27.500> don't

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.800 
just in case we do lose power so I just
wanted<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.500> show<00:02:27.650> you<00:02:27.680> guys<00:02:27.920> my<00:02:28.390> backup<00:02:29.390> system

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
wanted to show you guys my backup system

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.509 
wanted to show you guys my backup system
just<00:02:30.769> in<00:02:30.890> case<00:02:31.040> we<00:02:31.220> lose<00:02:31.370> power<00:02:31.580> next<00:02:31.970> week<00:02:33.519> it

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
just in case we lose power next week it

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.520 
just in case we lose power next week it
would<00:02:34.610> be<00:02:34.670> ideal<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.090> have<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.530> generator

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
would be ideal to have a generator

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.620 
would be ideal to have a generator
because<00:02:37.370> then<00:02:37.519> I<00:02:37.549> could<00:02:37.700> run<00:02:37.880> my<00:02:37.910> heater<00:02:38.299> and

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
because then I could run my heater and

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.340 
because then I could run my heater and
my<00:02:39.140> return<00:02:39.500> pump<00:02:40.060> but<00:02:41.060> this<00:02:41.209> will<00:02:41.360> work<00:02:41.540> for<00:02:42.080> at

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
my return pump but this will work for at

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.410 
my return pump but this will work for at
least<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:42.709> week<00:02:42.860> just<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.910> keep<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.239> water

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
least a week just to keep the water

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.660 
least a week just to keep the water
movement<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:44.959> keep<00:02:45.769> my<00:02:45.890> fish<00:02:46.100> and<00:02:46.310> corals

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
movement and keep my fish and corals

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.940 
movement and keep my fish and corals
alive
