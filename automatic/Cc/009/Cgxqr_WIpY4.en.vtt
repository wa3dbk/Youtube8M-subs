I've learned over that 23 years of

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.059 
I've learned over that 23 years of
Zildjian<00:03:54.239> is<00:03:54.390> that<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:55.110> can't<00:03:55.410> assume<00:03:55.799> that<00:03:55.860> a

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
Zildjian is that you can't assume that a

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.610 
Zildjian is that you can't assume that a
design<00:03:56.489> in<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:56.790> certain<00:03:57.120> diameter<00:03:57.620> translates

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
design in a certain diameter translates

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.530 
design in a certain diameter translates
into<00:03:58.830> another<00:03:59.220> so<00:03:59.670> there<00:03:59.849> was<00:04:00.000> some<00:04:00.209> some

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
into another so there was some some

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.210 
into another so there was some some
tweaking<00:04:00.840> though<00:04:01.080> that<00:04:01.410> was<00:04:01.560> going<00:04:01.860> on<00:04:01.980> and

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
tweaking though that was going on and

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.780 
tweaking though that was going on and
here's<00:04:02.370> this<00:04:02.549> symbol
