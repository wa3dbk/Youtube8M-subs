00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.890
 the cows are managed according to the state of production they are in 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.699
 that's why they are divided into two groups 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:12.429
 cows the itec 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.099
 the junior bulls 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.980
 It chooses them are those that have higher milk production and therefore are made 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.369
 creditors even more consumption 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:22.749
 enzo concentrate 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:26.829
 the second batch for being in a lower period of production the consumption of 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:28.909
 concentrated is less 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:33.020
 minister said rajoy notwithstanding that he is still the same for Paul two 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:37.609
 lots only that the elite plates are brought to the meadows tips to the 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:40.620
 orders to avoid excessive walking 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.950
 the cows are picked up like this at 11 in the morning 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.620
 taken to the barn where, according to their production, food is offered 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.580
 the cows remain in this place until two o'clock in the afternoon when the 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.249
 milking 

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:59.039
 our livestock the jungle has the necessary equipment to produce the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.050
 best milk in the region 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.310
 for this they have 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.310
 or milking with capacity to milk two phases 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.580
 and each one in its 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.800
 milking are done twice a day 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.800
 at four in the morning and another at two in the afternoon 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.270
 When they start the milking process, the cows leave their stable to 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.270
 be pigeonholed one by one in your cubicle 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.430
 once in their clubs 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.660
 The milking routine that consists of handling the hand in 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.660
 the nipples make a pre-breastfeed 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.740
 canning liners to start the selection process like mechanical milking 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.450
 this system allows the necessary of the cow 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.750
 to the cooling tank without it having any contact with the 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.750
 workers little in the environment of 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.900
 finished the milking process the cows are removed with their calves to a 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.330
 war pen passed where these are extracted the residual milk of the udder 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.640
 achieving thus form larger calves 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.640
 maybe the presence of mastitis in the cow 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.789
 from the corral reviewed the cows a levadas to the prairies previously 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.789
 delimited by the operator with the electrical tape 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:19.709
 the practice of the five electric ones is done two months in the morning that once 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.779
 in the afternoon this guarantees the consumption of fresh samper forage 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.499
 finished the milking process 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:32.429
 but they are separated according to their age meets badosa excellent pastures 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:34.629
 quality 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:41.609
 meters of a thing returning to the room dulko cradle the milk produced is taken 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.579
 two stainless steel tanks which remain at 2 degrees 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.879
 temperature 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.039
 once you have the total product 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:51.809
 this milk is 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:54.979
 pumping to a tank previously installed in a livestock truck 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:58.789
 which maintains the temperature up to 48 hours 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:05.149
 enough time to take the milk to the pasteurizer where it is 

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:08.959
 they perform the physical and chemical analyzes that yield results 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.439
 attitude then it is processed to have pasteurized milk and dairy products
