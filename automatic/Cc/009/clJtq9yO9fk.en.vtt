00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.019
 for good good I can quiet down 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.790
 Please rest assured that this looks like a 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.010
 paella of visit I practice we are here 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.300
 in a park when parkour really is 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.369
 a circuit where your staff is a 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.400
 aerial bike circuit in which if you 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.609
 you fall because bad things happen to you I do not smell 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.080
 epic or young cinematic motivates me 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.519
 came up had seen cinematics and 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.700
 madryn is that there is a circulation 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:37.010
 the film of 007 chapter 57 and I get 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.010
 a couplet that then 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.239
 it's high but it says jacques and jump to 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.309
 all parkour is from street that is 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.809
 handsome country dad is kaka touches you 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.129
 what has allowed it to have form 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.059
 that my good god good not mark no 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.760
 given time to see it was shaped like a 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.440
 Gherkin let's go let's all here 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.030
 down the point we get there takes a 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.890
 opinion pride the victim of the topic of 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.660
 animal please say goodbye male 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.949
 Say goodbye to the bikes because not only 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.290
 yours for quiet guys to see or be 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.100
 It really is hard to know but 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.840
 castilla to change clothes 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.979
 I do not know why it happens that look at the form 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.900
 worth them, let's see why the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.650
 point is down here to show that 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.320
 suspenders 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.180
 I think well I think well I 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.550
 I'm staying a little worth worth down 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.380
 I'm short now I'm fine 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.050
 as bad there are people who have passed as 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.950
 a goal but it's making me fatal 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.899
 then this because that time that does not 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.700
 I played with bike finally we are new 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.500
 and last things are pathetic 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.990
 then there's this career uncle does not pass 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.149
 nothing happens, nothing, life, to be happy 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.470
 but I want to be happy follow our 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.350
 race if we do not finish inferred and 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.179
 that we have to earn them when we are going down 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.030
 perfect perfect perfect us 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:55.050
 we approach the crosshairs have always 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.520
 invested in 296 it's worth it now the thing is 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.259
 between montages is something that is quite 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.670
 complicated because those ten points of 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.860
 control knows if the people already have 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.600
 half an hour that ends today we 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.039

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.560

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.000

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.530
 simply 10 anime control points 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.010
 as I jump with this visit a kangaroo 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.220
 male is stuck because he is stuck 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.620
 16 question because if it jumps 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.110

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.270

 for that foolish nonsense in 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.240
 reality the income 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.070
 my mother I regret the jagÃ¼eyes 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.110
 planito motivates the mind 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.400
 of mouth against cement is about 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.510
