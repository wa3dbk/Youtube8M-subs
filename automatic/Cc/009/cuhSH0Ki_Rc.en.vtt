the first thing we must do is analyze

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.990 
the first thing we must do is analyze
the<00:01:21.550> lie

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
the lie

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.730 
the lie

at is the wind so what Eric's gonna do
he's<00:01:54.099> going<00:01:54.220> to<00:01:54.310> demonstrate<00:01:54.819> by<00:01:54.970> picking<00:01:55.330> up

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
he's going to demonstrate by picking up

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.690 
he's going to demonstrate by picking up
some<00:01:55.599> grass<00:01:55.840> toss<00:01:56.709> it<00:01:56.979> straight<00:01:57.280> into<00:01:57.399> the<00:01:57.550> air

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
some grass toss it straight into the air

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.520 
some grass toss it straight into the air
and<00:01:58.209> you<00:01:58.330> can<00:01:58.509> see<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.869> direction<00:01:59.140> of<00:01:59.410> the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
and you can see the direction of the

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.190 
and you can see the direction of the
wind<00:01:59.649> what<00:02:00.580> we<00:02:00.700> also<00:02:00.879> can<00:02:01.270> check<00:02:01.539> is<00:02:01.750> we<00:02:01.959> look

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
wind what we also can check is we look

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.279 
wind what we also can check is we look
at<00:02:02.319> the<00:02:02.410> clouds<00:02:02.679> top<00:02:03.670> of<00:02:03.849> trees<00:02:04.149> and<00:02:04.660> even<00:02:05.080> the

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
at the clouds top of trees and even the

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:06.479 
at the clouds top of trees and even the
flagstick<00:02:05.800> can<00:02:05.979> tell<00:02:06.160> us<00:02:06.280> which<00:02:06.429> direction

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:06.489 
flagstick can tell us which direction

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:08.820 
flagstick can tell us which direction
the<00:02:07.060> wind<00:02:07.179> is<00:02:07.360> blowing<00:02:07.560> next<00:02:08.560> we're<00:02:08.769> gonna

the wind is blowing next we're gonna
look<00:02:09.099> at<00:02:09.310> if<00:02:09.519> we<00:02:09.700> look<00:02:09.879> at<00:02:10.000> out<00:02:10.149> here<00:02:10.360> towards

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
look at if we look at out here towards

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:11.790 
look at if we look at out here towards
the<00:02:10.780> green<00:02:10.989> we're<00:02:11.200> going<00:02:11.319> to<00:02:11.379> look<00:02:11.470> at<00:02:11.590> where's

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
the green we're going to look at where's

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.400 
the green we're going to look at where's
our<00:02:12.010> potential<00:02:12.550> trouble<00:02:12.989> because<00:02:13.989> we<00:02:14.140> need<00:02:14.290> to

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
our potential trouble because we need to

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.869 
our potential trouble because we need to
know<00:02:14.530> where<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:14.830> trouble<00:02:15.190> is<00:02:15.280> so<00:02:15.489> we<00:02:15.580> can<00:02:15.730> aim

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
know where the trouble is so we can aim

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.150 
know where the trouble is so we can aim
away<00:02:16.090> from<00:02:16.300> is<00:02:16.870> their<00:02:17.170> bunkers<00:02:17.680> as<00:02:17.980> they're

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
away from is their bunkers as they're

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.280 
away from is their bunkers as they're
out<00:02:18.190> of<00:02:18.340> bounds<00:02:18.550> is<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.300> lateral<00:02:19.660> hazards<00:02:20.110> we

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
out of bounds is the lateral hazards we

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.440 
out of bounds is the lateral hazards we
need<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.650> know<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:21.060> next<00:02:22.060> we're<00:02:22.180> gonna<00:02:22.239> look

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450

need to know that next we're gonna look
at<00:02:22.599> the<00:02:22.720> position<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.379> pin<00:02:23.620> is<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.489> pin<00:02:24.700> in

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
at the position of the pin is the pin in

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.369 
at the position of the pin is the pin in
the<00:02:24.970> middle<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.390> green<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:25.900> front<00:02:26.200> of<00:02:26.319> the

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
the middle of the green the front of the

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.110 
the middle of the green the front of the
green<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.800> back<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.310> green<00:02:27.459> is<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.849> tucked

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
green the back of the green is it tucked

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.290 
green the back of the green is it tucked
sometimes<00:02:29.110> greens<00:02:29.470> are<00:02:29.769> 30<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.459> 40<00:02:30.790> yards<00:02:30.909> long

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
sometimes greens are 30 to 40 yards long

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.970 
sometimes greens are 30 to 40 yards long
and<00:02:31.690> that<00:02:32.170> can<00:02:32.319> be<00:02:32.409> a<00:02:32.440> difference<00:02:32.860> of

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
and that can be a difference of

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.440 
and that can be a difference of
sometimes<00:02:33.430> two<00:02:33.730> to<00:02:33.849> three<00:02:34.090> or<00:02:34.180> even<00:02:34.239> four

sometimes two to three or even four

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.750 
sometimes two to three or even four
clubs<00:02:34.959> so<00:02:35.650> we<00:02:35.769> need<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.069> know<00:02:36.220> where<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.550> pin

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
clubs so we need to know where the pin

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.600 
clubs so we need to know where the pin
is<00:02:36.909> position<00:02:37.709> also<00:02:38.709> when<00:02:38.860> I'm<00:02:38.980> surveying<00:02:39.370> the

Niner will a high of my C game I'm more
likely<00:04:14.420> probably<00:04:14.840> gonna<00:04:14.990> have<00:04:15.260> to<00:04:15.470> use<00:04:15.680> an

likely probably gonna have to use an
8-iron<00:04:16.489> or<00:04:16.880> maybe<00:04:17.120> even<00:04:17.209> a<00:04:17.450> 7<00:04:17.870> to<00:04:18.470> make<00:04:18.620> up<00:04:18.799> for

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
the fact that I'm not hitting the golf

the fact that I'm not hitting the golf
ball<00:04:20.480> so<00:04:20.900> well<00:04:21.400> so<00:04:22.570> what<00:04:23.570> we<00:04:23.690> do<00:04:23.900> every<00:04:24.770> single

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
ball so well so what we do every single

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.410 
ball so well so what we do every single
shot<00:04:25.370> when<00:04:25.550> we're<00:04:25.700> on<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:25.880> golf<00:04:26.090> course

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
shot when we're on the golf course

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.310 
shot when we're on the golf course
be<00:04:26.810> it<00:04:26.960> a<00:04:27.110> drive<00:04:27.440> a<00:04:27.830> chip<00:04:28.310> a<00:04:28.550> pitch<00:04:29.000> a<00:04:29.300> putt<00:04:29.660> we

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
be it a drive a chip a pitch a putt we

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.530 
be it a drive a chip a pitch a putt we
must<00:04:30.530> always<00:04:30.800> survey<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.820> golf<00:04:32.030> shot

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
must always survey the golf shot

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.130 
must always survey the golf shot
so<00:04:33.050> again<00:04:33.320> surveying<00:04:34.280> we<00:04:34.790> check<00:04:35.030> the<00:04:35.150> lie<00:04:35.330> we

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
so again surveying we check the lie we

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.740 
so again surveying we check the lie we
check<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.560> slope<00:04:36.860> we<00:04:37.430> check<00:04:37.670> the<00:04:37.880> wind<00:04:38.090> and

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
check the slope we check the wind and

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.840 
check the slope we check the wind and
check<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.140> yardage<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:40.190> check<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.640> pin

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
check the yardage and check the pin

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.050 
check the yardage and check the pin
position<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.870> potential<00:04:42.500> trouble<00:04:42.950> ok<00:04:43.820> and

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
position the potential trouble ok and

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.640 
position the potential trouble ok and
then<00:04:44.210> we<00:04:44.330> have<00:04:44.420> to<00:04:44.540> look<00:04:44.810> internally<00:04:45.320> at

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
then we have to look internally at

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.260 
then we have to look internally at
ourselves<00:04:45.800> and<00:04:46.340> figure<00:04:46.610> out<00:04:46.670> hey<00:04:46.790> where<00:04:47.000> are

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
ourselves and figure out hey where are

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.440 
ourselves and figure out hey where are
we<00:04:47.480> today<00:04:48.160> to<00:04:49.160> help<00:04:49.370> us<00:04:49.580> decide<00:04:49.970> what<00:04:50.210> type<00:04:50.420> of

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
we today to help us decide what type of

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.150 
we today to help us decide what type of
shot<00:04:50.750> we're<00:04:50.960> going<00:04:50.990> to<00:04:51.170> choose<00:04:51.380> and<00:04:51.920> then<00:04:52.040> we

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
shot we're going to choose and then we

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.800 
shot we're going to choose and then we
must<00:04:52.340> figure<00:04:52.580> out<00:04:52.700> what<00:04:53.120> type<00:04:53.390> of<00:04:53.419> situation

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
must figure out what type of situation

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.520 
must figure out what type of situation
is<00:04:54.410> this<00:04:54.560> is<00:04:54.740> it's<00:04:54.919> a<00:04:55.040> red<00:04:55.310> yellow<00:04:56.120> or<00:04:56.360> green

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
is this is it's a red yellow or green

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.170 
is this is it's a red yellow or green
when<00:04:57.530> we<00:04:57.650> take<00:04:57.919> all<00:04:58.130> those<00:04:58.460> factors<00:04:58.940> into

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
when we take all those factors into

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.650 
when we take all those factors into
consideration<00:04:59.980> then<00:05:00.980> the<00:05:01.730> second<00:05:02.270> step<00:05:02.480> of

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
consideration then the second step of

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.420 
consideration then the second step of
preparation<00:05:03.230> for<00:05:03.380> a<00:05:03.470> golf<00:05:03.680> shot<00:05:03.890> would<00:05:04.400> be

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
preparation for a golf shot would be

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.970 
preparation for a golf shot would be
then<00:05:04.760> we<00:05:04.940> can<00:05:05.090> create<00:05:05.300> a<00:05:05.419> game<00:05:05.600> but<00:05:06.590> for<00:05:06.830> now

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
then we can create a game but for now

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.040 
then we can create a game but for now
let's<00:05:07.610> make<00:05:07.820> sure<00:05:07.850> every<00:05:08.300> shot<00:05:08.540> we<00:05:08.690> get<00:05:08.840> on<00:05:08.960> the
