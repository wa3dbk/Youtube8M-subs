00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.030
 or apple cookies 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.380
 remember that you have the recipe for 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.680
 written and detailed in greedy alandia 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.680
 dot com 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.120
 sugar almond butter ground 1 2 and 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.809
 we go to make the bed 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.809
 we go 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.550
 let's start scratching an apple the 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.620
 We had a grater peeled and 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.950
 We give a little cane until we have the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.160
 finite finite 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.640
 well we are finishing and there we have 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.770
 zest of 7 step we put the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.820
 butter in a container where 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.820
 we can put the blender 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.780
 we do the same with sugar in order 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.940
 no more mess 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.760
 with the help of some rods and are 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.010
 electric, much easier because we give 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.670
 cane until it's a creampie like that a 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.670
 little clear 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.360
 you see that he is staying we believe and this 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.140
 we believe and everything 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:34.010
 now we add an egg 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.310
 like that and nothing like always to beat it 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.579
 with them 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.990
 we already have 120 degrees and now we add 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.530
 the flour and everything inside 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.299
 and we are very loaded out to this and nothing 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.320
 remove as a spoon a wooden spoon 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.990
 a spatula to remove it that 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.330
 mix the other ingredients that we 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.880
 missing that are the almond milled there 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.570
 is and the apple that we have scratched 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.640
 principle for inside too 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.470
 I suppose already worthy you see what it is that 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.920
 restoration with it, of course, yes 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.450
 mix everything today is to mix and little 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.670
 more come 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.650
 we dump the content on a surface 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.660
 that we can work as for example 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.280
 this silicone and we knead with the hand 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:27.430
 until you get a doughy mass 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.020
 to get this form of loop 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.970
 what I do is put the dough in the 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.000
 center of this silicone a paper of 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.980
 oven covered with one of the parts 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.860
 that is then turning to the other side 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.380
 tightening evenly 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.740
 is 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:49.200
 if I achieve a shape with the same thickness and 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.319
 you see the cover with film 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.450
 but for the ones he's getting right 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.849
 because it 's going to save in the fridge 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.860
 we will not have cooling at least two 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.680
 hours to harden us and we can 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.239
 cut the cookies 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.269
 to make them different colors 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.730
 look with these typical polka dot boats 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.550
 sugar as good separates the colors 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.950
 crushed the moles 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.950
 and I have sugar of various colors 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.960
 we go with the recipe for nothing you see him 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.600
 we remove the film paper to the curl 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.360
 we are sticking the sugar granites 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.520
 by sections let's do a casting 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.190
 of each color because for example we can 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.380
 I also put white sugar in 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.680
 end you'll put the good cinnamon 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.049
 that we have and what we like 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.329
 and how will you press on a paper of 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.810
 silicone oven we cut them and we're going 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.810
 putting up 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.180
 We preheat the oven to 180 degrees 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.360
 we keep our cookies and what 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.120
 we go down to 160 and in 10 or 12 minutes the 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.600
 we have lists like these for outside 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.600
 footprints 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.730
 what do you think they look good 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.860
 homemade homemade cookies with that 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.000
 original because to apple and these 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.710
 so fun colors you like the idea 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.950
 we already have for coffee or for 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.950
 breakfast 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.060
 I do not know the dotcom
