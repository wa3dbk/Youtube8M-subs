00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.420
 so how not to do so already dozens 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.549
 tunnels and couldn't yet need 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.780
 give in order to conquer all 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.290
 that's what's being done 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.790
 fao so-called winston sarsat everyones 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.070
 bosses or with participation in all sorts of 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.359
 experience 

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:17.429
 so then swing at the seventieth level 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:19.539
 this is just a small necessary part 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:20.259
 games 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:21.969
 usually schoolchildren students handed over 

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:23.979
 exam preparation during 

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:26.710
 participation in the raids that is until you gather 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.829
 Persia after will pass the whole day 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.879
 Now I will briefly show how it happens 

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:32.130
 boss raid 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.320
 first sense stomp comstock then we 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.030
 going near him 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.080
 then finished up to 3 5 4 boss until everyone is 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.760
 ready 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.829
 then the strongest player called 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.160
 tank distracts after beats rub goes 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.130
 goes goes 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.050
 then all the other fives are connected 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.280
 the package of dead is not yet killed 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.270
 when they are killed they are going to the crowd 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.060
 will begin to share the fallen shit and 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.970
 scream that give me that good luck not 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.020
 in general, so can you collect for months 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.650
 to myself clothes today that came with 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.140
 first strike tired 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.239
 and if all the same one of the bosses then played 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.960
 there does not end again 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.150
 of course if you want you can hold your 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.150
 time for the simple killing of hooks 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.800
 better to participate in the so-called 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.650
 routines 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.520
 team on ward vs alliance team 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.960
 but his injuries then the truth begins you 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.150
 will try to run forward with the play 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.780
 first get on the head 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.740
 usually write down every school of steam between 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.500
 two grandees of their videos 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.130
 impose on no in steep 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.580
 music that could be seen how cool they are 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.790
 know how to play cool 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.790
 but apparently also should do it 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.760
 I recently conducted a more survey on this topic. 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.790
 Why do people play the club? 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.460
 got some interesting options 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.500
 answer 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.560
 including himself was popular 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.120
 what is interesting 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.630
 in second place is to kill this time 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.780
 feature 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.670
 the third most popular answer is 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.010
 who and why playing me of course more 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.800
 of games 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.090
 Further, what is your business that in Kiev Russia so 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.890
 Further the toughest was delfi does not carry why 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:14.939
 you live 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:17.339
 and only one person today answered 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:18.129
 fair 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.409
 because i can't write 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:21.669
 so what needs to be done to 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:24.359
 distract from this interesting but very 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:25.579
 dangerously psychological 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.569
 plan 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.800
 the best way to wean from this game 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.739
 this will create your server 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:32.939
 during the day you can be absolutely 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.249
 with impunity and will not be able to get 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:36.559
 any thing 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:40.650
 and we will get absolutely free s 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:41.349
 p 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.599
 however, the mother will not be so easy 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:44.499
 get rid of 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:47.499
 because I'm projectors and r 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.259
 reference 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:53.249
 however, try to still download 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:54.539
 from the internet give up 

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:56.299
 opportunities to install losing 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:56.980
 consciousness 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.209
 but maybe often but there you can 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.400
 to realize everything that you are not just overwhelmed 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.939
 real internet network 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.369
 Well, while you can install and simonds you can 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:07.809
 see what else you can do 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:09.219
 firstly there are always people 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:11.629
 who consider themselves the most witty on 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.489
 in fact they are usually an idiot they just 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.679
 Ugre lies the fact that they have access to the usual 

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:17.399
 life because mini go out 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:19.459
 meet a girl 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.389
 Yes, if at all, you can do 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.119
 make the characters dance and stupid 

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:24.359
 Medvedev smarts 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.239
 and if the authorities want to play honestly 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.859
 use whatever shield 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.289
 eat fly a taxi map eyeing 

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:31.939
 inaccessible station 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.059
 but be careful on most servers 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:35.949
 worth cheats now or if not worth it here 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.639
 very good just stupid panic 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.869
 If in life enter Heber nor man the 

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:41.099
 there is if you can perfectly 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.199
 with impunity 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.979
 and get pleasure from this suit 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.129
 if you are a fan often with dad and who 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.579
 you will be pleased to play in the arena 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.679
 small teams 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:53.129
 as always, Sevastopol is 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.879
 but this is the time 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.569
 rate and it will not seem 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.999
 quite high 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:00.219
 except for the fact that this game is dangerous 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:01.259
 objects he 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:04.009
 less she deserves 96 percent 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:05.879
 it's so cool that even small 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.779
 masonry became the breeze of the area 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:09.509
 thank you so much for watching 

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:11.759
 progressively group vkontakte there soon 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.199
 there will be new markets 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:16.199
 since may was a doctor passport bye bye 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.709
 as
