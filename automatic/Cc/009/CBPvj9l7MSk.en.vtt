00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.920
 Hey guys whats up 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.900
 instead of having a new video for you 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.719
 here on my two channel on mine 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.449
 Parents today, I'll show you an app 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.840
 Presentation of this app is called 3d 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.779
 tuning and so here you can be as 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.039
 car tune I'm looking for here now 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.039
 quickly a brand 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:48.550
 it was nissan's best skyline 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:04.059
 and then you have to accra and then 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.059
 has to load that first time takes something 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.340
 c'mon may come from the well 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.580
 internet to my internet is not like that 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.580
 Well 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:05.250
 but very chic and here you can 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.220
 lay the then deeply in error 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.010
 Then there are the rims on course 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.740
 Of course you can speak in English 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:22.120
 make even the neon on 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:29.080
 where is that now there and then could 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:31.410
 here you can change the color of the 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.410
 neon 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.450
 oh come 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:49.900
 Let's take it he knows but take 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.900
 continue 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.200
 Here you can adjust the front lip 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:21.370
 and here the tail fits here in the 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.370
 strings 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.110
 Naturally 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:33.040
 only the front lights are there, too 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.040
 but clearly 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:40.519
 So I really like the app because 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:44.530
 I'm just a bit 'already car 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:47.450
 fan and the rb I saw really cool for it 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.940
 and adapt hardly spoil the 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.480
 not just jordan i suppose 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:57.010
 I think you can still do that here 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.010
 bonnet of course 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.519
 but they just let me go that way 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.420
 and now we'll just leave it 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.420
 the games at 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.250
 is the belief for the roof up there this 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.710
 glasses exactly 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.500
 but looks at the skyline actually 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:43.360
 just shit because of that 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:45.699
 that we just leave him something 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.210
 I do not know about this here 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.620
 I suppose I suspected something in the foreground 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.750
 but do not really bastle 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.750
 which I think is gone too 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:09.910
 yes i can do it 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:14.020
 these stickers ne pages we do not 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.680
 I know we think we'll leave it that way 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.750
 White 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:21.970
 because the lights the led led as a leonie 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:25.030
 Marine mature looks pretty good too 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:30.580
 with white, that's the way it can be here 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:33.610
 then you can adjust the glass and here 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:36.070
 always what others make, depending on car 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.870
 it was like everything comes so and 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.889
 here you can still that he undercuts 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:44.520
 neon we can adapt but believe 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.520
 also gone 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:02.800
 yes as I said here depending on the car 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:07.160
 different 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.500
 yes, when he is done then it could be 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.100
 maybe everything here again 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:16.490
 make to see what it looks like and 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.560
 otherwise you can still have a photo of 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.780
 make his car up there but you can 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.820
 also adapt to the background differently 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:27.290
 I'm looking for that now I know though 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:31.040
 not exactly where it is yes here it is 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:41.890
 can then make the background so 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:48.950
 background that looks good 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:51.470
 the garage in then had exactly makes 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:55.450
 you can make the car a perfect one 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.450
 turn if I could fix it 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:07.360
 now it's never gonna turn it on 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:10.580
 gone so it must be good but is 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:14.840
 as with foto and then in the 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.920
 stored battery but it was too 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.720
 with the video 

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.720
 I hope see you next time
