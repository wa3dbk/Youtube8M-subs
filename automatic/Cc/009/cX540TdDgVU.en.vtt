00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
your joystick and they provide you with

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.520 
your joystick and they provide you with
more<00:02:23.130> grip<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:24.810> one<00:02:24.990> has<00:02:25.140> like<00:02:25.290> a<00:02:25.350> little

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
more grip so this one has like a little

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.450 
more grip so this one has like a little
bump<00:02:25.710> he's<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:26.070> it

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
bump he's on it

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.110 
ones for black ops 2 you called the
havoc<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.520> can<00:02:44.640> see<00:02:44.760> them<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.880> little<00:02:44.940> bit

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
havoc so you can see them a little bit

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.720 
havoc so you can see them a little bit
better<00:02:47.840> there<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:48.930> go

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
better there you go

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
okay grip it's not as good as a FPS

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.320 
okay grip it's not as good as a FPS

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
just start off here's a controller just

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.640 
just start off here's a controller just
snap<00:03:00.150> right<00:03:00.360> on<00:03:01.940> no<00:03:02.940> problem<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:04.080> then<00:03:04.470> you

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
snap right on no problem and then you

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.250 
snap right on no problem and then you
can<00:03:04.800> just<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.730> know<00:03:05.790> play<00:03:06.209> with<00:03:06.750> them<00:03:06.870> on<00:03:07.050> here

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
can just you know play with them on here

and I supposed to give you more leverage

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.460 
and I supposed to give you more leverage
and<00:03:08.550> more<00:03:08.730> grip<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.380> improve<00:03:10.380> your

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
and more grip and improve your

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.000 
and more grip and improve your
sensitivity<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.730> give<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.240> a<00:03:12.330> better<00:03:13.010> range

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
sensitivity and give you a better range

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.040 
sensitivity and give you a better range
of<00:03:14.220> movement<00:03:14.790> so<00:03:15.830> yeah<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:18.360> goes<00:03:18.480> on<00:03:18.720> like<00:03:18.870> that

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
of movement so yeah it goes on like that

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.100 
of movement so yeah it goes on like that
and<00:03:20.060> I've<00:03:21.060> been<00:03:21.120> playing<00:03:21.360> with<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.600> Joe<00:03:21.780> tabs

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
and I've been playing with the Joe tabs

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.070 
and I've been playing with the Joe tabs
on<00:03:22.530> top<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:25.489> freaks<00:03:26.489> so<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.510> control

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
on top of the freaks so the control

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.080 
on top of the freaks so the control
freaks<00:03:28.320> or<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.500> gel<00:03:28.650> tabs<00:03:28.830> on<00:03:29.190> top<00:03:29.430> Phil<00:03:30.000> is

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
freaks or the gel tabs on top Phil is

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.360 
freaks or the gel tabs on top Phil is
this<00:03:30.239> really<00:03:30.480> good<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:31.230> I<00:03:31.380> like<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.800> so<00:03:32.130> I

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
this really good and I like it so I

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.520 
this really good and I like it so I
can't<00:03:32.820> do<00:03:32.940> it<00:03:33.030> one<00:03:33.239> hand<00:03:33.510> but<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:34.260> get<00:03:34.410> the

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
can't do it one hand but you get the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.770 
can't do it one hand but you get the
idea<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:35.100> then<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.519> always<00:03:35.730> put<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.090> gel<00:03:36.239> tab<00:03:36.510> on

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
idea and then I always put a gel tab on

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.160 
idea and then I always put a gel tab on
the<00:03:37.080> left<00:03:37.320> side<00:03:37.489> so<00:03:38.489> in<00:03:39.000> my<00:03:39.180> opinion<00:03:39.300> I<00:03:39.810> would

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
the left side so in my opinion I would

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.990 
the left side so in my opinion I would
say<00:03:40.440> they're<00:03:40.620> control<00:03:40.950> freaks<00:03:41.250> are<00:03:41.489> the<00:03:41.730> best

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
say they're control freaks are the best

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.270 
say they're control freaks are the best
grip<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:43.110> you<00:03:43.170> can<00:03:43.410> possibly<00:03:43.769> get<00:03:44.040> a

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
grip that you can possibly get a

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.330 
grip that you can possibly get a
controller<00:03:44.970> it'll<00:03:45.570> provide<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.140> with<00:03:46.350> better

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
controller it'll provide you with better

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.630 
controller it'll provide you with better
accuracy<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.299> more<00:03:49.080> leverage<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.799> be<00:03:50.280> able<00:03:50.370> to

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
accuracy and more leverage to be able to

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.960 
accuracy and more leverage to be able to
increase<00:03:51.030> your<00:03:51.120> gun<00:03:51.390> skill<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:51.959> your<00:03:52.290> KD<00:03:52.560> and

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
increase your gun skill and your KD and

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.539 
increase your gun skill and your KD and
your<00:03:53.970> accuracy<00:03:54.269> of<00:03:54.480> course<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:55.080> then<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:56.310> gel

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
your accuracy of course and then the gel

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.300 
your accuracy of course and then the gel
tabs<00:03:56.760> are<00:03:57.120> great<00:03:57.420> for<00:03:57.810> also<00:03:58.290> increasing<00:03:59.160> their

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
tabs are great for also increasing their

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.479 
tabs are great for also increasing their
a<00:03:59.640> grip<00:04:00.709> probably<00:04:01.709> not<00:04:01.890> as<00:04:02.010> big<00:04:02.160> of<00:04:02.220> a

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
a grip probably not as big of a

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.060 
a grip probably not as big of a
advantage<00:04:02.910> as<00:04:03.209> these<00:04:03.769> but<00:04:04.769> I<00:04:04.799> would

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
advantage as these but I would

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.590 
advantage as these but I would
definitely<00:04:05.430> say<00:04:05.610> they<00:04:05.820> are<00:04:05.910> worth<00:04:06.090> getting

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
definitely say they are worth getting

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.600 
definitely say they are worth getting
for<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.930> left<00:04:07.170> thumbstick<00:04:07.430> because<00:04:08.430> some

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
for the left thumbstick because some

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.640 
for the left thumbstick because some
people<00:04:08.970> do<00:04:09.090> not<00:04:09.209> like<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.660> rise<00:04:09.930> on<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.440> left

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
people do not like the rise on the left

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.160 
people do not like the rise on the left
that<00:04:11.040> was<00:04:11.160> dick<00:04:11.340> and<00:04:11.640> I<00:04:12.209> personally<00:04:12.630> don't<00:04:12.900> I

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
that was dick and I personally don't I

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.530 
that was dick and I personally don't I
mean<00:04:13.950> they're<00:04:14.220> very<00:04:14.489> easy<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:14.790> put<00:04:14.910> on<00:04:15.150> you

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
mean they're very easy to put on you

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.030 
mean they're very easy to put on you
just<00:04:15.630> flip<00:04:15.900> them<00:04:15.989> inside<00:04:16.350> out<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.560> then<00:04:16.859> you

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
just flip them inside out and then you

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.490 
just flip them inside out and then you
flip<00:04:17.250> them<00:04:17.370> over<00:04:17.729> top<00:04:18.180> of<00:04:18.209> here<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:18.989> they<00:04:19.320> go

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
flip them over top of here and they go

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.349 
flip them over top of here and they go
right<00:04:19.769> on<00:04:19.830> they<00:04:20.250> go<00:04:20.370> right<00:04:20.580> around<00:04:20.700> like<00:04:21.000> that

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
right on they go right around like that

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.879 
right on they go right around like that
and<00:04:22.049> same<00:04:22.319> with<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.819> good<00:04:23.819> the<00:04:24.750> grip<00:04:24.960> its<00:04:25.500> are

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.029 
and same with the good the grip its are
good<00:04:27.080> but<00:04:28.080> they're<00:04:28.229> definitely<00:04:28.620> cheaper

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
good but they're definitely cheaper

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.159 
good but they're definitely cheaper
feeling<00:04:29.550> and<00:04:29.939> I<00:04:30.240> think<00:04:30.449> the<00:04:30.539> judge<00:04:30.780> has<00:04:30.990> to

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
feeling and I think the judge has to

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.570 
feeling and I think the judge has to
spring<00:04:31.469> a<00:04:31.500> little<00:04:31.740> bit<00:04:31.949> better<00:04:32.219> a<00:04:32.340> nicer

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
spring a little bit better a nicer

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.850 
spring a little bit better a nicer
