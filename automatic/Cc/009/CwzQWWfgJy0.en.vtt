um<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:39.149> really<00:00:39.360> fairly<00:00:39.930> cheap<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.829> get

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
um it's really fairly cheap you can get

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.150 
um it's really fairly cheap you can get
it<00:00:41.129> from<00:00:41.730> any<00:00:41.910> mini<00:00:42.300> wargaming<00:00:42.960> store<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:44.129> I

found it fairly cheap on eBay and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.020 
found it fairly cheap on eBay and
there's<00:00:46.530> different<00:00:46.890> variations<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.760> this

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
there's different variations of this

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.869 
there's different variations of this
different<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.840> know<00:00:49.379> basically<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.430> idea<00:00:50.700> is

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
different you know basically the idea is

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.330 
different you know basically the idea is
there's<00:00:51.090> two<00:00:51.300> compounds<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:52.739> B<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.920> mix

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
there's two compounds a and B you mix

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.340 
there's two compounds a and B you mix
them<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.820> get<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.180> liquid<00:00:54.600> plastic<00:00:55.170> that

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
them and you get a liquid plastic that

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.000 
them and you get a liquid plastic that
hardens

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
hardens

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.779 
hardens
I<00:00:56.510> recommend<00:00:57.510> need<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> tight<00:00:58.710> okay<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.579> green

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
I recommend need a tight okay the green

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.700 
I recommend need a tight okay the green
stuff<00:01:00.120> comes<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.690> blue<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.079> yellow<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.620> you

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
stuff comes in blue and yellow and you

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.600 
stuff comes in blue and yellow and you
mix<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.520> uh<00:01:03.680> it's<00:01:04.680> kind<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.890> like<00:01:05.040> sticky

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
mix it and uh it's kind of like sticky

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.570 
mix it and uh it's kind of like sticky
tack<00:01:05.850> only<00:01:06.510> different<00:01:06.960> anyways<00:01:07.770> what<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.310> mix

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
tack only different anyways what you mix

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.200 
tack only different anyways what you mix
it<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.180> then<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.570> hardens<00:01:10.400> slowly<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.030> it's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
it and then it hardens slowly so it's

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.940 
it and then it hardens slowly so it's
very<00:01:12.360> shapeable<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.260> got<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> good<00:01:13.740> amount

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
very shapeable you got a good amount

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.880 
very shapeable you got a good amount
time<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.520> shape<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.420> not<00:01:15.600> liquidy<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.770> be

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
time to shape it it's not liquidy can be

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.340 
time to shape it it's not liquidy can be
a<00:01:16.920> little<00:01:17.220> overly<00:01:17.820> sticky<00:01:18.150> sometimes<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
a little overly sticky sometimes just a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.920 
a little overly sticky sometimes just a
smidge<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:20.670> uh<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:21.299> means<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.630> sticks

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
smidge but uh that means it sticks

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.850 
smidge but uh that means it sticks
that's<00:01:22.500> good<00:01:22.909> and<00:01:23.909> that's<00:01:24.479> really<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.710> not

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
that's good and that's really it's not

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.130 
that's good and that's really it's not
that<00:01:26.009> bad<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:27.119> better<00:01:27.450> but<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> thought

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
that bad it's it's better but I thought

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.510 
that bad it's it's better but I thought
I'd<00:01:28.259> mention<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:28.710> just<00:01:28.829> cuz<00:01:28.979> ever<00:01:29.310> been

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
I'd mention it's just cuz ever been

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.740 
I'd mention it's just cuz ever been
times<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.820> like<00:01:29.939> no<00:01:30.060> no<00:01:30.240> oh

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
times it like no no oh

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.260 
times it like no no oh
stop<00:01:31.049> sticking<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.439> my<00:01:31.530> finger<00:01:31.939> but<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.119> not

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
stop sticking to my finger but it's not

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.910 
stop sticking to my finger but it's not
terribly<00:01:33.689> sticky<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.140> here<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.380> got<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.829> little

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
terribly sticky so here I got a little

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.020 
terribly sticky so here I got a little
bit<00:01:36.049> probably<00:01:37.049> more<00:01:37.290> than<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.680> need<00:01:38.030> not

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
bit probably more than I need not

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.080 
bit probably more than I need not
thinking<00:01:39.479> but<00:01:39.869> oh<00:01:40.020> well<00:01:40.640> I'll<00:01:41.640> find<00:01:41.850> something

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
thinking but oh well I'll find something

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.620 
thinking but oh well I'll find something
quick<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.479> use<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.700> I'm<00:01:44.790> just<00:01:45.060> mixing<00:01:45.299> it

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
quick to use it on so I'm just mixing it

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.679 
quick to use it on so I'm just mixing it
and<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.930> mix<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.380> until<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.890> turns<00:01:47.100> green<00:01:47.880> now

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
and you mix it until it turns green now

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.149 
and you mix it until it turns green now
this<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.960> very<00:01:49.140> helpful<00:01:49.380> when<00:01:49.740> you're<00:01:49.890> gluing

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
this is very helpful when you're gluing

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.889 
this is very helpful when you're gluing
something<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.500> there's<00:01:53.000> overlay<00:01:54.000> where<00:01:54.299> you

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
something and there's overlay where you

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.749 
something and there's overlay where you
know<00:01:55.020> there's<00:01:55.229> gap<00:01:55.829> between<00:01:56.100> what<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.490> glued

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
know there's gap between what you glued

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.530 
know there's gap between what you glued
on<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.090> figure<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:59.729> piece<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.420> the

on the figure and and the piece and the
figure<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.229> know<00:02:01.500> like<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.740> glued<00:02:02.520> these

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
figure you know like I glued these

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.319 
figure you know like I glued these
boosters<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.479> here<00:02:04.100> for<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.430> back<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.030> dom

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
boosters on here for the back of the dom

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.020 
boosters on here for the back of the dom
and<00:02:06.719> uh<00:02:06.950> where<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.160> see<00:02:08.369> all<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:08.700> green

and uh where you see all this green
stuff<00:02:09.239> there<00:02:09.750> was<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:09.989> gap<00:02:10.459> it<00:02:11.459> just<00:02:11.700> didn't<00:02:11.970> fit

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
stuff there was a gap it just didn't fit

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.090 
stuff there was a gap it just didn't fit
because<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.120> leg<00:02:13.450> was<00:02:13.720> rounded<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.950> know

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
because the leg was rounded you know

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.960 
because the leg was rounded you know
like<00:02:15.370> like<00:02:15.760> my<00:02:15.910> hand<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.600> so<00:02:17.380> uh<00:02:17.790> being<00:02:18.790> that

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
like like my hand and so uh being that

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.600 
like like my hand and so uh being that
it<00:02:19.240> was<00:02:19.420> rounded<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:20.020> just<00:02:20.290> didn't<00:02:20.590> fit<00:02:21.340> too

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
it was rounded it just didn't fit too

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.460 
it was rounded it just didn't fit too
well<00:02:21.820> so<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.120> filled<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:22.570> in<00:02:22.690> with<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.990> epoxy

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
well so I filled that in with the epoxy

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.580 
well so I filled that in with the epoxy
putty<00:02:23.650> I<00:02:23.980> cut<00:02:24.610> off<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.910> doms<00:02:25.120> backpack<00:02:25.780> don't

backpack I filled him an epoxy putty so
that<00:02:45.130> uh<00:02:45.160> you<00:02:45.700> wouldn't<00:02:46.150> show<00:02:46.450> those<00:02:47.050> holes

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
that uh you wouldn't show those holes

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.410

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
I fill that in with epoxy putty so epoxy

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.830 
I fill that in with epoxy putty so epoxy
putty<00:03:03.130> is<00:03:03.310> really<00:03:03.610> helpful<00:03:03.850> for<00:03:04.120> filling<00:03:04.750> in

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
need it for is my Zaku to here see this

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.490 
need it for is my Zaku to here see this
hole<00:03:30.700> that's<00:03:31.060> where<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:34.660> cable<00:03:35.080> went<00:03:35.230> the

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
hole that's where the the cable went the

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.460 
hole that's where the the cable went the
Zaku<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:36.070> g-type<00:03:36.670> doesn't<00:03:37.420> have<00:03:37.570> cables<00:03:38.080> so<00:03:38.350> he

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
Zaku to g-type doesn't have cables so he

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.259 
Zaku to g-type doesn't have cables so he
just<00:03:38.620> has<00:03:38.769> holes<00:03:39.040> there<00:03:39.310> we<00:03:39.519> aren't<00:03:40.000> supposed

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
just has holes there we aren't supposed

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.539 
just has holes there we aren't supposed
to<00:03:40.360> have<00:03:40.540> holes<00:03:40.840> there<00:03:41.200> so<00:03:41.950> I<00:03:41.980> take<00:03:42.190> some<00:03:42.250> of

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
to have holes there so I take some of

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.650 
to have holes there so I take some of
this<00:03:43.769> like<00:03:44.769> I<00:03:44.890> said<00:03:45.070> I<00:03:45.100> made<00:03:45.310> way<00:03:45.549> too<00:03:45.610> much<00:03:45.940> but

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
this like I said I made way too much but

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.440 
this like I said I made way too much but
at<00:03:46.750> least<00:03:46.780> you<00:03:46.989> can<00:03:47.140> see<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.410> in<00:03:47.470> my<00:03:47.590> video<00:03:47.890> and

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
at least you can see it in my video and

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.120 
at least you can see it in my video and
we're<00:03:49.450> just<00:03:49.540> going<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.750> apply<00:03:50.290> that<00:03:50.410> on<00:03:50.680> there

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
we're just going to apply that on there

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.520 
we're just going to apply that on there
and<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:54.820> closer<00:03:55.060> you<00:03:55.420> can<00:03:55.690> get<00:03:55.900> it<00:03:56.110> to<00:03:56.410> the

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
and the closer you can get it to the

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.199 
and the closer you can get it to the
amount<00:03:56.799> you<00:03:56.920> actually<00:03:57.160> need<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:58.030> less

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
amount you actually need the less

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.720 
amount you actually need the less
sanding<00:03:58.780> you're<00:03:58.959> going<00:03:59.140> to<00:03:59.200> have<00:03:59.380> to<00:03:59.590> do<00:03:59.769> which

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
sanding you're going to have to do which

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.030 
sanding you're going to have to do which
is<00:04:00.910> important<00:04:01.540> you<00:04:02.200> don't<00:04:02.260> really<00:04:02.650> want<00:04:02.950> to

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
is important you don't really want to

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.550 
is important you don't really want to
spend<00:04:03.280> all<00:04:03.400> your<00:04:03.580> time<00:04:03.640> sanding<00:04:04.360> slows<00:04:05.350> down

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
spend all your time sanding slows down

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.960 
spend all your time sanding slows down
the<00:04:05.709> whole<00:04:05.799> painting<00:04:06.250> process<00:04:06.489> and

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
the whole painting process and

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.060 
the whole painting process and
everything<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:08.260> so<00:04:08.440> they<00:04:08.500> just<00:04:08.709> keep<00:04:08.890> taking

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
everything and so they just keep taking

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.280 
everything and so they just keep taking
little<00:04:09.459> dabs<00:04:09.670> and<00:04:09.850> like<00:04:10.030> says<00:04:10.269> gets<00:04:11.049> a<00:04:11.140> little

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
little dabs and like says gets a little

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.939 
little dabs and like says gets a little
sticky<00:04:13.890> needle

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:15.949 
sticky needle

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:20.180 
sticky needle
