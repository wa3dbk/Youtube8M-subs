00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.839 
doing it you are going to have to use
the<00:02:41.480> needle<00:02:41.629> nose<00:02:41.870> pliers<00:02:42.230> in<00:02:42.500> order<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.920> fold

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
the needle nose pliers in order to fold

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.660 
the needle nose pliers in order to fold
your<00:02:44.409> copper<00:02:45.409> table<00:02:45.799> in<00:02:46.010> order<00:02:46.099> to<00:02:46.280> tighten<00:02:46.610> it

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
your copper table in order to tighten it

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:56.380 
your copper table in order to tighten it
I<00:02:54.250> know<00:02:55.250> I'm<00:02:55.400> not<00:02:55.519> making<00:02:55.730> this<00:02:56.000> really<00:02:56.209> easy

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
I know I'm not making this really easy

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.890 
I know I'm not making this really easy
for<00:02:56.569> the<00:02:56.690> camera<00:02:57.080> to<00:02:57.200> see<00:02:57.230> but<00:02:57.590> it's<00:02:57.739> difficult

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.069 

anyway<00:03:02.980> by<00:03:03.980> doing<00:03:04.340> this<00:03:04.599> you'll<00:03:05.599> notice<00:03:05.959> that

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
anyway by doing this you'll notice that

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.949 
anyway by doing this you'll notice that
if<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.200> bring<00:03:06.349> the<00:03:06.470> camera<00:03:06.860> up<00:03:07.269> that<00:03:08.269> oh<00:03:08.540> here

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
if you bring the camera up that oh here

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.150 
if you bring the camera up that oh here
I'll<00:03:09.049> turn<00:03:09.290> around<00:03:09.470> so<00:03:09.709> you<00:03:09.799> can<00:03:09.920> see<00:03:09.950> it

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
I'll turn around so you can see it

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.009 
I'll turn around so you can see it
better<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.549> it<00:03:10.790> leaves<00:03:10.970> one<00:03:11.180> of<00:03:11.360> these<00:03:11.569> small

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
better and it leaves one of these small

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.100 
better and it leaves one of these small
holes<00:03:12.260> open<00:03:12.799> for<00:03:13.250> you<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:13.430> just<00:03:13.670> put<00:03:13.879> a<00:03:14.110> screw

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
holes open for you to just put a screw

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.360 
holes open for you to just put a screw
in<00:03:15.140> through<00:03:15.470> this<00:03:15.590> so<00:03:15.739> that's<00:03:15.799> exactly<00:03:16.250> what

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
in through this so that's exactly what

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.699 
in through this so that's exactly what
we're<00:03:16.489> gonna<00:03:16.609> do<00:03:16.819> so<00:03:17.810> Nicole<00:03:17.959> is<00:03:18.230> gonna<00:03:18.470> hold

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
we're gonna do so Nicole is gonna hold

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.970 
we're gonna do so Nicole is gonna hold
this<00:03:18.920> for<00:03:19.250> me<00:03:19.750> I'm<00:03:20.750> gonna<00:03:20.930> turn<00:03:21.200> it<00:03:21.410> just<00:03:21.799> so

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
this for me I'm gonna turn it just so

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.280 
this for me I'm gonna turn it just so
that<00:03:22.160> it's<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.549> difficult<00:03:23.450> thing<00:03:23.780> to<00:03:23.810> do<00:03:24.019> here

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
that it's a difficult thing to do here

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.960 
that it's a difficult thing to do here
is<00:03:24.379> while<00:03:25.250> you're<00:03:25.400> putting<00:03:25.640> all<00:03:25.790> this

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
is while you're putting all this

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.050 
is while you're putting all this
together<00:03:26.180> this<00:03:26.720> hula<00:03:27.410> hoop<00:03:27.440> wants<00:03:28.160> to<00:03:28.400> wants

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
together this hula hoop wants to wants

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.610 
together this hula hoop wants to wants
to<00:03:29.180> turn<00:03:29.480> which<00:03:29.750> is<00:03:29.780> exactly<00:03:30.260> why<00:03:30.410> we're

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
to turn which is exactly why we're

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.830 
to turn which is exactly why we're
putting<00:03:31.250> in<00:03:31.370> this<00:03:31.519> screw<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:32.450> hula<00:03:32.750> hoop

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
putting in this screw the hula hoop

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.910 
putting in this screw the hula hoop
wants<00:03:33.290> to<00:03:33.470> waver<00:03:34.400> back<00:03:35.030> and<00:03:35.269> forth<00:03:35.739> so<00:03:36.739> what<00:03:36.859> we

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
wants to waver back and forth so what we

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.110 
wants to waver back and forth so what we
want<00:03:37.069> to<00:03:37.129> do<00:03:37.220> is<00:03:37.340> kind<00:03:37.489> of<00:03:37.579> get<00:03:37.670> on<00:03:37.790> the<00:03:37.879> side

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
want to do is kind of get on the side

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.849 
want to do is kind of get on the side
here<00:03:38.390> and<00:03:38.569> if<00:03:38.720> your<00:03:39.019> partner<00:03:39.379> doesn't<00:03:39.560> keep

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
here and if your partner doesn't keep

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.470 
here and if your partner doesn't keep
turning<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.549> pole<00:03:41.019> you<00:03:42.019> can<00:03:42.169> see<00:03:43.480> exactly

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
turning the pole you can see exactly

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.270 
turning the pole you can see exactly
whether<00:03:44.900> or<00:03:45.049> not<00:03:45.139> it's<00:03:45.349> lined<00:03:45.620> up<00:03:45.859> so<00:03:46.010> what<00:03:46.160> you

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
whether or not it's lined up so what you

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.430 
whether or not it's lined up so what you
want<00:03:46.459> this<00:03:46.639> is<00:03:46.790> B<00:03:47.060> even<00:03:47.269> with<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:48.079> pole<00:03:48.319> when

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
want this is B even with the pole when

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:56.550 
want this is B even with the pole when
you're<00:03:48.560> looking<00:03:48.769> at<00:03:48.889> it<00:03:49.010> from<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.310> side

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.380 

drillbit<00:03:57.560> out<00:03:57.950> and<00:03:58.160> get<00:03:58.280> my<00:03:58.490> screw<00:03:58.910> back<00:03:59.180> in

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
drillbit out and get my screw back in

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:16.210 
drillbit out and get my screw back in
there

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.350 

so<00:04:17.220> if<00:04:17.310> you're<00:04:17.430> short<00:04:17.610> like<00:04:17.820> me<00:04:17.850> it's<00:04:18.120> normally

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:18.360 
so if you're short like me it's normally

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.420 
so if you're short like me it's normally
better<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.720> get<00:04:18.870> on<00:04:19.080> top<00:04:19.560> of<00:04:19.620> something<00:04:20.220> but<00:04:20.370> I

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
better to get on top of something but I

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.340 
better to get on top of something but I
will<00:04:20.670> try<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:20.910> do<00:04:21.150> this<00:04:21.330> for<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.600> camera<00:04:21.989> just

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
will try to do this for the camera just

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.600 
will try to do this for the camera just
straight<00:04:22.560> up<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.740> down<00:04:22.830> but<00:04:22.950> it's<00:04:23.220> much<00:04:23.460> more

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
straight up and down but it's much more

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.100 
straight up and down but it's much more
difficult<00:04:23.760> this<00:04:24.210> way<00:04:24.390> but<00:04:24.600> if<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:24.750> can<00:04:24.870> get<00:04:24.990> up

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
difficult this way but if you can get up

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.450 
difficult this way but if you can get up
above<00:04:25.260> it<00:04:25.560> that's<00:04:25.680> really<00:04:25.980> the<00:04:26.100> best<00:04:26.280> way<00:04:26.430> to

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
above it that's really the best way to

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.570 
above it that's really the best way to
go<00:04:26.670> about<00:04:26.790> it<00:04:27.890> so<00:04:28.890> anyway<00:04:29.040> is<00:04:29.340> that<00:04:29.370> even<00:04:31.580> if

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
go about it so anyway is that even if

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.460 
go about it so anyway is that even if
it's<00:04:32.790> not<00:04:32.850> even<00:04:33.210> and<00:04:33.630> you<00:04:33.780> need<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.080> hold<00:04:34.200> the

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
it's not even and you need to hold the

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.660 
it's not even and you need to hold the
hold<00:04:35.100> the<00:04:35.220> hoop

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
hold the hoop

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.600 
hold the hoop
dear<00:04:35.970> her<00:04:36.120> once<00:04:36.390> it's<00:04:36.540> going<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:36.780> move<00:04:37.610> the

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
dear her once it's going to move the

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.130 
dear her once it's going to move the
best<00:04:38.850> way<00:04:41.570> you<00:04:42.570> might<00:04:42.750> have<00:04:42.840> to<00:04:42.960> do<00:04:43.050> this

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
best way you might have to do this

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.820 
best way you might have to do this
several<00:04:43.350> times<00:04:43.530> because<00:04:44.070> sometimes<00:04:44.490> it<00:04:44.700> won't

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
several times because sometimes it won't

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.070 
several times because sometimes it won't
stay<00:04:46.830> where<00:04:47.100> it<00:04:47.190> is<00:04:47.280> while<00:04:47.520> you're<00:04:47.700> drilling

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
stay where it is while you're drilling

00:04:48.080 --> 00:05:02.360 
stay where it is while you're drilling
so<00:04:49.080> do<00:04:49.260> try<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.470> keep<00:04:49.680> it<00:04:49.860> where<00:04:50.010> it<00:04:50.040> is

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.540 

okay

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
okay

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.860 
okay
so<00:05:04.540> ideally<00:05:04.870> no<00:05:05.500> again<00:05:05.770> this<00:05:05.950> is<00:05:06.210> not<00:05:07.210> even<00:05:07.630> see

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
so ideally no again this is not even see

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.140 
so ideally no again this is not even see
oh<00:05:08.200> you<00:05:08.830> got<00:05:08.980> to<00:05:09.010> be<00:05:09.160> real<00:05:09.340> careful<00:05:09.640> about<00:05:09.850> it

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
oh you got to be real careful about it

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.960 
oh you got to be real careful about it
being<00:05:10.300> even<00:05:10.720> this<00:05:10.810> is<00:05:11.020> slanted<00:05:11.790> if<00:05:12.790> that

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
being even this is slanted if that

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:14.250 
being even this is slanted if that

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 
an issue because what we're gonna do is

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.750 
an issue because what we're gonna do is
we're<00:05:17.140> just<00:05:17.320> gonna<00:05:17.440> have<00:05:17.740> it<00:05:17.770> tilted<00:05:18.580> like

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
we're just gonna have it tilted like

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.010 
we're just gonna have it tilted like
slightly<00:05:21.760> tilted<00:05:22.270> like<00:05:22.390> this<00:05:22.420> people<00:05:22.900> can

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
slightly tilted like this people can

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.990 
slightly tilted like this people can
throw<00:05:23.230> it<00:05:23.320> up<00:05:23.410> into<00:05:23.620> the<00:05:23.770> building<00:05:24.100> fine<00:05:24.460> but

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
throw it up into the building fine but

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.460 
throw it up into the building fine but
if<00:05:25.120> they<00:05:25.210> really<00:05:25.420> is<00:05:25.600> gonna<00:05:25.780> bug<00:05:26.020> you<00:05:26.050> you<00:05:26.260> just

this<00:05:34.240> happens<00:05:34.390> this<00:05:34.660> is<00:05:34.810> how<00:05:34.900> you<00:05:34.990> fix<00:05:35.170> it<00:05:35.380> you

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
this happens this is how you fix it you

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.010 
this happens this is how you fix it you
got<00:05:36.850> to<00:05:36.910> pull<00:05:37.060> it<00:05:37.090> got<00:05:37.510> to<00:05:37.600> pull<00:05:37.720> the<00:05:37.780> screw

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
got to pull it got to pull the screw

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.980 
got to pull it got to pull the screw
back<00:05:38.170> out<00:05:39.390> there's<00:05:40.390> a<00:05:40.450> lot<00:05:40.570> easier<00:05:40.630> than

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
back out there's a lot easier than

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
back out there's a lot easier than
putting<00:05:41.200> it<00:05:41.320> in<00:05:43.440> then<00:05:44.440> what<00:05:44.500> you<00:05:44.590> gotta<00:05:44.710> do<00:05:44.860> is

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
putting it in then what you gotta do is

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.360 
putting it in then what you gotta do is
you<00:05:45.130> gotta<00:05:45.160> have<00:05:45.520> got<00:05:46.300> to<00:05:46.420> rotate<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:47.170> hoop<00:05:47.370> so

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
you gotta have got to rotate the hoop so

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.560 
you gotta have got to rotate the hoop so
what<00:05:48.520> this<00:05:48.670> happens<00:05:49.000> you<00:05:49.090> got<00:05:49.210> to<00:05:49.300> start<00:05:49.450> the

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
what this happens you got to start the

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.150 
what this happens you got to start the
whole<00:05:49.750> brand<00:05:50.110> new<00:05:50.320> because<00:05:50.560> if<00:05:50.770> you<00:05:50.890> try<00:05:51.130> to

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
whole brand new because if you try to

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.950 
whole brand new because if you try to
just<00:05:51.460> rotate<00:05:51.670> it<00:05:52.060> and<00:05:52.210> do<00:05:52.300> a<00:05:52.330> hole<00:05:52.600> where<00:05:52.780> it<00:05:52.870> is

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
just rotate it and do a hole where it is

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.270 
just rotate it and do a hole where it is
you're<00:05:53.080> gonna<00:05:53.140> make<00:05:53.290> a<00:05:53.320> really<00:05:53.650> big<00:05:53.770> hole<00:05:54.010> and

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
you're gonna make a really big hole and

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.470 
you're gonna make a really big hole and
it's<00:05:54.400> not<00:05:54.580> gonna<00:05:54.730> hold<00:05:54.940> at<00:05:55.180> all

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
it's not gonna hold at all

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.240 
it's not gonna hold at all
you're<00:05:55.840> also<00:05:55.960> gonna<00:05:56.140> weak<00:05:56.410> in<00:05:56.560> this<00:05:56.740> area<00:05:57.070> and

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
you're also gonna weak in this area and

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.040 
you're also gonna weak in this area and
so<00:05:57.340> this<00:05:57.460> is<00:05:57.610> gonna<00:05:57.730> break<00:05:58.030> so<00:05:58.720> what<00:05:58.810> you<00:05:58.930> need

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
so this is gonna break so what you need

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.330 
so this is gonna break so what you need
to<00:05:59.140> do<00:05:59.260> is<00:05:59.380> if<00:05:59.500> you<00:05:59.590> screw<00:05:59.890> up<00:05:59.920> you<00:06:00.160> actually

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
to do is if you screw up you actually

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.790 
to do is if you screw up you actually
have<00:06:00.730> to<00:06:00.880> rotate<00:06:01.120> the<00:06:01.660> hoop<00:06:01.810> to<00:06:02.110> a<00:06:02.260> brand<00:06:02.650> new

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
have to rotate the hoop to a brand new

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.730 
have to rotate the hoop to a brand new
location<00:06:03.040> and<00:06:03.580> start<00:06:04.060> a<00:06:04.180> brand<00:06:04.510> new<00:06:04.720> hole<00:06:04.960> okay

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
location and start a brand new hole okay

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.110 
location and start a brand new hole okay
that's<00:06:05.950> the<00:06:06.130> consequence<00:06:06.640> of<00:06:06.730> getting<00:06:06.880> it

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
that's the consequence of getting it

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.470 
that's the consequence of getting it
wrong<00:06:08.220> so<00:06:09.220> again<00:06:09.520> you<00:06:09.850> want<00:06:10.030> to<00:06:10.060> line<00:06:10.270> this<00:06:10.420> up

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
wrong so again you want to line this up

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.620 
wrong so again you want to line this up
so<00:06:11.020> that<00:06:11.050> it's<00:06:11.200> even<00:06:11.530> with<00:06:11.560> the<00:06:11.710> pole<00:06:12.480> so<00:06:13.480> that

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:13.630 
so that it's even with the pole so that

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.030 
so that it's even with the pole so that
these<00:06:13.720> are<00:06:13.780> two<00:06:14.020> or<00:06:14.140> even<00:06:14.170> I<00:06:14.380> can't<00:06:14.590> tell<00:06:14.830> from

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.040 
these are two or even I can't tell from

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:24.560 
these are two or even I can't tell from
this<00:06:15.580> side<00:06:20.220> actually

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.210 

and<00:06:25.110> then<00:06:25.230> you're<00:06:25.320> gonna<00:06:25.410> start<00:06:25.680> a<00:06:25.740> brand<00:06:26.040> new

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
and then you're gonna start a brand new

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.640 
and then you're gonna start a brand new
hole<00:06:26.630> if<00:06:27.630> you<00:06:27.690> screw<00:06:28.050> up<00:06:28.110> this<00:06:28.350> is<00:06:28.500> the

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:28.650 
hole if you screw up this is the

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.830 
hole if you screw up this is the
consequence<00:06:29.160> of<00:06:29.340> not<00:06:30.330> getting<00:06:30.540> it<00:06:30.660> right<00:06:30.720> the

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
consequence of not getting it right the

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:36.260 
consequence of not getting it right the
first<00:06:31.200> time<00:06:34.370> put<00:06:35.370> that<00:06:35.550> back<00:06:35.730> in<00:06:35.940> there

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
first time put that back in there

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.020 
first time put that back in there
have<00:06:36.420> your<00:06:36.540> partner<00:06:36.810> hold<00:06:37.080> it<00:06:37.640> hold<00:06:38.640> it<00:06:38.790> real

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
have your partner hold it hold it real

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.220 
have your partner hold it hold it real
tight<00:06:39.060> and<00:06:39.480> then<00:06:39.570> they<00:06:39.660> do<00:06:39.720> need<00:06:39.990> to<00:06:40.050> put<00:06:40.170> a

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.230 
tight and then they do need to put a

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.900 
tight and then they do need to put a
little<00:06:40.410> bit<00:06:40.530> of<00:06:40.740> resistance<00:06:41.070> against<00:06:41.700> you<00:06:41.850> or

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:41.910 
little bit of resistance against you or

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.210 
little bit of resistance against you or
else<00:06:42.060> it's<00:06:42.240> not<00:06:42.300> gonna<00:06:42.740> it's<00:06:43.740> not<00:06:43.800> gonna<00:06:44.070> let

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
else it's not gonna it's not gonna let

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.220 
else it's not gonna it's not gonna let
you<00:06:44.310> do<00:06:44.490> it<00:06:44.520> you<00:06:45.210> can<00:06:45.330> start<00:06:45.630> off<00:06:45.750> real<00:06:46.020> slow

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.230 
you do it you can start off real slow

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.470 
you do it you can start off real slow
it's<00:06:47.100> just<00:06:47.250> slightly<00:06:47.430> magnetized<00:06:48.120> so<00:06:48.360> it's

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.480 
it's just slightly magnetized so it's

00:06:48.480 --> 00:07:09.220 
it's just slightly magnetized so it's
wanting<00:06:48.720> magnetized<00:06:49.230> of<00:06:49.350> the<00:06:49.410> cup<00:06:53.690> okay

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:09.230 

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.900 

I'm<00:07:09.770> sure<00:07:09.980> why<00:07:10.160> did<00:07:10.370> that<00:07:10.870> okay<00:07:12.400> so<00:07:13.400> once<00:07:13.790> again

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:13.910 
I'm sure why did that okay so once again

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.450 
I'm sure why did that okay so once again
we're<00:07:14.270> in<00:07:14.390> English<00:07:14.750> but<00:07:14.990> so<00:07:15.770> anyway<00:07:16.040> if<00:07:16.280> you

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:16.460
