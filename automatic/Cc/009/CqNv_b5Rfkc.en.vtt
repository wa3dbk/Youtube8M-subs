 connecting to the trunk when 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.269
 the need to eliminate it open 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.040
 ball valve 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.169
 check the tightness of connections 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.049
 open the tap for clean water and 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:59.370
 miss the water for 20 minutes 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.530
 the filter is ready for operation 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.480
 Please note that normal

 milliliters per minute or 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:10.739
 from 400 liters per day to 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.450
 the flow of water from the faucet was constant 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.040
 move the tap key to the top 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.410
 position in case of a sharp increase 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.850
 water flow is necessary to shut off the flow 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.010
 water and replace the membrane 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.479
 it is recommended to replace the pretreatment unit 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.370
 after six months of operation 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.680
 and the membrane after a year and a half the system 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.510
