00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
then I'm going to show you how to do it

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.560 
then I'm going to show you how to do it
as<00:00:52.890> Batman<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.640> then<00:00:53.940> I'm<00:00:54.180> going<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.390> switch

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
as Batman and then I'm going to switch

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.090 
as Batman and then I'm going to switch
the<00:00:54.719> Catwoman<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.320> let<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.500> see<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.800> with<00:00:55.949> her

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
the Catwoman and let you see it with her

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.709 
the Catwoman and let you see it with her
because<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.610> will<00:00:56.760> work<00:00:56.789> for<00:00:57.270> both<00:00:57.300> characters

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
because it will work for both characters

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.479 
because it will work for both characters
I<00:00:58.789> do<00:00:59.789> not<00:01:00.210> know<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.949> will<00:01:02.070> work<00:01:02.129> in

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
I do not know that it will work in

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.870 
I do not know that it will work in
challenge<00:01:02.879> mode<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.359> haven't<00:01:03.750> tested<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.880> so

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
challenge mode I haven't tested that so

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.640 
challenge mode I haven't tested that so
anyway<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.360> game<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:07.170> open<00:01:07.500> up<00:01:07.590> your

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
anyway in game you open up your

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.570 
anyway in game you open up your
cryptographic<00:01:08.220> sequencer<00:01:10.220> then<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.340> hold

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
cryptographic sequencer then you hold

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.490 
cryptographic sequencer then you hold
the<00:01:11.790> left<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.330> right<00:01:12.390> triggers<00:01:12.990> at<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.260> same

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the left and right triggers at the same

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.160 
the left and right triggers at the same
time<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.850> rotate<00:01:15.210> your<00:01:15.270> thumb<00:01:15.659> sticks<00:01:15.990> in

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
time and you rotate your thumb sticks in

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.929 
time and you rotate your thumb sticks in
their<00:01:16.290> respective<00:01:16.830> directions<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:17.790> you'll

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
their respective directions so you'll

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.390 
their respective directions so you'll
rotate<00:01:18.150> your<00:01:18.509> left<00:01:18.540> thumb<00:01:19.020> stick<00:01:19.350> left<00:01:20.070> or

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
rotate your left thumb stick left or

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.700 
rotate your left thumb stick left or
counterclockwise<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.600> you're<00:01:22.500> right

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
counterclockwise and you're right

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.690 
counterclockwise and you're right
thumbstick<00:01:23.040> right<00:01:23.490> or<00:01:23.670> clockwise<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:25.549> you<00:01:26.549> do

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
thumbstick right or clockwise and you do

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.310 
thumbstick right or clockwise and you do
it<00:01:26.820> right<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.330> need<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.600> rotate<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:28.049> for<00:01:28.229> about

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
it right we need to rotate it for about

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.819 
it right we need to rotate it for about
five<00:01:28.890> seconds<00:01:29.490> or<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.450> then<00:01:31.320> it'll<00:01:31.530> just

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
five seconds or so and then it'll just

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.560 
five seconds or so and then it'll just
switch<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.040> big<00:01:32.310> head<00:01:32.490> mode<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.939> was<00:01:33.299> having

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
switch to big head mode I was having

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.850 
switch to big head mode I was having
some<00:01:33.720> problems<00:01:34.079> for<00:01:34.259> some<00:01:34.350> reason<00:01:34.680> while<00:01:34.829> I

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
some problems for some reason while I

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.609 
some problems for some reason while I
was<00:01:35.070> trying<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.369> record<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.259> took<00:01:37.439> me

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
was trying to record this so it took me

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.950 
was trying to record this so it took me
a<00:01:37.650> couple<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:38.070> tries<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.490> get<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.909> but<00:01:39.390> once<00:01:39.840> you

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
a couple of tries to get it but once you

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.289 
a couple of tries to get it but once you
figure<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.290> out<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.530> really<00:01:40.650> not<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:40.920> hard

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
figure it out it's really not that hard

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:48.980 
figure it out it's really not that hard
and<00:01:42.710> there<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.799> go<00:01:43.829> big<00:01:44.610> head<00:01:44.820> mode<00:01:47.659> that<00:01:48.659> just

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
and there you go big head mode that just

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.550 
and there you go big head mode that just
looks<00:01:49.170> ridiculous<00:01:49.950> no<00:01:50.579> silly<00:01:51.350> pretty<00:01:52.350> fun

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
looks ridiculous no silly pretty fun
