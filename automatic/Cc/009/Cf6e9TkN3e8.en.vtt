00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
for two key reasons for me it's a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.880 
for two key reasons for me it's a
planning<00:01:12.150> tool<00:01:12.360> when<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.840> give<00:01:13.140> my<00:01:13.290> kids<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.650> test

planning tool when I give my kids a test

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.499 
planning tool when I give my kids a test
or<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> quick<00:01:14.820> little<00:01:15.060> check<00:01:15.330> for

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
or a quick little check for

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.880 
or a quick little check for
understanding<00:01:15.630> I'm<00:01:16.170> able<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.470> tell<00:01:16.680> really

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
understanding I'm able to tell really

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.830 
understanding I'm able to tell really
quickly<00:01:17.340> whether<00:01:18.030> they're<00:01:18.270> understanding

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
quickly whether they're understanding

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.749 
quickly whether they're understanding
what<00:01:18.960> I'm<00:01:19.080> giving<00:01:19.380> them<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.130> I'm<00:01:20.250> able<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.520> use

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
what I'm giving them so I'm able to use

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.609 
what I'm giving them so I'm able to use
it<00:01:20.909> for<00:01:21.090> planning<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.049> make<00:01:22.170> sure<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.439> I

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
it for planning and make sure that I

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.050 
it for planning and make sure that I
know<00:01:22.680> what<00:01:22.950> my<00:01:23.040> next<00:01:23.070> steps<00:01:23.520> are<00:01:23.670> as<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.850> teacher

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
and also so that I can differentiate for

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.460 
and also so that I can differentiate for
the<00:01:26.909> specific<00:01:27.450> needs<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.750> my<00:01:27.900> students<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.380> my

what<00:03:03.829> I<00:03:04.010> can<00:03:04.310> target<00:03:04.639> my<00:03:04.939> instruction<00:03:05.510> towards

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
what I can target my instruction towards

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.599 
what I can target my instruction towards
the<00:03:06.049> next<00:03:06.230> time<00:03:06.409> I<00:03:06.439> review<00:03:06.859> a<00:03:06.889> certain<00:03:07.280> skill

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
the next time I review a certain skill

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.220 
the next time I review a certain skill
so<00:03:07.790> if<00:03:07.879> I<00:03:08.030> have<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.510> students<00:03:08.840> discussing

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
so if I have the students discussing

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.869 
so if I have the students discussing
something<00:03:09.769> it's<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:10.010> lot<00:03:10.159> easier<00:03:10.340> for<00:03:10.549> me<00:03:10.790> to

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
something it's a lot easier for me to

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.899 
something it's a lot easier for me to
tell<00:03:11.239> what<00:03:11.510> their<00:03:12.349> thoughts<00:03:12.650> process<00:03:13.220> was<00:03:13.459> and

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:13.909 
tell what their thoughts process was and

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.899 
tell what their thoughts process was and
what<00:03:14.269> I<00:03:14.299> can<00:03:14.599> be<00:03:14.750> reviewing<00:03:15.319> as<00:03:15.470> a<00:03:15.500> teacher

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
what I can be reviewing as a teacher

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:17.890 
what I can be reviewing as a teacher

is that I can create formative

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.009 
is that I can create formative
assessments<00:03:38.060> in<00:03:38.150> a<00:03:38.209> lot<00:03:38.389> of<00:03:38.419> different<00:03:38.870> ways

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
assessments in a lot of different ways

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.319 
assessments in a lot of different ways

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
they also have some games that can

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.629 
they also have some games that can
really<00:03:41.480> engage<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.109> kids<00:03:42.290> in<00:03:42.590> the<00:03:43.010> process<00:03:43.459> of

doing<00:03:43.879> this<00:03:44.120> formative<00:03:44.569> assessment<00:03:45.079> they<00:03:45.169> can

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
doing this formative assessment they can

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.930 
doing this formative assessment they can
sort<00:03:45.560> of<00:03:45.650> compete<00:03:46.040> with<00:03:46.220> one<00:03:46.400> another

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
sort of compete with one another

sort of compete with one another
tell<00:03:47.239> us<00:03:47.329> about<00:03:47.419> exit<00:03:47.840> ticket<00:03:48.079> yeah<00:03:48.590> so<00:03:48.829> exit

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
tell us about exit ticket yeah so exit

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.619 
tell us about exit ticket yeah so exit
ticket<00:03:49.519> is<00:03:49.609> great<00:03:49.790> because<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.209> gives<00:03:50.359> me<00:03:50.540> the

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
ticket is great because it gives me the

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.629 
ticket is great because it gives me the
opportunity<00:03:51.199> to<00:03:51.229> use<00:03:51.620> that<00:03:51.650> strong<00:03:52.129> reporting

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
opportunity to use that strong reporting

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.149 
opportunity to use that strong reporting
I<00:03:52.819> get<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.419> look<00:03:53.599> at<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:54.049> exit<00:03:54.379> ticket<00:03:54.680> formats

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:55.159 
I get to look at the exit ticket formats

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:57.909 
I get to look at the exit ticket formats
to<00:03:55.459> decide<00:03:55.819> how<00:03:56.569> my<00:03:56.780> kids<00:03:57.049> did<00:03:57.290> on<00:03:57.560> their

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
to decide how my kids did on their

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.439 
to decide how my kids did on their
assessments<00:03:58.459> I<00:03:58.549> can<00:03:58.729> look<00:03:58.849> at<00:03:59.000> very<00:03:59.209> different

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449 
assessments I can look at very different

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.629 
assessments I can look at very different
dashboards<00:04:00.079> and<00:04:00.260> tell<00:04:00.530> how<00:04:00.979> they're<00:04:01.220> being

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
dashboards and tell how they're being

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.219 
dashboards and tell how they're being
successful<00:04:01.879> with<00:04:02.389> certain<00:04:02.659> things<00:04:02.690> and<00:04:03.139> what

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:03.229 
successful with certain things and what

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:05.379 
successful with certain things and what
they<00:04:03.379> still<00:04:03.590> need<00:04:03.739> to<00:04:03.769> review<00:04:04.040> it<00:04:04.940> gives<00:04:05.180> me<00:04:05.329> a

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
they still need to review it gives me a

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.990 
they still need to review it gives me a
chance<00:04:05.659> to<00:04:05.989> give<00:04:06.650> assessments<00:04:07.459> either<00:04:07.639> in<00:04:07.909> the

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
chance to give assessments either in the

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.520 
chance to give assessments either in the
middle<00:04:08.150> of<00:04:08.359> a<00:04:08.449> lesson<00:04:08.629> I<00:04:08.930> can<00:04:08.959> do<00:04:09.199> something

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
middle of a lesson I can do something

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.869 
middle of a lesson I can do something
called<00:04:09.560> a<00:04:09.799> check<00:04:09.979> for<00:04:10.099> understanding<00:04:10.280> where<00:04:10.849> I

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 
called a check for understanding where I

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.189 
called a check for understanding where I
look<00:04:11.180> to<00:04:11.389> see<00:04:11.569> if<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.840> kids<00:04:12.049> are

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:12.199 
look to see if the kids are

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:13.960 
look to see if the kids are
understanding<00:04:12.829> my<00:04:12.919> teaching<00:04:13.310> as<00:04:13.459> I'm<00:04:13.639> going

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
understanding my teaching as I'm going

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.420 
understanding my teaching as I'm going
through<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.269> lesson<00:04:14.680> but<00:04:15.680> I<00:04:15.709> can<00:04:15.919> also<00:04:16.099> build

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
through the lesson but I can also build

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.250 
through the lesson but I can also build
more<00:04:16.669> traditional<00:04:17.239> exit<00:04:17.539> tickets<00:04:17.840> at<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.079> end

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
more traditional exit tickets at the end

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.250 
more traditional exit tickets at the end
of<00:04:18.409> the<00:04:18.500> lesson<00:04:18.889> and<00:04:19.039> give<00:04:19.820> them<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.239> final<00:04:20.659> sort

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
of the lesson and give them a final sort

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.750 
of the lesson and give them a final sort
of<00:04:21.349> chance<00:04:21.650> to<00:04:21.859> show<00:04:22.039> me<00:04:22.190> what<00:04:22.219> they<00:04:22.490> learned

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
of chance to show me what they learned

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.750 
of chance to show me what they learned
and<00:04:23.450> what's<00:04:23.630> valuable<00:04:23.900> about<00:04:24.110> verso<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:25.310> gives

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
and what's valuable about verso it gives

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.060 
and what's valuable about verso it gives
students<00:04:26.180> an<00:04:26.270> opportunity<00:04:26.510> to

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
students an opportunity to

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.580 
students an opportunity to
watch<00:04:28.340> a<00:04:28.490> video<00:04:28.790> or<00:04:29.210> look<00:04:29.780> at<00:04:29.900> a<00:04:29.960> task<00:04:30.260> and

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
watch a video or look at a task and

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.620 
watch a video or look at a task and
respond<00:04:30.980> to<00:04:31.070> a<00:04:31.160> task<00:04:31.430> in<00:04:31.700> a<00:04:31.790> discussion<00:04:32.270> format

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
respond to a task in a discussion format

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.060 
respond to a task in a discussion format
so<00:04:32.840> they<00:04:32.960> log<00:04:33.200> in<00:04:33.380> and<00:04:33.410> they<00:04:33.650> write<00:04:33.860> their
