that<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.050> field<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.620> actually<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.579> life

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
that the field is actually it's life

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.119 
that the field is actually it's life
time<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.210> up<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.930> need<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> base<00:00:43.379> contractor

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
time is up so you need a base contractor

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the inside of the trash we have to take

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.479 
the inside of the trash we have to take
out<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> existing<00:01:00.809> field<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.500> removed<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
out the existing field so we removed the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.380 
out the existing field so we removed the
existing<00:01:03.260> natural<00:01:04.260> turf<00:01:04.470> that's<00:01:04.680> here<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.390> we

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
existing natural turf that's here and we

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.480 
existing natural turf that's here and we
take<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.409> all<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> way<00:01:07.920> down<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.280> what<00:01:08.400> we

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
take that all the way down to what we

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.700 
take that all the way down to what we
call<00:01:08.520> sub<00:01:08.939> base<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.450> we<00:01:09.600> install<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> drainage

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
call sub base and we install a drainage

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.010 
call sub base and we install a drainage
system<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.490> that's<00:01:12.030> what<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.600> those<00:01:12.869> are

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
system and that's what that those are

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.420 
system and that's what that those are
all<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> components<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.680> are<00:01:13.799> make<00:01:14.159> up<00:01:14.310> a

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
all the components that are make up a

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.770 
all the components that are make up a
synthetic<00:01:14.850> turf<00:01:15.030> system<00:01:15.509> but<00:01:15.659> their

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
synthetic turf system but their

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.899 
synthetic turf system but their
components<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.530> don't<00:01:16.710> see<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.729> we're

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
components we don't see so we're

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.609 
components we don't see so we're
actually<00:01:18.090> connecting<00:01:18.810> into<00:01:18.990> existing

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
actually connecting into existing

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.770 
actually connecting into existing
stormwater<00:01:20.130> systems<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.540> can

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
stormwater systems so that we can

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.719 
stormwater systems so that we can
control<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.409> water<00:01:22.590> as<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.070> comes<00:01:23.310> into<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
control the water as it comes into the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.660 
control the water as it comes into the
field<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.450> where<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.659> drains<00:01:24.930> off<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.409> Plus<00:01:26.250> on

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
field and where it drains off to Plus on

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.390 
field and where it drains off to Plus on
top<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:27.990> filter<00:01:28.920> fabric<00:01:29.250> which

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
top of that you have filter fabric which

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.490 
top of that you have filter fabric which
is<00:01:29.520> placed<00:01:29.729> over<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.150> subgrade<00:01:30.600> make<00:01:31.290> sure

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
is placed over the subgrade make sure

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.410 
is placed over the subgrade make sure
that<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.280> dirt<00:01:32.490> doesn't<00:01:32.759> mix<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.270> with

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
that the the dirt doesn't mix in with

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.010 
that the the dirt doesn't mix in with
the<00:01:33.570> snow

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the snow

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.539 
the snow
we're<00:01:34.530> in<00:01:34.619> with<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> water<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.369> have

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
we're in with the water so you have

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.130 
we're in with the water so you have
clean<00:01:35.790> water<00:01:35.820> running<00:01:36.329> off<00:01:36.540> into<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.840> major

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
clean water running off into the major

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.210 
clean water running off into the major
storm<00:01:37.649> water<00:01:37.890> system<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.829> come<00:01:41.070> in

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
storm water system and so you come in

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.340 
storm water system and so you come in
and<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.460> excavate<00:01:41.790> all<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.360> out<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.750> then

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
and you excavate all that out and then
