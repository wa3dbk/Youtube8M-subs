00:00:45.343 --> 00:00:48.378
In the desert of incomprehension

00:00:49.225 --> 00:00:52.004
God's love to call for us

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:55.991
(raising) Lifting us from struggle

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.676
Drying tears in a rushed world

00:01:04.254 --> 00:01:07.392
In Damascus, in the portal of light

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.997
The unforgettable weaver

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:15.069
will be enchanted by the celestial vision

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:18.893
bow before the Master

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:22.822
be dazzled by the friendly light

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:28.231
and finally understand the meaning of life

00:01:31.228 --> 00:01:33.968
Word in harmony

00:01:35.206 --> 00:01:38.737
Songs masterfully intoned

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:43.413
By angels of sublimated spheres

00:01:43.847 --> 00:01:48.647
In the bright light that dazzles 
the sunshine

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.200
Compassionate, inspired, loving

00:01:57.914 --> 00:02:00.598
walks the paths

00:02:01.103 --> 00:02:05.836
Calms the groaning of the afflicted

00:02:06.595 --> 00:02:09.958
Of all the little brothers and sisters

00:02:10.508 --> 00:02:15.413
All of those that are thirsting for God, for love

00:02:16.028 --> 00:02:22.057
For you are my chosen vessel

00:02:23.784 --> 00:02:26.565
It is &lt;i&gt;essential to love 
&lt;/i&gt;(necessary, required)

00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:30.543
Renew oneself in understanding

00:02:31.427 --> 00:02:34.459
It is necessary to work,

00:02:34.646 --> 00:02:38.310
To be faithful in very little things and faithful in much

00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:41.912
It's necessary to wait

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:46.018
Hope is a companion

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.370
It's necessary to forgive

00:02:49.618 --> 00:02:54.983
The purest love gives itself
(The purest love is self-giving)

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.344
