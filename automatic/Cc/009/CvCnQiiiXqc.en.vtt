00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
to help manage this pin getting it out

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.529 
to help manage this pin getting it out
flapping<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.670> be<00:01:02.879> put<00:01:03.090> back<00:01:03.270> in

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
flapping it so it can be put back in

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:12.749 
flapping it so it can be put back in
that's<00:01:04.229> all<00:01:07.070> our<00:01:08.070> nut<00:01:08.729> comes<00:01:09.299> off

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:19.859 

washer<00:01:13.759> comes<00:01:14.240> off<00:01:16.930> and<00:01:18.009> at<00:01:19.009> this<00:01:19.220> point

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
washer comes off and at this point

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.480 
washer comes off and at this point
you're<00:01:20.869> hoping<00:01:21.259> that<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.560> propeller<00:01:21.979> will

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
you're hoping that the propeller will

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.330 
you're hoping that the propeller will
slide<00:01:22.850> off<00:01:22.880> easily<00:01:23.420> if<00:01:24.409> it<00:01:24.710> doesn't<00:01:25.100> come<00:01:25.280> off

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
slide off easily if it doesn't come off

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.080 
slide off easily if it doesn't come off
easily<00:01:25.960> then<00:01:26.960> you<00:01:27.200> might<00:01:27.610> give<00:01:28.610> it<00:01:28.790> a<00:01:28.880> little

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
easily then you might give it a little

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.200 
easily then you might give it a little
tap<00:01:29.450> with<00:01:29.720> a<00:01:29.840> rubber<00:01:30.140> mallet<00:01:30.580> back<00:01:31.580> here<00:01:32.030> at

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
tap with a rubber mallet back here at

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.350 
tap with a rubber mallet back here at
the<00:01:32.360> starts<00:01:32.750> of<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.369> propellers<00:01:34.369> if<00:01:35.119> it

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
the starts of the propellers if it

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.440 
the starts of the propellers if it
doesn't<00:01:35.659> come<00:01:35.990> off<00:01:36.259> don't<00:01:37.220> force<00:01:37.640> it<00:01:37.820> put<00:01:38.330> the

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
doesn't come off don't force it put the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.660 
doesn't come off don't force it put the
nut<00:01:38.690> a<00:01:38.899> washer<00:01:39.409> back<00:01:39.619> on<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:40.009> pin<00:01:40.250> back<00:01:40.430> on

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
nut a washer back on the pin back on

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.539 
nut a washer back on the pin back on
take<00:01:41.539> it<00:01:41.570> down<00:01:41.899> to<00:01:42.049> your<00:01:42.140> boat<00:01:42.350> shop<00:01:42.649> get<00:01:43.340> them

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
take it down to your boat shop get them

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.120 
take it down to your boat shop get them
to<00:01:43.729> use<00:01:43.909> a<00:01:43.940> propeller<00:01:44.450> puller<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:45.649> get<00:01:45.830> it<00:01:45.979> off

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
to use a propeller puller to get it off

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.779 
to use a propeller puller to get it off
but<00:01:46.970> hopefully<00:01:47.330> it'll<00:01:47.840> come<00:01:48.140> straight<00:01:48.440> off

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.510 

now<00:01:52.789> here's<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:53.450> point<00:01:54.140> where<00:01:54.409> we<00:01:54.560> need<00:01:54.590> to

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
now here's the point where we need to

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.059 
now here's the point where we need to
put<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.789> grease<00:01:56.030> on<00:01:56.240> and<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:57.710> job<00:01:57.890> of<00:01:57.920> the

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
put the grease on and the job of the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.930 
put the grease on and the job of the
grease<00:01:58.340> here<00:01:58.610> at<00:01:58.700> this<00:01:58.850> point<00:01:59.179> is<00:02:00.140> actually<00:02:00.740> to

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
grease here at this point is actually to

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.130 
grease here at this point is actually to
stop<00:02:02.319> any<00:02:03.670> corrosion<00:02:04.810> occurring<00:02:05.810> because<00:02:05.929> of

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
stop any corrosion occurring because of

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.180 
stop any corrosion occurring because of
different<00:02:06.590> metals<00:02:06.740> of<00:02:07.130> your<00:02:08.030> propeller

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
different metals of your propeller

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.650 
different metals of your propeller
touching<00:02:10.190> on<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.610> shaft<00:02:12.040> so<00:02:13.040> I<00:02:13.069> put<00:02:13.660> be

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
touching on to the shaft so I put be

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.250 
touching on to the shaft so I put be
generous<00:02:15.110> with<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.440> grease<00:02:16.840> little<00:02:17.840> come<00:02:18.079> off

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260

generous with the grease little come off
any<00:02:18.680> excess<00:02:18.980> will<00:02:19.190> come<00:02:19.400> off<00:02:19.780> later<00:02:21.519> bit

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
any excess will come off later bit

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.450 
any excess will come off later bit
around<00:02:22.790> you

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
around you

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:31.120 
around you
shaft<00:02:25.460> doesn't<00:02:25.880> hurt<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:29.470> on<00:02:30.470> goes<00:02:30.740> your<00:02:30.980> new

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
shaft doesn't hurt and on goes your new

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:44.470 
shaft doesn't hurt and on goes your new
propeller<00:02:37.540> slips<00:02:38.540> in<00:02:38.750> nicely<00:02:39.020> there<00:02:43.480> I'll

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
propeller slips in nicely there I'll

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.790 
propeller slips in nicely there I'll
wash<00:02:45.260> it<00:02:45.290> back<00:02:45.650> on<00:02:47.830> old<00:02:48.830> nut<00:02:49.630> back<00:02:50.630> on<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.770> now

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
wash it back on old nut back on and now

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:59.980 
wash it back on old nut back on and now
pin<00:02:52.730> back<00:02:53.330> in<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:58.640> there<00:02:58.850> you<00:02:58.970> go<00:02:59.030> quite<00:02:59.810> easily

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
pin back in so there you go quite easily

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.380 
pin back in so there you go quite easily
done
