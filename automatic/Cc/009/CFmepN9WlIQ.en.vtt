00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:04.089
 it's not easy to play the pedal steel guitar 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.330
 you have to drag islands of aran and if the club so much money on the ropes 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.490
 while operating a pedal and latch system 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:16.779
 this one uses both his hands both feet it was on Thursday 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.380
 the pedal steel guitar classified green are to privilege a musical register 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.940
 impressive 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.100
 Friday it would be good to subscribe no I am of course very disappointed 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.300
 make an account 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.400
 Sarkozy and other Chinese and British leaders have landed in Paris 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.490
 everybody 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:55.460
 Friday 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.460
 - in the world 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.809
 the economists all these settings and on top the danger is real 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.930
 aeronautical aluminum earphone port a reinforcement for the frame 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.980
 guitar 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.700
 when we remove the reinforcement stones thrown rolling under beautiful remains 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.820
 of the structure 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.869
 then it was believed until the final get either 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.350
 plant 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.750
 - in the world 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.750
 then the music is a piece called by mechanical 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.180
 take into account 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.110
 these holes in the highlands that had been fixed the mechanics of 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.110
 the rating 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.140
 when we set the tray on the sleeve just above the touch 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.350
 Civil society 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.000
 she will receive the microphones that sweat the bond floor as well 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 that a pivot series 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.170
 to make its pivots factory several pieces in aluminum 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.610
 maintain the Azores 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.160
 the movement of the pivots makes it possible to increase or to lower the height of 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.139
 string notes 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.279
 we served as a pivot in a force of the plate of microphones 

00:02:17.279 --> 00:02:20.279
 and we live on the spot 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.069
 to check the movements of the pivots they have attached to the ground at 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.079
 the end of every human being 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.079
 to maintain tension his team 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:38.089
 a little grease facilitates the next operation 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:41.089
 in front of a church room 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:47.839
 then we go around the instrument to make a system that allows 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:50.839
 or pedaling or texier frogger of the team 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:54.239
 we are aiming at several axes 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.239
 one for each school around the wind instrument 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.269
 -30- 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.059
 brendan venter 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:05.049
 well it's hanging on the axes 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.239
 as for the son of my spirit I will decide at all levels 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:11.999
 and hangs 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:15.869
 Friday 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:19.319
 this system will allow the musicians to tighten to loosen the strings 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.349
 quantifying 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.090
 it's a kind of boiler agreement that gives the pedal steel 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.090
 guitar what are the features 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.280
 Hong Kong 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.280
 - in the world 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.059
 demand is increasing 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:38.729
 Friday 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.729
 we check the toggle to make sure they work 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:53.819
 to make a microphone surrounded by 2010 coils and wire thickness of 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.819
 copper 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.199
 substitutes Sunday between two of these two countries 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.579
 it must now be completed it is placed in another area of â€‹â€‹the oven plate 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.870
 just above the cleavages 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.510
 then we do not use gauge it says it to adjust the microphone 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:27.909
 when this one has to be enough more voters had to be 

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:29.050
 stack in the right place 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.050
 otherwise the street parade will not be yesterday 

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:41.789
 ten or twelve strings are attached to the market on certain instruments or 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.789
 handle to give or are even more dimension 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.819
 here is an instrument school
