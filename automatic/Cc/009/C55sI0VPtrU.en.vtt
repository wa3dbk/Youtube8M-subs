aircraft f-16 it's mine I got probably

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.279 
aircraft f-16 it's mine I got probably
got<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.520> guess<00:00:21.390> I<00:00:21.480> got<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.720> back<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:21.990> March

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
got it I guess I got it back in March

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.800 
got it I guess I got it back in March
but<00:00:22.650> I've<00:00:22.980> just<00:00:23.010> really<00:00:23.490> now<00:00:23.670> started<00:00:24.150> to<00:00:24.330> kind

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
but I've just really now started to kind

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.830 
but I've just really now started to kind
of<00:00:24.840> go<00:00:24.990> gangbusters<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:26.449> will<00:00:27.449> be<00:00:27.539> powered

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
of go gangbusters on it will be powered

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.099 
of go gangbusters on it will be powered
with<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.170> Stu<00:00:28.949> max<00:00:29.250> EDF<00:00:29.609> unit<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.210> have<00:00:30.539> ordered

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
with a Stu max EDF unit I have ordered

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.370 
with a Stu max EDF unit I have ordered
the<00:00:31.219> Stu<00:00:32.219> max<00:00:32.489> Inlet<00:00:33.300> ducting<00:00:33.750> specific<00:00:34.260> to

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
the Stu max Inlet ducting specific to

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.160 
the Stu max Inlet ducting specific to
that<00:00:34.559> engine<00:00:35.210> I<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:36.660> like<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> way<00:00:36.930> that

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
that engine I just like the way that

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.240 
that engine I just like the way that
sounds<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.980> little<00:00:38.070> bit<00:00:38.250> smaller<00:00:38.640> less<00:00:39.510> weight

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
sounds a little bit smaller less weight

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.299 
sounds a little bit smaller less weight
so<00:00:41.250> I'm<00:00:41.700> gonna<00:00:41.879> give<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.239> try<00:00:42.829> I<00:00:43.829> really

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
so I'm gonna give that a try I really

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.330 
so I'm gonna give that a try I really
haven't<00:00:45.239> done<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.480> whole<00:00:45.809> lot<00:00:45.870> on<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.410> yet<00:00:46.620> I've

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
haven't done a whole lot on it yet I've

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.520 
haven't done a whole lot on it yet I've
test<00:00:47.670> fitted<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.180> landing<00:00:48.960> gear<00:00:49.140> as<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.379> can

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
test fitted the landing gear as you can

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.279 
test fitted the landing gear as you can
see<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.039> not<00:00:50.190> actually<00:00:50.670> glued<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.289> I'm

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
see here it's not actually glued in I'm

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.470 
see here it's not actually glued in I'm
gonna<00:00:52.410> have<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.710> make<00:00:52.829> some<00:00:53.070> modifications

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
gonna have to make some modifications

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.150 
gonna have to make some modifications
actually<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.780> servo<00:00:55.260> arm<00:00:55.410> from<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.770> steering

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
actually the servo arm from the steering

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.610 
actually the servo arm from the steering
arm<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.660> rubbing<00:00:57.660> against<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> ducting<00:00:58.469> there

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
arm is rubbing against the ducting there

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.560 
arm is rubbing against the ducting there
you<00:00:58.739> can<00:00:58.890> kind<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.129> see<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.489> silhouette<00:01:00.390> of

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
you can kind of see the silhouette of

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.349 
you can kind of see the silhouette of
that<00:01:00.859> anyways<00:01:01.859> I'll<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.370> shim<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:02.910> up<00:01:03.149> on

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
that anyways I'll have to shim it up on

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.020 
that anyways I'll have to shim it up on
the<00:01:03.449> advice<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:04.790> gun<00:01:05.790> rad<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.270> RC<00:01:07.110> Universe<00:01:08.030> I

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the advice of gun rad on RC Universe I

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.289 
the advice of gun rad on RC Universe I
have<00:01:09.960> built<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:10.470> wing<00:01:10.939> I'll<00:01:11.939> show<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.210> guys

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
have built one wing I'll show you guys

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.719 
have built one wing I'll show you guys
how<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.510> build<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> other<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:13.920> when<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.159> go<00:01:14.610> out

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
how to build the other one when I go out

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:15.980 
how to build the other one when I go out
and<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.939> kind<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.150> want<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.390> work<00:01:15.570> out<00:01:15.750> all<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
and I kind of want to work out all the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.899 
and I kind of want to work out all the
quirks<00:01:16.200> kind<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.619> see<00:01:16.770> how<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.670> all<00:01:17.850> goes

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
quirks kind of see how it all goes

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.590 
quirks kind of see how it all goes
together<00:01:18.240> but<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.340> was<00:01:20.460> kind<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.360> proud<00:01:21.540> of

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
together but and I was kind of proud of

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.490 
together but and I was kind of proud of
myself<00:01:21.750> there<00:01:22.200> look<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:22.590> they<00:01:22.820> got<00:01:23.820> the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
myself there look if they got the

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.350 
myself there look if they got the
tolerance<00:01:25.500> oh<00:01:25.590> they're<00:01:25.740> pretty<00:01:26.009> pretty<00:01:26.670> tight

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
tolerance oh they're pretty pretty tight

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.429 
tolerance oh they're pretty pretty tight
so<00:01:29.479> anyways<00:01:30.710> I'm<00:01:31.710> got<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.159> rear<00:01:33.439> horizontal

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
so anyways I'm got the rear horizontal

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.730 
so anyways I'm got the rear horizontal
stabs<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:35.189> about<00:01:35.400> ready<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.759> glass<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.740> just

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
stabs just about ready to glass I just

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.390 
stabs just about ready to glass I just
need<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.040> add<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.189> cap<00:01:39.150> piece<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.400> inside

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
need to add the cap piece to the inside

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.460 
need to add the cap piece to the inside
edge<00:01:41.430> here<00:01:41.970> I've<00:01:42.299> got<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.659> cap<00:01:42.869> piece<00:01:43.110> here

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
edge here I've got the cap piece here

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.819 
edge here I've got the cap piece here
it's<00:01:43.590> not<00:01:43.770> actually<00:01:44.070> glued<00:01:44.310> on<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:45.649> I'm<00:01:46.649> just

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
it's not actually glued on but I'm just

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.380 
it's not actually glued on but I'm just
about<00:01:47.130> ready<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.520> do<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.909> want<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.180> get<00:01:48.299> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
about ready to do that I want to get the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.780 
about ready to do that I want to get the
other<00:01:48.420> wing<00:01:48.720> built<00:01:48.930> first<00:01:49.399> so<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.610> can

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
other wing built first so that I can

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.209 
other wing built first so that I can
kind<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.090> measure<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.630> angles<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.820> everything

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
kind of measure the angles of everything

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.160 
kind of measure the angles of everything
the<00:01:56.219> only<00:01:56.579> former<00:01:57.119> I've<00:01:57.240> actually<00:01:57.659> glued<00:01:57.960> in

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
the only former I've actually glued in

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.370 
the only former I've actually glued in
is<00:01:58.409> this<00:01:58.619> rear<00:01:59.310> former<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.210> haven't<00:02:01.140> really

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
is this rear former so haven't really

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.109 
is this rear former so haven't really
missed<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.770> whole<00:02:01.979> heck<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.700> lot<00:02:02.729> that's

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
missed a whole heck of a lot that's

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.330 
missed a whole heck of a lot that's
actually<00:02:03.420> an<00:02:03.509> easy<00:02:03.689> step<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.439> whole

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
actually an easy step to the whole

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.270 
actually an easy step to the whole
construction<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.920> anyway<00:02:09.259> and<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.470> have<00:02:10.890> kind

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
construction so anyway and I have kind

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.680 
construction so anyway and I have kind
of<00:02:11.400> skip<00:02:11.730> some<00:02:11.940> steps<00:02:11.970> because<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.450> don't<00:02:12.599> have

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
of skip some steps because I don't have

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.100 
of skip some steps because I don't have
the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.650 
the
arts<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.500> thought<00:02:14.310> would<00:02:14.520> have<00:02:14.640> come<00:02:15.150> with<00:02:15.360> it<00:02:15.540> I

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
arts I thought would have come with it I
