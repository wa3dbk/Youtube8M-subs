through that gate and show you the

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.009 
through that gate and show you the
spillway<00:00:26.080> like<00:00:26.290> it's<00:00:26.470> supposed<00:00:26.680> to<00:00:26.830> work

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
spillway like it's supposed to work

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.810 
spillway like it's supposed to work
somebody<00:00:29.039> said<00:00:30.039> the<00:00:30.160> damn<00:00:30.369> didn't<00:00:30.670> look<00:00:30.760> like

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
somebody said the damn didn't look like

was<00:00:31.090> very<00:00:31.269> big<00:00:31.539> my<00:00:31.960> treads<00:00:32.559> are<00:00:33.210> six<00:00:34.210> feet

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
was very big my treads are six feet

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.090 
was very big my treads are six feet
apart<00:00:34.809> and<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:37.090> you<00:00:37.150> know<00:00:37.330> it's<00:00:37.510> a<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.860> may<00:00:39.040> be

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
apart and so you know it's a it may be

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.340 
apart and so you know it's a it may be
12<00:00:39.730> feet<00:00:39.820> across<00:00:40.030> here<00:00:40.930> and<00:00:41.080> then<00:00:41.170> of<00:00:41.320> course

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
12 feet across here and then of course

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.940 
12 feet across here and then of course
it<00:00:41.680> slows<00:00:42.460> way<00:00:42.670> down<00:00:42.699> at<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.150> base<00:00:43.330> of<00:00:43.360> the<00:00:43.660> dam

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
it slows way down at the base of the dam

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.959 
it slows way down at the base of the dam
back<00:00:44.950> side<00:00:45.280> front<00:00:46.210> side<00:00:46.420> is<00:00:47.020> probably<00:00:47.969> twice

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:48.969 
back side front side is probably twice

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.540 
back side front side is probably twice
that<00:00:49.329> 20<00:00:49.960> 25<00:00:50.320> feet<00:00:50.710> something<00:00:50.950> like<00:00:51.039> that<00:00:51.309> so

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
that 20 25 feet something like that so

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.220 
that 20 25 feet something like that so
it's<00:00:51.700> you<00:00:51.940> know<00:00:52.059> you<00:00:52.510> can<00:00:52.600> drive<00:00:52.780> across<00:00:52.989> it

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
it's you know you can drive across it

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.160 
it's you know you can drive across it
comfortably<00:00:53.620> a<00:00:54.579> couple<00:00:55.390> places<00:00:55.570> right<00:00:55.899> in

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
comfortably a couple places right in

the net damn ok so anyway got a nice
little<00:04:53.659> flow<00:04:53.930> through<00:04:54.289> here<00:04:54.439> right<00:04:54.560> now<00:04:54.770> and

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
little flow through here right now and

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.610 
little flow through here right now and
it<00:04:55.099> will<00:04:55.129> flow<00:04:55.490> like<00:04:55.520> this<00:04:55.729> for<00:04:56.409> for<00:04:57.409> quite<00:04:57.560> a

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
it will flow like this for for quite a

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.679 
it will flow like this for for quite a
while<00:04:58.509> that<00:04:59.509> is<00:04:59.659> probably<00:05:01.330> six<00:05:02.330> or<00:05:02.419> eight<00:05:02.509> feet

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:02.689 
while that is probably six or eight feet

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:04.600 
while that is probably six or eight feet
across<00:05:02.930> right<00:05:03.590> here<00:05:03.650> than<00:05:03.919> the<00:05:03.979> widest<00:05:04.340> point

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
across right here than the widest point

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.760 
across right here than the widest point
cuz<00:05:05.000> it's<00:05:05.180> shallow<00:05:05.449> then<00:05:06.199> over<00:05:06.439> here<00:05:06.469> where<00:05:06.680> it

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
cuz it's shallow then over here where it

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.110 
cuz it's shallow then over here where it
gets<00:05:06.860> a<00:05:06.979> little<00:05:07.069> deeper<00:05:07.460> it's<00:05:07.610> only<00:05:07.909> a<00:05:07.939> couple

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
gets a little deeper it's only a couple

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.680 
gets a little deeper it's only a couple
feet<00:05:08.419> wide<00:05:09.219> anyway<00:05:10.219> that's<00:05:10.490> it<00:05:10.729> I<00:05:11.030> believe

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
feet wide anyway that's it I believe

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:21.789 
feet wide anyway that's it I believe
we're<00:05:12.199> going<00:05:18.550> pretty<00:05:19.550> sunset
