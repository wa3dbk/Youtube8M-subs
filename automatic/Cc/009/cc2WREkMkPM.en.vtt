 hello everyone and welcome 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.209
 on my channel today at least 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.369
 tell you what purchases I brought 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:17.099
 with us from estonia we recently went to 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:19.829
 homeland and if you're interested then 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:23.400
 stay watching video i will show 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:25.619
 makeup cosmetics and I'll probably start with 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.050
 of what I bought on the ship 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.940
 if you don't know then on the ship also 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.860
 as well as the plane there is a tax free zone 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.070
 fashion products there is certainly a little bit 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.219
 cheaper and I knew that I would go to Estonia 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.430
 so I was planning to buy myself 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.060
 new facial and my attention i 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.370
 drew on products brand biotherm 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.040
 aquasource there was such a discount if 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.829
 buy a product and on a certain 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.079
 the amount that gives you a gift and the first thing 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.430
 I took it was strong cream here 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.630
 aquasource knows the spa 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.280
 This night cream I really liked 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.409
 now my skin after pregnancy 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.890
 begin to change like it used to be it 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.740
 was drier normal and prone to 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.950
 dryness now it is more normal and 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.439
 oily skin combined 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.030
 Now it's a little hard for me to pick up 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.420
 products 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.869
 makeup cosmetics in general, my eyes fell 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.819
 on the bioterm and in principle I am very 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.420
 liked this cream it is very dense 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:35.490
 but it seems to me more suitable 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.099
 winter time that is for summer is too 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.229
 too much moisture 

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:43.380
 but for now i'm wriggling about i'm using 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.340
 This product is already two weeks old and for now 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.200
 delighted 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.479
 usually when if wrong 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.619
 selected skin care my skin suffers 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.889
 subcutaneous acne and looks like this 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.259
 dim chtoli aged 

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:59.609
 But with this cream, in principle, my skin 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.270
 smooth 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:06.369
 shines 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:08.500
 non-fat moderately well-fed in general 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.810
 Pretty second I bought this cream 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.470
 under my eyes it is very difficult for me to pick up 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.390
 cream of water for the area around the eyes because 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.510
 I think I have a lot 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.910
 wrinkles and accordingly my skin is there 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.019
 very dry but this cream for now 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.330
 I am very happy with me as well 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.890
 now since i recently gave birth as 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.989
 9 months ago almost 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.079
 back i have dark circles under 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.420
 eyes and of course i am with this problem 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.040
 tried to fight 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.019
 but of course he doesn't 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.010
 copes with dark circles under 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.880
 with his eyes he has a shimmer so straight 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.880
 shimmy shimmy 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.010
 and it highlights the area around the eyes 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.769
 fits well under tonalnik not 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.530
 rolls down in general so far i'm happy 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.360
