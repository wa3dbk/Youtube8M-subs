00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
I saw another YouTube lad I think of a

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.330 
I saw another YouTube lad I think of a
survivalist<00:01:24.479> board<00:01:24.750> was<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> channel<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.500> he

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
survivalist board was the channel and he

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.990 
survivalist board was the channel and he
had<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.970> 6<00:01:27.869> foot<00:01:28.049> by<00:01:28.080> 8<00:01:28.350> foot<00:01:28.380> tart<00:01:28.860> by<00:01:29.549> folded

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
had a 6 foot by 8 foot tart by folded

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.219 
had a 6 foot by 8 foot tart by folded
underneath<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.479> which<00:01:30.630> would<00:01:30.810> indicate<00:01:31.079> that

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
underneath it which would indicate that

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.190 
underneath it which would indicate that
the<00:01:31.470> measurements<00:01:31.890> are<00:01:31.979> absolutely<00:01:32.460> correct

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
the measurements are absolutely correct

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.600 
the measurements are absolutely correct
I<00:01:34.200> only<00:01:34.500> used<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.009> tent<00:01:35.220> stakes<00:01:35.460> that

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
I only used one of the tent stakes that

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.010 
I only used one of the tent stakes that
came<00:01:35.759> with<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> tent<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.390> generally<00:01:36.780> use<00:01:36.810> mice

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.460 
ground is pretty pretty hard once you
get<00:01:41.820> past<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.329> top<00:01:42.659> layer<00:01:42.840> there<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
get past the top layer there the the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.440 
get past the top layer there the the
first<00:01:46.710> hoop<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.070> had<00:01:47.280> concerned<00:01:47.759> me<00:01:47.939> when<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.180> put

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
first hoop I had concerned me when I put

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.600 
first hoop I had concerned me when I put
it<00:01:48.540> through<00:01:48.720> because<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.470> locks<00:01:50.280> into<00:01:50.460> those

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
it through because it locks into those

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.130 
it through because it locks into those
little<00:01:50.759> keyring<00:01:51.390> pins<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.810> you'll<00:01:51.960> see

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
little keyring pins that you'll see

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.090 
little keyring pins that you'll see
commonly<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.710> tents<00:01:53.009> right<00:01:53.100> there<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.229> I<00:01:55.229> was

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
commonly on tents right there and I was

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.230 
commonly on tents right there and I was
muscle<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.670> bit<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.000> thought<00:01:57.149> you

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
muscle in it a bit and I thought you

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.240 
muscle in it a bit and I thought you
know<00:01:57.360> if<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.479> push<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.780> any<00:01:57.869> harder<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:59.100> uh

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
know if I push it any harder it's uh

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.950 
know if I push it any harder it's uh
it's<00:01:59.640> going<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.850> rip<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.329> had<00:02:00.509> Steve<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
it's going to rip so I had Steve have a

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.999 
it's going to rip so I had Steve have a
look<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.229> see<00:02:01.380> if<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.530> was<00:02:01.619> doing<00:02:01.710> anything

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
look to see if I was doing anything

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.649 
look to see if I was doing anything
wrong<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.430> turns<00:02:02.640> out<00:02:02.850> no<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.479> had<00:02:03.570> to

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
wrong and it turns out no just had to

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.880 
wrong and it turns out no just had to
apply<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.869> little<00:02:03.990> more<00:02:04.110> pressure<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.649> tent

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
apply a little more pressure the tent

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.050 
apply a little more pressure the tent
did<00:02:05.040> not<00:02:05.130> break<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.460> any<00:02:05.579> way<00:02:05.729> shape<00:02:05.909> or<00:02:06.000> form

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
did not break in any way shape or form

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.479 
did not break in any way shape or form
as<00:02:07.049> best<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.380> could<00:02:07.439> tell<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.860> fly<00:02:08.129> up<00:02:08.340> there

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
as best I could tell the fly up there

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.010 
as best I could tell the fly up there
was<00:02:08.670> actually<00:02:08.970> over<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.509> hoop<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.869> wrong

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
was actually over that hoop the wrong

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.029 
was actually over that hoop the wrong
way<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.410> think<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:10.709> might<00:02:10.860> have<00:02:10.979> been

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
way and I think that might have been

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.250 
way and I think that might have been
giving<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.489> little<00:02:11.670> too<00:02:11.819> much<00:02:12.000> tension

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
giving it a little too much tension

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.720 
giving it a little too much tension
so<00:02:13.440> that's<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.890> outside<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.400> Bibby<00:02:14.550> and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
so that's the outside of the Bibby and

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.369 
so that's the outside of the Bibby and
as<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.120> said<00:02:15.420> I'll<00:02:15.540> be<00:02:15.569> sleeping<00:02:16.050> in<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.260> and

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
as I said I'll be sleeping in it and

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.089 
as I said I'll be sleeping in it and
tomorrow<00:02:16.680> I'll<00:02:16.920> let<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.519> know<00:02:17.640> how<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.940> goes

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
tomorrow I'll let you know how it goes

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.559 
tomorrow I'll let you know how it goes

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.500 
days anyway so let's take a look at this
baby<00:02:30.989> I<00:02:31.890> got<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.310> say<00:02:32.489> I<00:02:32.519> like<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.879> fly<00:02:33.090> system

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
baby I got to say I like the fly system

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.820 
baby I got to say I like the fly system
as<00:02:33.599> you<00:02:33.690> can<00:02:33.810> see<00:02:33.930> I've<00:02:34.019> just<00:02:34.200> got<00:02:34.349> that<00:02:34.379> corner

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
as you can see I've just got that corner

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.250 
as you can see I've just got that corner
open<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.940> can<00:02:36.090> see<00:02:36.239> that<00:02:36.390> little<00:02:36.540> line<00:02:36.930> over

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
open you can see that little line over

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.780 
open you can see that little line over
there<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.620> actually<00:02:37.920> pulls<00:02:38.129> out<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.549> part

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
there it actually pulls out to that part

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.280 
there it actually pulls out to that part
as<00:02:38.879> well<00:02:39.030> or<00:02:39.209> if<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.450> want<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.870> can<00:02:40.019> pull<00:02:40.170> the

as well or if you want you can pull the

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.009 
as well or if you want you can pull the
end<00:02:40.440> off<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.769> you<00:02:40.829> can<00:02:40.950> roll<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:42.390> fly<00:02:42.750> up<00:02:42.900> the

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
end off and you can roll that fly up the

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.449 
end off and you can roll that fly up the
entire<00:02:43.290> way<00:02:43.470> I'm<00:02:43.769> not<00:02:43.950> going<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.159> bother<00:02:44.250> doing
