feeling<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.390> side<00:04:19.660> of<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:19.959> frame<00:04:20.230> and

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
feeling the side of the frame and

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.610

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
holding it with my thumb also so I'm

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.650 
holding it with my thumb also so I'm
feeling<00:04:23.890> the<00:04:24.160> frame<00:04:24.520> with<00:04:24.790> this<00:04:25.030> finger<00:04:25.300> and

feeling the frame with this finger and

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:42.390 
feeling the frame with this finger and
the<00:04:25.990> weld<00:04:26.280> so<00:04:27.280> I<00:04:27.310> can<00:04:27.610> position<00:04:28.210> that<00:04:41.130> it<00:04:42.130> comes

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
the weld so I can position that it comes

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.860 
the weld so I can position that it comes
to<00:04:42.610> splice<00:04:43.060> in<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.510> back<00:04:45.240> all<00:04:46.240> I<00:04:46.300> do<00:04:46.510> is<00:04:46.840> just

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
to splice in the back all I do is just

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.520 
to splice in the back all I do is just
cut<00:04:47.320> this<00:04:47.530> about<00:04:48.190> an<00:04:48.340> inch<00:04:48.610> longer<00:04:49.410> kind<00:04:50.410> of

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
cut this about an inch longer kind of

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.830 
cut this about an inch longer kind of
the<00:04:50.710> same<00:04:50.980> thing<00:04:51.250> we<00:04:51.400> did<00:04:51.580> with<00:04:51.640> the<00:04:51.910> sewing

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.680 

but<00:04:55.840> this<00:04:56.050> is<00:04:56.230> a<00:04:56.260> little<00:04:56.650> different<00:04:57.130> I<00:04:57.280> just

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
but this is a little different I just

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.070 
but this is a little different I just
can<00:04:58.690> just<00:04:58.870> cut<00:04:59.470> the<00:04:59.500> weld<00:04:59.910> out<00:05:00.910> cut<00:05:01.540> that<00:05:01.780> off

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
can just cut the weld out cut that off

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.930 
can just cut the weld out cut that off
even<00:05:02.800> with<00:05:03.790> these<00:05:03.940> and<00:05:05.040> then<00:05:06.040> fold<00:05:06.370> this<00:05:06.640> over

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
even with these and then fold this over

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:14.220 
even with these and then fold this over
and<00:05:09.900> tuck<00:05:10.900> the<00:05:11.110> other<00:05:11.140> weld<00:05:11.560> into<00:05:11.860> it<00:05:12.930> and<00:05:13.930> that

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
and tuck the other weld into it and that

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:20.930 
and tuck the other weld into it and that
finishes<00:05:14.830> it<00:05:15.010> off

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.890 

the<00:05:21.480> next<00:05:21.840> step<00:05:22.310> is<00:05:23.310> to<00:05:23.700> put<00:05:23.910> on<00:05:24.090> cardboard

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
the next step is to put on cardboard

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.570 
the next step is to put on cardboard
stripping<00:05:25.800> on<00:05:26.760> the<00:05:26.790> welt<00:05:28.010> it<00:05:29.010> has<00:05:29.220> to<00:05:29.430> be

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
stripping on the welt it has to be

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.140 
stripping on the welt it has to be
stapled<00:05:30.090> on<00:05:30.410> otherwise<00:05:31.410> the<00:05:31.770> welting<00:05:32.250> can

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
stapled on otherwise the welting can

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:44.570 
stapled on otherwise the welting can
move<00:05:33.390> very<00:05:33.750> easily<00:05:42.980> when<00:05:43.980> you<00:05:44.070> come<00:05:44.310> to<00:05:44.460> the

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
move very easily when you come to the

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.750 
move very easily when you come to the
corners<00:05:45.030> all<00:05:45.600> you<00:05:45.720> got<00:05:45.870> to<00:05:45.960> do<00:05:46.080> is<00:05:46.230> kink<00:05:46.760> the

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
corners all you got to do is kink the

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.390 
corners all you got to do is kink the
cardboard<00:05:48.360> stripping<00:05:48.960> and<00:05:49.710> it'll<00:05:50.220> come

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
cardboard stripping and it'll come
