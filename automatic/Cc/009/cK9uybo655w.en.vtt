00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.630

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.810

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.420
 recipe of a turkish cuisine and that 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.020

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.120
 I have the recipe for you today 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.559
 powder and then we come to the now 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.730
 We need 250 ingredients for the dough 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:55.020
 gram flour so a glass that fits exactly 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.930
 100 milliliters of milk and 100 milliliters 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.359
 I would say 100 grams of yogurt 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.300
 Measured with the same glass as one 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.260
 Glass of yogurt two a package 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.170
 vanilla sugar a packet of baking powder juice 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:15.420
 a pinch of salt and half a lemon 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.509
 such a tablespoon gries for which it lures 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.350
 namely one kilo of sugar 750 milliliters 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.900
 water and juice of half a lemon 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.780
 that can be better too much will that 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.689
 I'll tell you then but the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.130
 Then you just have to drink plenty of syrup 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.710
 be immersed 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.520
 that's why we need to be in merzig and 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.670
 you can still do that 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.630

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:57.570
 cook properly and then refrigerate 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.090
 because the oil has to liberate properly 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.100
 you can just do that too 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.110
