00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.849
 so that's actually the bluesman that his notes 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.849
 the ecological mobile that will be released soon 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.560
 of its peculiarity first of all it's to have the tier 1 packaging is from 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.970
 reduced size which actually allows during transport in the most 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:20.769
 secure 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.769
 not in the canyon and therefore spend less than that during transport 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.529
 composed of 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.919
 of a matter actually did in a year 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.529
 recycled plastic bottles selebi in five or six that are 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:33.430
 recycled 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.680
 and who do so 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.890
 the practice 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.940
 oddo you have a solar panel 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.340
 23 square centimeters so it's still important enough for a mobile 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.120
 and that allows you to party first a secondary energy source for 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.250
 change your mobile 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.990
 so you still have the charger if a charger says m endemol big 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.770
 exchanged who is still plugged in they spend less energy than the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.960
 other chargers and seen the solar panel it's a complementary charge 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.940
 so it works 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.240
 in the light of the sun and also in the artificial light would see many 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.680
 raise a presentation 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.560
 3-inch touch screen 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.050
 3g + wifi 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.530
 the cpsc 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.070
 this camera mp3 player 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.350
 your team iselle 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.610
 so he still has a lot of confidence and also his 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.799
 particularities this case a really attractive mobile% especially for 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.280
 young people looking for touch 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.480
 and that is also ecological 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.480
 what you show a small application% ecological 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.370
 so you have a party 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.910
 mainly applications so you have a profile echoes if you 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.910
 actually allows to turn off the wifi 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.930
 which is also to change the duration of the backlighting which would allow 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.210
 to save from africa 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.210
 and you also have to commit them 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.890
 it's a pedometer 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.980
 so in fact when you walk worried in your page for example 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.240
 I'm not going there 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.130
 but I guarantee you hate it 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.830
 so when you walk 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.960
 actually tell your purposes and beforehand to re-record actually the 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.990
 consumption of your car 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.930
 This will let you know before 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.040
 in 2007 for example 150 parent 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.750
 you have to save to get along is audel compared to what you 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.159
 have written your car 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.010
 and then you can turn that into the number of saved trees you have 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.749
 also a small application maa al to unlock 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:17.979
 the screen 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:20.649
 no actually to you have a flowing tap so to unlock the screen 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:23.459
 it is necessary to stop running tap is not green 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.049
 all that all this is a sensitized fact e 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.499
 people are tired of the environment following a concern is over 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.389
 in more important 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:34.779
 to actually find the interface it drunk me so that is the device that 

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:37.779
 relate to it 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.989
 on the mobile touch on the entire range of touchscreen mobile then at the level 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.009
 from the menu 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:45.109
 you have germany in three parts 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.159
 time actually allows it's directly function 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.159
 without having to make several clips 1 on the functions 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:54.599
 to expose it an hour 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.489
 e in the sunlight where the artificial moon 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.349
 you may have decreased communication in 3g 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.430
 and then that also allows that in addition they use pages sometimes like 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.430
 that and then recharge 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:07.939
 here
