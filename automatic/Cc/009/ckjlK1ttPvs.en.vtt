00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
prologue it's pretty much accurate I

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.240 
prologue it's pretty much accurate I
mean<00:00:35.120> it's<00:00:36.120> interesting<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:37.170> very<00:00:37.500> cool<00:00:38.190> to

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
mean it's interesting it's very cool to

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.110 
mean it's interesting it's very cool to
look<00:00:38.640> at<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:38.910> mean<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.920> crazy<00:00:40.920> at<00:00:41.910> one<00:00:42.090> point

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120

and<00:00:44.329> the<00:00:45.329> main<00:00:45.570> concern<00:00:45.809> with<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.739> Baines

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
and the main concern with it is Baines

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.189 
and the main concern with it is Baines
voice<00:00:48.030> or<00:00:49.280> rather<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.760> case<00:00:51.090> just<00:00:51.199> being

voice or rather in this case just being

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.310 
voice or rather in this case just being

hearing what bane was saying i only made
out<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.049> couple<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.559> things<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:05.280> he<00:01:05.460> said

out a couple of things that he said
that's<00:01:06.390> right<00:01:06.780> Christopher<00:01:07.260> Nolan<00:01:07.619> has

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
that's right Christopher Nolan has

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.920 
that's right Christopher Nolan has
created<00:01:08.070> another<00:01:08.280> character<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.479> even

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
created another character that is even

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.679 
created another character that is even
harder<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.680> understand<00:01:11.280> even<00:01:12.090> more<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.510> than

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
harder to understand even more so than

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.240 
harder to understand even more so than
Batman<00:01:13.140> if<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.590> thought<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.830> was<00:01:13.920> hard<00:01:14.130> to

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
Batman if you thought it was hard to

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.030 
Batman if you thought it was hard to
hear<00:01:14.280> what<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.760> man<00:01:15.090> was<00:01:15.270> saying<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.560> much

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
hear what that man was saying it is much

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.249 
hear what that man was saying it is much
much<00:01:17.759> harder<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.360> understand<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:18.900> bane<00:01:19.080> is

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
much harder to understand what bane is

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.800 
much harder to understand what bane is
saying<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.680> lot<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.860> people<00:01:20.130> are<00:01:20.220> hoping<00:01:20.490> that

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
saying a lot of people are hoping that

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.160

Chris<00:01:21.810> Nolan<00:01:22.110> will<00:01:22.820> definitely<00:01:23.820> fix<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.659> in

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
Chris Nolan will definitely fix this in

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.249 
Chris Nolan will definitely fix this in
post<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:27.509> think<00:01:27.750> that's<00:01:27.900> probably<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.229> good

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
post and I think that's probably a good

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.760 
post and I think that's probably a good
call<00:01:28.409> because<00:01:28.920> we<00:01:29.369> want<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.670> know<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
call because we want to know what the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.319 
call because we want to know what the
villain<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.920> saying<00:01:32.250> mange<00:01:32.759> voice<00:01:33.030> did<00:01:33.299> sound

villain is saying mange voice did sound

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.710 
villain is saying mange voice did sound
cool<00:01:34.079> though<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.560> thought<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.420> despite<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.540> fact

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
cool though I thought I despite the fact

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.850 
cool though I thought I despite the fact
that<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.900> couldn't<00:01:37.259> understand<00:01:37.619> what<00:01:37.710> he<00:01:37.740> was

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
that I couldn't understand what he was

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.340 
that I couldn't understand what he was
saying<00:01:38.189> his<00:01:38.610> voice<00:01:38.909> did<00:01:39.180> sound<00:01:39.210> good<00:01:39.750> another
