00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.020
 hello I am alone sea we are in the river 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.870
 cross suite bcn and let's see today a 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.910
 movement of the world ball we are with 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.340
 Pablo Coach Crochet Barcelona 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.109
 we will also perform or we will see 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.520
 how it consists and what steps we should follow 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.589
 to make a good walk ball 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.679
 the movement consists of combining two 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.939
 moves more would be a front squat with 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.769
 that ball in front of our chest 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.230
 we would lower that hip below the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.970
 knees and then we would go up and 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.010
 we would perform a press to launch that 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.530
 ball to a target that is located in the 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.829
 case of the boys to 10 feet and in the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.100
 case of the girls at 98 feet according to the 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.649
 competition or training 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.239
 we will take the ball Pablo we carry the 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.730
 ball up we keep it in our 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.680
 breasts a little bit close to the elbows 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.680
 closed in front of our chest and the 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.780
 ball well supported down we can see 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.510
 us where are we going to throw that ball 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.149
 from this position we will lower the 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.710
 hip and we will extend that hip 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.390
 we will lower the hip below the 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.310
 Knees line always keeping 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.930
 that weight on our heels of such 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.149
 way that when we go up we are 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.430
 stable and we can print the maximum 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.380
 force to that ball at the time of uploading 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.850
 we will do in a controlled way but in 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.039
 one last tour we will take advantage 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.590
 our legs to throw this ball 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:24.319
 and help our arms to arrive 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:29.710
 at those ten feet or three meters and little 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:33.159
 there we have those three meters well 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.930
 perfect we rest well that would be the 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.270
 movement of the important world ball 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.100
 especially as he commented on the rise or 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.630
 in the rise phase take advantage of our 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.119
 legs the strength in our legs 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.659
 to be able to throw this ball up 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.790
 in any case we take the ball if my 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.890
 hip when I do the squat will not go down 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.570
 below the knees of the 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.759
 line that the knees generate 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.369
 to the ground it would not be a valid repetition 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.409
 in the case that we throw the ball and not 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.450
 we reached those three meters in the case 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.759
 of the boy would not be another repetition 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.220
 valid we repeat two more repetitions 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.960
 slow we would go downstairs keep that 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.789
 hip going backwards the weight there in 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.650
 the heels once we have come to 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.989
 the necessary depth maintaining that 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.120
 back straight look at the target and 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.340
 the ball in front of us will go up and 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.950
 we take advantage of that force to launch 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.800
 the ball up 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.569
 that's perfect, thank you and there we would have 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.760
 the dust very important as os 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.190
 he commented is going to keep both that 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.470
 correct position under lowering and descending 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.390
 that hip below how to get to the 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.879
 target and it's important to count each 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.980
 one of the repetitions both lower the 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:41.040
 hip how to get up on the target 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.720
 if it's not network and up to here the goalball 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.069
