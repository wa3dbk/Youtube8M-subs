00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello you love to welcome 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.540
 a new video what I'm just with 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.559
 his yard where i hear that again and again 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.660
 say so what was with his 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:21.180
 I can show them everything 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:22.650
 you now with his death can 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.330
 really make a lot and me 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.490
 mostly use are tofu and 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.140
 dairy products out of the way because 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.150
 I just can not stand it 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.340
 At first I put the baths his 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.530
 tofu as a kind of milkshake as one 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.719
 drink and just in the spring and in the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.510
 summer nothing, I like it more 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:42.510
 drinks with raspberry with blackberries and 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.210
 With mango banana so you can be practical 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.219
 his trophy in the blender hew rumors 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.870
 Pure who wants to can it all 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.860
 sweet and you can make one of them 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.149
 great gift is magic his turbo 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.270
 if you take it out of the packaging 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.289
 pretty glibberig and then he lets himself 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.260
 but in mixas totally nice yes in small 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.470
 house mix so to speak and has the whole thing 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.930
 a very great consistency and if 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.610
 you still in the drink vanille on the 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.920
 best real vanilla then that tastes 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.470
 really great so you can do it great 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.939
 for jims of all kinds also use for 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.360
 Cocktails if that's the way 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.640
 pina colada goes or something creamy 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.860
 or yes that is really very very 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.900
 delicious and who likes such dreams 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.700
 he also loves to drink 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.490
 such, so you can too 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.079
 freeze and enjoy it as ice 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.000
 really very delicious and very very 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.700
 refreshing and it's just cloth 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.479
 super versatile as a second I use 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.030
 like to make super santoro to pcs 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.640
 My favorite here is a milk free 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.500
 mousse au chocolat and it settles 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.450
 I really do a great job 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.869
 also a video made the link 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.119
 this is in the infobox linked then 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.189
 can you look at it again and 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.290
 It is really great but you can go out 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.969
 and cream caramel you can do on it 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.530
 make strawberry cream so comfortable 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.399
 There are no limits to creativity here 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.510
 set 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.030
 one can 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.130
 to put in different form and it 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.870
 tastes great and me 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.510
 must also say that when needed 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.610
 chocolate is not for the people here 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.620
 that would not be any way 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.100
 milk but no cream is so you have to 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.500
 chocolat 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.140
 there has never tasted out there 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.360
 summer is there toro in it or something 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.280
 other but it always arrived well 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.320
 I have the sometimes not so 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.430
 can quickly mention as fast as 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.380
 it was eaten 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.320
 and there were many people here 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.540
 Surprised that really only without 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.490
 milk is made and I love 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.800
 You have to chocolat with his death though 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.100
 as I said you can all kinds of the 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.640
 cs do with it and just in the bear 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.590
 time it is really great what I am 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.800
 also like to do with his turbo 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.600
 is it or vegetable cake or how it is 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.750
 on everyone wants to call because it needs 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.730
 you usually also in japanese man cream 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.520
 fraiche or something tastes great 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.459
 even with his turbo you can do everything 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.240
 again that's how herbs rheinseiten 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.220
 various other things 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.910
 and then you can really make a great one 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.010

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.340

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.709
 good hunger if I talk about it then too 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.500

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.900
 Toro and oatmeal are dead and 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.370
