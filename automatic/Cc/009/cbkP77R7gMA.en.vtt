before<00:01:42.310> that<00:01:42.430> spike<00:01:42.759> I<00:01:43.000> took<00:01:43.180> some<00:01:43.600> chromoly

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
before that spike I took some chromoly

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.310 
before that spike I took some chromoly
tubing<00:01:44.110> and<00:01:45.180> inserted<00:01:46.180> a<00:01:46.299> piece<00:01:46.689> of<00:01:46.930> quarter

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
wire feed welder in this case and forge

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.010 
wire feed welder in this case and forge
that<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.500> a<00:01:53.770> square<00:01:54.549> spike<00:01:55.000> and<00:01:55.299> blend<00:01:55.810> it<00:01:55.930> all

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
that to a square spike and blend it all

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.789 
that to a square spike and blend it all
that<00:01:56.229> together

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.760 

I<00:02:02.829> also<00:02:03.820> picked<00:02:04.240> up<00:02:04.390> these<00:02:04.719> little<00:02:05.140> welded

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
I also picked up these little welded

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.590 
I also picked up these little welded
rings<00:02:06.100> that<00:02:06.369> are<00:02:06.399> going<00:02:06.609> to<00:02:06.670> be<00:02:06.789> soldered<00:02:07.299> or

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
rings that are going to be soldered or

take<00:02:08.140> welded<00:02:08.500> on<00:02:08.739> to<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.099> end<00:02:09.250> of<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.459> socket

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
take welded on to the end of the socket

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.110 
take welded on to the end of the socket
and<00:02:11.709> cleaned<00:02:12.010> up<00:02:12.190> all<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.400> edges<00:02:12.849> and<00:02:12.879> the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
and cleaned up all the edges and the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.430 
and cleaned up all the edges and the
grinding<00:02:13.510> on<00:02:13.629> everything<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.290> most

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
grinding on everything the most

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.100 
grinding on everything the most
difficult<00:02:14.890> part<00:02:15.129> of<00:02:15.220> this<00:02:15.370> thing<00:02:15.610> is<00:02:15.849> you<00:02:16.480> have

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
difficult part of this thing is you have

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.949 
difficult part of this thing is you have
so<00:02:17.590> many<00:02:17.739> edges<00:02:18.519> pointing<00:02:18.940> out<00:02:19.239> and<00:02:19.599> trying<00:02:19.840> to

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
so many edges pointing out and trying to

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.440 
so many edges pointing out and trying to
polish<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:20.590> it's<00:02:20.920> just<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.430> very<00:02:21.790> difficult

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
polish that it's just a very difficult

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.430 
polish that it's just a very difficult
play<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:22.959> clean<00:02:23.620> up

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.980 

we<00:02:27.440> also<00:02:27.620> finished<00:02:28.130> up<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.730> butt<00:02:29.480> cap<00:02:29.750> with

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
we also finished up the butt cap with

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.110 
we also finished up the butt cap with
the<00:02:30.020> square<00:02:30.620> spike<00:02:30.950> in<00:02:31.190> that<00:02:31.580> Chris<00:02:31.910> had

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
the square spike in that Chris had

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.970 
the square spike in that Chris had
welded<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.600> rings<00:02:32.810> on<00:02:33.050> I<00:02:33.080> polished<00:02:33.680> up<00:02:33.770> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
welded the rings on I polished up the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.980 
welded the rings on I polished up the
rings<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.520> I<00:02:35.090> determined<00:02:35.630> it<00:02:35.720> looked<00:02:35.930> a

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
rings and I determined it looked a

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.020 
rings and I determined it looked a
little<00:02:36.200> plain<00:02:36.440> so<00:02:36.920> we<00:02:37.130> looked<00:02:37.340> up<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.550> Full
