00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
it's certainly true that much of what we

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.710 
it's certainly true that much of what we
call<00:00:15.540> innovation<00:00:15.780> today<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:17.720> essentially

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
call innovation today is essentially

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.050 
call innovation today is essentially
routine<00:00:19.650> or<00:00:19.859> evolutionary<00:00:20.400> innovation

I mean cloud computing has been around

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.740 
I mean cloud computing has been around
for<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> long<00:00:23.310> time<00:00:23.369> right<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.390> it's<00:00:24.510> getting

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
for a long time right and it's getting

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.660 
for a long time right and it's getting
better<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.050> better<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.529> better<00:00:25.590> after<00:00:26.279> all

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
better and better and better after all

cloud<00:00:26.939> computing<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:27.930> mainframe

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
cloud computing is just mainframe

computing<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.099> different<00:00:29.460> way<00:00:29.580> which<00:00:30.330> is

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
computing in a different way which is

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.240 
computing in a different way which is
how<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:30.900> learned<00:00:31.260> how<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.470> compute<00:00:31.800> when<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.040> was

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
how I learned how to compute when I was

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.819 
how I learned how to compute when I was
a<00:00:32.279> young<00:00:32.550> boy<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.989> fact<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.440> matter<00:00:34.469> is

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
a young boy so the fact of the matter is

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.260 
a young boy so the fact of the matter is
these<00:00:34.980> ideas<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.489> been<00:00:35.550> around<00:00:35.850> for<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> long

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
these ideas have been around for a long

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.389 
these ideas have been around for a long
time<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.710> change<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.219> world

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
time is that going to change the world

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.430 
time is that going to change the world
it<00:00:38.730> makes<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.149> certainly<00:00:39.450> better<00:00:39.629> but<00:00:40.320> it's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
it makes it certainly better but it's

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.380 
it makes it certainly better but it's
another<00:00:40.770> step<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.879> evolution<00:00:42.329> of

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
another step in the evolution of

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.630 
another step in the evolution of
computer<00:00:42.809> architecture<00:00:43.280> there's<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.340> new

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
computer architecture there's a new

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.990 
computer architecture there's a new
generation<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.719> user<00:00:46.289> interface<00:00:46.800> theory<00:00:47.610> that

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
generation of user interface theory that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.400 
generation of user interface theory that
says<00:00:48.210> there<00:00:48.450> should<00:00:48.719> not<00:00:48.870> be<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.170> user

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
says there should not be a user

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.400 
says there should not be a user
interface<00:00:50.300> that<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.629> information<00:00:52.199> should

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
interface that it the information should

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.040 
interface that it the information should
just<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.770> around<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.629> we<00:00:54.629> have<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> product

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
just be around you we have a product

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.630 
just be around you we have a product
called<00:00:55.230> Google<00:00:55.289> now<00:00:55.530> which<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.160> available<00:00:56.340> on

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
called Google now which is available on

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.540 
called Google now which is available on
Android<00:00:57.030> which<00:00:57.480> actually<00:00:57.899> attempts<00:00:58.649> by

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
Android which actually attempts by

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.189 
Android which actually attempts by
watching<00:00:59.879> what<00:01:00.270> you're<00:01:00.390> doing<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.840> with<00:01:00.989> your

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
watching what you're doing and with your

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.599 
watching what you're doing and with your
permission<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.859> forth<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.250> make<00:01:02.399> some

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
permission and so forth to make some

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.000 
permission and so forth to make some
suggestions<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.229> now<00:01:04.409> figured<00:01:04.830> out

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
suggestions so it's now figured out

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.920 
suggestions so it's now figured out
roughly<00:01:05.580> where<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.850> live<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.390> roughly<00:01:06.750> where<00:01:06.900> I

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
roughly where I live and roughly where I

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.469 
roughly where I live and roughly where I
work<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.590> tells<00:01:07.830> me<00:01:08.040> how<00:01:08.729> long<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.299> takes

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
work and it tells me how long it takes

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.060 
work and it tells me how long it takes
me<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.720> get<00:01:09.930> back<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.590> forward<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.890> work

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
me to get back and forward to the work

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.280 
me to get back and forward to the work
sort<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.340> useful<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.939> didn't<00:01:12.479> ask<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.170> do

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
sort of useful I didn't ask it to do

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.260 
sort of useful I didn't ask it to do
that<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:14.040> figured<00:01:14.490> out<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.850> was<00:01:15.030> going

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
that it figured out that I was going

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.149 
that it figured out that I was going
back<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.479> forth<00:01:15.720> every<00:01:16.110> day<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.710> said<00:01:16.950> oh

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
back and forth every day and it said oh

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.070 
back and forth every day and it said oh
there's<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.670> traffic<00:01:18.060> jam<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.630> forth<00:01:18.869> now

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
there's a traffic jam and so forth now

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.840 
there's a traffic jam and so forth now
what<00:01:19.770> are<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.950> limits<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.520> technology

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
what are the limits of that technology

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.580 
what are the limits of that technology
that's<00:01:21.390> an<00:01:21.509> artificial<00:01:21.900> intelligence

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
that's an artificial intelligence

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.330 
that's an artificial intelligence
question<00:01:23.430> but<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:24.479> highly<00:01:24.750> useful<00:01:25.220> for<00:01:26.220> it

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
question but it's highly useful for it

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.130 
question but it's highly useful for it
to<00:01:26.490> have<00:01:26.670> made<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.060> suggestion<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.780> would<00:01:28.020> be

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
to have made a suggestion that would be

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.590 
to have made a suggestion that would be
that<00:01:28.500> would<00:01:28.590> be<00:01:28.650> good<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:30.270> think<00:01:30.360> we're

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
that would be good so I think we're

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.300 
that would be good so I think we're
going<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.840> go<00:01:31.049> from<00:01:31.409> these<00:01:31.590> sort<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:31.890> command

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
going to go from these sort of command

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.120 
going to go from these sort of command
and<00:01:32.460> control<00:01:32.579> interfaces<00:01:33.290> where<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:35.009> know

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
and control interfaces where you know

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.740 
and control interfaces where you know
you<00:01:35.189> tell<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.880> computer<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.479> know<00:01:36.570> like<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
you tell the computer you know like a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.620 
you tell the computer you know like a
dog<00:01:37.020> barked<00:01:37.470> now<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.610> instead<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.210> computer

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
dog barked now and instead the computer

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.530 
dog barked now and instead the computer
becomes<00:01:39.960> much<00:01:40.259> more<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.829> friend<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:42.390> a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
becomes much more of a friend and a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.940 
becomes much more of a friend and a
friend<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.049> sense<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.590> computer

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
friend in the sense that the computer

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.590 
friend in the sense that the computer
says<00:01:44.250> well<00:01:44.549> we<00:01:44.640> kind<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.909> know<00:01:45.060> what<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.329> care

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
says well we kind of know what you care

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.660 
says well we kind of know what you care
about<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.170> again<00:01:46.500> you've<00:01:46.829> all<00:01:47.009> given<00:01:47.460> it

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
about and again you've all given it

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.330 
about and again you've all given it
permission<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.920> says<00:01:50.100> well

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
permission to do this and it says well

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.679 
permission to do this and it says well
maybe<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.670> should<00:01:50.820> do<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.090> or<00:01:51.360> maybe<00:01:51.390> should

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
maybe you should do this or maybe should
