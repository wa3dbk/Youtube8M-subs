 wes a second version to achieve a 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.150
 haircut it's a kind of cuff that 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.740
 we hang on the back of the ear 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.550
 for his creation you will need thread 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:27.840
 brass 0.81 mm brass wire 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:36.660
 finer 0.51 mm two chains a 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:39.320
 cutting pliers a flat dancing a pliers 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.320
 round toe 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.940
 of the father of your choice here I took some 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.739
 crystal agde forms take the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.350
 thicker brass wire and cut to 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.120
 12 cents montrable with a boss 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.570
 you will loop on one 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.570
 ends 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.309
 create an oval shape one rounds on the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.309
 concrete wire 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.229
 put the creation around your 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:24.660
 ear is cut just below the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:27.380
 lot once we pay 7 a loop 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.380
 with the pliers 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.780
 put the creation around your 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.399
 ear and ensure that the possible 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.469
 Be behind your long 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:42.630
 if it seems too long for you 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:44.909
 cut to continue you're going to have 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.689
 need eight 10 cm chains and one 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.689
 of 7 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.659
 take the thread being the finest and 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.220
 cut 30 cm with this one to you 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:04.080
 surround the thicker brass wire 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:07.250
 five times to avoid the spaces take 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.959
 a splat is leaning on each side 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.849
 with the thumb you will think one side 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:18.599
 of the wire and you're going to pull the other side 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:20.099
 to the euro insert a string of 10 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.170
 centimeters that you have maintain on 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.360
 the side and you continued to surround 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.390
 the son by putting the widest 5 to 6 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.390
 time 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.620
 repeat the operation as many times as 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.879
 you wish it according to the number of 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.879
 chains that you have pre-cut 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.849
 here is the result once the chains 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:03:01.290
 inserted now or she on more than 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:03:03.359
 girls now we're going to create little 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.370
 rings to lose them lease so on 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.799
 not rotate from left to right the 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.810
 sling clamp so as to train small to 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.189
 small a spring I'm doing this because a 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.889
 standard nano do not fit into these 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:16.260
 pearls which I use the son of 0.51 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:18.590
 says m in order to be able to insert more 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.590
 easy 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.750
 I take the cutting pliers and I'm going 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.019
 start the small spring to form 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.019
 gaza 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.510
 I ask our sincere a pearl and 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.510
 falling hichem 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:48.049
 I repeat the operation for all 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:50.120
 chains play account now the 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.340
 upper loop and I'm going to insert the 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:04:01.909
 small 7 cm chain accompanied by a 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:03.200
 pair and here is the final result as 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.879
 you see it that fits very 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.090
 easily going through the back of 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.090
