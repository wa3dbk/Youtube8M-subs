00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:28.439
 Look what has come to account for 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.970
 sleep on the roof because in the room 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:39.210
 the air conditioner broke and costs 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:43.019
 hot weather is now June 1st the hottest 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.739
 time before the rainy season rains 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.350
 will begin 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.460
 probably next week the sky is all 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:55.699
 overcast it is probably unusual 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.699
 see those who have been to r in high season 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:04.679
 There are no clouds, but now 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.050
 such a picture from yesterday night 

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:09.750
 it was cool to look at the sky 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:14.070
 the full moon and the clouds were highlighted with 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.940
 back side and all night there were flashes 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.850
 lightning lightning 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.160
 very nice the clouds ran very fast 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.489
 we often go fishing with friends here 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.209
 lately because others 

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:35.880
 almost no entertainment came to 

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:39.770
 some new place for fishing i'm still 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.770
 I was not here how to look 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.330
 took kefis bargain big fish with from 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.150
 their u apples 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.150
 and narva sounds . 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.390
 Yes 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.660
 but 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.200
 weights shooting 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.810
 in short, what happened was a crab and 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.590
 except crabs nothing else came across 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:33.510
 some crabs but one was big 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.510
 let's throws normally 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.470

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.480
 close 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.200
 huge herbs 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:47.310
 you are where you are because that's not respect, and throat 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.310

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.349
 show you the fish they are crabs 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.920
 and recently there was a case when fishing vessels 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.370
 driven 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:10.230
 a huge flock of fish right on the beach she 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.970
 cast ashore and all local 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.970
