00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
now I've pinned a few times in the past

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.520 
now I've pinned a few times in the past
when<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:40.950> was<00:00:41.070> still<00:00:41.460> young<00:00:41.820> with<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.390> ATCC<00:00:43.020> for

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
when I was still young with the ATCC for

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.110 
when I was still young with the ATCC for
me<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:43.829> more<00:00:44.100> or<00:00:44.160> less<00:00:44.219> like<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.520> home<00:00:44.640> tepee

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
me it's more or less like a home tepee

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.060 
me it's more or less like a home tepee
also<00:00:45.390> because<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:46.050> really<00:00:46.530> close<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.770> my

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
also because it's really close to my

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.850 
also because it's really close to my
home<00:00:47.340> where<00:00:48.120> I'm<00:00:48.210> born<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.539> Germany<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.649> lot

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
is a new track for a lot of the riders

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.810 
is a new track for a lot of the riders
but<00:01:00.840> not<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.289> Bobby<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:01.859> were<00:01:02.010> there<00:01:02.399> for<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
but not for Bobby we were there for the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.450 
but not for Bobby we were there for the
Italian<00:01:03.120> championship<00:01:03.329> we<00:01:04.229> were<00:01:04.350> riding<00:01:04.739> only

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
Italian championship we were riding only

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.550 
Italian championship we were riding only
with<00:01:05.610> Bobby<00:01:05.909> because<00:01:06.210> max<00:01:06.540> was<00:01:06.630> injured<00:01:07.170> it's

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
with Bobby because max was injured it's

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.250 
with Bobby because max was injured it's
a<00:01:07.619> good<00:01:07.770> track<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.970> good<00:01:09.210> shape<00:01:09.570> good<00:01:09.900> design

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
a good track like good shape good design

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.429 
a good track like good shape good design
but<00:01:10.590> really<00:01:11.520> hard<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.090> really<00:01:12.630> slippery<00:01:13.080> is

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
but really hard and really slippery is

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.280 
but really hard and really slippery is
not<00:01:13.890> easy<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:14.880> put<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.750> power<00:01:15.960> on<00:01:16.080> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
not easy to just put the power on the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.679 
not easy to just put the power on the
ground<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:17.250> really<00:01:17.880> really<00:01:18.000> important<00:01:18.570> to

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
ground so really really important to

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.560 
ground so really really important to
have<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.020> good<00:01:19.170> choice<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.680> tyres<00:01:19.950> there<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.640> to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
have a good choice of tyres there and to

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.780 
have a good choice of tyres there and to
have<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> good<00:01:22.070> feeling<00:01:23.070> with<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> throttle

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
have the good feeling with the throttle

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.310 
have the good feeling with the throttle
for<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.030> riders<00:01:24.390> because<00:01:24.689> it's<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.990> really

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
for the riders because it's a really

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.080 
for the riders because it's a really
slippery<00:01:25.650> track<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.250> probably<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> bit

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
slippery track it's probably a bit

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.359 
slippery track it's probably a bit
difficult<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.570> pass<00:01:27.869> so<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.650> good<00:01:28.829> start<00:01:29.159> will

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
difficult to pass so the good start will

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.730 
difficult to pass so the good start will
be<00:01:29.400> really<00:01:29.700> important<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.409> it's<00:01:31.409> always

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
be really important that it's always

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.109 
be really important that it's always
nice<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:31.979> race<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.460> Italy<00:01:32.579> good<00:01:32.880> weather

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
nice to race in Italy good weather

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.539 
nice to race in Italy good weather
especially<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:34.079> area<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:34.740> very<00:01:34.890> very

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
especially that area it's very very

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.289 
especially that area it's very very
really<00:01:35.909> big<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.570> mountain<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:38.159> hope<00:01:38.790> we
