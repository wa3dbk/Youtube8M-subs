00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
okay this was my tested Hans V's CD 43

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.440 
okay this was my tested Hans V's CD 43
version<00:00:09.420> of<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.840> 80s<00:00:10.440> interface<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.610> I've

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
version of the 80s interface and I've

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.690 
version of the 80s interface and I've
got<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.750> LEDs<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.290> all<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.500> good<00:00:13.650> stuff

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
got the LEDs and all that good stuff

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.820 
got the LEDs and all that good stuff
wired<00:00:14.700> up<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.960> wanted<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.470> kind<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.680> do<00:00:16.800> a

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
wired up and I wanted to kind of do a

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.040 
wired up and I wanted to kind of do a
run-through<00:00:17.690> to<00:00:18.690> show<00:00:18.900> how<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.199> LEDs<00:00:19.740> worked

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
run-through to show how the LEDs worked

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.820 
run-through to show how the LEDs worked
and<00:00:22.050> indicated<00:00:22.800> as<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:23.460> used<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:25.019> if<00:00:25.740> you

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
and indicated as I used it so if you

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.570 
and indicated as I used it so if you
watch<00:00:26.480> there<00:00:27.480> before<00:00:27.840> LEDs<00:00:28.320> here<00:00:28.740> I've<00:00:29.279> got<00:00:29.490> an

are<00:00:56.010> kind<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.340> good<00:00:56.460> indicators<00:00:57.000> that

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
are kind of good indicators that

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.299 
are kind of good indicators that
everything<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.570> connected<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.140> going<00:00:58.469> as

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
plugged into the twenty port now I'm

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.700 
plugged into the twenty port now I'm
gonna<00:01:18.210> walk<00:01:18.420> around<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.170> turn<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.619> ignition

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.330 
noticed that the orange light came on
much<00:01:39.909> brighter<00:01:40.630> so<00:01:41.590> even<00:01:41.950> though<00:01:42.039> we<00:01:42.159> don't

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
much brighter so even though we don't

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.969 
much brighter so even though we don't
have<00:01:42.399> a<00:01:42.520> separate<00:01:43.060> ignition<00:01:44.020> LED<00:01:44.409> it's<00:01:44.799> kind

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
have a separate ignition LED it's kind

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.590 
have a separate ignition LED it's kind
of<00:01:45.009> a<00:01:45.100> good<00:01:45.220> indicator<00:01:45.700> that<00:01:45.789> the<00:01:46.090> ignition<00:01:46.450> is

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
of a good indicator that the ignition is

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:57.300 
of a good indicator that the ignition is
on<00:01:47.250> now<00:01:48.250> I'm<00:01:48.399> going<00:01:48.580> to<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:49.000> quick<00:01:49.240> test<00:01:56.310> quick

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
on now I'm going to the quick test quick

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:05.690 
on now I'm going to the quick test quick
test<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.840> this<00:01:59.049> is<00:01:59.110> on<00:01:59.409> a<00:01:59.439> 1994<00:02:00.479> he<00:02:01.479> 36<00:02:02.220> 325i

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.120 

you<00:02:06.700> can<00:02:06.850> watch<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.360> LEDs<00:02:08.319> as<00:02:08.560> it<00:02:08.709> wants<00:02:08.979> to

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
you can watch the LEDs as it wants to

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:16.710 
you can watch the LEDs as it wants to
its<00:02:09.280> sequence<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:16.030> every<00:02:16.269> time<00:02:16.450> something

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
its sequence and every time something

its sequence and every time something
shows<00:02:17.049> up<00:02:17.260> at<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.440> bottom<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.830> means<00:02:18.069> it

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
shows up at the bottom that means it

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:49.900 
shows up at the bottom that means it
definitely<00:02:19.569> got<00:02:19.690> recognized<00:02:20.170> like<00:02:20.560> there

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.820 

and<00:02:50.300> as<00:02:50.540> this<00:02:50.780> kind<00:02:50.990> of<00:02:51.080> runs<00:02:51.260> through<00:02:51.530> like<00:02:51.740> I

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
and as this kind of runs through like I

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:52.780 
and as this kind of runs through like I
said<00:02:51.980> if<00:02:52.070> you're<00:02:52.160> watching<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.580> lights

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
said if you're watching the lights

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.090 
said if you're watching the lights
you'll<00:02:53.000> see<00:02:53.150> that<00:02:53.270> red<00:02:53.480> DTR<00:02:54.020> line<00:02:54.260> switch<00:02:54.680> on

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
you'll see that red DTR line switch on

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.480 
you'll see that red DTR line switch on
and<00:02:55.310> off<00:02:55.400> from<00:02:55.550> high<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:55.820> low<00:02:56.590> green<00:02:57.590> K<00:02:58.250> line

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
and off from high to low green K line

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.020 
and off from high to low green K line
the<00:02:59.270> yellow<00:02:59.480> L<00:03:00.170> line<00:03:00.560> as<00:03:01.250> they<00:03:01.490> communicate

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
the yellow L line as they communicate

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.130 
the yellow L line as they communicate
back<00:03:02.210> and<00:03:02.270> forth

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.740 

and<00:03:09.130> that's<00:03:09.370> what<00:03:09.520> it<00:03:09.610> pulls<00:03:09.820> up<00:03:10.030> now<00:03:10.180> Impa

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
and that's what it pulls up now Impa

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.210 
and that's what it pulls up now Impa
with<00:03:11.050> this<00:03:11.200> particular<00:03:11.410> version<00:03:11.890> which<00:03:12.040> is

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
with this particular version which is

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.020 
with this particular version which is
just<00:03:12.460> the<00:03:12.580> straight-up<00:03:13.420> 3.0<00:03:14.790> 3.0<00:03:15.790> one

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
just the straight-up 3.0 3.0 one

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.810 
just the straight-up 3.0 3.0 one
actually<00:03:16.500> even<00:03:17.500> though<00:03:17.680> not<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.220> whole<00:03:18.550> lot
