00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.826
Woman: Hello

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.851
This is my daughter

00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:27.169
She's a big, brave girl. And she's gonna have an operation today.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Carol: Name?

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.000

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.720

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.951

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.600

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.100
Carol: Age?

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.000
Danielle: Almost 6

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.200
Carol: So, 5

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.920
Danielle: Yes

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.580
Carol: Well, say 5

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.100
Carol: Address?

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.161
Where do you live?

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.700

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.900

00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:04.491
Carol: Finally

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.415
I'm inputting the details

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.843
Woman: They take out Danielle's tonsils

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.354
Carol: It's written, two new hip joints

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.500
Woman: Oh, no. It's probably a mistake

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.800
Carol: Computer says: "No"

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.100
Woman: Well. That must be some other Danielle Llyod

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.400
Carol: Computer says: "No"

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.200
There is just one Danielle Llody in our system

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.800
Do you want the double hip joints or no?

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.300
Woman: No. Clearly she doesn't need it

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.200
Carol: Maybe in the future

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.669
Woman: Listen! We were at Dr. Phillips and she has definitely an appointment to take out the tonsils

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.300
Carol: Computer says: "No"

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.100
Woman: Could you ask somebody?

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.907
Carol: I could, but ...

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.200
Woman: Oh, many thanks. You was a great help

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.100
Carol: Oh, do you have some times to fill out our questionnaire?

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.500
Would you say. I was A: "totally helpful" or B "extremely helpful"

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.500
or C "fucking helpful"
