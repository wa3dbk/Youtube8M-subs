i<00:00:57.660> prefer<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.739> do<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.890> um<00:00:59.190> like<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.300> because<00:01:00.629> I

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
i prefer to do it um like this because I

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.860 
i prefer to do it um like this because I
find<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.530> when<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:02.100> mix<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.270> foundation

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
find that when I mix the foundation

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.310 
find that when I mix the foundation
together<00:01:04.080> because<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.129> such<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> full<00:01:05.820> cover

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
together because it's such a full cover

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.590 
together because it's such a full cover
foundation<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.560> always<00:01:08.250> either<00:01:08.850> make<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
foundation I always either make it to

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.929 
foundation I always either make it to
light<00:01:09.869> into<00:01:10.470> or<00:01:10.680> too<00:01:10.979> dark<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.549> ended<00:01:11.820> up

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
light into or too dark and I ended up

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.780 
light into or too dark and I ended up
wasting<00:01:12.299> most<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> product<00:01:13.680> trying<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
wasting most of the product trying to

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.320 
wasting most of the product trying to
get<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:14.970> right<00:01:15.420> color<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.610> you<00:01:17.610> know<00:01:17.759> doing
