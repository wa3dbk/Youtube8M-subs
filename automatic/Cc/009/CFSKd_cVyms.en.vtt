 Zagazig site aliekspress he did not come 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.030
 yesterday and did not even expect it because 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.400
 the code does not seem to have come but I 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.010
 surprised and the only thing that did not come 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.750
 I did not know yesterday but yesterday 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.570
 where to put it is such a massager 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.269

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.610
 instig rigid or for prevention 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.130
 varicose veins or just for massage 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.430
 use in combination with various 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.780
 antivaricose medications 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.500
 anti-cellulite in general here are available 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.100
 such wheels 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.879
 balls that ride the beam 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.420
 performs massage is also available here 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:57.629
 such a thing is white like a lock 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.809
 depending on the width of the legs and does change 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.270
 do and yeshiva already have of course I would 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.139
 I wanted it to be so done 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.420
 tighter 

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:09.469
 so I had shea butter is not easy 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.200
 some kind of stroking but what to say 

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:15.209
 Basically, the good stuff is all packed. 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.149
 it was very good it is such a 

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:21.200
 a huge film with such pimples 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:25.139
 know the type of antidepressant therefore 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.429
 Basically, I advise all references leave 

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:28.889
 under the video 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:32.069
 so here everything will be them in the box 

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:38.039
 The next thing I ordered is to start with 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:40.159
 a big set of such awning wedge here 8 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:44.579
 items 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:47.340
 yes here two three three 4 5 6 but these three 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:51.929
 things here have a description in English 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.459
 language that put here if then at least 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.029
 I studied English at school 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.429
 cope 

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:59.999
 can tell briefly so ordinary 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:02.920
 brush by the way there is a set of only 88 

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:04.930
 rubles under so I did not even count 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.340
 he will be any decent 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.920
 but everything has come 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.970
 see which one you have n't used yet 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.730
 parties in principle calculation joke usually i 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.550
 I don't think what a joke this bouquet is to you 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.530
 brush it for the tongue that i was surprised 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.160
 Well, in principle, I think so round 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:28.690
 brush you can brush your teeth from the mirror 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:32.860
 I know this will come down to 88 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:36.310
 rubles this thing to remove particles 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.600
 the food between my teeth seems to me like that 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.610
 need to use a thing very 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.209
 neatly because you can damage 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.069
 enamel 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:47.400
 this is dental floss function that 3 pieces and this 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.290
 called written it is an eraser 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.080
 designed to polish mine for 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.459
 removal of plaque or else it says that 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.120
 use only for the device will 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:00.700
 once this set of 88 is understandable 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.230
 rubles you can and try, in principle, I 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:08.459
 ordered so to speak because of curiosity 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:13.870
 so I would not order the next product 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:17.560
 show such rezinochki such bright 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.100
 rezinochki they are different colors and bag 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.829
 total pieces in 30 minutes 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.549
 everybody understand why not take from 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:30.750
 I was another one you will teach 1 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:34.930
 I used it like this to stretch 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.570
 there are so many colors of different dependencies 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.430
 from what they lie to me put 3 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.890
 pink 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.600
 three blue then brown that's it for me 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.690
 loved it because it will 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.720
 invisible on the hair blue and here 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.510
 this seems to me too childish 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.959
 generally describe gum this is how it 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:01.030
 it stretches so non-silicone 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:04.060
 Well, in general, this will understand I ordered it 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.090
 because it seems to me these days and 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.260
 Safer for hair in the sense that their 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.870
 do not have to tighten tight 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.950
 there is no danger that they are flying, that is 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.890
 ordinary gum 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.540
 if she is not too tight she 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.840
 be sure to go hair 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.940
 but this gum and not enough so 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.020
 make two turns and here at the expense of here 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.229
 these bends 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.990
 protect and form it will hold and 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:33.199
 Of course, the bands do not glow, therefore 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.120
 This of course and the fact that to say that she on 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:38.240
 her hair does not remain after what 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.680
 of removed no remain for one 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.139
 a hair and that's why I advise you to buy 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.889
 such rezinochki also bought 1 when 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:50.600
 gone for a year jokes 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:56.630
 the next product came such sachets 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:58.699
 it is on the field in general it is intended for 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.490
 order to remove excess varnish 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:04.550
 when you do a manicure here 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.889
 two caps one already ready degree then 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.139
 there is cooking using other not 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:11.270
 I will open it here spare rods 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.960
 to the salon 30 rubles why not 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.789
 to try 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.070
 Basically, I have long wanted such a thing 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:20.770
 because nato does not use cotton 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.770
 wands face all other appliances u 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:26.620
 I just enjoyed it 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:36.130
 completely. the black . such a mask is she 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.320
 liquid kilotons probably many 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.250
 famous act pieces one i 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.550
 tried yesterday 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.110
 honestly there is 6 grams and I will 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.150
 use the next half time 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.970
 because yesterday I have literally everything 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:53.920
 years flew off my face because i'm very 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:56.590

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.270
 where to go 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.940
 next time I will use half 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:06.790
 what I noticed is written here 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.720

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:12.430

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:16.180
 this korean mask is very me 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.950
 liked there was no such effect 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.290
 to at least some kind of mask i 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.980
 pulled pores by those that i 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.380
 enjoyed 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:26.470
 it's just something she really 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.030
 pull pores but not right here those pores 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.270
 because it is clear maz ropes are not 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:34.210
 capable if you want to completely deduct 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.729

 not so often no need once a week 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:07:02.340
 I think that someone has enough oily skin 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:04.009
 skin is dry and sensitive 11 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.360
 common 

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:10.759
