00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
overlays actually kind of pin enough

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.380 
overlays actually kind of pin enough
that<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:16.259> can<00:01:16.530> probably<00:01:17.280> you<00:01:17.460> can't<00:01:17.700> see<00:01:18.090> them

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
that you can probably you can't see them
