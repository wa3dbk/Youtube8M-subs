00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:03.870
 and then what happened is that I do not understand lucia migob called him 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.069
 She tells me that she is sick and that with a soup she would feel better, I told her that 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.159
 time and I went to the vows 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:14.429
 the state is upset with me 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.519
 I probably wanted that soup to have staves 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.909
 and why not less said 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.539
 It has 10 40 h 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.429
 now the gentleman fini 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.409
 as it was with Katy 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:33.630
 well it seemed that everything was fine even invited me to his house 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.630
 1 those sinister 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.850
 he gave him a little out of pocket and asked me for my opinion 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.390
 I gave it to her 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.490
 good what 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.650
 He told her that it was incredible 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.960
 I said it was good for beginners or not 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.960
 He said he had been writing for 20 years 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.060
 at the end of the month 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.550
 is that it was not what I wanted to hear then why do they ask 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.989
 it did not surprise him 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.490
 the audio video 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.740
 They remembered that such 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.240
 Angel never understands me 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.610
 it seems that it touched on that I speak different languages 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.110
 one thing is jovial 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.270
 it's not us 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.940
 They are 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.350
 wait a minute maybe we should 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.110
 consider things 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.480
 then we tried and it does not work 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.300
 listen enough to the street 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.240
 I'm working on a theory 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.960
 the men 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.060
 They are idiots 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.060
 the people in favor of the alliance is even better 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.170
 they are very unfair 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.300
 until days 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.300
 so, what can we do now 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.490
 I do not know 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.409
 perhaps 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:11.179
 we should try to listen to them 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:14.379
 ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.829
 Senator HernÃ¡n Andrade 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.829
 maybe we should try to think again 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:20.829
 now
