00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.519
 hi all planet attacks gt 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.710
 I am lucky to bring you to ceram 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.019
 today we will discover the jaguar 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.880
 x-type and believe me it was a chance 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.260
 exceptional I have super beautiful 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.560
 pictures to show you it starts 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.560
 now 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.359
 you certainly know her 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.980
 jaguar is agde is in my eyes one of 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.630
 most beautiful cars of these last 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.349
 years I was finally able to approach him the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.349
 short time 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.080
 I was lucky to have three fans 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.520
 not my disposition as much to tell you that 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.070
 it was an absolute dream there were two 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.540
 v6 models in coupe and roadster is 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.480
 also the latest novelty at 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.370
 jaguar lifetime all-wheel drive with the 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.900
 four wheel drive it was just 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.070
 madness and for an hour and a half 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.070
 I was able to do pretty much what I 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.809
 wanted with the car on the ut axeram 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.270
 with the lehrplan speed ring is 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.580
 also test areas where we had 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.690
 low friction surfaces like that 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.760
 allowed to see a little capacity 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:08.280
 of the car it was just a chance 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:09.600
 to run away and do more for an hour 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.820
 and a half pretty much what I wanted 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.770
 with cars with at my disposal 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.280
 there our ceram speed 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.649
 is a track which is inclined with 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.750
 its highest point an angle of 43 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.920
 degrees 45 degrees I know more and that's 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.470
 really impressive of which you 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.720
 put about 180 km time 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.060
 you can let go of the hands you let go 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.229
 hands or keep your foot on 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.030
 the accelerator at a constant speed 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.880
 and the car keeps spinning and 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.140
 stays on its axis in the bend and you 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.420
 had nothing more to do 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.250
 it's very surprising because when the 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.080
 your monitor you say there you can 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.789
 let go of your hands you have a little trouble 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.450
 to believe it and in fact you do it and 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:47.450
 it does not work 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.640
 something else with the monitor we had 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:59.060
 the opportunity to ride at 260 km time on 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:00.950
 the ring is an impression that has 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.110
 just no sense you have the strength 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.780
 Centrifugal actually pushing see body 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.490
 towards the inside of the ring of which you 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.410
 have this feeling of being crushed in 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.100
 your sky and you can barely lifted 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.480
 hands and feel it's something 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.710
 something you did not know alas 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.810
 we really had the chance to 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.240
 to be able to live that was something 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.340
 completely phew I never lived that 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.780
 my life and it was really worth it 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.780
 to be lived at least once 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.790
 it's the author comes 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:53.120
 jaguar and fly offers you 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.680
 engines from 3 140 to 550 horses in 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.359
 manual or automatic gearbox 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.459
 available in two or four wheels 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:00.260
 motor and jaguar also neat 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.629
 inside with one finish at a time 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.510
 sporty and comfortable it's uncluttered 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:07.959
 class and effective at the height of his 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.959
 figures 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.610
 test 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.360
 not sure 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.920
 after that we had the chance to be able to 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.569
 spend some time testing the 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.700
 claw adhesion capabilities of the 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.290
 car with particular lehrplan which 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.630
 were wet and on which we had 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.470
 get the car working by trying 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.480
 of sponsorship to have the train hounded 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.760
 back it's kind of a dax game of 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.280
 acceleration dosage to see our 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.140
 abilities to keep motor skills and 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.060
 avoid having the car leave 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.739
 spin in which is enough 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.239
 impressive his request and quite a lot of 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.560
 capacity but very interesting to see 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.910
 that, in particular, thanks to 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.870
 electronic the car is capable of 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.030
 keep you safe 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.860
 and after we disconnected all these 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.370
 helpers and there we see that we are a little 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.370
 delivered to ourselves 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.040
 impeccable managed to keep me 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.019
 car on its trajectory 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:29.600
 I almost lost paseo on a head to 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:31.490
 tail and that's m but everything went well 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.820
 past and with my publisher we really 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.820
 spent a good 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.320
 we thank enormously jaguar france 2 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.880
 we have given this opportunity I 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.040
 will really try to do everything to 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.560
 to be able to shoot an essay worthy of the name 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.910
 with a version v8 or v6 that is little 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.480
 matter the model they are just 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.340
 magnificent 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.740
 so a very big big thank you to jaguar 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.480
 France I hope you have shared at 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.900
 better this experience tell you to 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.180
 soon 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.320
 thank you very much for following planet gt 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.250
 as usual 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.250
 Hi everybody
