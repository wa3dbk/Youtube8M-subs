00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.430
 to be me alone how can you save 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.330
 everyone 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.330
 I make you 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:25.340
 and I have to do something 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.340
 I promised that I would protect them 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.050
 when 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:39.540
 number remove 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.310
 it does not matter what happens, neither does it 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.310
 what's wrong with me 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.310
 Y 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.420
 and the hand however I do not care anything 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.060
 it is a concrete construct 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.500
 in that mountain I can not feel a small 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.500
 cost different from the spectra 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.150
 he is a boy 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.630
 try to knock down those rocks 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.289
 where your integrity 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.950
 although he managed to die and crushed 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.950
 boyacÃ¡ pretend 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.380
 in the girls and alone 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.930
 they are praying for me I know I can 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.000
 feel its strength and the universe there 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.930
 inside me says it let's go 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.950

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:51.079
 you can you 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.079
 you can save them all 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.720
 I could not be that child I can destroy the 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.480
 stone wall 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.300
 the energy that enveloped your body for a 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.290
 instant was his cosmos 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.290
 incredible how brave
