body stores toxins one study found that
an<00:01:12.570> average<00:01:13.570> person<00:01:14.170> has<00:01:14.320> in<00:01:14.650> their<00:01:14.740> fat<00:01:14.950> cells

taking in toxins faster than you can you

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.700 
taking in toxins faster than you can you
can<00:01:22.660> eliminate<00:01:22.780> your<00:01:23.080> body's<00:01:23.290> going<00:01:23.410> to<00:01:23.500> storm

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
can eliminate your body's going to storm

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.950 
can eliminate your body's going to storm
in<00:01:23.980> your<00:01:24.100> fat<00:01:24.280> now<00:01:24.760> here's<00:01:25.120> a<00:01:25.270> really<00:01:25.690> crucial

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
in your fat now here's a really crucial

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.820 
in your fat now here's a really crucial
point<00:01:26.410> and<00:01:26.650> that<00:01:26.680> is<00:01:27.610> that<00:01:28.470> your<00:01:29.470> body's<00:01:29.770> not

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
point and that is that your body's not

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.340 
point and that is that your body's not
going<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.159> want<00:01:30.280> to<00:01:30.400> burn<00:01:30.550> fat<00:01:31.080> if<00:01:32.080> you're

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
going to want to burn fat if you're

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.680 
going to want to burn fat if you're
taking<00:01:32.560> in<00:01:32.920> toxins<00:01:33.430> at<00:01:33.550> this<00:01:33.730> rate<00:01:34.060> because

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
taking in toxins at this rate because

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.690 
taking in toxins at this rate because
when<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:34.930> burn<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.320> fat<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.890> toxins<00:01:36.400> go<00:01:36.520> back

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
when you burn the fat the toxins go back

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.330 
when you burn the fat the toxins go back
into<00:01:36.909> your<00:01:37.060> system<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.630> you<00:01:38.290> actually<00:01:39.220> can

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
into your system and you actually can

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.490 
into your system and you actually can
get<00:01:39.460> poisoned<00:01:39.670> on<00:01:40.030> your<00:01:40.180> own<00:01:40.300> toxins<00:01:40.840> so<00:01:41.409> the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
get poisoned on your own toxins so the

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.810 
get poisoned on your own toxins so the
only<00:01:41.650> way<00:01:41.800> your<00:01:41.979> body<00:01:42.070> is<00:01:42.280> going<00:01:42.310> to<00:01:42.520> want<00:01:42.700> to

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
only way your body is going to want to

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.060 
only way your body is going to want to
burn<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.180> fat<00:01:43.390> is<00:01:43.750> if<00:01:44.320> you're<00:01:44.470> taking<00:01:44.800> in<00:01:44.890> less

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
burn the fat is if you're taking in less

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.810 
burn the fat is if you're taking in less
toxins<00:01:45.670> once<00:01:46.659> you<00:01:46.780> take<00:01:47.020> in<00:01:47.170> less<00:01:47.380> toxins<00:01:47.979> your

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
toxins once you take in less toxins your

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.370 
toxins once you take in less toxins your
body<00:01:49.000> can<00:01:49.210> start<00:01:49.420> eliminating<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.990> toxins

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
body can start eliminating the toxins

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.120 
body can start eliminating the toxins
that<00:01:50.470> it<00:01:50.590> already<00:01:50.710> has

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.410 

so<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:55.180> way<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:56.320> take<00:01:56.920> in<00:01:57.100> less<00:01:57.280> toxins<00:01:57.729> is<00:01:58.180> to

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
so the way to take in less toxins is to

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.090 
so the way to take in less toxins is to
always<00:01:58.600> choose<00:01:58.990> organic<00:01:59.289> whenever<00:02:00.159> possible

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
always choose organic whenever possible

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.440 
always choose organic whenever possible
always<00:02:03.100> get<00:02:03.280> clean<00:02:03.579> water<00:02:03.610> whenever<00:02:04.090> possible

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
always get clean water whenever possible

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.120 
always get clean water whenever possible
and<00:02:04.720> just<00:02:04.840> be<00:02:05.079> aware<00:02:05.170> of<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.590> fact<00:02:05.829> that

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
and just be aware of the fact that

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.440 
and just be aware of the fact that
there's<00:02:06.820> toxins<00:02:07.560> everywhere<00:02:08.560> you<00:02:08.979> put<00:02:09.269> get<00:02:10.269> a

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
there's toxins everywhere you put get a

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.050 
there's toxins everywhere you put get a
skin<00:02:10.989> cream<00:02:11.230> on<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:11.940> anything<00:02:12.940> you're

skin cream on and anything you're
putting<00:02:13.269> on<00:02:13.330> your<00:02:13.390> skin<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:13.840> going<00:02:13.870> into<00:02:14.200> your

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
putting on your skin is going into your

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.229 
putting on your skin is going into your
body<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:15.250> choose<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.519> skin<00:02:15.880> cream<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.709> that's

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
talk okay and being sick and going and

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.680 
talk okay and being sick and going and
trying<00:02:54.340> every<00:02:54.760> weight<00:02:54.940> loss<00:02:55.120> approach<00:02:55.450> out

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
trying every weight loss approach out

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.160 
trying every weight loss approach out
there<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.140> lose<00:02:56.260> weight<00:02:56.530> costs<00:02:57.220> money<00:02:57.459> too<00:02:57.670> and

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
there to lose weight costs money too and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.809 
there to lose weight costs money too and
this<00:02:59.170> is<00:02:59.350> the<00:02:59.440> solution<00:02:59.620> you've<00:03:00.489> got<00:03:00.700> it

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
this is the solution you've got it

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.430 
this is the solution you've got it
you've<00:03:00.850> got<00:03:01.060> to<00:03:01.359> factor<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.079> into<00:03:02.319> the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
you've got to factor that into the

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.020 
you've got to factor that into the
equation<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:03.430> if<00:03:03.519> you're<00:03:03.609> spending<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:03.910> couple

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
equation so if you're spending a couple

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.390 
equation so if you're spending a couple
of<00:03:04.269> dollars<00:03:04.510> let<00:03:04.870> more<00:03:05.230> on<00:03:05.380> on<00:03:05.620> food<00:03:05.920> you're

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
of dollars let more on on food you're

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.599 
of dollars let more on on food you're
actually<00:03:06.579> spending<00:03:06.910> a<00:03:07.799> fortune<00:03:08.799> less<00:03:09.340> on

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
actually spending a fortune less on

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.059 
actually spending a fortune less on
health<00:03:10.150> bills<00:03:10.420> you're<00:03:10.959> healthier<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.709> you're

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
health bills you're healthier and you're

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.509 
health bills you're healthier and you're
losing<00:03:12.190> weight<00:03:13.859> you've<00:03:14.859> got<00:03:15.069> to<00:03:15.220> factor<00:03:15.340> that

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
losing weight you've got to factor that

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.000 
losing weight you've got to factor that
into<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:15.850> equation<00:03:16.260> so<00:03:17.260> be<00:03:17.560> aware<00:03:17.799> of<00:03:17.859> the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
into the equation so be aware of the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.500 
into the equation so be aware of the
toxins<00:03:18.340> that<00:03:18.430> are<00:03:18.489> coming<00:03:18.790> into<00:03:18.910> system<00:03:19.329> and

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
toxins that are coming into system and

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.960 
toxins that are coming into system and
what<00:03:20.139> you<00:03:20.260> can<00:03:20.410> do<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:21.220> eliminate<00:03:21.609> those

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
what you can do to eliminate those

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.699 
what you can do to eliminate those
toxins<00:03:22.389> or<00:03:22.480> just<00:03:22.750> slow<00:03:22.959> down<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.350> rate<00:03:23.500> at

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
toxins or just slow down the rate at

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:44.510 
toxins or just slow down the rate at
which<00:03:23.769> they're<00:03:24.010> coming

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520
