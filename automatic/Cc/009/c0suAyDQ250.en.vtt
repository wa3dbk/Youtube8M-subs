 Hi girls, I'm going to cover my 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:14.670
 improvised dressing table with this contact 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:16.980
 here is island of coroinha 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.140
 so I want to say sorry already because 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.859
 so dark image is because it is 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.240
 At night I do not have good lighting. 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:30.179
 do and I wanted to do now 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.450

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.890

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.790
 contact paper 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.550
 I chose this one and it's a crown. 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.219
 I'll put it over here on my 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:51.180
 improvised dressing table and weed 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:54.690
 Just the right size I want 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.579
 It's going to be like this and I 'm going to give it a go. 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.940
 because then I'll cut straight is me 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.940
 back 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.890
 so I went to get some scissors 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:16.409
 I'm going to measure is that it's a very small table. 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:24.080
 computer, then I 'm going to measure the 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:27.780

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:36.689
 stay and I 'll do the finishing 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:39.020
 here it's going to be more or less I'm going to cut 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.020
 on here 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.060
 pivot of scola here behind 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:25.340
 I'll choose your half so just one 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:40.220
 bit and then I also run 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:43.640
 I came here and I'm going to paste chile 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.060
 with which to be careful in one year to train 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.390
 bubbles or anything 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:54.530
 I came with a piece of paper 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:58.970
 normal for me going through and taking 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:02.330
 doubts are right 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:09.100
 then I came down here the flight 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:16.640
 the chan on paper 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:19.570
 setting the year and passing it on 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.570
 stay no bubble 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.630
 It's good if I said goodbye to him. 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.730
 doing it alone because I'm very 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:41.040
 anxious and I want it to be ready 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:43.590
 quick draw only one hour so this is the 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.310
 fish is improvised on a small table 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:51.570
 as you can see from my computer because 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.480
 next year's project now send 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:59.310
 make me buy a pizza money 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:04.140
 While it does not happen, I'm going to 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:09.650
 Turning what I have I will not 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.650
 passing by shooting 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.530
 it's pretty easy 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:36.470
 the reader sir is how I want it 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:40.310
 was a very cool finish because 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:43.690
 involve these white whip and I 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.690
 I want to see that a finish 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:05:02.900
 It was a little ball here but we have 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:05:04.910
 yes how to pick up normal nail file 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.770
 I'm going to get this father because he's 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.650
 but here it's smoother 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:15.290
 here is more group who and I will do the 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:20.950
 finishing around the table by sanding 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.950
 that's how I'm going to do it 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:34.110
 careful that silenced when times are im 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:43.110
 put one pulling because because it has this 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:43.110
 but the folding here is easy to luxuriate 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.120
 O 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:14.960
 go doing it by releasing 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:40.589
 If it's good and perfect, I'll leave it with 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:44.279
 Calm down and I'll be back later. 

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:46.849
 showing off as the son of a paul 

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:55.620
 kicking paulo 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:58.289
 so girls stayed like this, it's all bad 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:03.930
 It's very beautiful, and the 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:06.919
 etoo moves even people not 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:10.529
 had to have the customer is because 

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:14.310
 have what I pass white enamel 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:19.770

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:22.110
 what was left over here, I'll see if 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.779
 Gimme to be here but I believe 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:27.870

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:31.800
