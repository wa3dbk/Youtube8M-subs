00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
to ace hardware and there's gonna cut

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.809 
to ace hardware and there's gonna cut
through<00:04:33.080> through<00:04:33.319> the<00:04:33.409> fence<00:04:33.680> and<00:04:33.889> like<00:04:34.550> I<00:04:34.669> see

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
know we started walking towards like an

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.570 
know we started walking towards like an
intersection<00:04:45.590> where<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:45.949> fence<00:04:46.249> actually

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
intersection where the fence actually

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.550 
intersection where the fence actually
leads<00:04:46.789> out<00:04:46.969> so<00:04:47.479> they<00:04:48.020> actually<00:04:48.289> go<00:04:48.529> through

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
leads out so they actually go through

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.439 
leads out so they actually go through
the<00:04:48.860> fence<00:04:49.129> shortcut<00:04:49.759> and<00:04:50.060> they<00:04:50.210> start

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
the fence shortcut and they start

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:51.519 
the fence shortcut and they start
following<00:04:50.719> us<00:04:50.930> home<00:04:51.050> like<00:04:51.259> you<00:04:51.319> know<00:04:51.409> what<00:04:51.499> a
