00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
I'm he's in his second form I can't

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.310 
I'm he's in his second form I can't
imagine<00:04:47.370> his<00:04:47.520> final<00:04:47.940> form<00:04:48.150> so<00:04:48.690> he<00:04:48.870> sleeps<00:04:49.170> on

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
imagine his final form so he sleeps on

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.120 
imagine his final form so he sleeps on
the<00:04:49.380> ground<00:04:49.740> usually<00:04:51.260> there's<00:04:52.260> no<00:04:52.440> animations

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
the ground usually there's no animations

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.800 
the ground usually there's no animations
right<00:04:53.340> but<00:04:54.000> now<00:04:54.150> they're<00:04:54.360> creating

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
right but now they're creating

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.830 
right but now they're creating
animations<00:04:55.490> for<00:04:56.490> different<00:04:56.970> I<00:04:57.150> guess<00:04:57.330> it's

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
animations for different I guess it's

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.800 
animations for different I guess it's
selected<00:04:58.560> dragons<00:04:59.010> as<00:04:59.250> you<00:05:00.210> can<00:05:00.330> see<00:05:00.450> he<00:05:00.660> was

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.840 
selected dragons as you can see he was
sleeping<00:05:01.260> on<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.440> ground<00:05:01.770> right<00:05:02.070> there<00:05:02.100> it

breath<00:05:05.400> so<00:05:05.970> that's<00:05:06.150> a<00:05:06.270> really<00:05:06.510> cool<00:05:06.720> breath

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
and unique one it as well alright

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.770 
and unique one it as well alright
there's<00:05:14.520> his<00:05:14.670> breath<00:05:14.910> again<00:05:15.210> and<00:05:15.480> then<00:05:15.570> he

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
there's his breath again and then he

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.140 
there's his breath again and then he
goes<00:05:15.960> to<00:05:15.990> sleep<00:05:16.730> can't<00:05:17.730> really<00:05:17.880> see<00:05:18.060> him

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150

goes to sleep can't really see him
sleeping<00:05:18.420> alright<00:05:19.080> so<00:05:19.200> there<00:05:19.410> there<00:05:19.770> he<00:05:19.920> is

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
sleeping alright so there there he is

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.970 
sleeping alright so there there he is
sleeping<00:05:20.870> really<00:05:21.870> strange<00:05:22.410> color<00:05:22.770> I<00:05:22.860> guess

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
sleeping really strange color I guess

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.980 
sleeping really strange color I guess
it's<00:05:23.400> because<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:23.790> hypnotic<00:05:24.120> dragon<00:05:24.660> is<00:05:24.810> in

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
it's because the hypnotic dragon is in

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.430 
it's because the hypnotic dragon is in
the<00:05:25.410> breed<00:05:25.710> has<00:05:26.010> like<00:05:26.820> a<00:05:26.850> rosy<00:05:27.450> red<00:05:27.780> yellow

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
okay we're going to evolve it to the

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.890 
okay we're going to evolve it to the
final<00:05:37.980> form<00:05:38.340> and<00:05:38.640> check<00:05:38.970> out<00:05:39.180> this<00:05:39.330> dragons

final form and check out this dragons

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.460 
final form and check out this dragons
final<00:05:40.680> evolution<00:05:41.180> let's<00:05:42.180> see<00:05:42.330> if<00:05:42.750> we<00:05:43.140> can<00:05:43.290> get

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
final evolution let's see if we can get

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.640 
final evolution let's see if we can get
them<00:05:43.590> to<00:05:43.800> level<00:05:44.430> 9<00:05:44.669> there<00:05:45.540> it<00:05:45.660> is<00:05:45.810> looks<00:05:46.470> like<00:05:46.620> a

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
them to level 9 there it is looks like a

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.290 
them to level 9 there it is looks like a
lion<00:05:46.980> kind<00:05:47.430> of<00:05:47.550> so<00:05:48.419> he<00:05:48.690> generates<00:05:49.460> 303<00:05:50.460> so<00:05:50.820> it's

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
lion kind of so he generates 303 so it's

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.060 
lion kind of so he generates 303 so it's
a<00:05:51.390> bit<00:05:51.570> less<00:05:51.840> than<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:52.169> dream<00:05:52.440> dragon<00:05:52.890> but

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
a bit less than the dream dragon but

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.440 
a bit less than the dream dragon but
once<00:05:53.340> it's<00:05:53.640> up<00:05:53.820> there<00:05:54.030> it<00:05:54.150> doesn't<00:05:54.360> really

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
once it's up there it doesn't really

00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:01.730 
once it's up there it doesn't really
matter<00:05:54.810> that<00:05:55.140> much<00:05:57.380> alright<00:06:00.380> alright<00:06:01.380> look<00:06:01.620> at

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
matter that much alright alright look at

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.640 
matter that much alright alright look at
this<00:06:01.950> dragon<00:06:02.370> this<00:06:02.460> dragon<00:06:02.940> is<00:06:03.260> gigantic<00:06:04.260> he's

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:04.650 
this dragon this dragon is gigantic he's

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.190 
this dragon this dragon is gigantic he's
much<00:06:04.890> bigger<00:06:05.370> than<00:06:05.580> the<00:06:05.730> dream<00:06:06.000> dragon<00:06:06.450> and<00:06:07.110> he

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
much bigger than the dream dragon and he

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.770 
much bigger than the dream dragon and he
jumps<00:06:07.620> up<00:06:07.770> and<00:06:08.010> does<00:06:08.250> that<00:06:08.520> burst<00:06:08.850> dragon

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
jumps up and does that burst dragon

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.470 
jumps up and does that burst dragon
breath<00:06:10.160> unlike<00:06:11.160> most<00:06:11.610> dragon<00:06:12.150> that<00:06:12.270> just

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
breath unlike most dragon that just

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.480 
breath unlike most dragon that just
walks<00:06:12.780> around<00:06:12.990> and<00:06:13.380> does<00:06:13.680> the<00:06:13.830> dragon<00:06:14.040> breath

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
walks around and does the dragon breath

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.700 
walks around and does the dragon breath
he<00:06:14.940> actually<00:06:15.270> jumps<00:06:15.660> up<00:06:15.810> into<00:06:16.169> the<00:06:16.230> air<00:06:16.440> and

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
he actually jumps up into the air and

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.670 
he actually jumps up into the air and
then<00:06:16.860> does<00:06:17.100> it<00:06:17.900> so<00:06:18.900> there<00:06:19.080> it<00:06:19.200> is<00:06:19.320> again

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
then does it so there it is again

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.830 
then does it so there it is again
I<00:06:19.890> don't<00:06:20.669> think<00:06:20.850> he's<00:06:21.180> going<00:06:21.360> to<00:06:21.419> do<00:06:21.540> it<00:06:21.660> on<00:06:21.750> the

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
I don't think he's going to do it on the

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.800 
I don't think he's going to do it on the
ground<00:06:22.310> but<00:06:23.310> he<00:06:23.400> falls<00:06:23.610> asleep<00:06:23.820> and<00:06:24.360> looks

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
ground but he falls asleep and looks

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.170 
ground but he falls asleep and looks
really<00:06:25.680> alive<00:06:26.220> compared<00:06:26.880> to<00:06:27.000> the<00:06:27.060> other

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
really alive compared to the other

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.700 
really alive compared to the other
dragon<00:06:27.600> if<00:06:27.750> you<00:06:27.900> looked<00:06:28.140> at<00:06:28.289> every<00:06:28.590> other

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710 
dragon if you looked at every other

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.260 
dragon if you looked at every other
dragon<00:06:29.160> before<00:06:29.280> it's<00:06:29.820> they're<00:06:30.090> usually

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
dragon before it's they're usually

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.719 
dragon before it's they're usually
walking<00:06:31.050> around<00:06:31.380> there's<00:06:31.590> not<00:06:31.740> much<00:06:31.919> of<00:06:31.950> an<00:06:32.280> me

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:32.729 
walking around there's not much of an me

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:34.850 
walking around there's not much of an me
but<00:06:33.240> this<00:06:33.389> dragon<00:06:33.659> certainly<00:06:34.349> has<00:06:34.589> an

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
but this dragon certainly has an

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.760 
but this dragon certainly has an
animation<00:06:35.669> and<00:06:36.089> of<00:06:36.990> course<00:06:37.259> the<00:06:37.589> newer

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 
animation and of course the newer

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.200 
animation and of course the newer
dragons<00:06:38.279> I<00:06:38.370> think<00:06:38.580> they're<00:06:38.729> adding<00:06:39.089> these

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
dragons I think they're adding these

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:42.049 
dragons I think they're adding these
things<00:06:39.270> where<00:06:39.779> I<00:06:39.809> guess<00:06:40.319> there's<00:06:41.189> animation

00:06:42.049 --> 00:06:42.059 
things where I guess there's animation

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:44.360 
things where I guess there's animation
because<00:06:42.330> I<00:06:42.569> think<00:06:43.229> that's<00:06:43.529> like<00:06:43.830> the<00:06:44.009> next

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
because I think that's like the next

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:46.219 
because I think that's like the next
evolution<00:06:45.120> to<00:06:45.330> the<00:06:45.419> game<00:06:45.629> they<00:06:45.839> want<00:06:46.020> to<00:06:46.110> add

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:46.229 
evolution to the game they want to add

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:48.619 
evolution to the game they want to add
more<00:06:46.259> animations<00:06:47.249> and<00:06:47.610> things<00:06:47.969> like<00:06:48.120> that
