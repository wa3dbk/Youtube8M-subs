00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
back down of course we can't do that so

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.029

they'll be lifted where the pavers are

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.010 
they'll be lifted where the pavers are
resting<00:00:51.010> against<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.579> foundations<00:00:52.329> and<00:00:52.629> then

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
resting against the foundations and then

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.410 
resting against the foundations and then
restored<00:00:53.500> after<00:00:54.160> treatment<00:00:54.550> in<00:00:54.910> areas<00:00:55.239> where
