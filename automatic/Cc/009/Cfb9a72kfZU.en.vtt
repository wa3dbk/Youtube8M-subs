purposes so let's go ahead and grab this

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.980 
purposes so let's go ahead and grab this
motherboard<00:02:02.229> and<00:02:02.590> take

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
motherboard and take

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:12.760 
motherboard and take
the<00:02:03.409> box<00:02:04.060> and<00:02:05.950> look<00:02:06.950> at<00:02:07.159> this<00:02:07.340> motherboard<00:02:11.770> now

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
the box and look at this motherboard now

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.140 
the box and look at this motherboard now
if<00:02:12.920> you've<00:02:13.069> seen<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.459> preview<00:02:13.910> of<00:02:14.060> the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
if you've seen the preview of the

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.430 
if you've seen the preview of the
motherboard<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:14.690> really<00:02:14.930> couldn't<00:02:15.170> mention

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
motherboard I really couldn't mention

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.000 
motherboard I really couldn't mention
anything<00:02:15.860> much<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:16.760> was<00:02:17.120> just<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.480> preview<00:02:18.010> so

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
anything much so was just a preview so

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.059 
anything much so was just a preview so
let's<00:02:19.250> go<00:02:19.400> ahead<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.700> actually<00:02:20.170> take<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.200> full

look at the motherboard we'll take a

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.120 
look at the motherboard we'll take a
look<00:02:24.319> around<00:02:24.470> of<00:02:24.800> course<00:02:25.010> it's<00:02:25.280> black<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:27.530> does

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
look around of course it's black it does

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.100 
look around of course it's black it does
have<00:02:28.340> some<00:02:28.580> nice<00:02:28.760> heat<00:02:29.120> sinks<00:02:29.540> on<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:31.540> PCH<00:02:32.540> of

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.880 
pin power connector is here this is your
fan<00:05:02.010> header<00:05:02.310> for<00:05:02.640> your<00:05:02.820> CPU<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:03.600> as<00:05:04.410> I<00:05:04.620> said

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
fan header for your CPU and as I said

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.770 
fan header for your CPU and as I said
everything<00:05:05.190> is<00:05:05.460> military<00:05:05.970> class<00:05:06.360> on<00:05:06.630> this

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
everything is military class on this

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.500 
everything is military class on this
board<00:05:07.050> it<00:05:07.830> says<00:05:08.190> has<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.700> military<00:05:08.910> class

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
board it says has the military class

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.469 
board it says has the military class
denomination<00:05:10.350> and<00:05:10.580> it<00:05:11.580> does<00:05:11.760> have<00:05:12.000> some<00:05:12.240> nice

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
denomination and it does have some nice

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.950 
denomination and it does have some nice
beefy<00:05:13.050> heat<00:05:13.290> sinks<00:05:13.680> on<00:05:13.860> it<00:05:14.150> so<00:05:15.150> you<00:05:15.690> should<00:05:15.930> be

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
beefy heat sinks on it so you should be

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.550 
beefy heat sinks on it so you should be
able<00:05:16.110> to<00:05:16.590> overclock<00:05:17.220> this<00:05:17.580> board<00:05:17.880> well<00:05:18.560> let's

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
able to overclock this board well let's

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.980 
able to overclock this board well let's
take<00:05:19.800> a<00:05:19.830> look<00:05:20.100> at<00:05:20.340> the<00:05:21.210> back<00:05:21.419> I<00:05:21.630> owe<00:05:21.690> plate<00:05:23.990> it

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
take a look at the back I owe plate it

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:32.170 
take a look at the back I owe plate it
also<00:05:25.169> comes<00:05:25.710> with<00:05:26.750> four<00:05:27.750> SATA<00:05:28.110> connectors

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:39.170 

SLI<00:05:33.180> bridge<00:05:34.940> and<00:05:36.620> something<00:05:37.620> that<00:05:37.910> if<00:05:38.910> you're

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
SLI bridge and something that if you're

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.450 
SLI bridge and something that if you're
not<00:05:39.300> familiar<00:05:39.510> with<00:05:39.960> these<00:05:40.110> basically<00:05:41.070> what

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
not familiar with these basically what

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.379 
not familiar with these basically what
these<00:05:41.639> connectors<00:05:42.270> are<00:05:42.540> you<00:05:43.530> take<00:05:43.830> your<00:05:44.389> you

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
these connectors are you take your you

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.670 
these connectors are you take your you
take<00:05:45.630> your<00:05:47.360> your<00:05:48.360> front<00:05:48.630> panel<00:05:49.080> case

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
take your your front panel case

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.620 
take your your front panel case
connectors<00:05:50.220> plug<00:05:50.639> them<00:05:50.790> into<00:05:50.940> here<00:05:51.330> and<00:05:51.360> then

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
connectors plug them into here and then

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.750 
connectors plug them into here and then
plug<00:05:51.960> them<00:05:52.169> into<00:05:52.440> your<00:05:52.950> header<00:05:53.580> on

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
plug them into your header on

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.070 
plug them into your header on
motherboard<00:05:54.270> so<00:05:55.050> you<00:05:55.740> can<00:05:56.570> you<00:05:57.570> don't<00:05:57.720> have<00:05:57.900> to

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
motherboard so you can you don't have to

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.050 
motherboard so you can you don't have to
fumble<00:05:58.410> with<00:05:58.800> this<00:05:59.130> inside<00:05:59.550> of<00:05:59.669> your<00:05:59.760> case

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
fumble with this inside of your case

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.760 
fumble with this inside of your case
wanting<00:06:00.720> to<00:06:00.810> know<00:06:00.990> where<00:06:01.169> it<00:06:01.290> is<00:06:01.410> I<00:06:01.440> mean<00:06:01.680> my

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
wanting to know where it is I mean my

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.010 
wanting to know where it is I mean my
fingers<00:06:02.190> are<00:06:02.310> pretty<00:06:02.550> big<00:06:02.730> and<00:06:02.900> you<00:06:03.900> know

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
fingers are pretty big and you know

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.170 
fingers are pretty big and you know
without<00:06:04.200> this<00:06:04.620> and<00:06:04.889> it's<00:06:05.310> a<00:06:05.490> lot<00:06:05.669> harder<00:06:05.910> in

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
without this and it's a lot harder in

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.360 
without this and it's a lot harder in
order<00:06:06.419> to<00:06:06.570> do<00:06:06.720> it<00:06:08.570> then<00:06:09.570> we<00:06:09.720> have<00:06:09.930> our<00:06:10.370> users
