other<00:01:50.240> people's<00:01:50.689> work<00:01:50.959> because<00:01:51.380> they<00:01:51.890> have

00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:52.099 
other people's work because they have

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:54.219 
other people's work because they have
ideas<00:01:52.280> which<00:01:52.700> I<00:01:52.849> can't<00:01:53.149> possibly<00:01:53.569> have<00:01:53.869> I<00:01:54.080> do

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
ideas which I can't possibly have I do

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.589 
ideas which I can't possibly have I do
also<00:01:54.709> like<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:55.159> do<00:01:55.280> my<00:01:55.459> own<00:01:55.490> but<00:01:56.179> I<00:01:56.209> find<00:01:56.479> it

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:56.599 
also like to do my own but I find it

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:59.589 
also like to do my own but I find it
really<00:01:57.049> quite<00:01:57.409> difficult<00:01:57.619> I<00:01:58.130> wanted<00:01:58.789> to<00:01:59.000> do<00:01:59.569> a

00:01:59.589 --> 00:01:59.599 
really quite difficult I wanted to do a

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:03.219 
really quite difficult I wanted to do a
book<00:01:59.869> which<00:02:00.799> was<00:02:01.099> a<00:02:01.340> rewrite<00:02:01.819> of<00:02:02.149> what<00:02:03.110> they

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
book which was a rewrite of what they

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.639 
book which was a rewrite of what they
call<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:04.000> nursery<00:02:05.000> stories<00:02:05.450> but<00:02:05.840> there<00:02:06.259> that

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
call the nursery stories but there that

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:07.990 
call the nursery stories but there that
would<00:02:06.830> mean<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.130> words<00:02:07.310> have<00:02:07.549> got<00:02:07.729> to<00:02:07.849> be

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
would mean the words have got to be

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.979 
would mean the words have got to be
stronger<00:02:08.840> I<00:02:09.700> decided<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:10.970> do<00:02:11.150> an<00:02:11.420> A<00:02:11.750> level

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
stronger I decided to do an A level

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.539 
stronger I decided to do an A level
English<00:02:12.500> course<00:02:12.530> because<00:02:13.099> I've<00:02:13.250> never<00:02:13.400> done
