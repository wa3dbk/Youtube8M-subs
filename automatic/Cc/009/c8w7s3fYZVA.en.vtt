but i'm not expecting it to pulp with

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.640 
but i'm not expecting it to pulp with
the<00:01:10.790> mechanism<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.909> has<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.810> b5<00:01:13.229> b6

the mechanism it has the b5 b6

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.429 
the mechanism it has the b5 b6
and<00:01:13.830> b7<00:01:15.140> ok<00:01:16.140> um<00:01:17.090> now<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.540> cube<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.170> exact

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
and b7 ok um now this cube is the exact

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.469 
and b7 ok um now this cube is the exact
same<00:01:19.650> size<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> landline<00:01:20.880> or<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.240> east

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
same size is the landline or the east

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.580 
same size is the landline or the east
sheen<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.080> some<00:01:22.350> things<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:24.590> it

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
very good quality few bumps everywhere

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.360 
very good quality few bumps everywhere
but<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.409> think<00:01:31.710> that's<00:01:31.890> fine<00:01:32.420> color<00:01:33.420> scheme<00:01:33.810> is

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.710 

good<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:40.340> well<00:01:41.340> let's<00:01:42.120> just<00:01:42.330> see<00:01:42.450> how<00:01:42.570> it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
good and well let's just see how it

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:54.770 
good and well let's just see how it
turns<00:01:51.050> whoa<00:01:52.520> this<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.880> amazing<00:01:54.210> maybe

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
turns whoa this is just amazing maybe

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.770 
turns whoa this is just amazing maybe
the<00:01:55.170> corner<00:01:55.560> cutting<00:01:55.800> but<00:01:56.580> it's<00:01:56.970> amazing<00:01:57.300> that

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
the corner cutting but it's amazing that

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.430 
the corner cutting but it's amazing that
turning<00:01:58.620> I<00:01:58.850> don't<00:01:59.850> know<00:01:59.940> how<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.290> describe<00:02:01.290> it

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
turning I don't know how you describe it

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
turning I don't know how you describe it
feels<00:02:01.770> like<00:02:02.010> a<00:02:03.800> you<00:02:04.800> know<00:02:04.830> you<00:02:04.980> can<00:02:05.250> hear<00:02:05.400> that

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
feels like a you know you can hear that

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.280 
feels like a you know you can hear that
right<00:02:07.580> so<00:02:08.580> I'd<00:02:08.820> say<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.149> feels<00:02:09.450> like<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.810> bit

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
right so I'd say it feels like a bit

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:17.450 
right so I'd say it feels like a bit
like<00:02:10.619> them<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:15.870> almost<00:02:16.020> feels<00:02:16.530> empty<00:02:17.250> inside

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
like them it almost feels empty inside

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.510 
like them it almost feels empty inside
it<00:02:18.060> feels<00:02:18.270> like<00:02:18.360> there's<00:02:18.660> nothing<00:02:18.900> inside<00:02:19.520> but

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
it feels like there's nothing inside but

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.550 
it feels like there's nothing inside but
you're<00:02:20.670> turning<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.180> pretty<00:02:21.750> smoothly<00:02:22.140> that

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
you're turning it pretty smoothly that

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.710 
you're turning it pretty smoothly that
any<00:02:22.770> but<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.610> feels<00:02:23.820> like<00:02:24.030> there's<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.480> few

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720

any but it feels like there's a few
bumps<00:02:24.990> here<00:02:25.740> but<00:02:26.640> still<00:02:27.330> feels<00:02:27.600> really<00:02:27.870> smooth

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
bumps here but still feels really smooth

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:38.660 
bumps here but still feels really smooth
and<00:02:30.920> yeah<00:02:33.320> now<00:02:36.230> only<00:02:37.230> two<00:02:37.350> by<00:02:37.620> two<00:02:37.680> S's<00:02:37.980> on<00:02:38.400> two

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
and yeah now only two by two S's on two

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.420 
and yeah now only two by two S's on two
by<00:02:38.820> twos<00:02:39.030> um<00:02:39.480> I'm<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.900> rough<00:02:40.200> Kiba<00:02:40.680> just<00:02:41.190> on<00:02:41.340> to

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
by twos um I'm a rough Kiba just on to

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.540 
by twos um I'm a rough Kiba just on to
you<00:02:41.490> by<00:02:41.580> twos<00:02:41.820> not<00:02:42.120> like<00:02:42.300> other<00:02:43.260> cubes<00:02:43.650> but

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
you by twos not like other cubes but

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.820 
you by twos not like other cubes but
like<00:02:46.489> this<00:02:47.489> is<00:02:47.550> very<00:02:48.030> hard<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.390> lock<00:02:48.660> up<00:02:48.900> it's

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
like this is very hard to lock up it's

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.110 
like this is very hard to lock up it's
because<00:02:50.040> if<00:02:50.130> it's<00:02:50.280> amazing<00:02:50.730> corner-cutting

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
because if it's amazing corner-cutting

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.809 
because if it's amazing corner-cutting
watch<00:02:51.360> this<00:02:55.790> okay

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
watch this okay

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:09.629 
watch this okay
oh<00:03:03.780> right<00:03:04.780> oh<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:08.680> see<00:03:08.859> the<00:03:08.980> point<00:03:09.249> like

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
oh right oh you see the point like

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.610 
oh right oh you see the point like
compared<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.329> my<00:03:10.450> land<00:03:10.689> line<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:11.170> is<00:03:11.290> much

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
compared to my land line that is much

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.910 
compared to my land line that is much
better<00:03:14.549> now<00:03:15.549> I<00:03:15.819> just<00:03:16.090> wanna<00:03:16.329> now<00:03:17.319> cut<00:03:17.590> reverse

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
better now I just wanna now cut reverse

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.229 
better now I just wanna now cut reverse
gonna<00:03:18.219> cut<00:03:18.430> that<00:03:20.280> this<00:03:21.280> cube<00:03:21.700> is<00:03:21.849> still

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
gonna cut that this cube is still

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.970 
gonna cut that this cube is still
amazing<00:03:22.569> look<00:03:23.439> at<00:03:23.560> that<00:03:24.389> look<00:03:25.389> at<00:03:25.480> that<00:03:26.579> easy
