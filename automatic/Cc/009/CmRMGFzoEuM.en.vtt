00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.929
 hello and thanks for turning on today 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.730
 is there a good classic of the 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.559
 quick kitchen namely a currywurst 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.820
 and I 'm just really fast 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.440
 and straightforward how to do a great job 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.060
 tasty and slightly hot sauces 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.949
 i get this fitting 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.859
 cool bowls found the look 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.029
 like yes this cardboard from the index 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.560
 However, from plastic you can 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.800
 wash again and continue to bind 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.269
 very cool colors and fits everyone 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.070
 of course, there is a great case 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.829
 a bit of fritz bush could do that 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.500
 make the way read and then just 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.940
 maybe also first of all 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.620
 whereas in fact the hot pan is 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.140
 add some oil in this case something 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.969
 olive oil and then I do that already 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.270
 small cut onion pure and 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.640
 Let's stew it for a very short time 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.239
 another one to two tablespoons of tomato paste 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.239
 add the 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.420
 let go if you still puzzle with it 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.399
 further on the traces of the beautiful 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.320
 Taste gives and brothers the whole 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.909
 ever to now back it all the more 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.290
 broken up with a bit of water and 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.939
 the whole then a little bit around 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.369
 last but one or two minutes 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.570
 move on in the pan with the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.570
 carry on with other ingredients 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.600
 in the next step weight two to 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.070
 three tablespoons perfectly normal 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.070
 Add commercial catcher 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.120
 and then I'll leave it short 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.860
 Boil the whole again to beautiful 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.650
 and now comes wonderful 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.800
 delicious honey add a big one 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.540
 tablespoon should be enough of 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.010
 balsamic vinegar and white sauce 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.690
 Of course, in the curry sauce a 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.690
 good pinch of curry powder is not missing 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.880
 and why she still a bit 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.740
 to spice things up is a little bit more 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.869
 Turmeric has the same color as 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.830
 curry tastes like something 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.390
 different and of course, of course 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.220
 Stir over low bit the said 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.930
 heat then nothing can burn 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.320
 there are a few more around that 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.340
 minutes to draw turns the stove 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.060
 and then we can do it right now 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.490
 serve already 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.510
 in the meantime , sometimes the sausage 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.330
 small ones we for the currywurst 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.140
 of course also need 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.209
 I have here now for the green 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.950
 bowl then decided which everything 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.780
 could already serve hits 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.920
 the sausage and now comes naturally 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.970
 our super delicious hot sauce does 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.620
 just as much as you want 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.510
 I'm definitely a fan of 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.260
 Maybe that's why maronese might as well 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.970
 in small local to that recipes 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.830

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.209

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.560
