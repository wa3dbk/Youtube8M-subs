00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 the mage abu dhabi men leaving the exhaust 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.849
 for the opening of government 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:11.399
 after bringing up 

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:13.629
 did not rule out the hypothesis 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.259
 and he is coming 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:20.689
 we believe that the hydrogen and design between 01 and 20 is the fuel of the 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.140
 Future eliminated guinea among renewable energy sources clean the means of 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.969
 transportation shall not be punishment at all and may be 

00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:30.969
 renewable without producing carbon dioxide 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:35.640
 hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe about 92 per 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.640
 cent of the universe is made of brasilia 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.480
 three young people were brook and this is my testimony of the future we have resources 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.570
 abundant in the form of water and in the form of hydrocarbons underground 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.990
 as well as in the form of grasses of trees on the surface 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.200
 as everyone learned in chemistry class water is made of two 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.270
 Hydrogen atoms 21 should be released today and to separate the two 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.330
 we use electrolysis 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.510
 gas production is instantaneous 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.320
 because this process 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.910
 is to dismember the molecule of its hydrogen components secrecy worse 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.120
 the hydrogen separates and is captured as a house 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.980
 but how does this palpable fuel work on horses 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.120
 certainly growth requires a car with a fuel cell cell 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.660
 fuel and energy 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.260
 is the inverse of the electrolysis process 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.340
 to 5 billion hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.340
 many people are moved the councilman however 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.900
 like gasoline today only with glass second 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.800
 and you have the air intake as the entity waits for the cell of 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.180
 and from an electricity generator the water comes out at 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.980
 leakage to time waiting for electricity supply electric supply 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.650
 do the vacancies of rodrigo 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.000
 The only purpose of hydrogen as a fuel is to supply the engine 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.619
 electric 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.530
 why will they simply drive an electric car 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.310
 what is the advantage of the fuel cell here we can go further 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.300
 to load much faster 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.300
 refueling takes about 5 minutes 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:13.189
 compared to a full night's load for the vehicle totally 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:14.499
 electric 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:16.259
 not convinced 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:20.239
 revealed hydrogen-only chassis 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.490
 This is the month that Ford 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.880
 this extremely predictable platform depending on the type of vehicle we can 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.399
 change the length and width 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:33.509
 it will be made of steel and aluminum today composed of carbon fiber and 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:34.909
 high resistance 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:37.120
 everything is settled in here 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.799
 tanks hydrogen fuel cell system to voters 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.819
 reversing and four undercarriages give the fuel cells generate 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.370
 electricity in a direct way differently from the 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.090
 internal combustion and with that electricity make them run 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.180
 systems such as brakes and steering 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.140
 therefore the hydrogen-powered platform is a plant 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.230
 self-sustaining for your car 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.349
 and believe if you want your future hydrogen-powered car can also supply 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.900
 your home the fuel cell generates electricity in 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.319
 excess that you can sell back to the concessions cases pass the greater 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.859
 part of the time for 210 we hear the car about 10% of the time 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.600
 this gives the opportunity to be a vehicle to create synergy 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.860
 which can be integrated into the power grid I am harry barnes vice president of 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.890
 research and development and general motors planning therefore 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.980
 this ability to use the car to generate power changes the role of the automobile 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.849
 I simply say transport to a mobile energy platform 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.969
 so thanks to the hydrogen charity while your car is stationary it may 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:43.629
 provide electrical power to your home 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.329
 and bought 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.349
 this class is afraid to avoid 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.909
 O 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.819
 - safety 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.349
 hydrogen fuel is not a good idea 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.249
 we did not put plutonium in the attack, hydrogen did not cause 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:04.479
 disaster of the Hindenburg airship it occurred because of the ignition of the 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:08.149
 that it is highly unlikely that the aluminum in the 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:11.709
 we forget the fact that when the internal combustion 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:12.719
 emerged 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.999
 many newspapers protested by saying both individuals 

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:19.719
 You'll drive on a lot of gasoline. 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.900
 any accident that happened would make your car exploded in flames no one 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.090
 would want a gas pump close to home 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.129
 well this is the world we live in 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:33.819
 the gas pumps are scattered around and when an accident happens 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.779
 We're afraid the car will catch fire. 

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:40.439
 now in relation to hydrogen people are saying the same thing 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.800
 hydrogen is a flammable substance 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.009
 and also gasoline also 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:50.349
 between humans should be second there is a big difference between the two technician 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:54.939
 genin is a very serious case fourteen times lighter than air many aspects 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:58.150
 hydrogen fuel cells 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.509
 of hydrogen earlier because gasoline 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.889
 Believe if you want, it's the truth. 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:07.150
 hydrogen requires more pressure to combust and it ignites 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.409
 temperatures that would not burn the taste to the foot 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.029
 but perhaps the most important is that as hydrogen is lighter than air the 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:17.119
 leakage would spill all the way up gasoline spreads on the floor 

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:19.789
 creating a larger flammable area 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:24.210
 but in the same way that gasoline storage of this volatile liquid is 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.789
 An important issue are the ones that store hydrogen are extremely 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.509
 stronger and more resistant than gasoline 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:34.280
 the hydrogen tanks of the cases are made with polycarbonate if 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:39.199
 incredibly durable visited the center already circulated today from the birthing soles 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.560
 but the safety of the hge state is no problem its production and distribution 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:45.619
 consumer is proving to be a major challenge. 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.069
 so far 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:52.049
 Welcome to Norway where hydrogen is extracted from the water almost 80 years 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:56.649
 I was well today, it's not a source of energy. 

00:05:56.649 --> 00:06:00.309
 energy the first minute that electricity should be generated from 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:03.290
 something can be extracted the stones would be coal 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.129
 the back also a new carbon-bearing city that causes greenhouse effect 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:11.539
 if we can use the energy in a renewed way but we will have the solution 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:16.659
 in the process of developing our own process of electrolysis in the 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:17.509
 twenties 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:20.509
 based on the electronic call 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.880
 the process is essentially the same as us the years of life in the 1920s 

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:30.249
 but optimized and modernized several times from here to here 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.879
 we received seven cities in the region 

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:39.709
 and so we know that the electricity we find is actually from a source 

00:06:39.709 --> 00:06:41.629
 renewable 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:44.659
 we put him in the water 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:46.430
 patients on waiting list 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.589
 we put it in 3d 

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:49.809
 it's not a little water
