00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 today we are going to drain this sir is what 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:15.350
 I do me every weekend me 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:18.350
 lets run is happening 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.350
 manning 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:29.210
 if it's not going to be Saturday, November 10 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.210
 you are lifelong runners 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.180
 even if I do not notice myself effectively with 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.219
 this tremendous good battle now seems 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.629
 a little bit the last few months because I'm sorry 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:48.200
 a little liked a little column 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:48.200
 but but I 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.000
 after additives and advance of 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.250
 kilometers and how it is done can not 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.840
 run in the most natural of the world be 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.360
 start thinking that it's like the only 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.250
 sport that one learns even before 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.490
 control the sphincter to crawl and walk 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.490
 and run 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.500
 in the background and also the sport more 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.500
 free 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.020
 I would like to kill some myths because 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.300
 I remember when I was a boy always 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.300
 I ran from little girls really 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.230
 I was a bit weird because 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.020
 I remember that was not in the first 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.120
 years of adolescence the whole girl 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.620
 they started going to the gym and at least 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.720
 with the gym I like to go running 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.000
 but everyone said care because 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.740
 you're going to smash your knee you 're going 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.860
 to despair the joints and 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.190
 when I'm 20 when you have 30 go to 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.340
 be with osteoarthritis throw me a lot of 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.420
 liars but it could not be true 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.050
 because we're going with there were the 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.610
 good enough implements 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.890
 good to run in a natural matter 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.260
 part from kids but we will deforming 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.970
 the type of footprint and it was fundamentally 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.190
 a the use of the shoes of the tacos 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.520
 etcetera 1 is weighing more with heel but 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.930
 if you start with metatarsal you will not have 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.930
 with the metatarsus with the goal 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.810
 and that allows you that the impact does not 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.340
 in the knee therefore you do not go and 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.340
 on the contrary, it will improve your calf 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.560
 currently the market has any 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.530
 shoe and meets any function 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.440
 that you have a deficiency in some kind 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.900
 maybe there's no problem with that there's no 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.000
 large contraindications regarding 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.920
 run today in Juan Carlos and how much 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.390
 it was because I am already giving birth tomorrow 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.180
 running I say already so tomorrow Saturday 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.130
 and at 25 kilometers also those methods 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.980
 which is the first objective does not look 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.420
 thinking about the homeowner if your daughter 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.320
 but people are running are 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.750
 running a co-worker 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.160
 etcetera that I also want to run not 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.500
 can arrive and depart with 10 kilometers 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.420
 you have to start moderately 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.390
 example you can go to the park and run 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.580
 one block walk another block to run 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.950
 one block walk another block perfect 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.660
 but it is improving in the aerobic system 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.850
 slowly and get a goal for the 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.459
 tell us in two more months I will run 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.680
 a 5k already program that but what 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.970
 important does not seem to share with five 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.050
 from one day to the next without having run in 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.140
 a great test because that can cause 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.360
 Actions 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.450
 and more than injuries will frustrate you 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.180
 feel really bad and it does not serve much with 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.020
 we like that intention to money 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.340
 delivering information regarding 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.760
 mail for people to run zhi wen 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:44.570
 joanito all the information to invite 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.070
 to the people of the good camera day the 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.959
 we invite the day of running that 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.760
 will take place on Saturday November 10 in 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.850
 the dependencies the metropolitan park 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.100
 de Santiago San Cristobal Hill and the 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.810
 side behind the divertimento there 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.450
 let's do a running camp there 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.060
 in the background we are going to have talks 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.110
 techniques to teach you how to run 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.060
 Guided trainings with the coaches 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.220
 of the different groups of santiago go 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.140
 to be available 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.250
 I'm a new runner, ok, let's go to a 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.829
 circuit for runners new talks 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.630
 nutrition techniques workouts 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.000
 free to pay something because many 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.310
 Sometimes there are like little things but it will be 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.910
 good is a runners activity 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.080
 for runners there are no marks behind 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.820
 The idea is that all the 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.180
 colors attend in the talks are 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.100
 free assistance is free 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.720
 the idea is that think about the runners 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.270
 new ones that do not need assistance 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.040
 that they are given only running says no I do not 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.419
 I know nobody but if you are going 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.940
 it was always watching the same 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.940
 faces thank you very much 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:57.750
 to the slopes develops that all the 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.750
 Proper supply and it's free www
