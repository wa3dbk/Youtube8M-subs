let's<00:00:02.520> focus<00:00:02.879> on<00:00:03.000> that<00:00:03.030> jump<00:00:03.480> spinning

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
let's focus on that jump spinning

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.619 
let's focus on that jump spinning

that's my kicking leg fun lap hands
forward<00:00:28.769> I'm<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.849> be<00:00:29.910> judging<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
forward I'm going to be judging the

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.450 
forward I'm going to be judging the
distance<00:00:30.570> right<00:00:30.960> here<00:00:30.990> one<00:00:31.980> arms-length

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
distance right here one arms-length

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.270 
distance right here one arms-length
apart<00:00:32.790> right<00:00:33.210> there<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.860> can<00:00:34.860> be<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> little<00:00:35.130> bit

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
apart right there I can be a little bit

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.350 
apart right there I can be a little bit
farther<00:00:35.460> part<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.850> can<00:00:36.000> be<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.120> little<00:00:36.210> bit

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
farther part I can be a little bit

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.540 
farther part I can be a little bit
closer<00:00:36.600> but<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.469> good<00:00:37.649> measurement

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
closer but this is a good measurement

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.910 
closer but this is a good measurement
right<00:00:38.790> there<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.360> want<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.290> lower<00:00:40.440> my<00:00:40.620> center<00:00:40.890> of

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
right there I want to lower my center of

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.459 
right there I want to lower my center of
gravity<00:00:40.980> now<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.700> want<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.910> spin<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:43.020> kind<00:00:43.379> of

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
gravity now I want to spin and kind of

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.470 
gravity now I want to spin and kind of
get<00:00:44.100> ready<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.399> spring<00:00:44.730> off<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.030> balls<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.420> my

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.680 
get ready to spring off the balls of my
feet<00:00:45.539> when<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.620> I'm<00:00:46.680> going<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.890> spring<00:00:47.219> up

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
feet when I do so I'm going to spring up

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.650 
feet when I do so I'm going to spring up
spin<00:00:48.690> around<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.379> kick<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.219> right<00:00:50.910> leg<00:00:51.180> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
outside Crescent kick right there so I

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.660 
outside Crescent kick right there so I
touch<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.430> spring<00:00:57.390> down<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.960> jump<00:00:58.410> up<00:00:58.670> outside

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
touch I spring down I jump up outside

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.799 
touch I spring down I jump up outside

Crescent kick one outside Crescent kick

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.820 
Crescent kick one outside Crescent kick
you<00:01:09.360> can<00:01:09.479> also<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:09.960> judge<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> distance

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
you can also just judge a distance

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.270 
you can also just judge a distance
without<00:01:11.280> touching<00:01:11.939> getting<00:01:12.570> an<00:01:12.659> eye<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:12.810> it

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
without touching getting an eye for it

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.820 
without touching getting an eye for it
springing<00:01:14.280> down<00:01:14.490> up<00:01:15.650> there's<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.890> kick<00:01:18.830> okay

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
springing down up there's that kick okay

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.289 
springing down up there's that kick okay
let's<00:01:20.040> work<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.310> your<00:01:20.340> jump<00:01:20.700> spinning

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
let's work on your jump spinning

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.780 
let's work on your jump spinning
Crescent<00:01:21.930> kicks<00:01:22.400> start<00:01:23.400> off<00:01:23.520> with<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.759> first

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
Crescent kicks start off with the first

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.120 
Crescent kicks start off with the first
one<00:01:24.270> as<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.570> person<00:01:24.900> was<00:01:25.020> actually<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.560> little

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
one as the person was actually a little

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.600 
one as the person was actually a little
more<00:01:26.340> difficult<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:28.100> if<00:01:29.100> you've<00:01:29.189> got<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> good

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
more difficult but if you've got a good

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.260 
more difficult but if you've got a good
spring<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.180> good<00:01:30.360> jump<00:01:30.659> should<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.110> any<00:01:31.259> problem

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
spring a good jump should be any problem

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.520 
spring a good jump should be any problem
it's<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.420> put<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.570> bogus<00:01:34.020> mint<00:01:34.229> right

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
it's going to put that bogus mint right

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.620 
it's going to put that bogus mint right
about<00:01:34.740> head<00:01:35.009> height<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.549> like<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.270> little<00:01:36.420> bit

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
about head height I like it a little bit

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.990 
about head height I like it a little bit
higher<00:01:37.170> than<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.590> you've<00:01:38.549> got<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> lot<00:01:38.970> of

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
higher than that you've got a lot of

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.850 
higher than that you've got a lot of
flexibility<00:01:39.630> want<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> little<00:01:39.990> bit<00:01:40.140> higher<00:01:40.320> aim

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
flexibility want a little bit higher aim

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.770 
flexibility want a little bit higher aim
for<00:01:41.040> at<00:01:41.310> least<00:01:41.460> head<00:01:41.850> height<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.540> need<00:01:42.720> to

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
for at least head height you need to

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.870 
for at least head height you need to
start<00:01:42.990> off<00:01:43.140> here<00:01:43.320> that's<00:01:43.530> fine<00:01:43.770> but<00:01:44.369> aim<00:01:44.640> for

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
start off here that's fine but aim for

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.789 
start off here that's fine but aim for
this<00:01:45.030> right<00:01:45.390> there<00:01:45.659> we're<00:01:46.409> going<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.590> lower

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
this right there we're going to lower

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.700 
this right there we're going to lower
center<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.280> gravity<00:01:47.369> right<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.420> here<00:01:48.869> now<00:01:49.409> I

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
center of gravity right in here now I

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.319 
center of gravity right in here now I
want<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.250> know<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.549> distance<00:01:50.909> between<00:01:51.030> myself

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
want to know the distance between myself

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.109 
want to know the distance between myself
and<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.530> focus<00:01:52.979> matter<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.399> target<00:01:53.880> area
