00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.170
 washers and fry it in the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.339
 bottom of the pan with a little bit 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.019

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.070
 too fine and we just have them for them 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.590
 melt lightly with onions 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.869
