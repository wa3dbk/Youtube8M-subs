00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.580
 today we are going to prepare Neapolitan 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.849
 chocolate the ingredients for our 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.120
 Neapolitan chocolate are 2 plates 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.160
 puff pastry icing sugar a pot of cream 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.110
 of cocoa a spoonful of jam 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.070
 apricot chocolate noodles for 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.070
 decorate and water 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.060
 first sprinkle the sugar 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.790
 glas on the base where we go to 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.689
 work and we will put the sheet of 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.689
 puff up 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.910
 As you can see, I have broken a little 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.200
 but nothing happens you can fix it 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.200
 squeezing well with your fingers 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.270
 and we go back to sprinkle more icing sugar 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.270
 we distribute over the whole mass 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.710
 we will stretch a little with the roller 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.150
 without taking care not to pass us we do not want 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.150
 that we left the very thin dough 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.090
 once we have this done in both 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.450
 plates we will take the cocoa cream and 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.190
 we will make a generous layer in the middle I 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.360
 say that I was wrong and I bought poop from 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.950
 two colors but good does not matter 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.950
 they came out very good 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.450
 we will clean the excess of spoons and 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.840
 it also will miss sheet 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.840
 puff pastry 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.130
 we will take one side and close and 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.040
 we will press a little bit so that 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.690
 open we worry if it breaks a bit the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.370
 mass does not matter 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.230
 on the other hand we will do the same 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.520
 and profile we will do a bit with our fingers 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:03.810
 so that it stays more or less straight 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.810
 so with the two sheets 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.769
 sprinkle we have more icing sugar 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.769
 we distribute 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.340
 we have prepared our tray 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.620
 oven with the vegetable paper we will go 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.409
 cutting with a knife with care of 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.930
 put the closing part on the part of 

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:38.019
 down the tray so that at the time 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.120
 to bake it is not open to us so 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.340
 we will cut napolitanas the size 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.420
 what do we expect if they are great 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.680
 will leave 4 a plus or minus 3 or 4 and if they are 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.680
 girls so many more 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:01.280
 we will follow the same procedure 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.280
 with the two with the two masses 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:09.010
 while we will preheat the oven 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.010
 for 10 minutes at 220 degrees 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.730
 and we put in the oven 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.410
 as you see after having them 180 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.440
 degrees 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.450
 for 10 minutes or 20 minutes according to me 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.830
 I've been keeping an eye on them but when 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.270
 you see there are two statesmen 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.510
 and they are not raw inside 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.340
 we will take a spoonful of marmalade 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.890
 apricot and mix with water 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.180
 tempered we remove and with a brush we go 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.920
 mesh 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.920
 we are bathing our napolitanas 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.530
 when we have finished sprinkle 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.980
 sprinkle we have with shavings 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.379
 chocolate to decorate 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.670
 and the look he has seems to be from 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.950
 bakery look 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.780
 they look good, well, 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.650
 I say that nothing did not last in the 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.239
 plate 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.450
 so cheer up because it's super easy 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:12.610
 It does not have much work and they are very rich 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.470
 so with this Neapolitan I say goodbye 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.470
 greetings and until the next video
