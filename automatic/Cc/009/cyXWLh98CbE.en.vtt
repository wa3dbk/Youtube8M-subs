00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
that could have been eaten we've done

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.790

research<00:00:15.240> over<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.570> last<00:00:15.630> two<00:00:15.929> years<00:00:15.960> where

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
research over the last two years where

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.040 
research over the last two years where
we<00:00:16.920> found<00:00:17.130> that<00:00:17.430> getting<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.359> portions<00:00:18.810> wrong

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.390 
we found that getting the portions wrong
is<00:00:19.170> one<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> main<00:00:19.680> reasons<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.189> end<00:00:20.310> up

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
is one of the main reasons we end up

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.490 
is one of the main reasons we end up
wasting<00:00:20.550> food<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.510> yeah<00:00:21.689> trying<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.320> think
