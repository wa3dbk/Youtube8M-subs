00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.089
 France is the first country in November by its Brazilian sideration 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.520
 located mainly in the eyes they recognize themselves in his referral is 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.259
 similar 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.649
 24 hours a day, 7 days a week 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:18.150
 which also helps fight against climate change the bags 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.999
 decreases in certificates 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:22.169
 ddd six people is threatened 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:26.550
 waste reduction and recycling sector are the two most important 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.230
 modes 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.609
 to limit our impact 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.569
 on climate change 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:32.759
 bearer of exasperation 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.319
 finally it is growing in Morocco 

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:35.720
 last week 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.190
 that's where we could go 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.130
 long considered the child 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.130
 defended by industrialists 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.120
 bendir enough of the recovery no 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.350
 it is not allowed music is that he had he had been simple public 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.390
 diane kurys scars environmental danger 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.390
 the ease involved but all come together 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.730
 in France waste represents 45 million tonnes each year 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.840
 11 billion euros which are devoted to 98 euros per person 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.100
 claude sicre 24% of waste 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.100
 a simple gesture that tends to develop 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.090
 we are at the men's cicta 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.090
 they are the ones who manage 90% of the waste of Ile-de-France 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.210
 such a house witness it is the director of communication who makes us 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.970
 visit 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.950
 it's the refusal I'm very happy 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.840
 it is the inhabitants who have cut the newspapers the magazines and magazines of the 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.460
 precious metal cardboard plastic bottles retains pasta 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.530
 food 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.360
 evening mix in this crisis it is sent to recycling channels 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.660
 no more to rebuild it two-thirds of these machines are dedicated to crime 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.710
 it's also a cloud factory 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.100
 it has existed for more than a century 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.619
 in the 90s studies have shown that incinerators 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.450
 release we fall short of huge sales by almost half 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.399
 as a whole for the om to propel 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.359
 in these standards 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:13.379
 and so that's good for much better pop 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.999
 les rochelais need to do this a standardization took place in 2005 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:19.729
 totally citizens 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:22.729
 nearly 200 billion dinars 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:26.999
 here is sébastien lapeyrère 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:28.719
 active activist 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:32.669
 I consider that facts but rejects 5 million tons of CO2 per year either 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:36.109
 the equivalent of two glasses of 3 million cars this huge 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.489
 reserved by the people 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.289
 mitel purifier of the river 

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:43.489
 on the fact that aspiration would make all the waste disappear 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.810
 yeah yeah that's not at all that the general sneering of gardens on 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.649
 see them fumets m 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:52.159
 then when you train a number of members will pollute toxic members 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:53.159
 in the balance sheet 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.280
 create a policy for the environment and as a result 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:03:00.250
 themselves of health impacts on the populations and especially to the 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:01.329
 food chain 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.909
 these hour impacts on the ground 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.039
 and jumps 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:08.099
 and in France in response on the roads nearly 3 million tons 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.260
 from 7 to 9 am 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.800
 strong young people that their remedies at the base of the founders desperation 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.420
 the report from the French Institute and a video for 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:20.359
 populations 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.759
 living near the power plant 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:26.279
 a few hours before his departure to the top of the mountain we meet 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:27.569
 this oncologist 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:28.929
 his goal 

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:32.179
 fight cancer related to environmental problems 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:35.499
 his first act report 2005 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:37.139
 so here is a risk 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.289
 in his report 

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:40.139
 the scrum-half 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.479
 also newer 6 

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.349
 she reports an analysis 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.449
 this case 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:49.439
 but at the level of some members of the CIA is afraid 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.169
 even if this option this second report is much more alarmist 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:54.929
 since it is lacking 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:59.009
 around the incinerators a high rate machined than in the vaucluse in 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:01.289
 general of cancers especially the cynics 

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:03.849
 the final form of the candidates for the podium 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.499
 of a form of leukemia 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:09.839
 it's easy, but it's so much breast cancer 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:13.839
 the implications of the new 2005 standards will only be studied in 10 

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:15.229
 can 15 years 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:16.909
 the priority of the g20 

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:18.669
 the situation 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.019
 but at waste recycling what are the risks 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.000
 meanwhile the department in France we will not have enough of 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.900
 storage and incineration solutions and waste in other words this 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.020
 technical preparatory if naples 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.779
 in France 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:37.289
 everyone agrees that we must focus on recycled waste 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.870
 no one can say today that his factories 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.259
 they are clean 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.839
 behind these new standards hide several billion euros without 

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:48.180
 count this burned waste which turns into heating and 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.590
 electricity 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.999
 the planet saturate waste 

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:55.439
 every year our consumption starts again 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:56.319
 what will be the alternative
