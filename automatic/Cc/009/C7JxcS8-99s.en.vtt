00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
swimming for so long and decided to lay

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.729 
swimming for so long and decided to lay
down<00:03:04.620> in<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.340> grass<00:03:06.080> ok<00:03:07.080> so<00:03:07.140> you<00:03:07.440> get<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.650> idea

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
down in the grass ok so you get the idea

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.890 
down in the grass ok so you get the idea
so<00:03:08.280> when<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:08.910> go<00:03:09.150> back<00:03:09.360> on<00:03:09.510> there

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
so when you go back on there

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.770 
so when you go back on there
if<00:03:09.959> we<00:03:10.170> turn<00:03:10.410> off<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.620> variation<00:03:11.340> airy<00:03:11.519> I<00:03:11.780> was

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
if we turn off the variation airy I was

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.259 
if we turn off the variation airy I was
very<00:03:13.110> tired<00:03:13.530> from<00:03:13.739> swimming<00:03:14.160> for<00:03:14.640> so<00:03:14.910> long

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
very tired from swimming for so long

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:16.850 
very tired from swimming for so long
