00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.230
 and attention we inform you that in the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.670
 next few minutes we will not talk about 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.560
 greedy entrepreneurs 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.110
 We are not going to show images that you 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.930
 make your hair stand on end 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.910
 We are not going to make you cry 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:35.140
 or maybe because we're going to talk about 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.140
 you the consumer 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.360
 this is you 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.760
 this is one then go out and buy 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.910
 this before you spend those twenty 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.370
 euros we have something to tell you 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.839
 ever asked how they are manufactured and 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.610
 where do the products that come from 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:57.199
 consume and why they cost what 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.199
 they cost low 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.210
 Sometimes things are so cheap 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.400
 assumes that for a price to be paid 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.920
 so low there is someone who has not earned what 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.080
 enough to be able to live you know how much 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.140
 charges a worker sewing balloons 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.970
 football in pakistan barely 40 cents 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.890
 euro a day figure that has not been 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.780
 increased during the last six 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.850
 years although the final price of the ball 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.860
 has gone up 40% 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.320
 but not always the clearest is the best 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.970
 in many cases that something is expensive 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.619
 means that it pays well to the one who 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.720
 has done but there are other people 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.409
 in the commercial chain that are enriched 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.409
 with the process 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.970
 if a chocolate tablet costs a 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.240
 euro the chocolate industry takes 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.960
 70 cents 25 the intermediaries and the 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.940
 producer so only 5 cents also in 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.550
 numerous times the medium is damaged 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.760
 environment for example for production 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.890
 of a lot of the clothes you wear around 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.140
 of 23 percent of insecticides 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.610
 employees in the world are used in the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.710
 cultivation of cotton with 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.200
 consequent polluting effects in 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.640
 land and water and children work and 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.760
 girls without taking into account the rights 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.680
 fundamentals of people 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.330
 in summary many of the products that 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.280
 we buy in conventional stores 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.900
 They have been manufactured by people who 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.820
 they live and work in countries 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.030
 disadvantaged and in conditions 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.030
 precarious 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.650
 and you have been amazed as a group 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.930
 people in the sixties 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.180
 hallucinated so much with this situation that 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.920
 they thought that something like that had to be done 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.920
 the fair trade movement was born 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.140
 in 1969 the first store of 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.120
 fair trade in merkel in holland 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.910
 selling only cane sugar and 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.340
 craftsmanship of impoverished countries two 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.970
 years later in this country there were already 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.460
 120 fair trade stores on 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.290
 fair trade is not a help but a 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.570
 alternative commercial activity to 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.460
 traditional trade that allows 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.470
 producers a direct access to 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.440
 markets in more egalitarian conditions 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.080
 improves their standard of living and collaborates in the 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.900
 poverty eradication to help you 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.090
 to understand it we are going to give you an example 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.790
 this is a coffee bean grown in 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.910
 Nicaragua and this is a coffee bean 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.280
 cultivated also in nicaragua seem 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.720
 same but they are very different and you already 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.520
 we say it does not have to do with the 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.500
 quality because in that there is no 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.140
 difference between them but we give you 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.870
 other clues one of them has come out of 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.430
 a fair trade cooperative that 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.560
 it means that the importer that 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.240
 purchase pays enough to the producer 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.220
 to be able to live without their children 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.500
 have to work and can go to 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.580
 school that part of that money serves 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.260
 to improve the commune 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.180
 where they live for example building 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.010
 hospitals or schools and that their 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.510
 workers fulfill the commitment of 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.310
 respect the environment in the 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.160
 production and ensure equality of 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.250
 gender of the other can not say what 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.250
 same 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.230
 how can you recognize the products of 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.420
 fair trade very easy approach a 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.790
 fair trade store or section 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.040

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.989

 a distinctive ensuring that 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.010
 products have been manufactured and 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.100
 marketed according to criteria of 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.750
 fair trade and if you only see the brand of 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.820
 either importing the 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.130
