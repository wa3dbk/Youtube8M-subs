00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
you divine it you actually need to cut a

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:29.479 
you divine it you actually need to cut a
little<00:03:21.340> deeper<00:03:21.819> like<00:03:22.150> this<00:03:22.329> way

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.729 

do<00:03:29.969> not<00:03:30.120> cut<00:03:30.420> through<00:03:30.629> a<00:03:31.019> little<00:03:31.439> bit<00:03:31.560> deeper

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
do not cut through a little bit deeper

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.770 
do not cut through a little bit deeper
and<00:03:32.040> then<00:03:33.290> just<00:03:34.290> like<00:03:34.439> this<00:03:35.180> easy<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.390> simple

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
and then just like this easy and simple

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.979 
and then just like this easy and simple
right<00:03:37.579> then<00:03:38.579> you're<00:03:38.730> going<00:03:38.909> to<00:03:39.030> do<00:03:39.209> all<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.510> the

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
right then you're going to do all of the

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:51.030 
right then you're going to do all of the
shrimp<00:03:40.260> right<00:03:40.379> this<00:03:40.709> way<00:03:41.209> before<00:03:42.209> baking

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.910 

well<00:03:51.640> after<00:03:52.209> you<00:03:52.540> butterfly<00:03:53.409> all<00:03:53.620> of<00:03:53.769> the

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
well after you butterfly all of the

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.920 
well after you butterfly all of the
shrimp<00:03:54.189> you<00:03:54.340> put<00:03:54.640> it<00:03:54.760> on<00:03:54.939> the<00:03:55.090> tray<00:03:55.329> on<00:03:55.360> top<00:03:55.629> of

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
shrimp you put it on the tray on top of

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.050 
shrimp you put it on the tray on top of
the<00:03:56.049> foil<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.650> then<00:03:57.069> we<00:03:57.189> start<00:03:57.459> to<00:03:57.610> meat<00:03:57.819> make

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
the foil and then we start to meat make

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.449 
the foil and then we start to meat make
meatball<00:03:58.540> I<00:03:58.750> just<00:03:58.959> simply<00:03:59.560> use<00:03:59.799> you<00:04:00.129> know<00:04:00.280> a

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
meatball I just simply use you know a

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.030 
meatball I just simply use you know a
spoon<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:01.030> also<00:04:01.269> can<00:04:01.540> use<00:04:01.569> the<00:04:02.379> ice-cream

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
spoon you also can use the ice-cream

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.119 
spoon you also can use the ice-cream
scope<00:04:03.519> to<00:04:04.209> make<00:04:04.870> a<00:04:04.900> better<00:04:05.470> shape<00:04:05.709> meatball

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
scope to make a better shape meatball

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.190 
scope to make a better shape meatball
whatever<00:04:06.819> you<00:04:07.000> prefer<00:04:07.209> whatever<00:04:07.900> you<00:04:08.019> like

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
whatever you prefer whatever you like

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.720 
whatever you prefer whatever you like
and<00:04:08.530> then<00:04:08.700> put<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:09.879> on<00:04:09.909> top<00:04:10.209> of<00:04:10.690> the<00:04:10.959> shrimp

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
and then put it on top of the shrimp

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:32.210 
and then put it on top of the shrimp
just<00:04:12.730> like<00:04:12.879> this<00:04:13.090> way

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.040 

right<00:04:33.220> after<00:04:33.730> we<00:04:33.820> stop<00:04:34.060> all<00:04:34.300> of<00:04:34.480> the<00:04:34.660> meatballs

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
right after we stop all of the meatballs

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.170 
right after we stop all of the meatballs
into<00:04:35.440> the<00:04:35.710> SRAM<00:04:36.010> you<00:04:36.190> can<00:04:36.370> look<00:04:36.640> at<00:04:36.790> like<00:04:36.940> this

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
into the SRAM you can look at like this

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.570 
into the SRAM you can look at like this
and<00:04:37.480> now<00:04:37.960> we<00:04:37.990> are<00:04:38.230> going<00:04:38.380> to<00:04:38.500> use<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.980> rest<00:04:39.310> of

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
and now we are going to use the rest of

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.420 
and now we are going to use the rest of
the<00:04:39.700> butter<00:04:39.910> and<00:04:40.270> toss<00:04:41.110> it<00:04:41.410> on<00:04:41.530> top<00:04:41.800> of<00:04:42.100> this

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
the butter and toss it on top of this

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.240 
the butter and toss it on top of this
meatball<00:04:43.210> number<00:04:43.660> one<00:04:44.020> that<00:04:44.380> will<00:04:44.650> make<00:04:44.950> the

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
meatball number one that will make the

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.580 
meatball number one that will make the
baked<00:04:45.580> or<00:04:45.880> grilled<00:04:45.940> meat<00:04:46.630> ball<00:04:46.840> more

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
really taste very dry so this butter

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.440 
really taste very dry so this butter
won't<00:04:59.650> work<00:04:59.830> for<00:05:00.100> that<00:05:00.220> besides<00:05:01.120> that<00:05:01.360> I<00:05:01.390> have

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
won't work for that besides that I have

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.010 
won't work for that besides that I have
to<00:05:01.690> tell<00:05:01.900> you<00:05:02.080> I<00:05:02.800> prefer<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.850> shrimp<00:05:04.210> with<00:05:04.690> the

to tell you I prefer the shrimp with the

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.200 
to tell you I prefer the shrimp with the
shell<00:05:05.290> because<00:05:05.710> that<00:05:06.220> can<00:05:06.460> also<00:05:06.700> hold<00:05:07.090> a

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
shell because that can also hold a

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.570 
shell because that can also hold a
better<00:05:07.420> shape<00:05:07.690> for<00:05:08.260> the<00:05:08.650> shrimp<00:05:08.980> and<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.460> me
