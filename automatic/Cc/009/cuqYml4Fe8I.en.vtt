00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
that floss thread it underneath the wire

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.670 
that floss thread it underneath the wire
you<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.149> use<00:00:42.390> these<00:00:42.629> little<00:00:42.960> blue<00:00:43.350> floss

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
you can use these little blue floss

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.340 
you can use these little blue floss
threader<00:00:43.980> --zz<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:45.030> go<00:00:45.570> through<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
threader --zz you just go through the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.920 
threader --zz you just go through the
loop<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.980> like<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:48.390> has<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> little<00:00:48.840> more

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
loop just like that it has a little more

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.729 
loop just like that it has a little more
of<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.110> rigid<00:00:49.489> point<00:00:51.050> and<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.170> pull<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.530> through

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
of a rigid point and you pull it through

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.380 
of a rigid point and you pull it through
just<00:00:52.770> like<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.520> then<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:53.940> your<00:00:54.059> seen

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
just like that and then you do your seen

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.569 
just like that and then you do your seen
flossing<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.170> then<00:00:55.350> pull<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.739> through<00:00:55.770> okay

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
flossing and then pull it through okay

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.250 
flossing and then pull it through okay
sometimes<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.480> works<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.899> little<00:00:58.020> bit<00:00:58.199> better

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
sometimes this works a little bit better

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.840 
sometimes this works a little bit better
on<00:00:58.590> these<00:00:58.770> lower<00:00:59.039> ones<00:00:59.160> because<00:00:59.550> it's<00:00:59.699> so

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
on these lower ones because it's so

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.599 
on these lower ones because it's so
close<00:01:00.120> together<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.899> these<00:01:00.960> brackets<00:01:01.260> are

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
close together and these brackets are

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.950 
close together and these brackets are
really<00:01:02.609> tight<00:01:02.910> with<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.270> crowding<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.840> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
really tight with the crowding of the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:13.000 
really tight with the crowding of the
teeth<00:01:04.229> okay<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.220> you're<00:01:05.580> what's<00:01:06.150> best<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:06.540> you

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.710 

this<00:01:14.010> helps<00:01:14.340> really<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> nooks<00:01:15.570> and

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
this helps really get in the nooks and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.810 
this helps really get in the nooks and
crannies<00:01:15.810> where<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.920> had<00:01:17.130> some<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.640> real

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
crannies where you had some of the real

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.960 
crannies where you had some of the real
crooked<00:01:18.330> teeth<00:01:18.659> mm-hmm<00:01:19.430> right<00:01:20.430> there<00:01:20.670> just

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
crooked teeth mm-hmm right there just

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.399 
crooked teeth mm-hmm right there just
really<00:01:21.180> gets<00:01:21.450> underneath<00:01:21.840> there<00:01:22.020> really<00:01:22.259> well

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
really gets underneath there really well

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.390 
really gets underneath there really well
if<00:01:22.470> you're<00:01:22.590> having<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.890> hard<00:01:23.040> time<00:01:23.100> getting
