prematurely falling out which is a point

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.630 
prematurely falling out which is a point
of<00:04:06.120> difference<00:04:06.269> but<00:04:07.170> it<00:04:07.380> thickens<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.070> lashes

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.080 
fighting one of the things we want to do
is<00:04:54.360> scientifically<00:04:55.340> utilize<00:04:56.340> ingredients

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
is scientifically utilize ingredients

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.630 
is scientifically utilize ingredients
that<00:04:57.270> are<00:04:57.330> going<00:04:57.570> to<00:04:57.690> interface<00:04:58.320> with<00:04:58.590> all<00:04:59.400> of

that are going to interface with all of

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.510 
that are going to interface with all of
these<00:04:59.760> billions<00:05:00.120> of<00:05:00.600> skin<00:05:00.900> cells<00:05:01.260> here<00:05:01.590> and<00:05:01.800> to

these billions of skin cells here and to

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.870 
these billions of skin cells here and to
address<00:05:03.390> and<00:05:03.810> to<00:05:04.080> support<00:05:04.650> things<00:05:05.550> that<00:05:05.760> are

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
address and to support things that are

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.430 
address and to support things that are
aging<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:06.419> we<00:05:06.480> know<00:05:06.630> where<00:05:06.720> I'll<00:05:06.810> acid<00:05:07.200> age

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
aging and we know where I'll acid age
