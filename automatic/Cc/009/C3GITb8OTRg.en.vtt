designed<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.109> be<00:00:28.500> CG<00:00:28.920> characters<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.550> taking

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
designed to be CG characters so taking

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.030 
designed to be CG characters so taking
something<00:00:30.179> that's<00:00:30.470> designed<00:00:31.470> as<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:31.679> flat

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
something that's designed as a flat

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.090 
something that's designed as a flat
drawing<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:33.649> switching<00:00:34.649> into<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:34.950> world

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
drawing and switching into that world

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.639 
drawing and switching into that world
can<00:00:35.399> be<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:36.149> know<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.510> it's<00:00:37.170> something<00:00:37.530> that

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
can be you know it it's something that

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.080 
can be you know it it's something that
could<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:38.100> could<00:00:38.250> go<00:00:38.370> either<00:00:38.520> way<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.879> could<00:00:39.000> go

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
could it could go either way it could go

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.549 
could it could go either way it could go
really<00:00:39.270> wrong<00:00:39.480> or<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.870> could<00:00:39.989> go<00:00:40.020> well<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.469> I

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
really wrong or it could go well and I

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.000 
really wrong or it could go well and I
think<00:00:40.770> we<00:00:41.430> got<00:00:41.610> lucky<00:00:41.870> well<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:43.140> us<00:00:43.230> how<00:00:43.829> about

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
think we got lucky well for us how about

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.350 
think we got lucky well for us how about
from<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.250> story<00:00:44.520> perspective<00:00:44.700> because<00:00:45.270> I

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
from a story perspective because I

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.850 
from a story perspective because I
remember<00:00:45.750> also<00:00:45.930> reading<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.530> he<00:00:46.710> was<00:00:46.829> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
remember also reading that he was a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.080 
remember also reading that he was a
little<00:00:47.039> concerned<00:00:47.399> about<00:00:47.460> stretching<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
little concerned about stretching the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.119 
little concerned about stretching the
format<00:00:48.480> into<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> full<00:00:49.110> feature<00:00:49.350> did<00:00:49.980> that

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
format into a full feature did that

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.220 
format into a full feature did that
affect<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.550> story<00:00:50.850> here<00:00:51.239> at<00:00:51.329> all<00:00:51.449> because<00:00:51.660> it

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
affect the story here at all because it

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.510 
affect the story here at all because it
works<00:00:52.559> as<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> whole<00:00:52.980> there's<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.280> through<00:00:53.489> line

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
works as a whole there's a through line

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.850 
works as a whole there's a through line
but<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.120> also<00:00:54.360> isolate<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:55.350> would<00:00:55.710> say

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
but you can also isolate I would say

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.680 
but you can also isolate I would say
four<00:00:56.160> distinct<00:00:56.579> parts<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.059> yeah<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.390> mean<00:00:57.629> I

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
four distinct parts of it yeah I mean I

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.689 
four distinct parts of it yeah I mean I
think<00:00:58.050> that's<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.590> big<00:00:58.800> challenge<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:59.399> us<00:00:59.430> but

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
think that's a big challenge for us but

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.670 
think that's a big challenge for us but
it's<00:00:59.820> also<00:00:59.969> after<00:01:00.570> doing<00:01:00.930> almost<00:01:01.170> 200

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
it's also after doing almost 200

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.349 
it's also after doing almost 200
episodes<00:01:01.770> it's<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.940> welcome

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
episodes it's like it's a welcome

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.750 
episodes it's like it's a welcome
challenge<00:01:03.600> because<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.470> know<00:01:04.610> we've<00:01:05.610> been

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
challenge because you know we've been

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.789 
challenge because you know we've been
doing<00:01:06.060> 11<00:01:06.390> minutes<00:01:06.630> shorts<00:01:06.900> for<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.350> long<00:01:07.560> and
