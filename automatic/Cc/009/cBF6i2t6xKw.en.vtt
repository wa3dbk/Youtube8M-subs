00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.050
 now from the opponent on the ces 2015 in las 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.000
 vegas we've been looking for it forever 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.679
 is probably a new smart watch from LG 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.500
 or jr 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.880
 with web os on it and with it all 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.900
 great and new editions eternally sought 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.330
 and now they have finally found 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.310
 namely, here at audi the novel kochanek 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.500
 She has a bracelet here from audi 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.640
 on his arm and the very special 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.859
 conditionally that does not just look 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.820
 new out but it also has nfc in it 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.949
 bracelet in it 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.780
 and why he explains us where now 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.780
 you do not see anything today 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.980
 why now this new watch why nfc what 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.480
 this is exactly what we say to each other 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.010
 audi we want new mobility 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.360
 support service in the future 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.710
 that means that the vehicle key 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.629
 should not be replaced but 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.820
 expanding and expanding means both 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.129
 smartphones as well as smart watchers 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.719
 So I want to support mine 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.320
 do not throw away the key and then 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.850
 is good one 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.140
 the customer decides itself that is 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.789
 we do not force the customer one 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.170
 technology but decides whether 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.059
 he is physical key today 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.270
 want to use or say in the future where 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.070
 he soon gets his smartphones a smartphone 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:11.939
 ok now here is an audi a7 in 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.229
 nice blue the thing to now i have 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.250
 just not my key with me 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.930
 do not have my smartphone now 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.369
 but only the clock what do I do 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.710
 the only thing I have to do is 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.540
 Just put the smart watch on the door handle 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.790
 receive 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.330
 The vehicle unlocks I climb 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.579
 an old it to the nfc interface in the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.720
 interior and start the vehicle that 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.820
 do not even present 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.759
 yes thank you so has the thing just there 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.850
 so ran into the center console and that 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.890
 thing is yes and you have no 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.619
 key with I have no key 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.360
 with me and the best or the biggest 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.619
 advantage 1 fcs it also works in the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.420
 switched off state 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.399
 that means if I now my phone 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.159
 I've played and the whole castle 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.420
 I have and the thing is all then I can 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.860
 still unlock it anyway 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.360
 Exactly I simulate is here now 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.670
 the smartphone was the same 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.270
 technology used i drive it now 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:08.360
 down and simulate that in the state 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.360
 device is off and moment 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.770
 right so that device off i stop 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.150
 for example, my vehicle in normal 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.260
 be worthy bluetooth low energy case 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.510
 I would have no possibility I 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.100
 become car , so to speak , care is 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.650
 the device loses its energy 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.640
 vehicle and I can still 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.230
 drive that's great 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.550
 I get out of my vehicle that 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.780
 means both the start and the 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.680
 Lock works perfectly 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.090
 but actually I could stop 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.770
 Showman key at home why 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.090
 he says should not be the 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.490
 key that as a key 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.320
 We also say that Mobi is replaced 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.650
 for some compliment you mean that 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.670
 with keyless entry ingo that is the one 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.350
 vehicle key for the vehicle 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.540
 no interaction i have mine 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.860
 but I have vehicle keys 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.690
 the problem that different 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.220
 vehicles during the week or day 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.900
 I would like to use this work 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.520
 I have to hand in my vehicle key 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.350
 and bring it back for me 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.820
 I just stop it 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.000
 still my smartphone as identity 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.230
 reger take all the information ahlmann 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.090
 digital key I get on one 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.140
 smartphone that is one of the advantages 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.420
 that means I can also several 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.070
 key on the chip april exactly me 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.510
 have up to eight up to date 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.610
 different vehicles at the same time 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.810
 use and the vehicle itself 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.300
 supports up to 16 different 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.500
 how do you secure your equipment? 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.180
 that's dangerous right now 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.290
 several keys now for all 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.430
 to make it available now 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.900
 exaggerated 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.880
 how do you assure yourself of that too? 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.620
 customer that's right we say in 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.900
 Security is an important topic to take 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.459
 privacy and use the so-called 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.450
 secure if you have the similar 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.700
 technology as in mobile payment 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.100
 range such as apple you with apple bay 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.050
 Introduces all sensitive data is not 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.459
 deposited on the application processor 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.070
 but a sure element 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:53.240
 sim card or that recognized in the budget 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.800
 And that is the anchor of trust for us 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.120
 in the device and that is the reason 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.790
 why is in the off state 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.870
 works so called many many 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.459
 thanks that was very interesting 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.170
 is nice to see what is happening right now 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.510
 the ces happens and, above all , what happens 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.300
 throughout the day the area works that way 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.080
 and that one already with a piece 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.780
 chip a car like an a7 can open 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.900
