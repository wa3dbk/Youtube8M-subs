good<00:01:37.140> delivery<00:01:37.650> but<00:01:37.980> i'm<00:01:38.100> afraid<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.520> finish

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
good delivery but i'm afraid the finish

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.170 
good delivery but i'm afraid the finish
wasn't<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:40.130> that's<00:01:41.130> wonderful<00:01:41.460> work<00:01:41.940> on

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
wasn't up to it that's wonderful work on

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.970 
wasn't up to it that's wonderful work on
the<00:01:42.300> flank<00:01:42.540> there<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.110> great<00:01:43.410> ball<00:01:43.680> in<00:01:43.950> I

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
the flank there and a great ball in I

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.480 
the flank there and a great ball in I
mean<00:01:44.160> this<00:01:44.400> could<00:01:44.670> prove<00:01:44.940> effective<00:01:45.300> for<00:01:45.690> them

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
mean this could prove effective for them

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.650 
mean this could prove effective for them
well<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.520> think<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.850> early<00:01:48.120> signs<00:01:48.390> have<00:01:48.630> been

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
well I think the early signs have been

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.420 
well I think the early signs have been
very<00:01:49.080> good<00:01:49.320> for<00:01:49.560> them<00:01:49.710> they've<00:01:49.830> already<00:01:50.010> got

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
very good for them they've already got

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.370 
very good for them they've already got
that<00:01:50.580> defense<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.210> settle<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.750> now<00:01:52.170> they've

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
that defense on settle and now they've

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.460 
that defense on settle and now they've
got<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.710> back<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.040> up<00:01:55.550> here's<00:01:56.550> a<00:01:56.640> chance<00:01:57.470> he

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
got to back it up here's a chance he

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.120 
got to back it up here's a chance he
decides<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.100> shoot
