00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
up in the middle in the top middle you

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:50.200 
up in the middle in the top middle you
will<00:00:39.210> be<00:00:39.450> able<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.930> cast<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:41.270> ultimate<00:00:42.270> attack

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:59.450 

so<00:00:51.210> we're<00:00:51.360> going<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.510> skip<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:58.460> your

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
so we're going to skip this your

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.880 
so we're going to skip this your
objective<00:01:00.090> here<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.570> to

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.220 

your<00:01:04.890> objective<00:01:05.550> here<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.150> get<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.960> energy

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:07.230 
your objective here is to get the energy

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:14.350 
your objective here is to get the energy
meter<00:01:07.770> up<00:01:08.070> high<00:01:08.660> to<00:01:09.660> maximum<00:01:10.230> if<00:01:10.380> possible<00:01:12.950> and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
you do that by tacking using your

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:51.429 
you do that by tacking using your
special<00:01:17.550> attack<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.480> forth

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.469

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.570 

all<00:02:15.590> right<00:02:15.770> we're<00:02:15.950> in<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.190> force<00:02:16.490> field

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
all right we're in the force field

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.800 
all right we're in the force field
they're<00:02:17.000> sucking<00:02:17.300> up<00:02:17.540> my<00:02:17.690> energy

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
they're sucking up my energy

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.140 
they're sucking up my energy
don't<00:02:20.810> lose<00:02:21.110> your<00:02:21.350> energy<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:22.490> is<00:02:22.760> very

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
don't lose your energy that is very

00:02:23.150 --> 00:03:15.210 
don't lose your energy that is very
important

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.130 

what

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.990 

all<00:03:21.140> right<00:03:21.319> so<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.680> more<00:03:21.950> special<00:03:22.640> attacks

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
all right so the more special attacks

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.750 
all right so the more special attacks
you<00:03:23.239> use<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:24.379> faster<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.129> bar<00:03:25.400> up<00:03:25.550> there

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
you use the the faster the bar up there

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.650 
you use the the faster the bar up there
goes<00:03:26.269> up<00:03:27.190> so<00:03:28.190> if<00:03:28.370> I<00:03:28.550> were<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:28.910> I<00:03:28.940> recommend

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
goes up so if I were you I recommend

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.070 
goes up so if I were you I recommend
using<00:03:30.170> your<00:03:30.379> special<00:03:31.190> attacks<00:03:31.760> more<00:03:32.569> often

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
using your special attacks more often

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.440 
using your special attacks more often

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
like these these attacks here these

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.619 
like these these attacks here these
energy<00:03:35.959> attacks<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:37.519> normal<00:03:38.030> attacks<00:03:38.360> like

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
energy attacks the normal attacks like

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.559 
energy attacks the normal attacks like
the<00:03:38.810> mean<00:03:39.019> the<00:03:39.980> physical<00:03:40.670> attack<00:03:41.209> doesn't

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
the mean the physical attack doesn't

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:51.540 
the mean the physical attack doesn't
work

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550
