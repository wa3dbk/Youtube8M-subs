00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
actually made pretty good power and went

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:32.380 
actually made pretty good power and went
pretty<00:01:15.350> fast<00:01:30.130> yeah<00:01:31.130> it's<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.429> fun<00:01:31.670> bike<00:01:31.909> I<00:01:32.240> mean

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
pretty fast yeah it's a fun bike I mean

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.300 
pretty fast yeah it's a fun bike I mean
it's<00:01:32.720> not<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:32.959> race<00:01:33.170> bike<00:01:33.470> so<00:01:33.679> you<00:01:33.740> can't<00:01:34.009> expect

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
it's not a race bike so you can't expect

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.380 
it's not a race bike so you can't expect
to<00:01:34.399> bring<00:01:34.549> that<00:01:34.729> thing<00:01:34.850> out<00:01:35.000> here<00:01:35.030> and<00:01:35.299> do

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
to bring that thing out here and do

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.389 
to bring that thing out here and do
races<00:01:35.780> although<00:01:36.080> no<00:01:36.590> you<00:01:36.649> could<00:01:37.009> if<00:01:37.369> you

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
races although no you could if you

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:40.600 
races although no you could if you
wanted<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:38.080> it<00:01:39.080> actually<00:01:39.619> runs<00:01:39.950> quite<00:01:40.399> well

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
wanted to it actually runs quite well

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.660 
wanted to it actually runs quite well
for<00:01:40.849> a<00:01:40.910> 250<00:01:41.479> and<00:01:41.770> you<00:01:42.770> know<00:01:42.890> against<00:01:43.550> its

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
for a 250 and you know against its

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.219 
for a 250 and you know against its
competition<00:01:44.119> it's<00:01:44.509> right<00:01:44.660> there<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:45.080> even

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
competition it's right there and even

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.350 
competition it's right there and even
though<00:01:45.440> it<00:01:45.619> is<00:01:45.800> a<00:01:45.950> smaller<00:01:46.429> displacement<00:01:46.849> bike

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
though it is a smaller displacement bike

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.270 
though it is a smaller displacement bike
makes<00:01:47.810> good<00:01:48.020> power<00:01:48.229> I<00:01:48.530> haven't<00:01:48.920> found<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.129> rev

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
makes good power I haven't found the rev

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.520 
makes good power I haven't found the rev
limiter<00:01:49.610> yet<00:01:49.849> so<00:01:50.149> you<00:01:50.209> can<00:01:50.420> kind<00:01:50.629> of<00:01:50.660> pin<00:01:51.319> it<00:01:51.440> up

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
limiter yet so you can kind of pin it up

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.580 
limiter yet so you can kind of pin it up
into<00:01:51.769> the<00:01:51.860> over<00:01:52.099> oven<00:01:52.489> and<00:01:52.849> it'll<00:01:53.060> still<00:01:53.330> pull

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
into the over oven and it'll still pull

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.990 
into the over oven and it'll still pull
handling<00:01:54.590> wise<00:01:54.739> is<00:01:54.950> pretty<00:01:55.190> nimble<00:01:55.399> coming

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
handling wise is pretty nimble coming

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.880 
handling wise is pretty nimble coming
into<00:01:56.149> turns<00:01:56.390> and<00:01:56.599> everything<00:01:56.989> the<00:01:57.709> big<00:01:57.860> thing

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
into turns and everything the big thing

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.229 
into turns and everything the big thing
it<00:01:58.190> doesn't<00:01:58.310> have<00:01:58.459> a<00:01:58.489> lot<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:58.670> weight<00:01:58.849> you're

00:01:59.229 --> 00:01:59.239 
it doesn't have a lot of weight you're

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:00.190 
it doesn't have a lot of weight you're
throwing<00:01:59.509> around<00:01:59.599> so<00:01:59.899> it<00:01:59.959> doesn't<00:02:00.140> really

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
throwing around so it doesn't really

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.960 
throwing around so it doesn't really
surprise<00:02:00.440> you<00:02:00.649> you<00:02:01.220> can<00:02:01.310> come<00:02:01.459> in<00:02:01.580> get<00:02:01.759> a<00:02:01.789> feel

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
surprise you you can come in get a feel

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.880 
surprise you you can come in get a feel
for<00:02:02.149> the<00:02:02.209> brakes<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:02.660> the<00:02:02.750> training<00:02:02.989> just

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
for the brakes and the training just

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.020 
for the brakes and the training just
kind<00:02:04.069> of<00:02:04.129> how<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.280> things<00:02:04.550> going<00:02:04.729> to<00:02:04.789> raft

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
kind of how the things going to raft

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.520 
kind of how the things going to raft
underneath<00:02:05.479> you<00:02:05.690> doesn't<00:02:06.019> do<00:02:06.110> anything<00:02:06.289> silly

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530

track which is perfect for a really
light<00:02:14.209> 250<00:02:14.750> like<00:02:14.900> this<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.680> tires<00:02:15.920> stuck<00:02:16.400> like

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
light 250 like this the tires stuck like

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.449 
light 250 like this the tires stuck like
glue<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:17.540> supermoto<00:02:18.170> has<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.470> much<00:02:19.010> larger

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
glue the supermoto has a much larger

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.149 
glue the supermoto has a much larger
more<00:02:19.640> powerful<00:02:19.700> front<00:02:20.420> brake<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.950> works

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
more powerful front brake and it works

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
eventually I got hip cramps so I had to

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.360 
eventually I got hip cramps so I had to
come<00:02:41.120> in<00:02:41.330> but<00:02:41.540> the<00:02:42.470> bike<00:02:42.680> was<00:02:42.829> willing<00:02:43.129> to<00:02:43.219> go

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370
