00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.379
 I call the people to continue giving the 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.400
 battle against the economic war of the 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:12.400

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:34.680
 announce first 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.670

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.829

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.520
 that were being used to 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.030
 plunder the little ones 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.830

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.329

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.969
 the shops in general 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.920

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.780
 looting of the owners of the centers 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.329

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.960
 the village 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:10.860
 also in that decree prohibits the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.100
 collection of purposes of any kind but 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.300
 even less the collection of purposes in 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.880

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:25.320
 and whoever did it has to return 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:29.900
 the money heard who made it has 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.900
 to return the money because it is illegal 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:36.750

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.690
 the owner of the shopping center 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.080
 for example 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:49.330
