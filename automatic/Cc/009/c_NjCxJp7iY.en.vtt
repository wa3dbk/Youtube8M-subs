one<00:02:17.940> thing<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.239> will<00:02:18.420> mention<00:02:18.480> now<00:02:18.959> is<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.230> fact

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
one thing I will mention now is the fact

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.050 
one thing I will mention now is the fact
that<00:02:19.590> camera<00:02:20.069> sticks<00:02:20.340> out<00:02:20.519> from<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.849> fact

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
that camera sticks out from the fact

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.210 
that camera sticks out from the fact
quite<00:02:21.360> far<00:02:21.660> opening<00:02:22.110> not<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.440> scratch<00:02:22.769> damage

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
quite far opening not to scratch damage

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.699 
quite far opening not to scratch damage
however<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.209> reason<00:02:24.510> for<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:25.019> so<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> s6

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
however the reason for this is so the s6

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.410 
however the reason for this is so the s6
can<00:02:25.920> house<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.190> bigger<00:02:26.550> sensor<00:02:27.060> therefore

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
can house a bigger sensor therefore

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.440 
can house a bigger sensor therefore
giving<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:27.900> much<00:02:28.080> clearer<00:02:28.440> sharper<00:02:28.769> photos
