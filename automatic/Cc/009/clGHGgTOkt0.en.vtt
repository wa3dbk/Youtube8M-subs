00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.410

 not for less than 100 thousand requests 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.600
 clear online 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.210
 almost everything we find in the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.610
 new expansion of wow we liked 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.130
 although clear the blizzard plan we 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.560
 it seems logical to attract blood 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.790
 new for something have happened again of 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.860
 the 10 million active accounts 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.150
 because those who have discovered come 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.940
 world of warcraft 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.010
 thanks to huston for example for that and 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.140
 because they have also cajoled us with 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.300
 many novelties just those that you 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.150
 we discussed the day before yesterday in engineers and 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.330
 now in the analysis of world of tráenos 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.700
 which returns the mma to its origins is 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.190
 it becomes a huge expansion both 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.440
 by quality as by content has a 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.810
 spectacular design a good plot 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.360
 carried hundreds of new missions 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.770
 objects 10 more levels to reach 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.450
 dungeon events you play a group wow 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.130
 of buyers of playstation vita ha 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.649
 got what they are and have them 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.630
 compensate for misleading advertising to 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.460
 less so I do taxes in the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.700
 federal commission of commerce in states 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.460
 it would 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.110
 and what is it all about? 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.750
 about the possibility of pausing 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.939
 the playstation 3 games since avoids 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.009
 an option that works in few titles 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.409
 but that initial advertising showed 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.810
 as something generalized besides neither 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.630
 explained the need to have a ps3 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.909
 as obvious as it may seem, although there 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.429
 something that we would have liked to see what 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.069
 use the 3g to play online we go that 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.920
 the advertising ones threw the pisto and 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:56.319
 now you only have to pay between 25 and 50 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.090
 dollars to those who bought life in the USA 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:03.159
 before June 1, 2012 in a 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.890
 Recent interview for mcv the 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.259
 responsible for designing xbox one has 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.660
 talked about sizes yes friends we have 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.510
 received complaints about this matter and 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.640
 we wanted answers because the solution 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.329
 It will take time to arrive but for now it is 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.700
 waths up 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:21.040
 well the good of cat ledbetter has 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.260
 affirmed that everything is due to a rise 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.590
 in terms of processor requirements 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.480
 We are going to consume a lot and need 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.860
 dissipate heat from there that almost a quarter 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.570
 Console is 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.000
 dedicated to cooling components 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.310
 internal and more than half to leave room 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.860
 so that the air runs from there that the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.490
 power supply is out but 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.930
 in general 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.420
 ledbetter asks users to 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.940
 try xbox one and assess if it deserves 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.720
 worth sacrificing site next to the TV 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.670
 in exchange for many hours of fun 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.680
 crew that car game that we've 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.990
 played many hours and still has not 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.510
 come out that experience that is enjoyed 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.209
 online especially but we 'll have to 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.430
 leave for next Monday because it is 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.530

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.390
 that allowed us to go through states 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.620
 united from coast to coast and if we have a 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.140

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.300

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.040
 you have an opinion already formed by that 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.709
 we do not care because we will be 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.600
 asphalt the mud the pastures and that tree 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.700
 that always gets ahead after 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.550
