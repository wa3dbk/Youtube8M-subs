 milk and 200 g of crushed biscuit I 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.930
 start by preparing the base of my 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.920
 check in the salad bowl 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.920
 I put my speculoos my melted butter 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:51.329
 and I mixed so I prepared a 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.500
 plate on which I put a paper 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.719
 cooking and there I drop my circle and I 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.719
 pour my preparation indoors 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.720
 I spread my break especially the bottom 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.410
 of my circle and with my glass where there 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.930
 had the melted butter 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.470
 I will come so hurry to equalize 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.470
 my surface 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.560
 we make sure that all the holes are well 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.230
 blocked and aumessas about fifteen 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.430
 minutes in the fridge 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.500
 go on we move on following the race is 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.500
 then in my bowl I put my chocolate 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:47.180
 and I put some of my caramel and 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.330
 we bring all that heated to the microphone 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.100
 waves about 50 seconds 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.340
 I put the cheese spread in the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.340
 bowl 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:11.530
 I pour my liquid cream so 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.530
 preferably very cold 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:28.370
 and I put the remaining caramel man a 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:31.019
 caramel purchased commercially 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.769
 I must be to get a mix 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.769
 very creamy 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:46.920
 ag whipping about 30 seconds 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:48.930
 then good chocolate and mont carmel 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.620
 north are well melted i'm going to them 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.890
 gently incorporate so a good 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.099
 previous mix so with a whip I 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.099
 mixed 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:11.220
 make sure that the chocolate and the 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:16.650
 caramel is not too hot and I 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:19.610
 continue to mix then now 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.630
 with maryse i'll get to the bottom 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:28.769
 to be sure everything is fine 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:31.049
 mix the speculoos so well I well 3 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:35.250
 so I'll be able to pay all my 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:39.319
 indoor preparation there we have 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.319
 really read our super wahou textures 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:49.609
 now with my spatula 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.609
 I will come and equalize the surface 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.560
 now I put my cheese cake at 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:00.540
 fridge for about an hour we go 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.470
 move to the demolding of the cheesecake 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:08.599
 so here I planned so a blowtorch and 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.599
 I will pass it around my circle 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:16.949
 because if you do not have a torch this 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.590
 that you can do is take a 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:22.800
 clean sponge has you underwater 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.190
 very hot and you have not it is the same 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.919
 around your circle you spent it 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.620
 many times and you will not have to 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:37.160
 have a problem with demolding 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.160
 so I gently remove the circle 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.710
 and there we really have a super nice 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.610
 result 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:50.419
 a nice risk and that choko caramel 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.320
 I think I'll feast with that 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:56.780
 then we go to cutting 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.780
 so I'm grabbing my knife 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:26.960
 and we're going to cut a nice part I think 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:31.840
 to wipe my knife and I drop a 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:34.540
 part of the cheesecake on my plate 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.500
 so I show you the loan texture 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:43.730
 did really indicate that very creamy 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:46.420
 a very beautiful texture really does have a 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.420
 very very beautiful result 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:56.620
 so we're going to taste that so I show the 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.620
 close texture 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.600
 we have a good taste of chocolate and 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.900
 caramel 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:08.330
 we have a crispy side brought by 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.980
 the speculoos you are really going to be 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.150
 surprised 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.070
 that's where the cheesecake recipe is 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.690
 finished I'm counting on you for their 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.470
 to do at home and I tell you to very 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.470
