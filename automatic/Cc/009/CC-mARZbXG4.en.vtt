00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
on I really said I highly suggest at

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.840 
on I really said I highly suggest at
least<00:00:36.630> turn<00:00:37.500> health<00:00:37.800> all<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> way<00:00:38.370> up<00:00:38.399> because

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
least turn health all the way up because

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.430 
least turn health all the way up because
uh<00:00:39.860> we<00:00:40.860> tend<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.550> blow<00:00:41.790> each<00:00:41.969> other<00:00:42.149> up<00:00:42.300> now<00:00:43.230> on

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
uh we tend to blow each other up now on

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.020 
uh we tend to blow each other up now on
what<00:00:43.710> you're<00:00:43.829> seeing<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> process<00:00:44.730> it's

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
what you're seeing is the process it's

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.360 
what you're seeing is the process it's
pretty<00:00:45.420> self-explanatory<00:00:45.860> you<00:00:46.860> charge<00:00:47.160> up

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
pretty self-explanatory you charge up

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.729 
pretty self-explanatory you charge up
you<00:00:47.610> throw<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.969> grenade<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.989> then<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.469> sent

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
you throw the grenade and then you sent

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.290 
you throw the grenade and then you sent
it<00:00:49.829> off<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.129> other<00:00:50.309> guy<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:51.030> reason<00:00:51.239> you

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
it off to the other guy the reason you

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.639 
it off to the other guy the reason you
do<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.600> because<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.199> fuse<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
do this is because the fuse of the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.209 
do this is because the fuse of the
grenades<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.129> about<00:00:53.370> four<00:00:53.670> seconds<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.590> if

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
grenades is about four seconds so if

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.310 
grenades is about four seconds so if
they're<00:00:56.940> not<00:00:57.120> passed<00:00:57.480> off<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.840> four<00:00:57.989> seconds

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
they're not passed off in four seconds

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.410 
they're not passed off in four seconds
they<00:00:58.469> all<00:00:58.559> blow<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.910> can't<00:01:00.090> stack

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
they all blow up and so you can't stack

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.290 
they all blow up and so you can't stack
them<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:02.100> goal<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.609> get<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.850> 20

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
them and the goal is to get to 20

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.270 
them and the goal is to get to 20
because<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.719> can<00:01:03.870> stack<00:01:04.110> up<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.500> 20<00:01:04.890> grenades

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
because you can stack up to 20 grenades

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.090 
because you can stack up to 20 grenades
in<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:06.479> one<00:01:06.869> ages<00:01:07.200> device<00:01:07.439> because<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.950> can

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
in a one ages device because you can

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.219 
in a one ages device because you can
stack<00:01:08.280> up<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.490> 20<00:01:08.729> bullets<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.869> doesn't<00:01:10.140> work

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
stack up to 20 bullets it doesn't work

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.350 
stack up to 20 bullets it doesn't work
with<00:01:10.500> small<00:01:11.040> rockets<00:01:11.670> because<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:12.150> soon<00:01:12.240> as

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
with small rockets because as soon as

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.000 
with small rockets because as soon as
you<00:01:12.450> pass<00:01:12.600> them<00:01:12.840> they<00:01:13.049> turned<00:01:13.439> into<00:01:13.799> little

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
you pass them they turned into little

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.890 
you pass them they turned into little
purple<00:01:14.490> shots<00:01:14.700> or<00:01:14.909> something<00:01:14.939> they<00:01:15.659> still
