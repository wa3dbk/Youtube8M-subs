00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.879
 Hello everyone, Swami, I am today with my 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.769
 friend play concrete guests mini as 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:19.099
 Hello to all 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.800
 Westlake is the Snake is generally a game 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:25.849
 mini- game on the kind of like new and not before 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.150
 saw and then you just need to run a sheep 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.650
 even a few options which 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.010
 stretched into such a long snake again 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:38.079
 come back and you can't bump purple 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.989
 other media yak it turns out and then 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.870
 crashed into pink and lost water here 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.879
 very quickly the rounds occur therefore 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.239
 we will write about five rounds 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:53.510
 and in the end there are a few small 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.120
 huge snakes that are already 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.180
 sometimes they fight there for a long time 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.110
 sometimes you learn quickly to us 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.149
 the game is very fast interesting by the way 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.820
 if someone else did not understand this server 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:14.210
 mineplex dot com when starting the server 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:19.209
 in the description everyone can play but who 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:22.429
 there is a skin license 

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:24.859
 he can do something simple but rather 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.100
 In total there I am right now , the mod is installed on ps 

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:27.469
 but 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:35.859
 shows what things have recently been used 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:38.270
 Calf before the start of the railing 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:40.539
 pressing f5 by the way is very convenient to play 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.940
 see who is next to you 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:46.800
 so area 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.800
 now i will say to the colors don't you dare 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.950
 turquoise still not worth the damn clubs here 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.740
 very hard to risk and embed 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:01.350
 and damn damn here is the free space I 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.540
 look here look how the words play 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.200
 you are on the edge of the principle of two 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.040
 survivors 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:18.970
 I think I hope him right now somehow 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:22.300
 let me hit myself a couple 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:31.150
 then we can win it 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:32.260
 won so well oh well here I am 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.630
 would still like to try 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.060
 super steak but on ultra it is generally 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:42.340
 set even gems can not be so here 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.680
 so well, yes on what we are not going to play 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.110
 Donat minekravt to the north is like that 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:53.350
 archway on samaine kraft is the norm 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.870
 server of course for the sake of these games you do 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.820
 did not sting and fall down 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.820
 someone wrote their genes 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.970
 you have different maps as we had only 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.129
 two cards total 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.629
 apparently on this game and the card is my group 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:15.780
 It gave only yesterday so today as well 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:18.239
 I can not be immediately died well and 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.360
 dark green sheep and I'm looking for you 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:25.410
 I still found it neatly fun there 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:29.280
 them handsome left as it is 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.819
 not much and compared to its size 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:39.900
 not important 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:47.060
 and he done handsome handsome my most snake 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:49.890
 the best is the sheep and this is the best 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.030
 it was just a good color for me 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.579
 there were two murders 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.609
 how many rams of an evening gems for victory 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.890
 gave more for something cool would be if 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.670
 you can choose their color and do not know 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.410
 there is one yellow lonely 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.829
 where you could immediately know who 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:11.609
 what color is my 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:14.609
 while I jump over water there fun 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:17.639
 occupation here still on the server is some 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.769
 very strange complex parkour for the war 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.720
 which give 1000 gems but which are very 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.660
 difficult to go yes there it is impossible 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.760
 stop perfect but some 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:45.980
 certain moments 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:52.010
 can i kill you yes yes my gift to you 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.940
 He presented you with gems Yes , I have a lot of them 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.310
 basis left two 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.400
 it seems a and today in the hole undercut him 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.320
 there is no this I hit him well damn I 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.530
 it is so almost cut the second better 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.020
 the place is cool and what card do you think 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.240
 it seems better to me this here with weed 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.720
 it is more suitable for sheep but 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.720
 we are snakes 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:19.670
 we don't know sheep 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:26.030
 card doctor how more I like to be 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:28.219
 In general, where the grass and in the meantime can 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:33.839
 jump down 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:42.239
 I have not been to the house yet I was not there I did not 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:49.019
 be in other people's homes and I fell all 

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:51.209
 where again is a gray card like I already 

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:54.809
 confused how many we are four rounds 4 

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:59.879
 diode, and we were on the cards like 2 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:06:03.509
 zhidam this as I already here and I, too, seems 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:06.089
 you were the center and maybe each other 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:08.309
 dunk well as not this i did three 

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:11.459
 there are three kilos every time 

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:16.050
 four kilos even if my ax is always 

00:06:11.459 --> 00:06:19.919
 ate ridiculous of course if you are a business of omsk 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:22.879
 I saw snakes as if like a loop 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:28.469
 pass themselves through themselves and does not die 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:30.989
 lags lags all things choose a career 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:31.610
 old without knowing lesika case choose 

00:06:30.989 --> 00:06:35.159
 position 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:40.819
 you last round hope you 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:45.839
 I liked it like a toy skin review it 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:49.429
 waffle look here dad run and he 

00:06:45.839 --> 00:06:49.429
 jumped no 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:07:01.380
 points the most beautiful goal 

00:06:53.729 --> 00:07:03.030
 forget about my originality then we 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.280
 it seems like cards alternate here 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.560
 to easily get into this mode you need 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:12.330
 just go to the portal peasant 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:15.360
 the portal bar is in the lobby right up to 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:27.919
 this is hardcore and i'm dead i'm there windows 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:31.440
 spit I'm like we have three left 

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:37.250
 But I see you let him on the other 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:42.150
 sides there look newton and 

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:46.260
