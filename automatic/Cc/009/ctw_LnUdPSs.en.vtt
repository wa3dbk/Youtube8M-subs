year for the concours event at the BBG
the<00:00:29.519> question<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.000> have<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.420> as<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.810> can<00:00:30.990> see

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the question I have is as you can see

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.639 
the question I have is as you can see
here<00:00:31.880> the<00:00:32.880> butterfly<00:00:33.360> valve<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.899> partially

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
here the butterfly valve is partially

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.150 
here the butterfly valve is partially
closed<00:00:35.070> if<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:36.480> push<00:00:36.780> down<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.800> linkage

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
closed if you push down on the linkage

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.690 
closed if you push down on the linkage
it<00:00:39.059> opens<00:00:39.480> up<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.469> problem<00:00:40.920> with<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.430> thing

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
it opens up the problem with this thing

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.540 
it opens up the problem with this thing
is<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.390> secondaries<00:00:43.140> are<00:00:43.410> not<00:00:43.800> opening

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
is that the secondaries are not opening

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.940 
is that the secondaries are not opening
up<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.360> configuration<00:00:46.110> as<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.620> see<00:00:46.829> it

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
up in that configuration as you see it

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.720 
up in that configuration as you see it
again<00:00:47.670> push<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.570> linkage<00:00:48.870> forward<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.730> the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
again push the linkage forward and the

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.330 
again push the linkage forward and the
secondaries<00:00:51.449> work<00:00:51.840> fine<00:00:52.320> there's<00:00:53.070> no

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
secondaries work fine there's no

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.150 
secondaries work fine there's no
performance<00:00:53.820> issues<00:00:54.390> now<00:00:55.079> down<00:00:55.320> here<00:00:55.350> I've

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
performance issues now down here I've

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.740 
performance issues now down here I've
got<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> choke<00:00:56.670> pull<00:00:56.940> off<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.480> just

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
got a choke pull off that I just

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.770 
got a choke pull off that I just
replaced<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> metal<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:59.359> and<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.600> works

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
replaced with a metal one and it works

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.860 
replaced with a metal one and it works
fine<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.710> also<00:01:01.949> are<00:01:02.820> also<00:01:03.120> over<00:01:03.480> here<00:01:03.719> this

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
fine this also are also over here this

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.090 
fine this also are also over here this
choke<00:01:04.229> pull<00:01:04.589> off<00:01:05.180> is<00:01:06.260> also<00:01:07.260> working<00:01:07.470> properly

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
choke pull off is also working properly

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.300 
choke pull off is also working properly
so<00:01:08.580> essentially<00:01:09.510> I've<00:01:09.630> got<00:01:09.890> that<00:01:10.890> all<00:01:11.100> covered

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
so essentially I've got that all covered

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.190 
so essentially I've got that all covered
everything<00:01:11.850> seems<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.210> work<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:14.840> heat<00:01:15.840> spring

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
everything seems to work the heat spring

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.850 
everything seems to work the heat spring
down<00:01:16.409> here<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.920> all<00:01:17.220> factory<00:01:17.640> correct<00:01:18.000> and

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
down here is all factory correct and

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.070 
down here is all factory correct and
there's<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.920> bar<00:01:20.159> coming<00:01:20.549> up<00:01:20.670> out<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.119> now<00:01:21.689> I

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
there's a bar coming up out of it now I

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.200 
there's a bar coming up out of it now I
was<00:01:22.530> told<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.860> bend<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.280> bar<00:01:23.610> but<00:01:24.180> that

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
was told to bend this bar but that

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.060 
was told to bend this bar but that
doesn't<00:01:24.720> make<00:01:24.840> sense<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.229> me<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.830> does<00:01:26.040> not

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
doesn't make sense to me that does not

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.929 
doesn't make sense to me that does not
make<00:01:26.400> sense

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
make sense

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.270 
make sense
the<00:01:27.420> bar<00:01:27.990> goes<00:01:28.229> into<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> standard<00:01:29.070> hole

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the bar goes into a standard hole

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.429 
the bar goes into a standard hole
there's<00:01:29.549> another<00:01:29.759> hole<00:01:30.000> with<00:01:30.180> an<00:01:30.299> alt<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
there's another hole with an alt the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.960 
there's another hole with an alt the
next<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.159> don't<00:01:32.400> know<00:01:32.640> if<00:01:32.790> that's

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
next to it I don't know if that's

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.980 
next to it I don't know if that's
correct<00:01:33.540> I'm<00:01:33.720> assuming<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:35.689> but<00:01:36.689> yet<00:01:36.840> I've

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
correct I'm assuming it is but yet I've

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.929 
correct I'm assuming it is but yet I've
got<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.530> try<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.740> figure<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.070> out<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.280> I'm

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
got to try to figure it out so I'm

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.390 
got to try to figure it out so I'm
asking<00:01:39.420> if<00:01:40.409> anybody<00:01:40.650> out<00:01:41.009> there<00:01:41.040> has<00:01:41.369> any

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
asking if anybody out there has any

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.810 
asking if anybody out there has any
experience<00:01:41.729> in<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.740> again<00:01:43.740> right<00:01:44.520> now<00:01:44.700> in

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
experience in this again right now in

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.789 
experience in this again right now in
that<00:01:44.939> configuration<00:01:45.590> secondaries<00:01:46.590> don't

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
that configuration secondaries don't

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.510 
that configuration secondaries don't
open<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.880> doesn't<00:01:48.210> run<00:01:48.329> as<00:01:48.479> well<00:01:49.280> with<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
open and it doesn't run as well with the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.609 
open and it doesn't run as well with the
linkage<00:01:51.180> pushed<00:01:51.479> forward<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:52.049> works<00:01:52.290> fine

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
linkage pushed forward it works fine

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.289 
linkage pushed forward it works fine
secondaries<00:01:53.340> open<00:01:53.640> up<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.990> choke<00:01:56.030> fast<00:01:57.030> idle

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
secondaries open up the choke fast idle

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.899 
secondaries open up the choke fast idle
choke<00:01:57.630> works<00:01:57.899> fine<00:01:58.140> when<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.350> start<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.770> up<00:01:58.920> when

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
choke works fine when I start it up when

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.719 
choke works fine when I start it up when
I<00:01:59.939> kick<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.960> little<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:02.009> choke<00:02:02.250> goes<00:02:02.460> down

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
I kick it a little the choke goes down

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.069 
I kick it a little the choke goes down
and<00:02:02.969> everything<00:02:03.210> seems<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.540> be<00:02:03.630> fine<00:02:03.869> but

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
and everything seems to be fine but

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.429 
and everything seems to be fine but
again<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:05.180> issue<00:02:06.180> right<00:02:06.570> there<00:02:06.840> with<00:02:07.200> the

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
again that issue right there with the

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.229 
again that issue right there with the
secondaries<00:02:08.160> not<00:02:08.310> opening<00:02:08.670> up<00:02:08.849> is<00:02:09.000> what's

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
secondaries not opening up is what's

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:09.919 
secondaries not opening up is what's
what's

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
what's

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.649 
what's
hindering<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.409> performance<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.099> this<00:02:11.219> thing

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:11.659 
hindering the performance of this thing

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:16.519
