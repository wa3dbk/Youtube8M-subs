hi<00:00:00.539> youtubers<00:00:01.250> look<00:00:02.250> at<00:00:02.340> these<00:00:02.490> solar<00:00:03.240> lights

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
hi youtubers look at these solar lights

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.160 
hi youtubers look at these solar lights
we<00:00:03.720> all<00:00:03.929> got<00:00:04.170> them<00:00:04.819> you've<00:00:05.819> got<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.089> up<00:00:06.210> tripod

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
we all got them you've got the up tripod

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.600 
we all got them you've got the up tripod
one<00:00:07.410> of<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.649> lighting<00:00:07.950> software<00:00:08.340> after<00:00:08.429> a

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
one of the lighting software after a

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.000 
one of the lighting software after a
string<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.179> Lights<00:00:09.420> here<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.380> they<00:00:10.740> weren't

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
string of Lights here and they weren't

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.480 
string of Lights here and they weren't
working<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.940> all<00:00:12.170> acting<00:00:13.170> nothing<00:00:13.950> going<00:00:14.309> to

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
working and all acting nothing going to

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.609 
working and all acting nothing going to
have<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.330> look<00:00:15.420> at<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.780> see<00:00:15.900> what's<00:00:16.170> gone

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
have a look at it and see what's gone

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.880 
have a look at it and see what's gone
wrong<00:00:17.420> usually<00:00:18.420> can<00:00:18.810> be<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.320> battery<00:00:19.710> we're

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
wrong usually can be the battery we're

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.710 
wrong usually can be the battery we're
gonna<00:00:20.010> have<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.220> look<00:00:20.369> at<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:20.580> first<00:00:20.910> or<00:00:21.539> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
gonna have a look at that first or the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.330 
gonna have a look at that first or the
charge<00:00:21.990> there'll<00:00:22.560> be<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.680> couple<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:23.039> screws<00:00:23.279> in

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
charge there'll be a couple of screws in

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.450 
charge there'll be a couple of screws in
here<00:00:23.960> and<00:00:24.960> there'll<00:00:25.529> be<00:00:25.560> down<00:00:25.859> inside<00:00:26.250> these

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
here and there'll be down inside these

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.150 
here and there'll be down inside these
holes<00:00:26.760> here<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.500> see<00:00:28.740> if<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:28.980> put<00:00:29.130> a

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
holes here and you can see if I put a

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.550 
holes here and you can see if I put a
screwdriver<00:00:29.490> in<00:00:29.910> we<00:00:30.119> can<00:00:30.300> get<00:00:30.420> these<00:00:30.599> out<00:00:30.869> so

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
screwdriver in we can get these out so

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.880 
screwdriver in we can get these out so
we're<00:00:31.830> not<00:00:31.920> doing<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.340> first<00:00:32.640> off<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:35.780> see

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
we're not doing this first off and see

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:44.479 
we're not doing this first off and see
my<00:00:37.890> chick<00:00:39.860> and<00:00:41.750> mrs.<00:00:42.750> rora<00:00:43.260> design<00:00:44.160> look<00:00:44.399> at

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
my chick and mrs. rora design look at

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.720 
my chick and mrs. rora design look at
this<00:00:45.200> obviously<00:00:46.200> someone's<00:00:47.039> tried<00:00:47.280> putting<00:00:47.550> a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
this obviously someone's tried putting a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.240 
this obviously someone's tried putting a
rechargeable<00:00:48.329> battery<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.809> there<00:00:49.100> and<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
rechargeable battery in there and the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.490 
rechargeable battery in there and the
connections<00:00:50.730> ever<00:00:50.910> made<00:00:51.180> up<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.289> come

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
connections ever made up so it's come

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.830 
connections ever made up so it's come
away<00:00:52.739> yeah<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.730> there's<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.000> problem<00:00:54.360> straight

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
away yeah so there's a problem straight

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.500 
away yeah so there's a problem straight
away<00:00:55.079> with<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.320> one<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.680> lot<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.340> times<00:00:56.579> well

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
away with that one a lot of times well

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.810 
away with that one a lot of times well
it's<00:00:57.780> worth<00:00:57.989> replacing<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.190> battery<00:00:59.579> in

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
it's worth replacing the battery in

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.540 
it's worth replacing the battery in
these<00:01:00.120> things<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:00.840> trying<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.500> if<00:01:02.370> it

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
these things and just trying it if it

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.109 
these things and just trying it if it
doesn't<00:01:02.879> go<00:01:03.739> fly<00:01:04.739> away<00:01:05.070> basically<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.970> means

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
doesn't go fly away basically it means

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.120 
doesn't go fly away basically it means
he<00:01:06.270> isn't<00:01:06.420> charging<00:01:06.840> also<00:01:07.740> if<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:07.950> put<00:01:08.100> a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
he isn't charging also if you put a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.010 
he isn't charging also if you put a
battery<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.210> light<00:01:09.390> comes<00:01:09.689> straight

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
battery in and the light comes straight

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.550 
battery in and the light comes straight
on<00:01:10.520> and<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.909> whether<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.420> daylight<00:01:12.900> or

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
on and it's on whether it's daylight or

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.920 
on and it's on whether it's daylight or
whatever<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.430> means<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.909> circuit<00:01:15.360> board<00:01:15.600> that

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
whatever it means the circuit board that

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.690 
whatever it means the circuit board that
little<00:01:16.650> circuit<00:01:17.040> board<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.430> there<00:01:17.580> is

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
little circuit board in there is

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.390 
little circuit board in there is
probably<00:01:18.030> gone<00:01:18.450> up<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.439> wall<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:20.159> one's

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
probably gone up the wall this one's

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.770 
probably gone up the wall this one's
being<00:01:20.610> chewed<00:01:20.939> someone's<00:01:21.420> done<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> little

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
being chewed someone's done a little

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.179 
being chewed someone's done a little
cheat<00:01:22.140> on<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.650> tried<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.890> make

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
cheat on this and tried to make

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.100 
cheat on this and tried to make
connections<00:01:23.790> from<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.090> battery<00:01:24.900> like<00:01:25.080> that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
connections from a battery like that

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.740 
connections from a battery like that
which<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.650> thought<00:01:25.890> she<00:01:26.040> hasn't<00:01:26.220> worked<00:01:26.750> very

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
which I thought she hasn't worked very

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.690 
which I thought she hasn't worked very
cheap<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.140> nasty<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:29.189> if<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.400> want<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> new

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
cheap and nasty but if you want a new

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.490 
cheap and nasty but if you want a new
battery<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.119> recharge<00:01:31.020> were<00:01:31.200> already

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
battery in recharge were already

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.789 
battery in recharge were already
recharged<00:01:32.420> connected<00:01:33.420> up<00:01:33.540> I'll<00:01:34.470> put<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.710> in

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
recharged connected up I'll put it in

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.069 
recharged connected up I'll put it in
this<00:01:35.009> holder<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:35.970> find<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> light<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.900> on

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
this holder and you find the light is on

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.450 
this holder and you find the light is on
whether<00:01:38.009> you've<00:01:38.250> covered<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:39.360> sensor<00:01:39.840> or<00:01:39.990> not

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
whether you've covered the sensor or not

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.920 
whether you've covered the sensor or not
then<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.640> boards<00:01:41.970> go<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.329> circuit<00:01:42.750> board

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
then the boards go on the circuit board

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.990 
then the boards go on the circuit board
and<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.259> chuck<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.619> away<00:01:43.680> if<00:01:44.460> when<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.820> put<00:01:44.970> a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
and just chuck it away if when you put a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.370 
and just chuck it away if when you put a
new<00:01:45.149> battery<00:01:45.390> make<00:01:45.930> sure<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.200> already

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
new battery make sure it's already

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.800 
new battery make sure it's already
charged<00:01:46.890> put<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.189> in<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.970> if<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.270> works<00:01:48.479> by

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
charged put it in and if it works by

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.590 
charged put it in and if it works by
putting<00:01:49.110> your<00:01:49.200> hand<00:01:49.470> over<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.159> sensor<00:01:50.729> if<00:01:51.450> you

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
putting your hand over the sensor if you

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.510 
putting your hand over the sensor if you
put<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.869> over<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.340> light

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
put it over like that and the light

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.780 
put it over like that and the light
comes<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:54.110> you<00:01:55.110> know<00:01:55.290> that's<00:01:55.979> that's<00:01:56.579> all

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
comes on you know that's that's all

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.450 
comes on you know that's that's all
these<00:01:57.350> probably<00:01:58.350> ones<00:01:58.500> maybe<00:01:58.799> changing<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.399> a

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
these probably ones maybe changing to a

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.830 
these probably ones maybe changing to a
better<00:01:59.670> position<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.360> allow<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:02.840> solar

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
better position to allow the the solar

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.410 
better position to allow the the solar
to<00:02:04.350> go<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.979> allow<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.189> Sun<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.820> give<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.240> bit

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
to go in to allow the Sun to give a bit

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.109 
to go in to allow the Sun to give a bit
more<00:02:06.450> poke<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.170> charge<00:02:07.710> up<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.220> run<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.610> was

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
more poke and charge up and run I was

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.479 
more poke and charge up and run I was
amazing<00:02:09.360> that's<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.869> there<00:02:10.800> were<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.099> bit<00:02:11.400> of

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
amazing that's it there were a bit of

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.280 
amazing that's it there were a bit of
much<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.879> masses<00:02:12.239> like<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.629> essences<00:02:12.989> do

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
much the masses like the essences do

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.580 
much the masses like the essences do
types<00:02:13.620> different<00:02:14.069> sources<00:02:14.519> standalone<00:02:15.120> ones

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
types different sources standalone ones

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.050

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
but all of them just taken to bits just

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.720 
but all of them just taken to bits just
take<00:02:18.299> the<00:02:18.420> screws<00:02:18.659> ever<00:02:19.170> look<00:02:19.379> and<00:02:19.680> just<00:02:20.430> do

take the screws ever look and just do
those<00:02:20.909> simple<00:02:21.150> tests<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:21.659> I've<00:02:21.780> just<00:02:21.959> told

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200
