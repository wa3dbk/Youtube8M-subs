00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
 road 

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:09.180
 he protected himself from the right hand of 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.180
 canelo and the canelo 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.620
 and all the right glove of the portion 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.780
 right of the face trying to 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:25.449
 protect yourself from the left record of 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:27.400
 south of where both were respected and 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.369
 there is a before and after doctor 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.680
 infinity sector without a doubt after 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.340
 that canelo sends to the canvas has 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.980
 optimized because when you connect it and what 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.020
 sends to the floor when the 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.700
 American begins to exchange 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.469
 hits with the Mexican changes 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.809
 radically his strategy the 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.030
 intelligence 25 he had shown in 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.980
 previous bouts he forgets and entered 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.170
 in the mexican game that undoubtedly 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.390
 I was happy to exchange blows 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.160
 with the slow stable he raffled it like 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.680
 brave to the center and know that doctor 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.960
 as a retinue 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.370
 right from austin ground sending the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.370
 canvas so he took it off 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.220
 well because everything is a difficult fighter 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.530
 what 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.580
 more difficult because when it hits it goes 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.140
 for more back more try to defend yourself 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.030
 left-handed when they attack you obviously 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.920
 it's more difficult because it already attacks you from the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.870
 another guard that you 're not used to 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.340
 but we plan to say a fight 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.950
 difficult we knew we had to be 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.210
 smarter faster and not 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.100
 letting us hit was a strategy that did not 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.990
 you will take off the glove of the right hand 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.320
 to neutralize the left and because 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.150
 he throws a blowout of strong left-handed me 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.520
 I think he's the strongest he has and I 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.050
 I think with the hand up then never 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.730
 I was going to grab and feared feared 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.960
 to kiss me in the flesh that saul beat of 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.660
 the fights you've had like 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.220
 professional today that there was 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.520
 difference 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.740
 Well obviously always it is always 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.000
 different in rival not always different 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.069
 from the center of your employer that 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.530
 It complicated the fight a lot 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.599
 a tough left-handed fighter because there's 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.840
 left-handed fighters who have the same 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.370
 style almost that of right not then 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.439
 this is a left-handed fighter who is more 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.590
 on the harder side and I learned many 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.590
 things
