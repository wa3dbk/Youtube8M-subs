that if you if I Oh Stan run straight

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.740 
that if you if I Oh Stan run straight
forward<00:02:41.100> I<00:02:41.250> would<00:02:41.310> have<00:02:41.880> made<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.239> because<00:02:42.630> you

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
forward I would have made it because you

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.479 
forward I would have made it because you
see<00:02:42.930> it's<00:02:43.140> two<00:02:43.590> seconds<00:02:44.130> from<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.180> next<00:02:45.720> star

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
see it's two seconds from the next star

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.500
