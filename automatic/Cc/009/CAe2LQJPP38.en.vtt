00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.440 
but some people thought this should be
called<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.950> blackjack<00:02:23.519> three<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:23.970> now<00:02:24.390> we

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
called the blackjack three and now we

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.800 
called the blackjack three and now we
have<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.670> propel<00:02:26.670> Pro<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.180> all<00:02:27.360> these<00:02:27.569> devices

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
have the propel Pro so all these devices

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.229 
have the propel Pro so all these devices
together<00:02:28.140> are<00:02:28.500> similar<00:02:28.950> form<00:02:29.280> factor<00:02:29.760> where

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
together are similar form factor where

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.690 
together are similar form factor where
there's<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.510> keyboard<00:02:30.690> out<00:02:30.959> in<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.140> front<00:02:31.410> but

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
there's a keyboard out in the front but

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.830 
there's a keyboard out in the front but
Samsung<00:02:32.700> actually<00:02:32.970> changed<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.390> keyboard

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
Samsung actually changed the keyboard

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.809 
Samsung actually changed the keyboard
for<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.019> propelled<00:02:34.379> Pro<00:02:34.560> it's<00:02:34.739> no<00:02:34.920> longer<00:02:35.190> the

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
for the propelled Pro it's no longer the

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.369 
for the propelled Pro it's no longer the
keyboard<00:02:36.299> where<00:02:36.540> there<00:02:36.780> are<00:02:36.930> these<00:02:37.110> big

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
keyboard where there are these big

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.440 
keyboard where there are these big
spaces<00:02:37.680> between<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.160> buttons<00:02:38.459> now<00:02:38.700> we<00:02:39.060> have

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
spaces between the buttons now we have

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.830 
spaces between the buttons now we have
kind<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.379> more<00:02:40.980> motorola<00:02:41.790> q9h<00:02:42.510> like

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
kind of a more motorola q9h like

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.500 
kind of a more motorola q9h like
keyboard<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.470> remember<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.430> q9h<00:02:44.940> looks<00:02:45.360> like

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
keyboard and remember the q9h looks like

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.630 
keyboard and remember the q9h looks like
this<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.590> may<00:02:46.739> mean<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.280> keyboard

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
this so that may mean that the keyboard

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.940 
this so that may mean that the keyboard
of<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.760> propelled<00:02:48.060> pro<00:02:48.269> is<00:02:48.450> really<00:02:48.720> fantastic

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
of the propelled pro is really fantastic

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.900 
of the propelled pro is really fantastic
anyway<00:02:49.950> let's<00:02:50.160> take<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.370> look<00:02:50.579> at<00:02:50.640> how<00:02:50.760> this

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
anyway let's take a look at how this

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.819 
anyway let's take a look at how this
compares<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.420> other<00:02:51.720> similar<00:02:51.930> devices<00:02:52.349> so<00:02:52.709> we

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
compares to other similar devices so we

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.400 
compares to other similar devices so we
just<00:02:53.099> saw<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.340> q9h<00:02:53.819> let's<00:02:54.720> look<00:02:54.900> at<00:02:54.989> thickness

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
just saw the q9h let's look at thickness

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.970 
just saw the q9h let's look at thickness
the<00:02:55.980> propelled<00:02:56.340> pro<00:02:56.549> is<00:02:56.730> much<00:02:57.060> thicker<00:02:57.860> but<00:02:58.860> it

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
the propelled pro is much thicker but it

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.410 
the propelled pro is much thicker but it
can't<00:02:59.129> be<00:02:59.220> any<00:02:59.400> thicker<00:02:59.670> than<00:02:59.879> the<00:02:59.970> pantech

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
can't be any thicker than the pantech

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.449 
can't be any thicker than the pantech
matrix<00:03:01.170> Pro<00:03:01.410> which<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.829> thickest<00:03:02.160> device

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
matrix Pro which is the thickest device

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.390 
matrix Pro which is the thickest device
I<00:03:02.610> think<00:03:02.790> has<00:03:03.329> ever<00:03:03.599> been<00:03:03.799> released<00:03:04.799> in<00:03:05.250> the

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
I think has ever been released in the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.460 
I think has ever been released in the
world<00:03:05.579> probably<00:03:06.180> not<00:03:06.510> but<00:03:06.750> close<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.019> it<00:03:07.260> and

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
world probably not but close to it and

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.150 
world probably not but close to it and
let's<00:03:07.980> see<00:03:08.069> how<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.340> compares<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.599> epics

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
let's see how it compares to the epics

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.380 
let's see how it compares to the epics
it's<00:03:11.160> taller<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.519> course<00:03:11.760> when<00:03:11.940> you<00:03:12.030> slide<00:03:12.239> out

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
it's taller of course when you slide out

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.050 
it's taller of course when you slide out
the<00:03:12.420> slider<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.049> it<00:03:13.829> is<00:03:13.950> actually<00:03:14.190> about<00:03:14.879> the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
the slider and it is actually about the

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.729 
the slider and it is actually about the
same<00:03:15.209> thickness<00:03:15.480> I'd<00:03:15.780> say<00:03:15.989> a<00:03:16.019> little<00:03:16.379> bit

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
same thickness I'd say a little bit

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.110 
same thickness I'd say a little bit
thicker<00:03:18.769> then<00:03:19.769> next<00:03:20.069> to<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.400> blackjack<00:03:20.639> -

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
thicker then next to the blackjack -

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.910 
thicker then next to the blackjack -
which<00:03:21.329> was<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.540> very<00:03:21.989> popular<00:03:22.230> device<00:03:22.709> of

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
which was a very popular device of

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.870 
which was a very popular device of
course<00:03:22.950> it'll<00:03:23.280> be<00:03:23.370> taller

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
course it'll be taller

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.629 
course it'll be taller
although<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.299> screen<00:03:24.630> has<00:03:24.959> more<00:03:25.380> pixels<00:03:26.250> on

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
although the screen has more pixels on

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.759 
although the screen has more pixels on
it<00:03:26.819> and<00:03:26.970> this<00:03:27.480> is<00:03:27.600> an<00:03:27.690> interesting<00:03:28.019> d-pad

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
it and this is an interesting d-pad

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.650 
it and this is an interesting d-pad
anyway<00:03:29.489> so<00:03:29.549> a<00:03:29.670> lot<00:03:29.880> more<00:03:29.910> coming<00:03:30.359> up<00:03:30.420> on<00:03:30.540> the

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
anyway so a lot more coming up on the

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.479 
anyway so a lot more coming up on the
propel<00:03:30.989> Pro<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.410> think<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:31.769> is<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:32.010> potential

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
propel Pro I think this is the potential

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.699 
propel Pro I think this is the potential
to<00:03:32.579> be<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:32.730> really<00:03:33.000> fantastic<00:03:33.500> windows<00:03:34.500> mobile

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
to be a really fantastic windows mobile

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.890 
to be a really fantastic windows mobile
device<00:03:35.099> we're<00:03:36.060> gonna<00:03:36.150> talk<00:03:36.389> about<00:03:36.599> hardware

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
device we're gonna talk about hardware

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.889 
device we're gonna talk about hardware
coming<00:03:37.349> up<00:03:37.470> next<00:03:37.680> -<00:03:39.530> that's<00:03:40.530> it<00:03:40.680> for<00:03:40.829> now
