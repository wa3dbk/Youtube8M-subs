00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.789 
limits of what's possible to do with
bamboo<00:01:23.640> we're<00:01:24.570> thinking<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.960> bamboo<00:01:25.350> as<00:01:25.590> an

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
bamboo we're thinking of bamboo as an

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.859 
bamboo we're thinking of bamboo as an
integral<00:01:26.159> material<00:01:26.759> with<00:01:27.270> specific

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
integral material with specific

qualities that allows it to do things

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.240 
qualities that allows it to do things
that<00:01:30.210> would<00:01:30.509> or<00:01:30.900> other<00:01:31.170> materials<00:01:31.770> can't<00:01:32.100> do

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
that would or other materials can't do

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.609 
that would or other materials can't do
at<00:01:32.430> all<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.880> when<00:01:33.780> we<00:01:33.900> think<00:01:34.079> about<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.409> we

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
at all and when we think about that we

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.620 
at all and when we think about that we
can<00:01:35.250> think<00:01:35.400> about<00:01:35.520> what<00:01:35.970> structures<00:01:36.450> are

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
can think about what structures are

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.740 
can think about what structures are
possible<00:01:37.110> what<00:01:37.920> shapes<00:01:38.400> are<00:01:38.610> possible<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.360> we

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
possible what shapes are possible and we

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.480 
possible what shapes are possible and we
let<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> characteristics<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.250> properties

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
let the characteristics and properties

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.999 
let the characteristics and properties
of<00:01:42.000> bamboo<00:01:42.329> dictate<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.110> forms<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
of bamboo dictate the forms that the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.639 
of bamboo dictate the forms that the
structures<00:01:44.430> come<00:01:44.729> out<00:01:45.170> at<00:01:46.170> Green<00:01:46.380> School

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
structures come out at Green School

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.289 
structures come out at Green School
we're<00:01:46.829> doing<00:01:47.070> our<00:01:47.189> best<00:01:47.310> not<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.700> cut<00:01:47.880> down<00:01:48.060> any

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
we're doing our best not to cut down any

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.539 
we're doing our best not to cut down any
trees<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.350> some<00:01:49.829> instances<00:01:50.280> we're

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
trees so in some instances we're

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.609 
trees so in some instances we're
planning<00:01:50.939> our<00:01:51.030> buildings<00:01:51.869> around<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
planning our buildings around the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.469 
planning our buildings around the
current<00:01:52.920> trees<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.340> are<00:01:53.399> growing<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:54.299> other

current trees that are growing in other
instances<00:01:54.810> were<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:55.320> laying<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.649> trees

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.370 
instances were just laying the trees
grow<00:01:56.130> through<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> roofs<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.570> we're<00:01:57.840> having

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
grow through the roofs so we're having

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.020 
grow through the roofs so we're having
them<00:01:58.530> as<00:01:58.649> part<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.950> an<00:01:59.070> architectural<00:01:59.640> detail

our<00:02:28.510> structures<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:30.250> bamboo<00:02:30.610> is<00:02:30.790> an<00:02:30.910> extremely

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
our structures so bamboo is an extremely

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.320 
our structures so bamboo is an extremely
fast<00:02:31.600> growing<00:02:31.840> material<00:02:32.490> these<00:02:33.490> bamboo<00:02:33.790> poles

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
fast growing material these bamboo poles

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.710 
fast growing material these bamboo poles
that<00:02:34.660> you<00:02:34.780> see<00:02:34.960> behind<00:02:35.140> me<00:02:35.700> took<00:02:36.700> about<00:02:36.910> five

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
that you see behind me took about five

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.310 
that you see behind me took about five
or<00:02:37.870> six<00:02:38.050> years<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.590> grow<00:02:38.830> which<00:02:39.670> is<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:41.290> know

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
or six years to grow which is you know

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
or six years to grow which is you know
compared<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:42.010> 30<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.490> 50<00:02:42.820> years<00:02:43.090> for<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.450> tree

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
compared to 30 to 50 years for a tree

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.540 
compared to 30 to 50 years for a tree
and<00:02:45.900> another<00:02:46.900> advantage<00:02:47.410> is<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.830> these<00:02:48.070> once

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
and another advantage is that these once

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.940 
and another advantage is that these once
you<00:02:48.700> cut<00:02:48.910> it<00:02:49.030> off<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.510> root<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:50.470> just<00:02:50.709> grows

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
you cut it off the root it just grows

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.400 
you cut it off the root it just grows
right<00:02:51.190> back<00:02:51.430> again<00:02:52.050> one<00:02:53.050> of<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.260> first

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
right back again one of the first

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.080 
right back again one of the first
structures<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.070> was<00:02:54.220> built<00:02:54.489> here<00:02:54.550> in<00:02:54.730> fact<00:02:55.000> I

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
structures that was built here in fact I

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.850 
structures that was built here in fact I
think<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:55.450> was<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.840> first<00:02:56.080> structure<00:02:56.560> that

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
think it was the first structure that

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.100 
think it was the first structure that
was<00:02:56.980> built<00:02:57.040> here<00:02:57.400> is<00:02:57.550> the<00:02:57.760> bridge<00:02:58.060> and<00:02:58.360> it

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
was built here is the bridge and it

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.410 
was built here is the bridge and it
spans<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.830> gorgeous<00:03:00.250> young<00:03:00.430> River<00:03:00.970> which<00:03:01.270> is

really looks like a ship and it connects
the<00:03:12.010> two<00:03:12.160> sides<00:03:12.459> of<00:03:12.640> campus<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.810> instance

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
the two sides of campus and the instance

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.140 
the two sides of campus and the instance
that<00:03:14.380> it<00:03:14.500> was<00:03:14.650> built<00:03:14.920> people<00:03:15.370> started<00:03:15.820> to<00:03:15.940> use

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
that it was built people started to use

that it was built people started to use
it<00:03:16.330> there<00:03:16.690> wasn't<00:03:17.140> a<00:03:17.230> soul<00:03:17.560> living<00:03:17.860> on<00:03:18.070> this

it there wasn't a soul living on this

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.979 
it there wasn't a soul living on this
campus<00:03:18.700> there<00:03:18.910> wasn't<00:03:19.330> a<00:03:19.510> school<00:03:19.810> building

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
campus there wasn't a school building

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.990 
campus there wasn't a school building
built<00:03:20.410> there<00:03:20.860> wasn't<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.310> student<00:03:21.700> enrolled

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
built there wasn't a student enrolled

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.880 
built there wasn't a student enrolled
but<00:03:22.209> there<00:03:22.390> was<00:03:22.540> this<00:03:22.720> gorgeous<00:03:23.110> bridge<00:03:23.650> at

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
but there was this gorgeous bridge at

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.220 
but there was this gorgeous bridge at
the<00:03:24.010> Hardys<00:03:24.310> envision<00:03:24.850> and<00:03:25.060> it<00:03:25.690> began<00:03:26.019> to<00:03:26.080> be

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
the Hardys envision and it began to be

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.740 
the Hardys envision and it began to be
used<00:03:26.350> by<00:03:26.620> villagers<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.910> structures<00:03:28.420> here

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
used by villagers the structures here

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.979 
used by villagers the structures here
are<00:03:28.959> inspired<00:03:29.380> by<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.739> shape<00:03:30.070> of<00:03:30.220> a<00:03:30.310> wave<00:03:30.989> our

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
are inspired by the shape of a wave our

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.229 
are inspired by the shape of a wave our
architect<00:03:32.500> was<00:03:32.680> interested<00:03:33.130> in<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.880> shapes

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
architect was interested in the shapes

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.780 
architect was interested in the shapes
of<00:03:34.390> bamboo<00:03:34.780> that<00:03:35.019> are<00:03:35.470> like<00:03:35.890> shapes<00:03:36.400> of<00:03:36.580> water

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
of bamboo that are like shapes of water

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.740 
of bamboo that are like shapes of water
so<00:03:37.690> we're<00:03:37.840> using<00:03:38.019> bamboo<00:03:38.350> thali<00:03:38.799> we're<00:03:39.190> using

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
so we're using bamboo thali we're using

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.570 
so we're using bamboo thali we're using
whole<00:03:40.750> pieces<00:03:41.019> of<00:03:41.320> patong<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.799> bamboo<00:03:42.310> and

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
whole pieces of patong the bamboo and

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.270 
whole pieces of patong the bamboo and
we're<00:03:43.000> using<00:03:43.180> rammed<00:03:43.600> earth<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:44.620> create<00:03:44.980> the

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
we're using rammed earth to create the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.789 
we're using rammed earth to create the
lines<00:03:45.549> and<00:03:46.000> forms<00:03:46.450> that<00:03:46.959> really<00:03:47.290> create<00:03:47.590> an

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
lines and forms that really create an

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.800 
lines and forms that really create an
inspirational<00:03:48.640> environment<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.720> either

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
inspirational environment to either

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.770 
inspirational environment to either
learn<00:03:50.080> in<00:03:50.290> or<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.680> live<00:03:50.860> in<00:03:50.980> this<00:03:51.970> looks<00:03:52.239> like<00:03:52.450> a

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
learn in or to live in this looks like a

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.020 
learn in or to live in this looks like a
pineapple<00:03:53.650> it<00:03:54.250> is<00:03:54.400> it's<00:03:54.610> inspired<00:03:55.030> by

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
pineapple it is it's inspired by

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.090 
pineapple it is it's inspired by
pineapple<00:03:55.840> but<00:03:55.989> one<00:03:56.680> of<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.830> things<00:03:57.010> that

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
pineapple but one of the things that

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.440 
pineapple but one of the things that
we're<00:03:57.310> really<00:03:57.519> trying<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.880> do<00:03:58.060> is<00:03:58.090> come<00:03:58.420> up

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
we're really trying to do is come up

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.360 
we're really trying to do is come up
with<00:03:58.690> really<00:03:58.870> innovative<00:03:59.530> furniture<00:04:00.070> design

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
with really innovative furniture design

if you're living around really creative

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.780 
if you're living around really creative
furniture<00:04:07.330> and<00:04:07.630> you're<00:04:07.750> going<00:04:08.019> and

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
living in a classroom that's really

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.280 
living in a classroom that's really
creative<00:04:11.189> and<00:04:11.549> outside<00:04:12.090> of<00:04:12.120> a<00:04:12.299> box<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:13.019> be<00:04:13.140> able

learning village that's the authentic

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:52.700 
learning village that's the authentic
part<00:04:50.910> of<00:04:51.030> the<00:04:51.090> curriculum<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.720> that<00:04:52.320> includes

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
part of the curriculum and that includes

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.339 
part of the curriculum and that includes
taking<00:04:53.160> parts<00:04:54.000> of<00:04:54.240> what<00:04:54.750> they<00:04:54.870> learn<00:04:55.080> in<00:04:55.110> the

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:55.349 
taking parts of what they learn in the

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.050 
taking parts of what they learn in the
classroom<00:04:55.620> and<00:04:56.039> connecting<00:04:56.880> it<00:04:57.000> to

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
classroom and connecting it to

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.790 
classroom and connecting it to
real-world<00:04:57.360> situations<00:04:58.259> so<00:04:58.470> we're<00:04:58.620> going<00:04:58.710> to

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
real-world situations so we're going to

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.400 
real-world situations so we're going to
have<00:04:58.860> different<00:04:59.460> industry<00:05:00.000> on<00:05:00.479> the<00:05:00.990> campus

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
we might have a chocolate factory we

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.140 
we might have a chocolate factory we
might<00:05:10.169> have<00:05:10.320> a<00:05:10.349> ceramics<00:05:10.889> workshop<00:05:11.070> we<00:05:11.940> might

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
might have a ceramics workshop we might

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.180 
might have a ceramics workshop we might

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
what they learn to real-world situations

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.250 
what they learn to real-world situations
the<00:05:30.300> learning<00:05:30.449> becomes<00:05:30.840> much<00:05:31.110> more

become lifelong learners and really

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.750 
become lifelong learners and really
important<00:05:37.110> ways<00:05:37.289> I<00:05:37.590> think<00:05:38.220> we're<00:05:38.639> doing

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
important ways I think we're doing

important ways I think we're doing
something<00:05:38.880> really<00:05:39.510> important<00:05:39.960> here<00:05:40.020> and

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:40.409 
something really important here and

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:42.920 
something really important here and
really<00:05:41.099> vital<00:05:41.490> for<00:05:41.820> the<00:05:41.849> future<00:05:42.210> of<00:05:42.389> education

really vital for the future of education

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.310 
really vital for the future of education
and<00:05:43.229> perhaps<00:05:44.010> with<00:05:44.250> the<00:05:44.280> planet<00:05:44.990> if<00:05:45.990> you<00:05:46.199> look

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
and perhaps with the planet if you look

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.480 
and perhaps with the planet if you look
at<00:05:46.440> what's<00:05:46.860> happening<00:05:47.130> in<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:47.280> world<00:05:47.310> today

at what's happening in the world today

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.370 
at what's happening in the world today
we've<00:05:48.090> reached<00:05:48.270> a<00:05:48.389> really<00:05:48.630> critical<00:05:48.780> point<00:05:49.229> in

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380
