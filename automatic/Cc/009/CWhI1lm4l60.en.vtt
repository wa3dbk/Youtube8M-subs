00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.330
 that the van in which he was transferred 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.680

 achieve what revenge most longs for 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.130
 with this fast-paced start a 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.049
 game that marked a time and that in its 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.509
 moment meant a revolution in the way 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.100
 to understand the video adventures 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.070
 introducing adult and 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.420

 reedited for mobile platforms 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.490
 of teatres is a mix of shooter in 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.140
 first person graphic adventure and 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.939
 driving simulator that 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.619
 develops in an open world in which 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.600
 we can explore the city â€‹â€‹to our 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.159
 craving stealing all the cars that 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.700
 we want and attacking citizens 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.700
 right-handed and sinister 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.790
 but its true power lies in its 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.260
 history as criminals that we are what 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.210
 more logical will be to put us to the orders 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.620
 of the local mafias to win something of 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.720
 easy money and go ascending 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.820
 progressively thanks to the works 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.770
 ordered by our bosses of this 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.840
 as we go on doing a 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.760
 name in the underworld other bands 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.950
 they will look at us and can move on to 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.710
 work for them or becoming 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.660
 your goal so we will get to our 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.030
 old girlfriend related now with the 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.540
 drug cartels and consummate our 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.540
 revenge 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.540
 Thank you 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.160
 each mission is introduced by a 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.780
 sequence in which we are indicated 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.489
 our goal and weapons and others 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.380
 resources that we will have for 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.270
 complete it will also leave us 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.069
 presenting the different characters that 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.130
 they integrate the story and they will reveal themselves 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.140
 details so that this one advances 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.900
 the basic controls will allow us 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.430
 run jump fight move to our 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.740
 character and change the angle of vision 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.510
 but as we need to perform 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.100
 other tasks will appear buttons 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.050
 specific that will facilitate us the 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.100
 playability overcoming limitations 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.100
 of the touch screen 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.810
 the graphics and textures have been 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.490
 improved for the occasion although they continue 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.080
 being somewhat flat and the movements 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.010
 make the characters seem more 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.010
 robots that people 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.050
 the 3d engine is still spectacular 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.840
 despite having 10 years providing 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.310
 huge and full of details scenarios 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.170
 the voices of the characters and the band 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.340
 sound are also very careful to the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.880
 height of the best movies 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.880
 police 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.640
 grand theft auto '3 for ipad does not bring 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.040
 substantially nothing new delivery 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.739
 original is essentially the same game 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.690
 than a decade ago enjoyed such 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.489
 time some missions plus a change in the 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.290
 argument line would have been the hit 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.209
 perfect for an anniversary edition 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.209
 but good is gta 3 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.120
 resistance that I am nothing 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.720
 and
