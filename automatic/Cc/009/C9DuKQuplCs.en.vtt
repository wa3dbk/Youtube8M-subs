but for now I would put this away the
reasons<00:00:46.500> for<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.940> good<00:00:48.899> for

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
reasons for that is this is good for

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.470 
reasons for that is this is good for
sectioning<00:00:49.590> yes<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.850> tension<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.390> this

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
sectioning yes but the tension in this

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.779 
sectioning yes but the tension in this
comb<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.899> too<00:00:52.110> tight<00:00:52.379> for<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.800> most<00:00:52.980> part<00:00:53.250> most

of the tail combs have really tight

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.049 
of the tail combs have really tight
teeth<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.250> they're<00:00:56.370> not<00:00:56.460> going<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> help<00:00:56.910> you

you probably wouldn't want to use for a
typical<00:01:20.220> haircut<00:01:20.400> let's<00:01:20.700> say<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.030> bob<00:01:21.479> haircut

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509

or<00:01:22.229> something<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.770> that

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
or something like that

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.120 
or something like that
even<00:01:23.700> long<00:01:23.880> layers<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.570> just<00:01:24.869> too<00:01:25.080> big

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
even long layers this is just too big

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.010 
even long layers this is just too big
some<00:01:26.640> people<00:01:26.880> love<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.240> big<00:01:27.420> comb<00:01:27.689> they<00:01:27.840> love

holding<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.560> their<00:01:28.650> hand<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.070> personally

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
holding it in their hand I personally

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.280 
holding it in their hand I personally
think<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:30.570> too<00:01:30.750> much<00:01:30.930> if<00:01:31.170> you're

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
think that it's just too much if you're

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.350 
think that it's just too much if you're
trying<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.560> hold<00:01:31.710> hair<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.040> your<00:01:32.159> hand<00:01:32.400> trying

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
to cut a bob take clean sections it's

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.100 
to cut a bob take clean sections it's
just<00:01:35.549> going<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.759> get<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.030> way<00:01:36.180> so<00:01:36.240> try<00:01:37.079> to

the<00:01:57.689> way<00:01:57.810> through<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.740> reason<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.340> that

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
the way through the reason I like that

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.310 
the way through the reason I like that
is<00:01:59.670> because<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.299> like<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.689> for<00:02:00.840> dry<00:02:01.079> hair

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
is because I like it for dry hair

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.230 
is because I like it for dry hair
cutting<00:02:01.590> when<00:02:02.100> you're<00:02:02.219> cutting<00:02:02.369> dry<00:02:02.759> hair<00:02:03.030> if

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
cutting when you're cutting dry hair if

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.240 
cutting when you're cutting dry hair if
you<00:02:03.659> use<00:02:03.840> something<00:02:04.110> with<00:02:04.380> too<00:02:04.590> tight<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> teeth

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
you use something with too tight a teeth

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.980 
you use something with too tight a teeth
you<00:02:05.460> can't<00:02:05.729> get<00:02:05.850> through<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.180> hair<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.659> it

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
you can't get through the hair and it

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.690 
you can't get through the hair and it
makes<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.259> hair<00:02:07.350> really<00:02:07.530> staticky<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.459> this

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
makes the hair really staticky so this

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.210 
makes the hair really staticky so this
is<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.970> nice<00:02:09.479> smooth<00:02:09.840> comb<00:02:10.200> works<00:02:10.860> its<00:02:11.099> way

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
is a nice smooth comb works its way

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.490

little bit less tension it runs through

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.290

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
section has the medium teeth but they

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.070 
section has the medium teeth but they
still<00:02:40.800> give<00:02:41.010> good<00:02:41.310> tension<00:02:41.700> so<00:02:42.210> as<00:02:42.600> I'm<00:02:42.930> going

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
still give good tension so as I'm going

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.680 
still give good tension so as I'm going
through<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.530> I'm<00:02:43.590> trying<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.890> cut<00:02:44.070> a<00:02:44.100> bob<00:02:44.340> or

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
through and I'm trying to cut a bob or

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.410 
through and I'm trying to cut a bob or
any<00:02:45.690> type<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.260> haircut<00:02:46.470> then<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.970> gives<00:02:48.180> me<00:02:48.300> the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
any type of haircut then it gives me the

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.180 
any type of haircut then it gives me the
right<00:02:48.540> tension<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.140> need<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.650> it's<00:02:50.070> not

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
right tension that I need and it's not

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.980 
right tension that I need and it's not
too<00:02:50.370> much<00:02:50.520> tension<00:02:50.760> for<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.120> haircut<00:02:51.240> so

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
too much tension for the haircut so

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.080 
too much tension for the haircut so
these<00:02:52.380> two<00:02:52.680> combs<00:02:52.920> are<00:02:53.130> very<00:02:53.340> similar<00:02:53.760> but<00:02:53.910> one

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
these two combs are very similar but one

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.790 
these two combs are very similar but one
is<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.240> little<00:02:54.510> bit<00:02:54.750> smaller<00:02:55.140> so<00:02:55.260> if<00:02:55.530> I'm<00:02:55.650> trying

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
is a little bit smaller so if I'm trying

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.310 
is a little bit smaller so if I'm trying
to<00:02:55.950> get<00:02:56.070> into<00:02:56.250> tighter<00:02:56.580> spaces<00:02:57.110> or<00:02:58.110> work

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
to get into tighter spaces or work

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.199 
to get into tighter spaces or work
closer<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> hairline<00:02:59.520> or<00:02:59.760> something<00:03:00.060> like

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
closer to a hairline or something like

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.480 
closer to a hairline or something like
that<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.600> love<00:03:01.110> having<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.560> smaller<00:03:01.920> comb<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.459> I

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
that I love having a smaller comb so I

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.980 
that I love having a smaller comb so I
usually<00:03:02.880> work<00:03:03.000> with<00:03:03.209> three<00:03:03.420> different<00:03:03.570> combs

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
usually work with three different combs

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.380 
usually work with three different combs
most<00:03:04.410> people<00:03:04.680> have<00:03:04.800> their<00:03:04.920> favorite<00:03:05.340> comb<00:03:05.550> and

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
most people have their favorite comb and

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.330 
most people have their favorite comb and
they<00:03:06.540> never<00:03:06.690> switch<00:03:07.080> out<00:03:07.320> I<00:03:07.560> personally<00:03:08.250> think

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
they never switch out I personally think

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.920 
they never switch out I personally think
you<00:03:08.490> should<00:03:08.610> have<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.730> few<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.209> them<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.690> comb

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
you should have a few of them the comb

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.180 
you should have a few of them the comb
is<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.260> tool<00:03:10.470> it's<00:03:10.709> like<00:03:10.860> having<00:03:11.130> a

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
is the tool it's like having a

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.370 
is the tool it's like having a
screwdriver<00:03:11.690> Phillips<00:03:12.690> in<00:03:12.840> straight<00:03:13.170> head

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
screwdriver Phillips in straight head

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.260
