00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.689
 how was that when you first put on this jersey? 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.689
 One day, a special atmosphere dies here 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.310
 around 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.030
 but the club that lives in history so here, too 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.550
 Food from family club of and 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.820
 I have to say so in 2003 I made the first game for VfB 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.750
 So Stuttgart not for Celtic but against Celtic 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.650
 and that without a unique atmosphere I have something 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.080
 I've never really experienced any goose bumps before 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.460
 Gone field 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.600
 and so what he can so what reminds min 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.830
 Of course, you remember that and that 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.710
 of course, when I get an offer, I have everything exactly 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.920
 looked at here 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.350
 heard a lot about the story and that is definitely a whole 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.660
 special club so 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.619
 as I am too 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.899
 say proudly musicians and I have to say quite honest part of the 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:13.290
 History Train Train to be or to become 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.760
 In 1888 while studying Seifried founded 60000 67 Best British Club 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.560
 the Balinger are driven by jazz music 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.710
 At the same time, the club is the Irish Catholic immigrant and has already 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.180
 Won 42 championships 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.000
 an absolute archenemy comes from my own city my ship the club 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.920
 of the Protestant establishment and if it likes to so-called and lead 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.830
 the hand green vs blue down against up is the most emotional 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.830
 City championship of the world 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.240
 So certainly not says is that the WDR turquoise 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.360
 I have already experienced the duel 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.310
 in ten years 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.450
 Percent mean 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.220
 Group d did not play on before 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.630
 it is also very 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.720
 intense that the way they who so the southerners are also a bit 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.270
 in principle already 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.270
 but must say here it is still a little different so 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.059
 It has heard many stories with politics of course over again 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:16.779
 Religion and percent over all in the city so that is 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:19.169
 Meaning more factors that sang to play 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:23.389
 and there it is very intense so yesterday it is super atmosphere so I think 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:26.389
 that is no comparable of the right to know Alonso again 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:28.599
 incredible 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.709
 On Saturday it's time again 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.670
 the 381 the Old Firm Derby stands at 2 time that comes in as a leader in 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.099
 the shopping park 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:41.040
 the games in the woods are the most important 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.040
 Either way that way 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.229
 it is abroad but so i personally never drove too 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.519
 Sawdust very good if not at all because the opponent is then 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.619
 there you can pull yourself up to something you were before at Cydia 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:57.550
 how was the effect 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.570
 to the destination here 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.319
 to play the football 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.299
 is different in each then also I have to say so 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.019
 but it's a bit like that work here in the Scottish 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.290
 League of course, there are many similar exercise also us frustration at football 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.509
 gives the same rules 

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:15.879
 Therefore, there are many entertainers and per training Citroen and rhythms 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.790
 So in Berlin in training or a training week, it is already 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.969
 bit different 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:21.339
 around 

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:24.810
 but now from the football game here it is very body 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.930
 emphasizes that becomes of the other things when I'm very intense game 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.409
 about penultimate Spanish the bad luck that relaxing technical football 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.719
 played different rhythms played times the tempo took out what 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.809
 Again, here I am given a full throttle from the first to the last 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:40.809
 minute 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:43.869
 and heat and the very physical 

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:47.849
 man Andreas Hinkel is looking for league games in the starting team of FC Wehr 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:48.929
 on the area 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:52.359
 So never a solid one in the picture could not prove 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.949
 In the cup and in the uefa cup, everyone plays against everyone in 2007 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:58.649
 trophies 

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:01.819
 The power was just fun because aesthetic football was offensive 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:02.789
 Soccer 

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:04.909
 and I played together with Poland 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.719
 and also the competition is that one forgot that Dani Alves that 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:12.109
 we what or play that over 30 trillion changed to Barcelona 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:13.329
 before the meeting 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.340
 and it was an important competitor and I had to face each one of them 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.130
 Use has to fight b 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.230
 no regular missions so help serenity 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.699
 he's getting a new chance with the change to Celtic 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.139
 In September he plays for his first international match in three years 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:32.389
 There I've been 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.020
 So nothing comes the algorithm because it had done itself 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.180
 completely surprising 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.630
 he reasons that I hug I promised in July that I will stop 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.720
 Of course, Celtic also played a small part here 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.050
 Club he is always international plays 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.229
 I think so 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.110
 which, however, completely missing percent 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.869
 the right defender position so out of encouragement too little, therefore, to calm 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.900
 I am one of the carriers of the home heaves the main task as right 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.059
 Defenseman defensively well 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:07.099
 To prevent Franks from merely doing so, of course 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.740
 To make inquiries and 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.569
 That was the attacking game Daum on to rehearsals 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:17.520
 9 Andreas Hinkel Emma has the Stuttgart jersey so he wrote 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.159
 2003 to the national team and in the heart of the Swabian audience Hz 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:24.129
 could 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:25.750
 what 14 years at 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.749
 Stuttgart 

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:29.749
 what is your favorite memory of the time 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:33.689
 nice weather and traffic the answer Red 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:35.069
 the judges appeared to me 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:38.069
 ASA 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:42.759
 Andersson says that this is my club of VfB Dr 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.409
 I was 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:50.059
 Many had the dream as a child Real Madrid suffers many animals or what 

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:52.499
 I know I had Forfait it was my dream 

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:54.800
 five appearances are playing 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.930
 Many young women energy for the pregnant woman was the young national player too 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:01.809
 and represent BÃ©da from Wednesday 

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:03.460
 that of course then 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.650
 and my bird then I play that I could dream as well as me 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.270
 then I came out of Wars pretty young 17 18 I have the first ones 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.270
 Workouts then made five on beer with 18 the first games 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:15.559
 and 

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:18.800
 It was very intense at the beginning Assauer 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.810
 my club so 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.320
 My club was all about surviving when I came out but that's the one 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.320
 Relegation prevented two years later in the Champions League 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:31.800
 Everyone thinks right that the special experiences for him but the 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.050
 which have set America has trend way 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.949
 I think everyone 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:39.740
 but the other probably much more important the decision whether Muezzin 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.469
 only closer or whether the second league is 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:44.629
 and I think that I stop 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:47.539
 that I am glad that I could help the club in the times 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:51.059
 From a fast-down to skim the young voters test case for the 

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:55.800
 Stuttgart si st 2002 2003 they vote too much to championship and 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.419
 Teamplay always in the middle of it all 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:01.389
 Platini the football for them is to reach the fastest 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:05.000
 surprise team 2003 plays as well as the wonder team 2008 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
 Leader Hoffenheim under coach Ralf Rangnick 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.319
 At the top of the Bundesliga, of course, buying one right now is what you have 

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:19.949
 something like that expected 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:23.080
 Hann yes I know the coach very well 

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.900
 At the time, he brought the woman missing to the first team, that was mine 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.479
 be followed first race 

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:31.050
 and around 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.910
 I know his philosophy. I know what happens again. It's something 

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:36.039
 to avoid 

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:39.039
 Strangers do not come from Germany so open one 

00:07:39.869 --> 00:07:40.770
 percent 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.170
 at the car hits are increasingly at home Speaker Prof the player is on 

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:47.599
 played but at the end of the season he will again be at the top in Cannes 

00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:50.749
 she definitely can 

00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:52.880
 so if you are the carefree 

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.320
 keeping the scissor sisters he put too much pressure on that is one 

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.240
 crazy first season 

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.509
 and it wants to be able to maintain it 

00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:03.060
 without team spirit 

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.950
 well together play well harmonize yes no one is allowed 

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.179
 put somebody in the foreground 

00:08:09.179 --> 00:08:11.740
 then it is possible in any case 

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.490
 I thank you very much
