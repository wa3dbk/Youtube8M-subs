the the multiplayer map this is nothing
like<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.130> beta<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:09.150> guys<00:01:09.390> probably

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
like the beta that you guys probably

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.810 
like the beta that you guys probably
played<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.770> while<00:01:11.580> ago<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:13.010> they<00:01:14.010> really<00:01:14.640> got

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
played a while ago and they really got

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.880 
played a while ago and they really got
it<00:01:14.939> close<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.180> retail<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.960> really<00:01:16.259> smooth<00:01:16.560> it

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it close to retail it's really smooth it

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.039 
it close to retail it's really smooth it
looks<00:01:17.130> polished<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.360> think<00:01:18.540> what<00:01:18.869> you're

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
looks polished so I think what you're

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.570 
looks polished so I think what you're
seeing<00:01:19.080> now<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.710> what<00:01:20.009> you're<00:01:20.189> going<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.400> see

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
seeing now is what you're going to see

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.179 
seeing now is what you're going to see
when<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> game<00:01:21.330> comes<00:01:21.509> out<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.590> which<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
when the game comes out it which is in a

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.710 
when the game comes out it which is in a
couple<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.549> days<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.150> don't<00:01:24.450> think<00:01:24.570> there's

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
couple of days so I don't think there's

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.289 
couple of days so I don't think there's
too<00:01:25.350> many<00:01:25.500> glitches<00:01:26.280> or<00:01:26.729> bugs<00:01:26.970> are<00:01:27.119> going<00:01:27.240> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
too many glitches or bugs are going to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.929 
too many glitches or bugs are going to
fix<00:01:28.250> pretty<00:01:29.250> much<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> lot<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.700> people<00:01:29.880> were

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
fix pretty much a lot of people were

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.940 
fix pretty much a lot of people were
afraid<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> beta<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.680> know<00:01:31.770> this

could put out to the public so they were

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.539 
could put out to the public so they were
not<00:01:45.329> only<00:01:45.689> testing<00:01:46.470> for<00:01:46.710> bugs<00:01:46.920> they<00:01:47.460> were

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.100 
playing on a ps3 I will also say that
the<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.280> graphics<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.909> textures<00:02:03.299> are<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.509> lot

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the the graphics the textures are a lot

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.590 
the the graphics the textures are a lot
better<00:02:04.409> than<00:02:05.070> what<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:05.700> play<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.030> on<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.509> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
better than what we play it on on the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.410 
better than what we play it on on the
beta<00:02:06.920> I<00:02:07.920> know<00:02:08.160> on<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.489> pc<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.940> looks<00:02:09.149> pretty

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
beta I know on the pc it looks pretty

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.270 
beta I know on the pc it looks pretty
good<00:02:09.539> too<00:02:09.810> but<00:02:10.410> particularly<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.039> lot<00:02:11.220> of

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
good too but particularly a lot of

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.979 
good too but particularly a lot of
people<00:02:11.370> were<00:02:11.760> complaining<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.540> xbox

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
people were complaining that the xbox

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.260 
people were complaining that the xbox
and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
and

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.200 
and
3<00:02:13.630> version<00:02:14.050> just<00:02:14.440> didn't<00:02:14.950> look<00:02:15.190> up<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.700> par<00:02:15.940> but

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
3 version just didn't look up to par but

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.020 
3 version just didn't look up to par but
as<00:02:16.990> you<00:02:17.260> can<00:02:17.350> see<00:02:17.500> this<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.890> ps3<00:02:18.190> it<00:02:18.700> looks

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
as you can see this is a ps3 it looks

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.520 
as you can see this is a ps3 it looks
pretty<00:02:19.180> much<00:02:19.390> up<00:02:19.570> to<00:02:19.600> par<00:02:19.840> looks<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.140> lot<00:02:20.230> better

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
pretty much up to par looks a lot better

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.730 
pretty much up to par looks a lot better
and<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.460> just<00:02:21.910> definitely<00:02:22.060> means<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.170> that

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
and it just definitely means that that

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.650 
and it just definitely means that that
they<00:02:24.130> polish<00:02:24.580> this<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.000> they<00:02:25.060> really<00:02:25.360> wanted

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
they polish this and they really wanted

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.540 
they polish this and they really wanted
to<00:02:25.870> make<00:02:26.080> this<00:02:26.230> look<00:02:26.410> good<00:02:26.470> which<00:02:27.190> I<00:02:27.340> think

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
to make this look good which I think

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.750 
to make this look good which I think
they<00:02:27.670> accomplished<00:02:28.120> pretty<00:02:28.360> well<00:02:28.540> for

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
they accomplished pretty well for

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.220 
they accomplished pretty well for
consoled<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.910> first<00:02:31.180> person<00:02:31.330> shooter<00:02:31.540> console

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
consoled a first person shooter console

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.260 
consoled a first person shooter console
game<00:02:32.380> so<00:02:32.800> this<00:02:33.220> as<00:02:33.490> you<00:02:33.730> see<00:02:33.880> this<00:02:34.030> map<00:02:34.240> is

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
game so this as you see this map is

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.930 
game so this as you see this map is
there's<00:02:35.050> no<00:02:35.200> vehicle<00:02:35.650> so<00:02:36.040> there's<00:02:36.310> no<00:02:36.460> tanks

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
there's no vehicle so there's no tanks

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.270 
there's no vehicle so there's no tanks
there's<00:02:37.090> no<00:02:37.270> airplanes<00:02:37.900> no<00:02:38.050> jets<00:02:38.500> so<00:02:39.070> this<00:02:39.250> is

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
there's no airplanes no jets so this is

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.510 
there's no airplanes no jets so this is
all<00:02:39.640> about<00:02:39.820> just<00:02:40.270> shooting<00:02:40.990> and<00:02:41.370> making<00:02:42.370> sure

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
all about just shooting and making sure

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.390 
all about just shooting and making sure
you're<00:02:42.850> hitting<00:02:43.150> your<00:02:43.360> opponent<00:02:44.290> like<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.160> said

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
you're hitting your opponent like I said

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.880 
you're hitting your opponent like I said
it's<00:02:45.700> before<00:02:46.270> it's<00:02:46.420> team<00:02:46.600> deathmatch<00:02:47.020> so<00:02:47.410> I

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
it's before it's team deathmatch so I

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.970 
it's before it's team deathmatch so I
would<00:02:48.790> try<00:02:49.030> to<00:02:49.060> be<00:02:49.420> an<00:02:49.480> assault<00:02:49.840> or<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.170> support

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
would try to be an assault or a support

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.280 
would try to be an assault or a support
class<00:02:51.970> because<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.600> want<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.810> provide<00:02:53.080> your

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
pretty much not much different from the

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.690 
pretty much not much different from the
beta<00:03:05.320> that<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.530> played<00:03:05.740> I<00:03:05.770> mean<00:03:06.070> there<00:03:06.520> wasn't
