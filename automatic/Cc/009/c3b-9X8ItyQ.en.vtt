00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 yes 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.180
 it is international material heritage 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.160
 informs about the lack of humidity that 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.960
 exists in the Mexican Republic and I 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.750
 I mean the humidity that clouds form 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.600
 that give rainfall is only a 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.160
 little humidity towards the southeast of the sea 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.270
 Caribbean to the peninsula so many 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.359
 explanations that are directed 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.699
 occasionally moderate what is the 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.859
 city ​​that wind wind enrachado that 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.840
 can tire the 60 70 kilos per hour in 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.390
 the littoral of the gulf of mexico and that 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.800
 it carries humidity to these states 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.960
 but mainly we will wait some 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.719
 Light and scattered rain in Tamaulipas 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.899
 look at you there in the north of 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:46.480
 peaceful this great great cloud formation 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.489
 and that the wind takes care of it 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.930
 towards baja california sonora and chihuahua 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.789
 and let's also hope for something 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.789
 precipitation but it will be really very 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:57.640
 but very light in fact the country 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:00.309
 will continue then forming a very 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.320
 stable very high temperatures at 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.699
 over the next few days is what 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.530
 there will be some points of numbers 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.720
 temperatures are really very very 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.060
 high as it can be in Jalisco 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.649

 be around between 40 and 42 degrees 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:22.780
 the maximum temperature in these points of 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.310
 the Mexican republic for the northwest and
