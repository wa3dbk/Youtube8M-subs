I'm<00:01:50.340> not<00:01:50.520> sure<00:01:50.700> many<00:01:51.240> people<00:01:51.390> who<00:01:51.840> have<00:01:52.110> an<00:01:52.229> s5

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
I'm not sure many people who have an s5

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.069 
I'm not sure many people who have an s5
use<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.950> but<00:01:53.100> just<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.460> case<00:01:53.700> it's<00:01:54.479> on<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.810> s5

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
use it but just in case it's on the s5

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.350 
use it but just in case it's on the s5
but<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.649> didn't<00:01:56.219> manage<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.490> find<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> s5

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
but I didn't manage to find it on the s5

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.330 
but I didn't manage to find it on the s5
mini<00:01:57.619> in<00:01:58.619> terms<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.840> speed<00:02:01.219> what<00:02:02.219> we're

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
mini in terms of speed what we're

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.899 
mini in terms of speed what we're
getting<00:02:02.460> from<00:02:02.700> both<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:03.149> these<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:05.310> s5<00:02:05.880> has

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
getting from both of these is the s5 has

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.510 
getting from both of these is the s5 has
two<00:02:06.689> gig<00:02:06.899> of<00:02:07.049> ram<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:09.270> s5<00:02:10.080> mini<00:02:10.110> has<00:02:10.890> 1.5

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
two gig of ram and the s5 mini has 1.5

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.070 
two gig of ram and the s5 mini has 1.5
diagram<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.540> believe<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.230> above

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
diagram I believe the above

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.270 
diagram I believe the above
so<00:02:16.080> if<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.290> would<00:02:16.410> like<00:02:16.560> to<00:02:16.680> see<00:02:16.800> a<00:02:16.830> speed<00:02:17.130> test

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
so if you would like to see a speed test

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.949 
so if you would like to see a speed test
on<00:02:17.520> both<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.850> these<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.240> see<00:02:18.390> which<00:02:18.569> one<00:02:18.750> boots

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
on both of these to see which one boots

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.800 
on both of these to see which one boots
up<00:02:19.170> faster<00:02:19.230> which<00:02:19.890> one<00:02:20.130> has<00:02:20.310> faster<00:02:21.300> browser

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
up faster which one has faster browser

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.830 
up faster which one has faster browser
test<00:02:22.319> or<00:02:23.310> any<00:02:23.459> thing<00:02:24.030> else<00:02:24.240> you'd<00:02:24.450> like<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.630> see

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
test or any thing else you'd like to see

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.940 
test or any thing else you'd like to see
just<00:02:25.050> let<00:02:25.140> me<00:02:25.260> know<00:02:25.380> in<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.500> comments<00:02:25.860> down

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
just let me know in the comments down

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.780 
just let me know in the comments down
below<00:02:26.390> let's<00:02:27.390> also<00:02:27.600> check<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.470> camera<00:02:29.280> see<00:02:29.700> if

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
below let's also check the camera see if

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.400 
below let's also check the camera see if
there's<00:02:30.000> any<00:02:30.150> different<00:02:30.600> settings<00:02:31.290> within

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
there's any different settings within

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.860 
there's any different settings within
the<00:02:31.680> camera<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.709> camera<00:02:35.130> on<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.940> s5<00:02:36.540> mini

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
the camera so the camera on the s5 mini

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.280 
the camera so the camera on the s5 mini
is<00:02:37.470> an<00:02:38.190> 8<00:02:38.430> megapixel<00:02:38.700> camera<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.840> camera

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
is an 8 megapixel camera and the camera

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.360 
is an 8 megapixel camera and the camera
on<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.590> s5<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.280> 16<00:02:41.790> megapixel<00:02:42.360> camera<00:02:42.690> for

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
on the s5 is a 16 megapixel camera for

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.920 
on the s5 is a 16 megapixel camera for
some<00:02:44.370> reason<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:44.790> one's<00:02:45.030> set<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.660> 6

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
some reason that one's set to 6

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.400 
some reason that one's set to 6
megapixels<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:46.920> it's<00:02:47.100> 8<00:02:47.959> how<00:02:48.959> can<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.230> see

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
megapixels but it's 8 how can you see

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.150 
megapixels but it's 8 how can you see
their<00:02:49.650> they<00:02:50.310> both<00:02:50.489> have<00:02:50.900> quite<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:52.290> lot<00:02:52.680> of

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
their they both have quite a lot of

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.560 
their they both have quite a lot of
settings<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:54.200> many<00:02:55.200> if<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:55.920> ask<00:02:56.040> me<00:02:56.450> for<00:02:57.450> the

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
settings to many if you ask me for the

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.430 
settings to many if you ask me for the
average<00:02:57.720> user<00:02:58.700> but<00:02:59.700> there's<00:02:59.850> plenty<00:02:59.940> there

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
average user but there's plenty there

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.100 
average user but there's plenty there
both<00:03:01.440> of<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.769> devices<00:03:02.220> also<00:03:02.430> have<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.150> heart

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
both of the devices also have the heart

against<00:03:13.650> each<00:03:13.739> other<00:03:13.950> yet<00:03:14.220> but<00:03:14.360> if<00:03:15.360> you<00:03:15.600> would

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
against each other yet but if you would

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.270 
against each other yet but if you would
like<00:03:15.720> me<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:15.989> try<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.470> can<00:03:16.650> definitely<00:03:16.800> do

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
like me to try that I can definitely do

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.479 
like me to try that I can definitely do
that

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
that

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.900 
that
oops<00:03:18.590> also<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.950> button<00:03:20.310> placement<00:03:20.489> is

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
oops also the button placement is

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.069 
oops also the button placement is
exactly<00:03:21.570> the<00:03:21.810> same<00:03:22.019> on<00:03:23.090> each<00:03:24.090> side<00:03:24.420> there<00:03:25.049> you

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
exactly the same on each side there you

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.470 
exactly the same on each side there you
can<00:03:25.320> see<00:03:25.530> but<00:03:26.010> another<00:03:26.340> difference<00:03:26.850> is<00:03:27.060> at<00:03:27.299> the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
can see but another difference is at the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.740 
can see but another difference is at the
bottom<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.829> don't<00:03:28.950> have<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.280> USB<00:03:29.670> flap<00:03:30.450> on

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
bottom you don't have the USB flap on

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.470 
bottom you don't have the USB flap on
the<00:03:30.780> s5<00:03:31.680> mini<00:03:31.820> now<00:03:32.820> a<00:03:32.850> lot<00:03:33.030> of<00:03:33.120> people<00:03:33.390> was

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
the s5 mini now a lot of people was

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
the s5 mini now a lot of people was
worried<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:33.959> thought<00:03:34.200> that<00:03:34.470> this<00:03:34.709> may<00:03:34.950> not<00:03:34.980> be

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
worried and thought that this may not be

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.780 
worried and thought that this may not be
water-resistant<00:03:37.500> although<00:03:37.829> it<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:38.040> ip67

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
water-resistant although it is ip67

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.840 
water-resistant although it is ip67
certified<00:03:39.660> like<00:03:39.959> vs<00:03:40.230> 5<00:03:40.500> but<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.400> can<00:03:41.579> assure<00:03:41.700> you

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
certified like vs 5 but I can assure you

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.420 
certified like vs 5 but I can assure you
it<00:03:42.090> definitely<00:03:42.269> is<00:03:43.070> water-resistant<00:03:44.070> if<00:03:44.220> you

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
it definitely is water-resistant if you

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.830 
it definitely is water-resistant if you
check<00:03:44.730> one<00:03:44.910> of<00:03:45.030> my<00:03:45.090> videos<00:03:45.420> in<00:03:45.660> the

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
check one of my videos in the

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.780 
check one of my videos in the
description<00:03:45.870> down<00:03:46.560> below<00:03:46.620> you'll<00:03:47.400> see<00:03:47.430> that

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
description down below you'll see that

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.509 
description down below you'll see that
it<00:03:47.880> is<00:03:48.000> water-resistant<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:48.950> I<00:03:49.950> put<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.400> in

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
it is water-resistant and I put it in

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.039 
it is water-resistant and I put it in
the<00:03:50.670> water<00:03:51.000> for<00:03:51.450> quite<00:03:52.079> a<00:03:52.380> long<00:03:52.620> time<00:03:53.870> but<00:03:54.870> I

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
the water for quite a long time but I

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.150 
the water for quite a long time but I
think<00:03:55.170> that's<00:03:55.470> enough<00:03:55.739> for<00:03:55.980> now<00:03:56.940> guys<00:03:57.269> on
