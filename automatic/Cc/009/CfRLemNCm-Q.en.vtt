00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
is the the 5510 series which is the

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.700 
is the the 5510 series which is the
right<00:02:15.480> they<00:02:15.780> call<00:02:15.930> it<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.140> bright

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
right they call it a bright

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.940 
right they call it a bright
what<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.100> little<00:02:17.430> bit<00:02:17.550> shorter<00:02:18.150> than<00:02:18.950> the

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
what is a little bit shorter than the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.510 
what is a little bit shorter than the
other<00:02:20.220> brush<00:02:20.610> I<00:02:20.790> showed<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.920> try<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.980> plot<00:02:23.220> one

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
other brush I showed you try to plot one

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.300 
other brush I showed you try to plot one
and<00:02:24.210> you'll<00:02:24.480> see<00:02:24.720> here<00:02:24.960> it's<00:02:25.350> shorter<00:02:26.190> in

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
and you'll see here it's shorter in

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.810 
and you'll see here it's shorter in
ratio<00:02:26.580> this<00:02:27.000> one's<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.480> 24<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.380> don't<00:02:29.130> have<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.370> 24

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
ratio this one's a 24 I don't have a 24

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.340 
ratio this one's a 24 I don't have a 24
minutes<00:02:30.090> at<00:02:30.150> 40<00:02:30.390> phone<00:02:30.570> you'll<00:02:30.750> see<00:02:31.020> that<00:02:31.200> the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
minutes at 40 phone you'll see that the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.840 
minutes at 40 phone you'll see that the
two<00:02:31.530> brushes<00:02:32.120> this<00:02:33.120> is<00:02:33.420> shorter<00:02:34.490> size<00:02:35.490> wise

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
two brushes this is shorter size wise

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.940 
two brushes this is shorter size wise
than<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.300> other<00:02:36.450> one<00:02:36.660> let's<00:02:37.320> see<00:02:37.470> if<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.710> have

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
than the other one let's see if I have

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:46.430 
than the other one let's see if I have
one<00:02:42.470> here's<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.530> 16<00:02:44.130> it's<00:02:44.520> not<00:02:45.020> and<00:02:46.020> just<00:02:46.260> see

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
one here's a 16 it's not and just see

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.960 
one here's a 16 it's not and just see
here<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.710> 16<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.340> longer<00:02:47.760> than<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.950> 24<00:02:49.970> so

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
here the 16 is longer than the 24 so

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.700 
here the 16 is longer than the 24 so
these<00:02:51.780> are<00:02:51.960> a<00:02:51.990> little<00:02:52.260> shorter<00:02:52.590> little

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
these are a little shorter little

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.980 
these are a little shorter little
stiffer<00:02:53.250> little<00:02:53.700> thicker<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.300> they<00:02:54.750> just

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
stiffer little thicker and they just

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.670 
stiffer little thicker and they just
give<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.320> real<00:02:55.560> nice<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:56.930> nice<00:02:57.930> look<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.560> them

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
give you a real nice a nice look to them

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.500 
give you a real nice a nice look to them
and<00:02:58.830> they<00:02:58.950> hold<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.280> paint<00:02:59.490> well<00:02:59.670> and<00:03:00.180> it's

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
and they hold the paint well and it's

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.180 
and they hold the paint well and it's
the<00:03:00.720> habit<00:03:00.900> NC<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.350> smooth<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.740> paint<00:03:01.950> more

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
the habit NC to smooth the paint more

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.160 
the habit NC to smooth the paint more
than<00:03:02.370> a<00:03:02.400> bristle<00:03:02.790> brush<00:03:02.820> one<00:03:03.660> way<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.870> look<00:03:04.050> at

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
than a bristle brush one way to look at

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.310 
than a bristle brush one way to look at
the<00:03:04.290> difference<00:03:04.560> between<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.820> lay<00:03:05.820> nickel

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
the difference between a lay nickel

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.190 
the difference between a lay nickel
brush<00:03:07.320> like<00:03:07.770> these<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:09.450> bristle<00:03:09.990> brushes

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
brush like these and the bristle brushes

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.170 
brush like these and the bristle brushes
is<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.920> bristle<00:03:11.280> brushes<00:03:11.490> will<00:03:11.760> leave<00:03:11.970> more

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
is the bristle brushes will leave more

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.500 
is the bristle brushes will leave more
of<00:03:12.240> a<00:03:12.360> track<00:03:12.600> mark<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.970> these<00:03:14.970> will<00:03:15.330> leave

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
of a track mark and these will leave

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.480 
of a track mark and these will leave
less<00:03:15.870> but<00:03:16.170> they<00:03:16.260> still<00:03:16.500> leave<00:03:16.710> paint<00:03:17.190> on<00:03:17.400> the

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
less but they still leave paint on the

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.430 
less but they still leave paint on the
canvas<00:03:17.640> and<00:03:18.090> still<00:03:18.420> leave<00:03:18.600> track<00:03:18.900> marks<00:03:19.230> just

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
canvas and still leave track marks just

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.770 
canvas and still leave track marks just
not<00:03:19.950> as<00:03:20.100> much<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.610> way<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.060> think<00:03:21.300> about<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.630> if

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
not as much a way to think about it if

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.470 
not as much a way to think about it if
you<00:03:21.900> were<00:03:21.990> gonna<00:03:22.080> paint<00:03:22.320> burlap<00:03:23.270> you<00:03:24.270> didn't

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
you were gonna paint burlap you didn't

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.410 
you were gonna paint burlap you didn't
want<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.690> use<00:03:24.900> a<00:03:25.200> bristle<00:03:25.980> brush<00:03:26.010> right<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.210> if

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
want to use a bristle brush right and if

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.200 
want to use a bristle brush right and if
you<00:03:27.480> were<00:03:27.570> gonna<00:03:27.660> paint<00:03:27.900> silk<00:03:28.350> or<00:03:28.700> flowers<00:03:29.700> you

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
you were gonna paint silk or flowers you

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.000 
you were gonna paint silk or flowers you
would<00:03:30.330> use<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:31.100> natural<00:03:32.100> or<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:33.590> sable<00:03:34.590> brush<00:03:34.770> or

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
would use a natural or a sable brush or

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.520 
would use a natural or a sable brush or
a<00:03:35.070> mongoose<00:03:35.820> hair<00:03:36.240> brush<00:03:36.480> that's<00:03:37.110> one<00:03:37.320> way<00:03:37.500> to

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
a mongoose hair brush that's one way to

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.260 
a mongoose hair brush that's one way to
look<00:03:37.710> at<00:03:37.830> could<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.370> do<00:03:38.490> both<00:03:38.730> with<00:03:39.030> both

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
look at could you do both with both

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.870 
look at could you do both with both
absolutely<00:03:40.170> it's<00:03:40.770> just<00:03:40.890> that's<00:03:41.190> kind<00:03:41.730> of<00:03:41.760> a

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
absolutely it's just that's kind of a

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.790 
absolutely it's just that's kind of a
way<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.060> think<00:03:42.330> about<00:03:42.480> it<00:03:42.720> in<00:03:42.810> terms<00:03:42.960> of<00:03:43.260> how

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
way to think about it in terms of how

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.370 
way to think about it in terms of how
the<00:03:43.860> paint's<00:03:44.370> gonna<00:03:44.520> be<00:03:44.790> applied<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.870> the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
the paint's gonna be applied that the

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.470 
the paint's gonna be applied that the
heavier<00:03:46.770> stuff<00:03:46.890> or<00:03:47.310> maybe<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.610> quieter<00:03:48.090> areas

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
heavier stuff or maybe the quieter areas

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.750 
heavier stuff or maybe the quieter areas
like<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.900> shadows<00:03:49.650> maybe<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.100> softer<00:03:50.520> brush

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
like the shadows maybe the softer brush

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.050 
like the shadows maybe the softer brush
and<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:52.190> areas<00:03:53.190> you<00:03:53.250> want<00:03:53.460> more<00:03:53.700> paint<00:03:53.970> to

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
and the areas you want more paint to

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.160 
and the areas you want more paint to
show<00:03:54.300> like<00:03:54.600> on<00:03:54.780> lights<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:56.930> personal<00:03:57.930> brush

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
show like on lights the personal brush

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.430 
show like on lights the personal brush
again<00:03:58.830> no<00:03:59.400> magic<00:03:59.820> you<00:03:59.940> can<00:04:00.000> do<00:04:00.210> both<00:04:00.510> with<00:04:00.840> both

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
again no magic you can do both with both

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.200 
again no magic you can do both with both
it's<00:04:01.680> just<00:04:01.860> that<00:04:02.040> they're<00:04:02.460> both<00:04:02.640> great<00:04:02.910> tools

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
it's just that they're both great tools

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.800 
it's just that they're both great tools
you<00:04:03.420> should<00:04:03.570> try<00:04:03.780> them<00:04:03.930> both<00:04:04.610> okay<00:04:05.660> then<00:04:06.660> the

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
you should try them both okay then the

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.840 
you should try them both okay then the
other<00:04:06.960> thing<00:04:07.230> is<00:04:07.350> for<00:04:07.890> sometimes<00:04:08.250> for<00:04:08.490> detail

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
other thing is for sometimes for detail

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.180 
other thing is for sometimes for detail
work<00:04:09.150> or<00:04:09.390> for<00:04:09.810> putting<00:04:10.170> little<00:04:10.380> lines<00:04:10.620> in<00:04:10.920> or

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
work or for putting little lines in or

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.670 
work or for putting little lines in or
mostly<00:04:12.120> softening<00:04:12.690> edges<00:04:13.020> I<00:04:13.170> got<00:04:13.560> these

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
mostly softening edges I got these
