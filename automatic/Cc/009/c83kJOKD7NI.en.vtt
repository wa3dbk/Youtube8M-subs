00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:03.980
Hi guys, I'm Caroline.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:04.980
And I'm Alejandra.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.450
And to we're making peanut butter crispy rice
treats.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.110
Very simple, just a couple of ingredients.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.920
We have our Crunch Time peanut butter, the
most important.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.939
And just a couple tablespoons of butter.

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.919
Some miniature marshmallows.

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.950
And some crispy rice.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.600
So we have our hot pan already going here.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.630
We're going to add our butter and half cup
of the Crunch Time.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.699
We're just going to stir this together so
that it all melts together.

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.530
So over here we have a pan that's already
been spritzed with a little cooking spray

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.870
and lined with some parchment.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.559
We just have that sitting aside because we're
going to work quickly once we get this all

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:51.559
together.

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:52.559
I'm ready to go.

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.559
Alright!

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:54.559
Let's do this.

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.130
So we're just melting again the butter and
peanut butter together.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.610
Now we're ready for our marshmallows.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.070
You can go ahead and pour all that all those
in.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.370
Alright.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.600
This is great, it's such an easy after school
snack if you have kids.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.600
You can give different types of rice cereal
a try, Like brown rice.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.730
So here you can see the peanut butter, butter,
and marshmallows are just melting together.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.760
It's kind of fun, right?

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.330
So this is actually what you're looking for.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.250
Just so there are no more marshmallow lumps.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.280
You can still see the nice crunchy peanut
butter in there.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.250
And we're just going to pour in this cereal.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.790
Okay, And i'm just going to stir it in.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.850
Turn off the heat and stir it in.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.370
That's a lot of sticky goodness.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.370
Yes!

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.370
That's so cool.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.310
I grew up making these but never thought of
adding peanut butter.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.930
And so I'm just going to go ahead and pour
this hot mixture in the man so just be careful

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.880
to not touch the bubby, the friend helping
you.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.230
Haha, Yes, exactly!

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.570
There we go.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.720
And we're just going to take this second spatula
here and if you want to help me just pack

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.830
it in, all the way to the corners and edges.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.429
It's alright if it's a little messy.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.159
That's fine you know.

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:16.849
Nobody's picky when it comes to crispy rice
treats.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.349
So we're just going to set this aside just
until its cooled and then you can slice it

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.610
up and give it a try.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.569
So here are our treats, nice and cool and
easy to lift out of the pan.

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.030
So we're just going to cut them up and dive
right in.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.030
Those look awesome.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.909
I'm super excited about this.

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.420
So there you have it Peanut Butter Crispy
Rice Treats.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.140
Do you want to give it a try?

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.140
Yes!

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.760
I was going for it already.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.890
Cheers lady.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.959
