instruction if this one's coming this

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.000 
instruction if this one's coming this
there<00:00:18.060> was<00:00:18.270> has<00:00:18.510> come<00:00:18.779> with<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.199> tree<00:00:19.560> search

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
there was has come with the tree search

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.160 
there was has come with the tree search
coil<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.820> good<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.390> small<00:00:21.689> one<00:00:21.720> just

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
coil this is good is the small one just

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.130 
coil this is good is the small one just
for<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.470> surface<00:00:23.269> okay<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:26.689> it<00:00:27.689> comes<00:00:27.990> with

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
for the surface okay and it comes with

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.230 
for the surface okay and it comes with
the<00:00:28.199> medium<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.920> large<00:00:29.220> one<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:29.939> more

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
the medium and the large one so more

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.900 
the medium and the large one so more
people<00:00:30.720> you're<00:00:31.410> gonna<00:00:31.560> change<00:00:31.890> your<00:00:32.189> search

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
people you're gonna change your search

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.389 
people you're gonna change your search
code<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:33.960> circle<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.710> sensitive<00:00:35.219> enough

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
code so this circle is sensitive enough

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.780 
code so this circle is sensitive enough
to<00:00:35.610> detect<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.510> metal<00:00:37.020> pipe<00:00:37.640> under<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
to detect the metal pipe under the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.430 
to detect the metal pipe under the
asphalt<00:00:39.510> or<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.800> concrete<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.690> is<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:43.110> believe

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
asphalt or the concrete and is I believe

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.200 
asphalt or the concrete and is I believe
is<00:00:43.649> Iran<00:00:44.040> like<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> forty<00:00:44.969> or<00:00:45.390> maybe<00:00:45.809> for<00:00:46.940> 30<00:00:47.940> or

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
is Iran like a forty or maybe for 30 or

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.590 
is Iran like a forty or maybe for 30 or
40<00:00:48.440> centimeter<00:00:49.440> deep<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.160> ground<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:51.090> as

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
40 centimeter deep in the ground so as

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.979 
40 centimeter deep in the ground so as
you<00:00:51.780> can<00:00:51.960> see<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.680> metal<00:00:53.100> pipe<00:00:53.780> is<00:00:54.780> in

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
you can see this is a metal pipe is in

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.790 
you can see this is a metal pipe is in
here<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.980> metal<00:00:56.489> pipe<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:57.480> goes<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:58.199> there

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
here is a metal pipe it goes to there

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
here is a metal pipe it goes to there
here<00:00:59.070> glass<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.680> it's<00:01:01.680> coming<00:01:02.129> here<00:01:02.460> as<00:01:02.640> you

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
here glass and it's coming here as you

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.170 
here glass and it's coming here as you
can<00:01:03.030> see<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.480> goes<00:01:03.750> under<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.589> asphalt<00:01:05.180> and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
can see it goes under the asphalt and

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.160 
can see it goes under the asphalt and
I'm<00:01:06.330> dancing<00:01:06.750> here<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.580> it<00:01:08.580> goes<00:01:08.970> other<00:01:09.600> side

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
I'm dancing here and it goes other side

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.390 
I'm dancing here and it goes other side
and<00:01:12.110> they<00:01:13.110> come<00:01:13.409> out<00:01:13.909> right<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.840> here<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:17.250> this

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
and they come out right in here so this

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.600 
and they come out right in here so this
is<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.610> other<00:01:17.850> end<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:19.229> as<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.680> see<00:01:20.009> it's

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
is the other end so as you can see it's

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.800 
is the other end so as you can see it's
in<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:21.150> goes<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:23.280> after<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> did<00:01:24.000> my<00:01:24.240> grand

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
in here goes so after I did my grand

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.010 
in here goes so after I did my grand
balancing<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:26.159> in<00:01:26.369> here<00:01:26.670> as<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.880> can<00:01:27.180> see<00:01:27.450> I'm

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
balancing is in here as you can see I'm

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.920 
balancing is in here as you can see I'm
gonna<00:01:28.259> bring<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.590> my<00:01:29.009> circle<00:01:29.640> close<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.810> it

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
gonna bring that my circle close to it

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.550 
gonna bring that my circle close to it
see<00:01:31.530> even<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.400> meter

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
see even the meter

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.300 
see even the meter
this<00:01:34.159> from<00:01:34.400> here<00:01:34.640> is<00:01:34.850> around<00:01:35.119> 1<00:01:35.450> meter<00:01:36.310> above

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
this from here is around 1 meter above

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.480 
this from here is around 1 meter above
as<00:01:37.790> they<00:01:38.020> give<00:01:39.020> me<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.290> signal<00:01:39.560> for<00:01:40.010> that<00:01:40.070> one

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
as they give me the signal for that one

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.620 
as they give me the signal for that one
so<00:01:41.060> now<00:01:42.009> imagine<00:01:43.009> I'll<00:01:43.340> just<00:01:43.700> put<00:01:44.360> it<00:01:44.479> away

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
so now imagine I'll just put it away

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.469 
so now imagine I'll just put it away
from<00:01:45.080> it<00:01:45.259> C<00:01:46.159> is<00:01:46.310> in<00:01:46.490> here<00:01:46.790> right<00:01:49.330> there's<00:01:50.330> a

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
from it C is in here right there's a

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.760 
from it C is in here right there's a
still<00:01:50.780> show<00:01:51.190> and<00:01:52.190> I<00:01:52.430> go<00:01:52.729> again<00:01:53.390> deep<00:01:53.780> so<00:01:54.530> more

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
still show and I go again deep so more

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.770 
still show and I go again deep so more
go<00:01:54.979> deeper<00:01:55.460> this<00:01:56.149> part<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:59.060> this<00:01:59.240> part<00:01:59.299> will

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
go deeper this part and this part will

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.660 
go deeper this part and this part will
be<00:01:59.810> there<00:02:00.229> like<00:02:00.470> a<00:02:00.500> more<00:02:00.950> deep<00:02:01.190> in<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.490> ground

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
be there like a more deep in the ground

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.180 
be there like a more deep in the ground
so<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.690> amazing<00:02:02.869> thing<00:02:03.380> about<00:02:03.409> this<00:02:03.920> one<00:02:04.159> is

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
so the amazing thing about this one is

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.590 
so the amazing thing about this one is
you<00:02:04.640> will<00:02:05.149> detect<00:02:05.600> it<00:02:05.810> right<00:02:06.110> under<00:02:07.330> on<00:02:08.330> the
