00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 they are all friends, welcome to 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.520
 a new video this champion left behind 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.290
 human weaknesses to become 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.580
 an android to then enter the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.840
 league of legends and prove what 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.550
 great that was his invention 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.150
 today we will have Victor in 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.150
 did you know 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.859
 to begin incorporates being the only 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.689
 champion who is passive granting a 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.369
 Special item which will have to be put 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.289
 necessarily in the six spaces of 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.849
 the systems also that after being 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.609
 bought the hex ' core can not be 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.140
 sold but the cv can be improved 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.969
 of víctor like his laser beam 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.350
 count as projectiles so they can 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.030
 be blocked by the wind wall and 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.140
 the ice shield 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.610
 you will be stunned in the field 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.739
 gravitational if you get to 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.329
 have three stacks or stay a second 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.829
 and medium in it however you can 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.270
 take away or block this debut in 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.039
 any time using the fucking 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.230
 come back or bungee or using a shield 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.489
 before spells something very important that 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.230
 you have to know is that this skill 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.000
 it will remain active even if víctor has 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.410
 dead remember that it is very important 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.820
 know since at some point you can 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.770
 save some ally with stability 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.960
 although you and this body 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.850
 the debit that ray by making it go down 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.559
 A lot of life can also be used to 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.510
 reveal champions that are hidden in 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.920
 the bushes in addition this ability does not 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.810
 has castelló so it can be 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.970
 used while walking or going to steal 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.710
 the blue just like the bird double the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.300
 Ultimate Vctor will remain active and this one 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.420
 dies however will stay in place 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.040
 and can not move it now let's move on to its 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.390
 story at the beginning of his life 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.130
 Victor discovered his passion for 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.600
 science and inventions especially in the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.460
 world of mechanical automation 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.200
 studied at the prestigious faculty of 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.330
 tecma turia de sound and directs the team 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.310
 who created bliss with great success 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.710
 scientist believed that he was going to catapult 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.600
 to the top of his profession however the 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.070
 professor stanwyck stole his triumph at 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.960
 stay with the merit of having created 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.580
 the intelligence of sight and 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.530
 subsequently used the investigations 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.240
 of víctor to revive burgos 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.250
 Victor cold justice but nobody made him 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.259
 case and ended up assuming it makes a deep 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.210
 depression left the faculty and he 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.470
 locked in a private laboratory 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.280
 cutting off all ties with other beings 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.140
 humans 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.490
 there the secret prepares a project of 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.740
 that nobody could take away the merit 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.630
 he wanted to revolutionize his field and also 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.610
 eliminate human emotions from the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.470
 that runs away inside it therefore 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.400
 created mechanical parts with which 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.010
 I would replace 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.900
 to your body 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.780
 If you want your story complete the link 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.950
 I leave it here below in the description 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.540
 the victory story is based on 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.640
 most with the story of the inventor 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.200
 American Serbian and key since 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.970
 the story of víctor he takes care of 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.620
 be in sight but the teacher is 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.570
 week steals his creation and steals the 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.490
 credit very similar to what happened to him 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.840
 to tesla where you took and did he stole the 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.880
 credit for the creation of the focus 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.320
 electric also víctor had done 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.210
 investigations to revive burgos 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.160
 but as I said before the professor 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.660
 it's week he stole the job and he took 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.520
 the credit 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.530
 and has James as a rival since he 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.760
 he is also a Victorian inventor he sees it as 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.680
 an obstacle to your invention 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.840
 Adriana also appears as a rival of 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.190
 him and this is probably because she 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.240
 at first it was also human and 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.050
 then he became a robot 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.940
 now let's go to the curiosities 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.650
 the robot's skin hand 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.170
 prototype can be seen in the video of 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.520
 Panamax launch also by 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.820
 if you did not know it, Vctor was the last 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.110
 champion to be released in 2011 something 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.880
 curious is that víctor has a great 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.590
 similar with víctor bond um or more 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.900
 known as the doctor doom de marvel 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.800
 comics and it's actually that this one is 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.600
 based in part on the doctor doom 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.030
 the dance that makes víctor is a 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.280
 reference to the message that is a step that 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.960
 perhaps you've seen around the 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.980
 prototype editor skin we can 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.810
 observe the beginnings in your 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.610
 transformation into an android when 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.680
 everything he was wearing was just 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.710
 prototype plus this is who makes 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.630
 reference to the guide doctor and I the 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.370
 víctor aquino skin shows her a 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.200
 a fully robotic víctor 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.660
 comparisons or plastic sting this one already 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.030
 does not present human parts and for 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.410
 last the skin because the creator shows 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.300
 to víctor leading the champions with 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.010
 appearance of batteries or warlike armor 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.750
 the best or the champions with their 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.240
 dimension these are the ones that appear 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.650
 these beaches like ropes see with 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.239
 scanner and fumbled in addition to waxes 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.129
 and good friends I hope you liked it 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.329
 this you knew that about víctor remembers 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.790
 leave in the comments if it is that I 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.049
 I forgot to say something essential about not 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.939
 forget to click on the button 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.680
 subscribe to increase floor and 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.510
 get to challenger and leave your like to 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.590
 to continue with this series and see you 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.590
 until next time
