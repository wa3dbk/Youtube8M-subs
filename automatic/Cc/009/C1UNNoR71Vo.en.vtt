00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:07.740
 hello everyone with you misha i am a and we 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.870
 come to the plunger for the umbrella is like years 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.389
 city ​​city well yes it's probably the city we 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.219
 we live in a spa is a van and actually here or 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.020
 the airport is the only effect not 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.230
 only 10 reports for these for 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.779
 airplanes small private private and 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.920
 right here for this parking 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.720
 gorochkoy cut away at it there need 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.010
 climb on the hill to get the most 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.180
 best view of 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.210
 and on days it's very interesting what it is and 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.040
 i decide did this track track and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.379
 the path to the people it rises 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.780
 In fact, the stone here so finland 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:48.270
 you know there is a lot of raking there 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.460
 each floor well yes and in zones actually 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.160
 here it was as if close to 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.260
 north to this as antarctica and it was 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.239
 glacier glacier when dinosaur died 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.469
 like these stones brought him here 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.980
 as far as i'm from my school 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.840
 education know about ah yes well 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.030
 So we actually got into the top can 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.070
 left below ivan plane flies 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.750
 yes and here the planes are landing 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.689
 because behind our back now 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.140
 is boarding one of the boarding 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.060
 the bands off will get and everything as far as 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.320
 when a takes off and take off in the same 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.229
 which they sit on 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.299
 just well very simple here is cool 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.700
 a place so that you stand on a hill 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.430
 and here there is a stone, he is shorter 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.470
 saying flies away and sits on there no longer 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.960
 go as if there were a fence going out 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.630
 somehow the last time there is a lattice there 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.619
 shorter nothing is visible but we can 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.500
 went still there i'm not holy but they 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.930
 soaring far away there is not so 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.970
 here were three times and even we were on the side 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.920
 where they take off but there so nothing but 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.780
 there rarely for some reason they take off well 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.990
 in short there are different places this is the most 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.810
 cool place that 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.240
 Yes, and when in the summer when you lie on your hands 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.950
 it shows him that I have fun below 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.750
 I look so I do not really want to close 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.670
 fly people come here make peace 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.369
 with kebabs 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.009
 with all sorts there for example with such you know 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.869
 like a blanket so that fashion us with 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.700
 some of these dad chicks to 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.280
 sit sit all night over and 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.560
 but not night not night here we are cool 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.450
 if at night finland the same white light 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.690
 at night it can be beautiful 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.269
 it will be even more if you want to be beautiful 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.310
 next to take the name is beautiful it was well yes 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.950
 Well, or a photo of the couple set and excerpt 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.760
 photo but broke flash on 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.860
 highway 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.780
 but flash flash those sky wo n't answer well 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.510
 in short there are many people, although quite 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.160
 still cold and the wind blows but all the people 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.590
 equal here here how many times have we been 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.840
 here is always the people below the machine adios we 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.390
 were the guy was selling down coca cola but 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.350
 not your age n13 boy 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:53.470
 sold there any sneakers 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.390
 idea once I see some 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.700
 dudes so did they succeeded on the wing 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.530
 Well, not well, what can you bring the grill 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.299
 put and sits and by plane 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.450
 the only smell is this 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.790
 what is it called but what is the plane 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:11.700
 kerosene flies to yield kerosene 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:14.430
 yes and for what we have in the forest design guys 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.590
 throwing this coal 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.750
 but this building here went to the house and there 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.310
 Those who then something coal threw not here 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.109
 pretty clean by the way there is no 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.640
 there are no these centurions we give birth 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:29.530
 and the forest and we made ourselves friends to us 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.980
 We were given there about can 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.079
 start sowing this gave herself indicating the forest 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.340
 lacquer arrange he made himself a house yes and 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:42.600
 in short there you can even climb a tree 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.350
 there brother kids down here my name is 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.980
 need climbed on we did home too 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.870
 wave and in short my friend are you talking about 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.140
 talked about the review 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.890
 he screams the water is already extinct dad climbed 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.590
 can 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.980
 if you see it, of course you can fly 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:06.650
 then its end will be easier for dad 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:08.420
 make well shorter to the plane and but i don't 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.420
 I know every five minutes just sit down 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.400
 moreover, because their and that so every 10 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.860
 minutes and oh yes because apparently the weather 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.960
 Good and flights to Helsinki very much 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:21.890
 why fly to canada to spain 

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:23.510
 Russia made it clear well, in short a lot 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.250
 where there is in England somewhere and and 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.520
 transplants have always been in helsinki for 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.450
 This and in Italy such a stupid 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.570
 sticks put on the flanks of paris paris 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.070
 on the secondary well actually yes because 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.170
 such traffic intersection is one of 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.760
 central and main airline 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.910
 Finland, the finer 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.200
 I do not soar number us there she courses 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.080
 people came to tell 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.020
 be interested i have spotted the sand of it 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.230
 flood buy very expensive places need 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.030
 millions of dollars which is what 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.770
 actually such a method unnecessarily eat 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.520
 our as it is seen that the wind is visiting and 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.950
 just and the camera will also be heard from 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.860
 labeled this is my hat I will pull and we went 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:09.980
 to another gorochka yes to that gorochka 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.660
 rise and then we have top well 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.240
 shorter honesty and climb the hill 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:15.950
 check and actually the fountain of Finland 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.570
 because this is the first pony and there in 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.340
 America are flying chocolate planes on 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.530
 dofiga any transplants 5 huge 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.060
 transfer hub all transplant there 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.870
 your mind and report so the plane and 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.460
 there are different on 380 not sit down a 320 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:36.020
 some sit quietly review 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:37.640
 somewhere around 99 percent come on here these flies 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.500
 probably well that's flying the plane 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.230
 screw it flies water probably queen 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.640
 near here when there gu Tamale 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.100
 saint petersburg to saint petersburg 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.750
 fly 40 minutes and this is shorter than ours 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.280
 application called she flight radar 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.350
 24 she paid 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.810
 it shows which planes where 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.790
 is next to us and which go 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.190
 but actually landing now 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:00.070
 flies and takes off recruited very 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.290
 convenient yes you see we will consider accounting 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.730
 you will come with me and you can 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.400
 on each plane click to see where 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:11.190
 he flies what he causing spasms 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:13.420
 you look like it on iphone 5 and in short 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.760
 how does augmented reality work 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.770
 the application can be put on a plane like 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.390
 Here I am, right now, and actually 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.490
 showing something to the plane where is he 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:23.260
 flies and at what time he will need that 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.870
 you see that this is real i am looking at 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.580
 real plane and you can can just 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.110
 put this application without free 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.420
 turn paid not help is no different 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.890
 but shorter link put yes yes shorter 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.290
 just put the application in the sky 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:39.340
 point to if a book near you is 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:41.020
 There kilometers expose 10-20 plane 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:45.580
 it will write to you where this plane flies 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:49.000
 and why are we surely like this now 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.770
 such la la la la la la plane yes yes 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.960
 immediately direct from the cartoon is the plane 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.730
 flies as if and about landing then 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.140
 very comfortable to watch when there 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.690
 next fly suppose if 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.090
 some other one is big 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.880
 and actually conditionally barrier there 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:06.670
 you can actually walk and here's the car 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:10.020
 such so here from all sides and the aircraft 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:14.290
 not infinite fly and accordingly 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:18.130
 principle we all went home now it 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:20.410
 I'll sit down the most I lived in a chair in the nursery 

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:22.090
 not on the baby floor 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:25.210
 not long as a shorter special 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.770
 chair for them not to be cleaned determine well 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:29.230
 yes it should proceed so he just 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:32.830
 bends cannot there very difficult to 

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:35.960
 who will be the chair this here and we went 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:38.789
 of course the trip by police madonna 

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.680
 before the explosion delicious potatoes yah 

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:45.409
 actually all subscribe to the channel 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.409
 Like or Dislike everyone bye bye. 

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:54.919
 more 

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:54.919
 but 

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:04.199
 but
