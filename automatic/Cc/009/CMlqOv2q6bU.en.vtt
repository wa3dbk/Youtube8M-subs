be showing you guys our obsidian farm

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.450 
be showing you guys our obsidian farm
now<00:00:21.250> this<00:00:22.250> is<00:00:22.310> it<00:00:22.610> in<00:00:22.730> front<00:00:22.880> of<00:00:22.970> us<00:00:23.060> and<00:00:24.460> what

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
now this is it in front of us and what

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.720 
now this is it in front of us and what
we<00:00:25.490> have<00:00:25.730> here<00:00:26.119> is<00:00:26.470> just<00:00:27.470> a<00:00:27.739> three-level<00:00:28.430> stone

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
we have here is just a three-level stone

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.690 
we have here is just a three-level stone
encasing<00:00:31.730> pretty<00:00:31.910> much<00:00:32.090> and<00:00:32.829> on<00:00:33.829> top<00:00:34.550> we<00:00:34.579> have

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
encasing pretty much and on top we have

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.310 
encasing pretty much and on top we have
lava<00:00:35.290> but<00:00:37.120> i'll<00:00:38.120> show<00:00:38.300> you<00:00:38.360> the<00:00:38.510> design<00:00:38.840> pretty

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
lava but i'll show you the design pretty

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.080 
lava but i'll show you the design pretty
much<00:00:39.410> we've<00:00:39.649> just<00:00:39.860> got<00:00:40.250> a<00:00:42.010> basic<00:00:43.010> sent<00:00:43.250> lower

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
much we've just got a basic sent lower

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.650 
much we've just got a basic sent lower
block<00:00:44.390> and<00:00:44.780> it's<00:00:44.960> say<00:00:45.890> one<00:00:46.190> and<00:00:47.000> then<00:00:47.120> two<00:00:47.149> and

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
block and it's say one and then two and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.200 
block and it's say one and then two and
then<00:00:48.289> on<00:00:48.890> that<00:00:49.070> second<00:00:49.460> level<00:00:49.670> that<00:00:49.760> comes<00:00:50.000> in

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
then on that second level that comes in

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.500 
then on that second level that comes in
so<00:00:50.929> it<00:00:51.109> comes<00:00:51.260> in<00:00:51.440> by<00:00:51.589> three<00:00:51.800> and<00:00:52.149> then<00:00:53.149> it's

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
so it comes in by three and then it's

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.250 
so it comes in by three and then it's
got<00:00:53.660> a<00:00:54.010> top<00:00:55.010> level<00:00:55.719> now<00:00:56.719> the<00:00:56.780> reason<00:00:57.050> we've

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
got a top level now the reason we've

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.869 
got a top level now the reason we've
done<00:00:57.379> this<00:00:57.530> is<00:00:57.829> that<00:00:58.039> when<00:00:58.370> you<00:00:58.460> have<00:00:58.579> water

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
done this is that when you have water

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.180 
done this is that when you have water
you<00:00:59.660> place<00:00:59.899> the<00:01:00.109> water<00:01:00.320> on<00:01:00.559> these<00:01:02.829> this<00:01:03.829> level

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
you place the water on these this level

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.310 
you place the water on these this level
here<00:01:04.519> so<00:01:04.760> it<00:01:04.879> flows<00:01:05.120> over<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.570> top<00:01:05.810> of<00:01:06.110> the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
here so it flows over the top of the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.190 
here so it flows over the top of the
lava<00:01:06.530> creating<00:01:07.130> obsidian<00:01:07.600> if<00:01:08.600> you<00:01:08.780> had<00:01:08.900> it<00:01:09.020> on

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
lava creating obsidian if you had it on

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.050 
lava creating obsidian if you had it on
the<00:01:09.350> same<00:01:09.560> level<00:01:09.590> it<00:01:10.130> would<00:01:10.250> create<00:01:10.460> a

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
the same level it would create a

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.780 
the same level it would create a
cobblestone<00:01:11.980> hardened<00:01:12.980> rock<00:01:13.220> pretty<00:01:13.790> much

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
cobblestone hardened rock pretty much

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.999 
cobblestone hardened rock pretty much
it's<00:01:16.790> not<00:01:16.909> that<00:01:17.030> hard<00:01:17.149> to<00:01:17.240> build<00:01:17.420> we've<00:01:18.229> we<00:01:18.829> did

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
it's not that hard to build we've we did

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.510 
it's not that hard to build we've we did
spawn<00:01:19.280> Marva<00:01:19.700> for<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.149> purpose<00:01:20.509> of

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
spawn Marva for the purpose of

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.800 
spawn Marva for the purpose of
multiplayer<00:01:22.520> because<00:01:22.880> buckets<00:01:23.360> don't<00:01:23.630> work

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
multiplayer because buckets don't work

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.149 
multiplayer because buckets don't work
and<00:01:24.140> we're<00:01:24.439> not<00:01:24.500> going<00:01:24.770> to<00:01:24.860> bother<00:01:24.979> with

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
and we're not going to bother with

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.060 
and we're not going to bother with
bucket<00:01:25.610> fixes<00:01:25.970> in<00:01:26.210> plugins<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:27.909> yeah<00:01:28.909> it's

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
bucket fixes in plugins so yeah it's

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.050 
bucket fixes in plugins so yeah it's
pretty<00:01:31.070> big<00:01:31.310> I'll<00:01:31.729> give<00:01:31.850> you<00:01:31.909> guys<00:01:32.030> a

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
pretty big I'll give you guys a

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.319 
pretty big I'll give you guys a
demonstration<00:01:32.630> in<00:01:32.869> a<00:01:32.960> sec<00:01:34.689> hey<00:01:35.689> piggy<00:01:37.329> it's

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
demonstration in a sec hey piggy it's

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.120 
demonstration in a sec hey piggy it's
you<00:01:39.020> can<00:01:39.170> make<00:01:39.290> it<00:01:39.380> as<00:01:39.439> big<00:01:39.619> as<00:01:39.740> you<00:01:39.799> want<00:01:40.039> it

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
you can make it as big as you want it

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.679 
you can make it as big as you want it
doesn't<00:01:40.250> have<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.579> be<00:01:40.610> as<00:01:40.789> big<00:01:40.939> as<00:01:41.060> this<00:01:41.180> if

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
doesn't have to be as big as this if

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:42.670 
doesn't have to be as big as this if
you're<00:01:41.810> playing<00:01:41.930> a<00:01:42.020> single<00:01:42.259> player<00:01:42.439> you<00:01:42.560> can

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
you're playing a single player you can

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.709 
you're playing a single player you can
make<00:01:42.799> it<00:01:42.890> a<00:01:42.950> lot<00:01:43.100> smaller<00:01:43.310> because<00:01:44.210> collecting

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
make it a lot smaller because collecting

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:49.450 
make it a lot smaller because collecting
lava<00:01:45.140> is<00:01:45.380> harder<00:01:45.969> definitely<00:01:47.469> in<00:01:48.469> when<00:01:49.369> you

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
lava is harder definitely in when you

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.980 
lava is harder definitely in when you
buy<00:01:49.610> yourself<00:01:49.899> but<00:01:50.899> yeah<00:01:51.079> I'll<00:01:51.259> show<00:01:51.500> you

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.070 

what<00:01:55.990> happens<00:01:56.290> when<00:01:56.439> you<00:01:56.619> put<00:01:57.580> water<00:01:58.080> over

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
what happens when you put water over

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.510 
what happens when you put water over
this<00:02:00.040> is<00:02:00.280> just<00:02:00.549> using<00:02:01.360> her<00:02:01.720> mod<00:02:02.280> replace<00:02:03.280> water

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
this is just using her mod replace water

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.719 
this is just using her mod replace water
like<00:02:03.759> that<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:07.240> does<00:02:07.930> that<00:02:08.250> get<00:02:09.250> some<00:02:09.459> sand

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
like that it does that get some sand

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:20.120 
like that it does that get some sand
from<00:02:09.850> down<00:02:10.119> here<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:17.020> that's<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.440> result<00:02:17.560> of

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.740 

the<00:02:21.130> water<00:02:21.340> going<00:02:22.150> over<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.450> top<00:02:22.569> of<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.780> lava

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.240 

not<00:02:28.750> too<00:02:28.930> hard<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.140> build<00:02:29.319> pretty<00:02:29.860> simple

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
not too hard to build pretty simple

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.220 
not too hard to build pretty simple
design<00:02:30.580> doesn't<00:02:31.209> have<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.450> be<00:02:31.540> complicated<00:02:31.690> at

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
design doesn't have to be complicated at

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.740 
design doesn't have to be complicated at
all<00:02:32.819> probably<00:02:33.819> make<00:02:33.940> it<00:02:33.970> one<00:02:34.180> Laura<00:02:34.420> as<00:02:34.569> well

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
all probably make it one Laura as well

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.000 
all probably make it one Laura as well
if<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:34.930> wanted<00:02:35.170> you<00:02:35.200> could<00:02:35.290> just<00:02:35.530> dig<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.739> hole

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
if you wanted you could just dig a hole

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.590 
if you wanted you could just dig a hole
in<00:02:36.069> the<00:02:36.370> ground<00:02:36.580> fill<00:02:37.239> it<00:02:37.360> in<00:02:37.450> with<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.860> lava

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
in the ground fill it in with the lava

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.270 
in the ground fill it in with the lava
put<00:02:40.600> a<00:02:40.630> Ledge<00:02:41.080> on<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.350> side<00:02:41.530> of<00:02:41.560> it<00:02:41.739> put<00:02:42.190> your

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
put a Ledge on the side of it put your

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.479 
put a Ledge on the side of it put your
water<00:02:42.400> in<00:02:42.640> nothing<00:02:42.819> like<00:02:43.500> yeah<00:02:44.500> thanks<00:02:45.459> for

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
water in nothing like yeah thanks for

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.819 
water in nothing like yeah thanks for
watching
