00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.640
 redres 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.960
 waregem, not for angels 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.030
 has an afternoon thomas card 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.849
 suggested that who has academy 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.590
 within DC comes reinforcing for the tube 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.030
 to football supporter he is thomas no 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.970
 unknown 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.380
 you are a former soccer player i have nine 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.010
 been down or soccer player for years 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.529
 inter alia at westerlo asking and eg 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.010
 in the Netherlands and Sint-Truiden 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.140
 I was head coach for a year 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.060
 at central including other mine 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.730
 The last march on Zulu Waregem was the 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.750
 at 300 breezes I resigned there myself 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.580
 given 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.489
 after that i completely devoted myself to it 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.309
 training youth players in a number 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.530
 own projects and last 5 years one 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.460
 assistant technical director and the jmg 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.809
 academy 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.460
 You are now with Zulu Waregem me 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.600
 specifically at the youth academy of 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.239
 waregem 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.239
 what exactly are you going to do yes i had it 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.410
 first part of youth work 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.620
 of such a car 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.019
 the intention is that we can sugar 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.870
 start with very big talents 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:09.560
 the train starts twenty hours a week 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.050
 combination with education and boarding school 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.460
 and that's how it demented them 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.860
 youth education to a very high level 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.450
 we can bring the that specific 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.790
 to tackle 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.130
 specific so that we are going to try one 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.070
 small group to start from 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.340
 a dozen or little players in 2000 2001 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.830
 one that he will form a basis for 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.690
 a larger group later that those players 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.650
 so specific 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.040
 four hour trains go by aster 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.500
 waregem 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.710
 explain under my authority how 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.920
 that is specifically linked to the 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.880
 existing youth work of such commodities 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.920
 so yes firstly it can already 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.700
 players are from Zulu Waregem itself 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.909
 let's hope 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.860
 that they want to get in with it 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.200
 second everything will function on it 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.610
 training complex of zulte waregem 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.009
 I will also integrate myself in the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.140
 youth work between the quran too 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.630
 coordinators in the trainers to bit 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.910
 to impart my know-how and experience 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.920
 and those players will 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.170
 also I will specifically drive member 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.240
 are from Zulu Waregem but so many none 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.450
 competition matches played the first 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.440
 number of days and that's why she is 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.940
 no league matches will 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.620
 because there will be a specific reason 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.630
 for his yes 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.580
 I often asked the question how is your 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.500
 bourgeois in you then many people say 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.970
 yes we go to university i say 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.950
 yes no you must first go to the 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.990
 after the crash and then after primary school 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.950
 go through an entire process are seven 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.630
 eight steps 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.150
 I think that's what we do in youth education 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.890
 we also have to do with the children 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.810
 put the child at the center of the rhythm 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.250
 of the child and on a very 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.160
 technical 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.450
 learn to play football in an intelligent way 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.610
 first in smaller spaces with 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.670
 smaller numbers and gradually larger and 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.770
 larger to 17 is 18 years old and 11 to 11 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.440
 can play and what is the final 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.470
 goal the ultimate goal is that they 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.990
 all play in the rainbow stadium 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.030
 that anything in the words of 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.310
 Patrick Decuyper saying so much 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.740
 possible players from a youth preferably 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.940
 Belgians at the kick-off to appear on 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.220
 it attacks 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.790
 the intention is that within the foreseeable future 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.940
 time all core players consist of themselves 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.010
 trained players from youth work 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.170
 depth effect as the sock score 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.840
 will venture is really almost foreseeable time 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.730
 so then we still have a 6 after 10 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.170
 years before and 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.910
 before we take the 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.520
 first fruits of seeing 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.980
 patience is very important talent is one 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.900
 second thing and hard work and a lot 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.270
 tears is something else and that he 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.920
 you must try 10,000 dares anyway 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.420
 the trains between 8 and 18 years old to prof 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.610
 and then we go the players 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.410
 So try to offer tomorrow will 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.050
 they are not yet ready but with 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.060
 We will go with the necessary patience 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.620
 we see the necessary benefits 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.630
 First, you think that patience animals 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.489
 at patrick decuyper she present at the 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.230
 other people also have one that is absolute 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.270
 philosophy to give young people a chance 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.820
 that it is certainly present here whatever 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.200
 the basis is absolutely to have such a project 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.260
 to succeed 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:14.650
 final questions why is this unique in Belgium 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:18.090
 because it is unique because a club in ter 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:21.760
 sizes really want to invest in youth 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.050
 that degree is that is that unique that too 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.880
 such a project within one's own 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.960
 youth work continues 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.960
 thank you so much thomas and good luck
