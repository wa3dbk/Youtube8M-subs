00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
other charms and when I couldn't find it

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.330 
other charms and when I couldn't find it
I<00:00:42.030> decided<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.870> get<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.290> instead<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.309> I

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
I decided to get this instead so I

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.240 
I decided to get this instead so I
didn't<00:00:44.940> experiments<00:00:45.750> because<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.320> was

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
didn't experiments because I was

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.279 
didn't experiments because I was
wondering<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.180> would<00:00:48.539> turn<00:00:48.809> out<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.050> be

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
wondering if this would turn out to be

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.680 
wondering if this would turn out to be
squishy<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.579> was<00:00:50.730> wondering<00:00:51.180> if<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.480> could

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
squishy and I was wondering if I could

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.220 
squishy and I was wondering if I could
make<00:00:51.840> molds<00:00:52.289> out<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:52.770> as<00:00:52.980> well<00:00:53.309> so<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.570> it

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
make molds out of this as well so and it

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.590 
make molds out of this as well so and it
does<00:00:55.469> work<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.420> looks<00:00:57.600> like

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
does work and this is what it looks like

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:12.260 
does work and this is what it looks like
so<00:01:00.600> I'm<00:01:00.809> going<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.170> show<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:10.460> I<00:01:11.460> really

fun<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.630> play<00:01:15.810> with<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:17.130> takes<00:01:17.759> about<00:01:18.110> 24<00:01:19.110> hours

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
fun to play with it takes about 24 hours

to be see so yeah this was just

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.729 
to be see so yeah this was just
experiments<00:02:57.360> I'm<00:02:57.540> not<00:02:57.840> sure<00:02:58.019> if<00:02:58.170> I'm<00:02:58.320> actually

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
experiments I'm not sure if I'm actually

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.030 
experiments I'm not sure if I'm actually
going<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.519> use<00:02:59.700> this<00:03:00.000> mold<00:03:00.350> maybe<00:03:01.350> this<00:03:01.709> one

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
going to use this mold maybe this one

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.780 
going to use this mold maybe this one
but<00:03:02.340> maybe<00:03:03.030> not<00:03:03.330> this<00:03:03.600> one<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:04.340> don't<00:03:05.340> really

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
but maybe not this one I don't really

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.440 
but maybe not this one I don't really
like<00:03:06.269> it<00:03:06.569> it's<00:03:06.750> not<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.350> best<00:03:07.620> but<00:03:08.040> I'll<00:03:08.610> try

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
like it it's not the best but I'll try

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.050 
like it it's not the best but I'll try
to<00:03:09.510> see<00:03:10.110> what<00:03:10.320> I<00:03:10.350> can<00:03:10.440> do<00:03:10.739> with<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.130> and<00:03:11.340> I

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060
