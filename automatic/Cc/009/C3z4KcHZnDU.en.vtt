00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
flush into the side so very very neat

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.560 
flush into the side so very very neat
and<00:01:35.229> compact<00:01:35.679> when<00:01:36.670> that<00:01:36.880> cable<00:01:37.240> is<00:01:37.329> not<00:01:37.479> in

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
sort of sort of soft to the touch and

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.539 
sort of sort of soft to the touch and
then<00:01:55.149> it's<00:01:55.299> got<00:01:55.420> plastic<00:01:55.929> embedded<00:01:56.649> around

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
then it's got plastic embedded around

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.719 
then it's got plastic embedded around
the<00:01:58.119> inside<00:01:58.600> giving<00:01:59.049> its<00:01:59.170> rigidity<00:01:59.499> and<00:01:59.950> then

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
the inside giving its rigidity and then

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.459 
the inside giving its rigidity and then
it's<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:00.969> very<00:02:01.149> simple<00:02:01.359> device<00:02:01.810> we<00:02:02.079> just<00:02:02.259> lift

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
it's a very simple device we just lift

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:06.599 
it's a very simple device we just lift
this<00:02:02.619> portion<00:02:03.009> up<00:02:03.100> here<00:02:03.749> this<00:02:04.749> is<00:02:05.369> feels<00:02:06.369> like

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
this portion up here this is feels like

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:08.490 
this portion up here this is feels like
metal<00:02:07.030> but<00:02:07.240> I<00:02:07.389> think<00:02:07.840> that<00:02:08.080> this<00:02:08.170> is<00:02:08.259> pretty

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
metal but I think that this is pretty

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.309 
metal but I think that this is pretty
sure<00:02:08.710> this<00:02:08.890> is<00:02:08.950> plastic<00:02:09.869> let<00:02:10.869> me<00:02:10.960> just<00:02:11.110> have<00:02:11.290> a

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
sure this is plastic let me just have a

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.130 
sure this is plastic let me just have a
look<00:02:11.580> yes<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:12.819> is<00:02:13.000> plastic<00:02:13.600> because<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:14.050> is

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
look yes this is plastic because it is

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.559 
look yes this is plastic because it is
quite<00:02:14.380> flexible<00:02:14.650> and<00:02:15.280> it's<00:02:15.910> got<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.090> rubber<00:02:16.270> tip

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
quite flexible and it's got a rubber tip

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.570 
quite flexible and it's got a rubber tip
on<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:16.840> here<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.290> give<00:02:17.409> some<00:02:17.590> grip<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.159> then

on it here to give some grip and then

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.240 
on it here to give some grip and then
the<00:02:18.700> dock<00:02:18.909> connector<00:02:19.420> resides<00:02:20.049> under<00:02:20.319> here<00:02:20.739> so

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
the dock connector resides under here so

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.620 
the dock connector resides under here so
we've<00:02:21.370> got<00:02:21.519> this<00:02:21.670> sort

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.040 
onto the angled portion of the little
stand<00:02:41.920> here<00:02:42.280> now<00:02:42.820> it's<00:02:43.030> very<00:02:43.390> very<00:02:43.660> simple<00:02:43.690> in

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
stand here now it's very very simple in

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.230 
stand here now it's very very simple in
its<00:02:44.110> use<00:02:44.350> obviously<00:02:44.950> you<00:02:45.340> can<00:02:45.520> have<00:02:46.030> it<00:02:46.120> at

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
its use obviously you can have it at

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.940 
its use obviously you can have it at
more<00:02:46.570> of<00:02:46.600> an<00:02:46.690> angle<00:02:46.810> like<00:02:47.020> so<00:02:47.440> that's<00:02:47.710> probably

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
more of an angle like so that's probably

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.730 
more of an angle like so that's probably
the<00:02:48.880> most<00:02:49.240> laid<00:02:49.630> back<00:02:49.660> angle<00:02:50.320> it's<00:02:50.470> going<00:02:50.620> to

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
the most laid back angle it's going to

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.670 
the most laid back angle it's going to
offer<00:02:50.920> up<00:02:51.340> or<00:02:51.580> we<00:02:52.120> can<00:02:52.330> in<00:02:52.480> fact<00:02:52.510> sort<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:53.530> make

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
offer up or we can in fact sort of make

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.640 
offer up or we can in fact sort of make
it<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:53.890> little<00:02:54.010> bit<00:02:54.220> more<00:02:54.370> up<00:02:54.640> right<00:02:55.000> now<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:56.470> has

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
it a little bit more up right now it has

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.830 
it a little bit more up right now it has
got<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.920> downside<00:02:57.340> of<00:02:57.610> course<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.360> can't<00:02:58.600> use

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
got the downside of course you can't use

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.720 
got the downside of course you can't use
this<00:02:58.990> in<00:02:59.170> landscape<00:02:59.740> position<00:02:59.890> so<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.580> is

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
this in landscape position so this is

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.910 
this in landscape position so this is
purely<00:03:01.120> just<00:03:01.360> for<00:03:01.600> docking<00:03:02.020> and<00:03:02.170> charging<00:03:02.260> and

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
purely just for docking and charging and

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.860 
purely just for docking and charging and
syncing<00:03:03.000> you're<00:03:04.000> not<00:03:04.150> going<00:03:04.270> to<00:03:04.360> use<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.690> while

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
syncing you're not going to use it while

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.840 
syncing you're not going to use it while
you're<00:03:04.990> watching<00:03:05.200> videos<00:03:05.830> but<00:03:06.430> it's<00:03:06.490> very

you're watching videos but it's very

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.080 
you're watching videos but it's very
very<00:03:07.210> useful<00:03:07.750> we<00:03:08.260> can<00:03:08.500> even<00:03:08.770> go<00:03:08.980> into<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.730> really

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
very useful we can even go into a really

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.600 
very useful we can even go into a really
upright<00:03:10.570> position<00:03:11.050> and<00:03:11.170> this<00:03:11.740> rubber<00:03:12.070> portion

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
upright position and this rubber portion

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.670 
upright position and this rubber portion
on<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.850> back<00:03:13.230> really<00:03:14.230> does<00:03:14.380> a<00:03:14.410> good<00:03:14.620> job

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
on the back really does a good job

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.410 
on the back really does a good job
because<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.250> means<00:03:15.430> that<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:15.730> your<00:03:16.210> phone

because it means that you your phone

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.150 
because it means that you your phone
doesn't<00:03:16.660> slip<00:03:17.020> back<00:03:17.200> down<00:03:17.440> so<00:03:17.890> it<00:03:17.980> does<00:03:18.130> a

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
doesn't slip back down so it does a

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.700 
doesn't slip back down so it does a
really<00:03:18.490> good<00:03:18.760> job<00:03:18.820> and<00:03:19.270> of<00:03:20.050> course<00:03:20.080> when<00:03:20.620> you
