superior line with less stretch which we
know<00:00:27.660> means<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.990> gives<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.380> lots<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.890> extra

sort of if you're overcast it's going to
hold<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:35.579> not<00:00:35.640> going<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.850> go<00:00:35.910> straight

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
hold it so it's not going to go straight

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.270 
hold it so it's not going to go straight
into<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.719> trees<00:00:37.020> when<00:00:37.920> you're<00:00:38.040> trying<00:00:38.160> to

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
into the trees when you're trying to

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.830 
into the trees when you're trying to
fill<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.610> lead<00:00:38.790> down<00:00:39.000> because<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.660> lack<00:00:39.809> of

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
fill the lead down because the lack of

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.450 
fill the lead down because the lack of
stretch<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.469> feel<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.860> bottom<00:00:41.070> but<00:00:41.370> it

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
stretch you can feel the bottom but it

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.610 
stretch you can feel the bottom but it
gives<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.790> all-important<00:00:42.450> dunk<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.410> for

gives you that all-important dunk so for

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.020 
gives you that all-important dunk so for
me<00:00:43.770> that's<00:00:44.219> not<00:00:44.430> going<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.610> be<00:00:44.700> used<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:44.940> I've

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
me that's not going to be used and I've

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.549 
me that's not going to be used and I've
gone<00:00:45.149> for<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.360> 15-pound<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.110> brown<00:00:46.320> is

gone for the 15-pound in brown is
available<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.039> green<00:00:47.219> as<00:00:47.430> well<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.210> guess

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
available in green as well and I guess

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.910 
available in green as well and I guess
you<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.510> pick<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.379> suits<00:00:49.739> your

lake better so first of all contrary to
popular<00:00:53.219> belief<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.940> mistake<00:00:54.059> that

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
popular belief and it's a mistake that

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.360 
popular belief and it's a mistake that
I've<00:00:54.539> made<00:00:54.570> on<00:00:54.930> numerous<00:00:55.199> occasions<00:00:55.829> it's

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
that's right at the back very rarely

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.940 
that's right at the back very rarely
sees<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> light<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.659> day<00:01:18.810> as<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.619> starting

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
sees the light of day as that starting

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.560 
sees the light of day as that starting
to<00:01:20.070> contract<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.850> goes<00:01:21.030> really<00:01:21.360> really

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
to contract it goes really really

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.170 
to contract it goes really really
crinkly<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.500> feels<00:01:22.860> brittle<00:01:23.549> now<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.000> don't

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
crinkly and it feels brittle now I don't

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.520 
crinkly and it feels brittle now I don't
think<00:01:24.420> actually<00:01:24.659> does<00:01:24.780> anything<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.200> damage

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
think actually does anything to damage

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.960 
think actually does anything to damage
the<00:01:25.680> line<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.009> when<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.189> do<00:01:26.340> eventually<00:01:26.460> get

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the line but when you do eventually get

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.120 
the line but when you do eventually get
to<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.150> part<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:28.290> just<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:28.650> very<00:01:28.829> nice<00:01:28.979> it

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
to that part it's just not very nice it

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.590 
to that part it's just not very nice it
just<00:01:29.159> doesn't<00:01:29.579> behave<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.880> way<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
just doesn't behave the way that a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.929 
just doesn't behave the way that a
normal<00:01:30.659> mono<00:01:31.079> should<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:32.100> having<00:01:32.729> checked

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
normal mono should so having checked

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.429 
normal mono should so having checked
with<00:01:33.150> him<00:01:33.299> he<00:01:33.479> said<00:01:33.659> give<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.840> aside<00:01:34.110> for<00:01:34.140> maybe

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
with him he said give it aside for maybe

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.530 
with him he said give it aside for maybe
30<00:01:34.710> minutes<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.220> an<00:01:35.369> hour<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.210> more<00:01:36.450> and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
30 minutes to an hour and that more and

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.300 
30 minutes to an hour and that more and
more<00:01:36.600> just<00:01:36.990> allows<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.439> spool<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.979> take<00:01:38.159> on

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
more just allows the spool to take on

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.090 
more just allows the spool to take on
enough<00:01:38.520> water<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.720> make<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.020> softer<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.680> nicer

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
enough water to make it softer and nicer

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.190 
enough water to make it softer and nicer
so<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:41.909> nice<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.090> tight<00:01:42.299> when<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.750> do<00:01:42.899> spoil

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
so it's nice and tight when you do spoil

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.080 
so it's nice and tight when you do spoil
it<00:01:43.320> on<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:44.070> once<00:01:44.250> that's<00:01:44.399> done<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:44.909> on

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
it on so once that's done and it's on

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.210 
it on so once that's done and it's on
you<00:01:45.509> thread<00:01:45.750> your<00:01:45.780> line<00:01:46.079> back<00:01:46.799> through<00:01:46.860> your

you've<00:02:21.299> had<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.420> few<00:02:21.629> casts<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.230> lines<00:02:22.409> got

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
you've had a few casts and the lines got

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.619 
you've had a few casts and the lines got
wet<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.159> you're<00:02:23.610> reeling<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.120> back<00:02:24.269> in<00:02:24.450> under

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
wet and you're reeling it back in under

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.390 
wet and you're reeling it back in under
tension<00:02:24.900> you'll<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.470> notice<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:26.040> actually

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
tension you'll so notice this actually

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.130 
tension you'll so notice this actually
under<00:02:26.640> field<00:02:26.909> and<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.510> could<00:02:27.689> sort<00:02:28.049> of

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
under field and that could sort of

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.080 
under field and that could sort of
hinder<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.620> when<00:02:28.799> it<00:02:28.920> comes<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.250> casting<00:02:29.760> real

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
hinder you when it comes to casting real

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.539 
hinder you when it comes to casting real
long<00:02:30.299> distances<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.650> there<00:02:31.769> you<00:02:31.829> go<00:02:31.980> nice<00:02:32.310> and

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
long distances so there you go nice and

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.210 
long distances so there you go nice and
simple<00:02:32.940> keep<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.390> line<00:02:33.540> tight<00:02:33.569> wind<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.500> on<00:02:34.590> so

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
simple keep the line tight wind it on so

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.009 
simple keep the line tight wind it on so
it's<00:02:35.400> just<00:02:35.579> sort<00:02:36.090> of<00:02:36.120> level<00:02:36.510> with<00:02:36.629> the<00:02:36.690> lip<00:02:36.870> of

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
it's just sort of level with the lip of

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.340 
it's just sort of level with the lip of
the<00:02:37.049> spool<00:02:37.379> and<00:02:37.560> you're<00:02:37.920> ready<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.220> go
