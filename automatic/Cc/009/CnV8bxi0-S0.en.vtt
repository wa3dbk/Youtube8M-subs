00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
still have no idea what I'm going to

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.689 
still have no idea what I'm going to
call<00:05:45.180> him<00:05:45.330> the<00:05:46.169> silver<00:05:46.919> wasn't<00:05:47.310> quite<00:05:47.490> working

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
call him the silver wasn't quite working

call him the silver wasn't quite working
the<00:05:47.940> way<00:05:48.060> I<00:05:48.090> expected<00:05:48.270> so<00:05:48.810> I<00:05:48.840> kind<00:05:49.169> of<00:05:49.259> had

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:49.409 
the way I expected so I kind of had

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:52.100 
the way I expected so I kind of had
improvised<00:05:50.190> with<00:05:50.460> the<00:05:50.610> color<00:05:50.880> scheme<00:05:51.120> so

improvised with the color scheme so

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.080 
improvised with the color scheme so
therefore<00:05:52.469> I<00:05:52.710> have<00:05:53.069> no<00:05:53.130> idea<00:05:53.460> what<00:05:53.819> I'm<00:05:53.940> going
