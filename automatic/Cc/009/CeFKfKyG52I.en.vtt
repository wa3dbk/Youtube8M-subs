didn't live a snob at me it was about
squad<00:03:04.600> and<00:03:04.810> you<00:03:05.320> know<00:03:05.440> they<00:03:05.830> need<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.100> be

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
squad and you know they need to be

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.890 
squad and you know they need to be
positive<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.790> I<00:03:06.910> don't<00:03:07.330> be<00:03:07.420> going<00:03:07.450> into<00:03:07.780> the

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
positive and I don't be going into the

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.870 
positive and I don't be going into the
final<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:08.470> I<00:03:08.710> think<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.250> hardest<00:03:09.460> day<00:03:09.610> for<00:03:09.790> me

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
final so I think the hardest day for me

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.370 
final so I think the hardest day for me

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.190 
and we walked out on that pitch on
Saturday<00:03:12.520> and<00:03:12.850> that<00:03:13.090> was<00:03:13.240> heartbreaking<00:03:13.840> for

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
Saturday and that was heartbreaking for

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.080 
Saturday and that was heartbreaking for
