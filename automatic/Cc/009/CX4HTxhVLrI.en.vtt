00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.730
 The first thing we will do is catch each 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.850
 one of our threads help us with 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.920
 our rule and cost 80 centimeters of 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.770
 everyone do not worry about the tape 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.660
 pearls that is very easy to cut well 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.930
 that with other scissors we will be able to 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.930
 do 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.970
 and now, what we are going to do will be 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.690
 catch the tips 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.000
 to accommodate them and we're going to take our 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.550
 bandita let's go through the middle of 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.740
 our little band and we're going to make a knot 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.710
 simple leaving at least 5 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.030
 centimeters of space 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.760
 we pull very well and we align all 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.800
 our threads the black thread in this 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.170
 case is going to be the one on the right side the 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.330
 the pearls of the middle and the tail of 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.740
 rat the other end 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.119
 now simply what we are going to do 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.119
 will braid 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.859
 normally a normal braid you're going to 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.429
 give an account that it will remain as a 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:40.159
 Mermaid braid since the black ribbon is 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:43.580
 much thicker 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.220
 and that's going to be the whole procedure 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.390
 every time it's a turn try that 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.450
 do not go tangling 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.220
 and stretching so that it goes taking the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.980
 shape 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.890
 this project is very beautiful and I think 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.450
 very simple you can do it from the 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.180
 colors you want if you want you can 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.790
 change up the color of the tape to 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.100
 that is more striking 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.590
 my hair color as it is dark because no 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.290
 you're going to see a lot of black tape but 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.010
 Well, it's very nice anyway 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.780
 when we have braided the desired length 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.570
 let's take what we have left 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.290
 pass it again by the bandit and go 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.900
 to knot again we talk everything very well 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.710
 that is well insured we cut the 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.110
 leftovers 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.730
 I recommend that the tips 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.230
 of the tapes to give us the yes the 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.230
 che and ready 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.680
 just turn around you'll go 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.410
