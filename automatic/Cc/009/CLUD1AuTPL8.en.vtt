hello<00:00:01.709> we're<00:00:01.979> going<00:00:02.010> to<00:00:02.129> talk<00:00:02.280> about<00:00:02.480> quills

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hello we're going to talk about quills

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.059 
hello we're going to talk about quills
today<00:00:03.840> we<00:00:04.470> got<00:00:04.620> regular<00:00:05.130> quote<00:00:05.339> and<00:00:06.240> we<00:00:06.660> have

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
today we got regular quote and we have

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.709 
today we got regular quote and we have
high-performance<00:00:08.069> coil<00:00:08.490> we<00:00:08.700> call<00:00:08.910> those<00:00:09.090> HP

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
high-performance coil we call those HP

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.160 
high-performance coil we call those HP
for<00:00:10.050> high-performance<00:00:12.019> what's<00:00:13.019> the

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
for high-performance what's the

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.650 
for high-performance what's the
difference<00:00:13.620> well<00:00:14.490> one<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.820> black<00:00:15.030> diamonds

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
difference well one is black diamonds

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:23.450 
difference well one is black diamonds
orange<00:00:18.980> also<00:00:20.480> another<00:00:21.480> thing<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.020> that<00:00:22.460> this

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
orange also another thing is that this

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.359 
orange also another thing is that this
one<00:00:23.699> our<00:00:24.689> performance<00:00:25.230> one<00:00:25.410> supposed<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.220> give

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
one our performance one supposed to give

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.710 
one our performance one supposed to give
you<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.550> more<00:00:26.820> intense<00:00:27.330> spark<00:00:28.939> so<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.510> one

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
you a more intense spark so the one

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.299 
you a more intense spark so the one
there's<00:00:30.960> probably<00:00:31.230> more<00:00:31.439> windings<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.070> there

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
there's probably more windings in there

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.750 
there's probably more windings in there
and<00:00:32.430> stuff<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:34.010> some<00:00:35.010> people<00:00:35.280> do<00:00:35.489> see<00:00:35.730> a

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
and stuff and some people do see a

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.600 
and stuff and some people do see a
difference<00:00:36.180> but<00:00:37.040> not<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.100> tremendous

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
difference but not a tremendous

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.790 
difference but not a tremendous
difference<00:00:38.790> usually<00:00:39.300> your<00:00:39.420> CDI<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.739> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
difference usually your CDI is going to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.549 
difference usually your CDI is going to
give<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> more<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:42.180> know<00:00:42.329> pep<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
give you a more you know pep for the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.440 
give you a more you know pep for the
buck<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:46.280> one<00:00:47.280> thing<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.550> people<00:00:47.940> don't

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
buck but one thing that people don't

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.299 
buck but one thing that people don't
know<00:00:48.629> about<00:00:48.660> some<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.350> these<00:00:49.410> coils<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.100> that

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
know about some of these coils is that

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.060 
know about some of these coils is that
you<00:00:50.460> could<00:00:50.610> unscrew<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.300> right<00:00:52.260> there<00:00:52.530> just

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
you could unscrew this right there just

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.889 
you could unscrew this right there just
righty-tighty<00:00:53.730> lefty-loosey<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:56.899> sometimes

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
righty-tighty lefty-loosey and sometimes

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.900 
righty-tighty lefty-loosey and sometimes
you<00:00:58.410> might<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> burnt

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
you might have like a burnt

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.359 
you might have like a burnt
you<00:01:00.570> know<00:01:00.719> wire<00:01:01.020> right<00:01:01.350> there<00:01:03.080> and<00:01:04.220> you<00:01:05.220> might

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
you know wire right there and you might

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.340 
you know wire right there and you might
not<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.580> getting<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.030> good<00:01:06.150> connection<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.290> you

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
not be getting a good connection so you

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.380 
not be getting a good connection so you
can<00:01:07.710> just<00:01:07.860> cut<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.250> off<00:01:08.310> or<00:01:08.700> clean<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> up<00:01:09.210> or

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
can just cut that off or clean it up or

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.510 
can just cut that off or clean it up or
something<00:01:09.540> like<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.619> your<00:01:11.040> coil<00:01:11.310> keep

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
something like that and your coil keep

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.140 
something like that and your coil keep
going<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.150> know<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.549> another<00:01:14.549> thing<00:01:14.850> is

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
going you know so and another thing is

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.170 
going you know so and another thing is
that<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:16.619> know<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.100> could<00:01:17.250> order<00:01:17.490> these<00:01:17.790> or

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
that you know you could order these or

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.499 
that you know you could order these or
something<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:19.549> the<00:01:20.549> coils<00:01:20.880> themselves

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
something like that the coils themselves

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.499 
something like that the coils themselves
and<00:01:21.720> just<00:01:22.040> you<00:01:23.040> know<00:01:23.070> replace<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.670> wire<00:01:23.909> some

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
and just you know replace the wire some

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.510 
and just you know replace the wire some
people<00:01:24.780> sound<00:01:25.020> like<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:25.860> I'll<00:01:26.220> post

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
people sound like that but I'll post

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.380 
people sound like that but I'll post
some<00:01:26.759> links<00:01:26.909> below<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.630> coils

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
some links below of the coils

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.609 
some links below of the coils
check-check<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.630> mountain<00:01:31.020> bond<00:01:31.200> these

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
check-check a mountain bond these

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.289 
check-check a mountain bond these
usually<00:01:31.829> go<00:01:32.040> for<00:01:32.280> around<00:01:32.369> fifteen<00:01:32.880> sixteen

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
usually go for around fifteen sixteen

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.289 
usually go for around fifteen sixteen
bucks<00:01:33.570> while<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.909> traditional<00:01:35.909> ones<00:01:36.090> right

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
bucks while the traditional ones right

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.230 
bucks while the traditional ones right
now<00:01:36.329> around<00:01:36.750> ten<00:01:36.990> dollars<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.729> they<00:01:38.729> also<00:01:38.939> do

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
now around ten dollars and they also do

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.179 
now around ten dollars and they also do
the<00:01:39.299> same<00:01:39.570> thing<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:40.020> know<00:01:40.140> they<00:01:40.350> unscrew<00:01:40.950> on

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
the same thing you know they unscrew on

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.260 
the same thing you know they unscrew on
both<00:01:41.700> sides<00:01:43.159> then<00:01:44.159> they're<00:01:44.310> good<00:01:44.520> they<00:01:44.970> you

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
both sides then they're good they you

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.090 
both sides then they're good they you
can<00:01:45.450> unscrew<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:45.990> side<00:01:46.340> which<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.369> your<00:01:47.670> cap

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
can unscrew this side which is your cap

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.609 
can unscrew this side which is your cap
or<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.130> other<00:01:50.909> side<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.079> replace

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
or the other side and you just replace

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.340 
or the other side and you just replace
the<00:01:52.799> wire<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.630> sometimes<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.810> get<00:01:55.020> up<00:01:55.170> in

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
the wire and sometimes you get up in

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.910 
the wire and sometimes you get up in
there<00:01:55.530> -<00:01:56.450> if<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.810> thing<00:01:57.869> personal<00:01:58.619> reason

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
there - if this thing personal reason

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.709 
there - if this thing personal reason
doesn't<00:01:59.100> fit<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.640> could<00:01:59.790> always<00:01:59.939> take<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.540> out

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
doesn't fit you could always take it out

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.590 
doesn't fit you could always take it out
and<00:02:01.340> modify<00:02:02.340> that<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> little<00:02:03.000> bit<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.479> know

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
and modify that a little bit you know

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.100 
and modify that a little bit you know
cut<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:03.930> down<00:02:04.140> at<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.290> razor<00:02:04.560> blade<00:02:05.960> you<00:02:06.960> can

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
cut it down at the razor blade you can

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.639 
cut it down at the razor blade you can
still<00:02:07.350> do<00:02:07.500> some<00:02:07.680> tweaking<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.129> there<00:02:08.280> and

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
still do some tweaking in there and

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.819 
still do some tweaking in there and
her<00:02:08.829> performance<00:02:09.610> but<00:02:10.409> just<00:02:11.409> try<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.620> make

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:11.829 
her performance but just try to make

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.470 
her performance but just try to make
sure<00:02:12.010> that<00:02:12.129> there's<00:02:12.700> no<00:02:12.879> air<00:02:13.090> that's<00:02:13.239> going<00:02:13.420> to

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
sure that there's no air that's going to

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.449 
sure that there's no air that's going to
escape<00:02:13.659> some<00:02:14.200> of<00:02:14.260> them<00:02:14.349> are<00:02:14.439> air-cooled<00:02:14.890> and

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
escape some of them are air-cooled and

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.270 
escape some of them are air-cooled and
you<00:02:16.120> can<00:02:16.239> take<00:02:16.390> this<00:02:16.510> rubber<00:02:16.780> out<00:02:17.049> and<00:02:17.650> examine

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
you can take this rubber out and examine

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.490 
you can take this rubber out and examine
the<00:02:18.370> inside<00:02:18.549> in<00:02:19.000> there<00:02:19.269> you<00:02:19.870> can't<00:02:20.110> really<00:02:20.260> see

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
the inside in there you can't really see

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.259 
the inside in there you can't really see
in<00:02:20.560> there<00:02:20.769> it's<00:02:21.129> kind<00:02:21.250> of<00:02:21.370> impossible<00:02:21.849> with

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
in there it's kind of impossible with

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.530 
in there it's kind of impossible with
that<00:02:22.420> camera<00:02:22.780> but<00:02:24.209> sometimes<00:02:25.209> those<00:02:25.480> little

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
that camera but sometimes those little

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.330 
that camera but sometimes those little
pins<00:02:25.930> fall<00:02:26.260> out<00:02:26.500> or<00:02:26.680> something<00:02:26.980> like<00:02:27.129> that

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
pins fall out or something like that

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.470 
pins fall out or something like that
when<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:27.549> try<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.730> install<00:02:27.879> it<00:02:28.180> into<00:02:28.299> the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
when you try to install it into the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.740 
when you try to install it into the
spark<00:02:28.750> plug<00:02:28.959> inside<00:02:29.920> in<00:02:30.099> there<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.599> you<00:02:31.599> could

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
spark plug inside in there and you could

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.160 
spark plug inside in there and you could
usually<00:02:32.019> repair<00:02:32.439> that<00:02:32.620> as<00:02:32.859> well<00:02:34.170> pretty

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
usually repair that as well pretty

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.240 
usually repair that as well pretty
simply<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:37.200> these<00:02:38.200> high-performance<00:02:38.409> coils

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
simply and these high-performance coils

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.220 
simply and these high-performance coils
also<00:02:39.640> have<00:02:39.819> a<00:02:39.849> thicker<00:02:40.239> wire<00:02:40.599> for<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.019> most

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
also have a thicker wire for the most

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.920 
also have a thicker wire for the most
part<00:02:41.639> better<00:02:42.639> wire<00:02:42.879> on<00:02:43.180> them<00:02:43.329> so<00:02:43.540> that<00:02:43.569> lasts

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
part better wire on them so that lasts

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.729 
part better wire on them so that lasts
longer<00:02:44.230> so<00:02:45.040> high<00:02:45.340> performance<00:02:45.849> you're<00:02:46.090> paying

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
longer so high performance you're paying

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.460 
longer so high performance you're paying
for<00:02:47.739> something<00:02:47.980> there<00:02:48.359> so<00:02:49.359> thanks<00:02:50.349> for

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
for something there so thanks for

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.799 
for something there so thanks for
watching
