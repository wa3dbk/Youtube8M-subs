00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:11.300
 Hello, everyone is referred to as social insurance labor consultant Takeda thank you 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:19.580
 I will be in charge of this course 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:21.680
 It was an opportunity for me to aim for social insurance workers, but for the first time after finding a job 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.099
 It's time I got it 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.130
 Social insurance fee Health insurance how much 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:31.289
 Then the welfare pension premium how much 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.440
 And in the form of say autumn leaves insurance premiums much part Meiji 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:40.079
 Although it was written in the first 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.949
 Yeah Well I was O'expect to Fu Tteyuu This was do such commonplace things are attracted Well 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.430
 Though 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:52.440
 This amount according to receive a monthly pay slip every month Why so it 's such a what will this amount 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:01:00.120
 It became an opportunity to have a question 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:01.829
 So what kind of qualification should I aim for to clarify this social insurance premium? 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.369
 If you are looking for thinking 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:11.940
 Beneath it arrives at the qualification of social insurance labor consultant 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.430
 And if you are examining it, you will learn about the Labor Management Labor Standards Act, etc. 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.100
 By 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:20.330
 It was noted that he was also a professional in labor management and was very 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:27.570
 I was interested in 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:33.120
 And just in parallel with it my brother is 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:39.720
 It is taking advantage of the qualification may go Seriously Orimashi aims to tax accountant 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:44.520
 Because I have thought since, such as wanting opened I take the qualification of social insurance labor York 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:47.560
 If I can start working, I can emphasize and do the work 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.440
 Well that way in and we envision that 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:56.870
 Aimed to be a social insurance worker 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.620
 In fact, it was very busy when I aimed for a social insurance worker 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.910
 that 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:06.740
 I could not go to live classes or something like that. 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:08.399
 Of course there was no such e-learning, I'm very sorry though 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:15.780
 Because 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:19.409
 At that time, the book was shook in one hand and while being swayed by a car, it was put on a red-colored formula to eat insects 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.470
 I want to study in the wind that say Na or enter into a place 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:26.909
 Or while doing household chores 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.420
 While watching others or while holding a child 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:34.450
 The total reading a book 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.830
 I think that it was tough to think from now on anything more than I did learning 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.940
 I will 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:45.610
 But now it is a very good time 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:50.850
 I was able to use e-Learning so everyone 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.850
 I think that I want you to advance learning efficiently 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:01.690
 Well then, it's a test called a social insurance worker 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:05.590
 It takes place once a year on Sunday of the fourth week of August 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:09.990
 When the time approaches, I too 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:16.770
 I took an exam, so it is hot summer 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:20.200
 Naa has been working hard to inspire a'll pass this year while giving up to say leisure Toka so 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:27.970
 Such memories come back to life 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:35.170
 Because we want you to pass by one time by all means 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:37.480
 Use e-Learning to efficiently watch when time is available for efficient learning 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:42.990
 It is by advancing 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:46.370
 Have you finished round the tour relatively early 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:54.319
 When it's over, you're not relieved 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:04:00.379
 To reinforce the weakness in the output bought a commercially available collection of problems yet again this upon yeah 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:02.060
 I will try to fix the knowledge by reviewing the course again and more and more. 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:07.579
 I would like to 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:09.910
 It is your knowledge by repeating it over and over 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:15.460
 Prior to the test 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:21.010
 It is very expensive and you can take the exam and pass it in one shot 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:23.250
 Everyone's in so I we thought because this course 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.660
 I can pass it once 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.660
 Please do your best by all means
