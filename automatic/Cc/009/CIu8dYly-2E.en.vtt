00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.609
 another thing try to intervene the 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.799
 apiary not not see the apiary as only 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.900
 as a set of beehives we in 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.730
 the place that we are now in a lot 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.830
 that we are in present to come now this 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.329
 year is from these hives first 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.660
 season that are happening here and how 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:20.929
 they see there are empty benches but 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.660
 We are here installing and developing a 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:28.289
 daily model since it will hold more or 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.449
 less to 40 to 50 families then it 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.099
 they fix there are several holes that are already 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.649
 excavated 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.039
 we have some cultivation beds that 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.050
 the aesthetic stage is already 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.699
 land now goes out to apply guano in 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.949
 end after the altar high bed type 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.800
 then we between the hives 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.659
 we will sow these high beds 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.370
 medicinal herbs and aromatic herbs 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:53.070
 Most aromatic herbs 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.899
 medicinal the bees love 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.399
 can take advantage of nectar and pollen 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.170
 of these flowers there are many varieties 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.610
 which are very rustic and very resistant to 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.610
 drought conditions 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.509
 and most importantly, they generate a climate of 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.270
 hostility towards their main enemy 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.649
 how good the enemy are unfortunately 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.189
 humans but second principal 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:17.110
 enemy are the varroa mites of the 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.789
 beard that is a very dangerous parasite 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.630
 that kills hundreds of hives 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:24.030
 every year the whole pd 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.610
 gets irritated and gets very upset with the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.369
 aromas of herbs like thyme like 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.320
 the lavender like mint the truth that 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.759
 almost any aromatic herb an aroma 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.150
 intense is annoying to the mud then 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.400
 us when sowing 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.690
 and a lot of medicinal herb around 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.880
 the hives and between the hives 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.260
 we generate food for bees not 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.510
 it is of more to raise fodder for bees 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.040
 that's also where things have to be 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.480
 consider in the current state of 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.680
 destruction of ecosystems we have 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.990
 come to the point where you have to kill 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.390
 forage for bees 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.450
 and we also take advantage of the control 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.640
 organic against this disease too 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.649
 if they set a certain distance between 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.600
 the hives we started digging these 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.240
 holes where we are going to plant trees 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.030
 deciduous fruit trees most 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.319
 the fruit trees need bees 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.880
 for the production of fruits and 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.950
 that they do not need to be like this to produce 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.360
 Anyway, fruits are improving the 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.600
 quality and quantity of fruit that 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.670
 produces and on the other hand 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.740
 these clear trees give back the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.220
 bees with nectar and pollen of quite 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.860
 good quality and we are also going to plant 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.830
 these trees between the hives and of 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.050
 leaf expires because 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.410
 and this brings me to another exhibition theme 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.330
 to the sun 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.030
 how the beehives have to be 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.830
 full shadow in full sun and shadow 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.050
 that's going to sell the place a lot 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.390
 we are located it is very different to have 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.700
 hives in the dry land like here where the 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.830
 summer is very intense to a selection 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.440
 very strong thermal can put 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.340
 temperature of 38 degrees and in the shade in 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.560
 strong summer and see the boxes are the 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.820
 little houses and thermally is the truth is 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.910
 that there is not much then bees 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.800
 they have to spend a lot of 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.390
 energy in keeping the temperature low 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.010
 and a lot of proven ones have to 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.720
 be carrying water instead of watering 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.140
 nectar 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.660
 on the other hand in the shade everything 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.190
 otherwise there is a very humid environment a 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.810
 very dark environment is far away is usually 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.340
 a little bit more hostile is like in this 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.640
 check and see the breeding costs much more 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.230
 of the lived thing because the larvae 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.300
 in general it does not give very good 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.360
 results then ideally in an area 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.130
 like this one that has very 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.810
 hot in winter is very cold already 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.209
 well marked the action is created station 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.280
 one what was more convenient is 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.600
 have the sentences between trees I leave 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.070
 that educates something that give shade to 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.800
 noon not all day at noon 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.030
 hopefully during the grain and loses the 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.680
 leaves and let the sun rays pass 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.810
 during the winter that we are not 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.400
 doing is then why we plant 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.040
 fruit trees because good yes we are going to 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.719
 plant 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.090
 trees the idea is that this element 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:56.890
 tree complements a function always 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.599
 we have to keep meeting the maximum of 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.799
 a culture each element meet 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.909
 latest functions each function 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.620
 important had multiple 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:04.810
 elements in this case 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.359
 the tree fulfills the function of providing 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.900
 forage for bees and provide 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:12.970
 shadow if at the same time it provides us with 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.930
 food to us you know a little bit the 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.459
 idea 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.039
 then we are going to make a 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.919
 small chapter 2 hopefully in spring of 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:23.139
 this same newspaper where you can see already 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.930
 all beehives installed bees 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.289
 working the cameras planted and the 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.100
 small trees growing and giving their flowers and 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.100
 your little leaves 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.450
 It is also very important that you consider 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.090
 when they said where to enter a stone the 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.560
 distance between the newspaper and our 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.169
 home 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.000
 because you have to work with the ones that 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.100
 sticks there are times when you have to 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.419
 make many visits I hope few 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.590
 visits but in general you have to work 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.080
 and you have to be loading materials 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.550
 then the access has to be good 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.160
 that arrives once as a vehicle 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.480
 I wish to myself very close to the 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.970
 apiary to download materials 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.350
 we harvest myself in the drawers are heavy 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.450
 they weigh thirty kilos is not so much that 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.850
 when we have to load you get 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:09.740
 at 70 kilos and more or less the number 45 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.509
 we begin to be less tritones 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.330
 if we have to bring bees or 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.560
 move bees to another side we have to 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.699
 do it in a way that is in good 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.539
 conditions because if we are not going to kill 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:22.009
 many bees with the truck jumps 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.780
 and we're going to spend a lot less 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:25.550
 fuel we have to give 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.180
 save fuel therefore the most 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.229
 near the house possible I know that the 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.550
 people who live in cities suddenly 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.449
 this can be very complicated but 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.009
 they can always practice 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.110
 small-scale urban agriculture that 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:38.740
 it's quite a pretty interesting subject 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.960
 that we will address later 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.849
 in another very important subject is the 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.130
 neighborhood and what I mean 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:46.479
 complementary I mean the neighbors 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.690
 farmers that we go we have around 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:52.870
 since they can eventually apply 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:55.000
 agrochemicals is very common 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.220
 bees are poisoned product of the 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.650
 agrochemicals that farmers 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.419
 small and medium and large clear 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.520
 apply to your crops then it's re 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.449
 important that we identify 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.999
 less what is it that we have around 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:11.610
 what plantations are there to talk to 

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:14.520
 neighbors see if they produce 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.099
 some kind of use some kind of 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.199
 agrochemicals and eventually it's because 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:21.719
 they do not study to expend a little and 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.370
 advise them about alternatives here 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:25.050
 of organic cut can use 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.819
 explaining also that we 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.770
 we have bees and all the benefits 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:30.050
 that the bees bring to their own 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.919
 crops 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.479
 in the fund to establish alliances and 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:37.879
 vital vital fundamental flora 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:40.990
 melífera no longer all the forces in 

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:40.990
 usable by bees 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:48.260
 and good out of honey a pretty subject 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.690
 interesting important that would take us 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.490
 a lot more time and how long this 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.290
 video comment but what it is 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.990
 important to consider is that bees 

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:58.850
 they have to be located in a place 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:01.970
 where the honey flora is sufficient 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:03.980
 in abundance and in quality for 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.870
 feed our bees and to 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.190
 produce a surplus of honey because 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.610
 finally what we harvest is 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:12.890
 the surplus then honey flora and 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.540
 diverse abundant and if there is not 

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.120
 we can always plant forage for 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.520
 there are many species that are very 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.920
 Easy to grow that give honey 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.440
 pollen 

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:28.290
 nectar and pollen forgiveness and at the same time 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:28.290
 can give us fruits and vegetables sir
