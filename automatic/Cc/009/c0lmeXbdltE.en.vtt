00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
how to do this the only thing you need

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.389 
how to do this the only thing you need
is<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.220> computer<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.939> your<00:00:30.480> 3ds<00:00:31.009> do<00:00:32.009> we<00:00:32.160> want

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
is a computer and your 3ds do we want

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.400 
is a computer and your 3ds do we want
because<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.180> expert<00:00:33.600> won't<00:00:33.899> work<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
because this expert won't work on the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.370 
because this expert won't work on the
new<00:00:34.559> 3ds<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.399> new<00:00:35.520> 3ds<00:00:36.030> XL<00:00:36.059> I'm<00:00:36.719> not

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
new 3ds in the new 3ds XL I'm not

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.340 
new 3ds in the new 3ds XL I'm not
completely<00:00:37.680> sure<00:00:37.860> for<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.820> Diaz<00:00:39.290> but<00:00:40.290> I

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
completely sure for it to Diaz but I

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.170 
completely sure for it to Diaz but I
think<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:41.129> will<00:00:41.340> work<00:00:41.399> since<00:00:41.940> it's

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
think this will work since it's

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.790 
think this will work since it's
considered<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:43.079> both<00:00:43.680> 3ds<00:00:48.260> for<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.620> work

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
considered in both 3ds for this to work

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.819 
considered in both 3ds for this to work
you<00:00:50.100> need<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.180> first<00:00:51.510> slot<00:00:51.870> on<00:00:52.320> your<00:00:52.379> first

you need the first slot on your first

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.270 
you need the first slot on your first
box<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.579> open<00:00:54.199> so<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.860> shouldn't<00:00:56.129> be<00:00:56.219> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280
