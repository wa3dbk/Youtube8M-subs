00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
in the compost pile but the interesting

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.430 
in the compost pile but the interesting
thing<00:01:08.300> is<00:01:08.450> is<00:01:08.750> that<00:01:08.869> during<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.200> summer

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
thing is is that during the summer

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.469 
thing is is that during the summer
months<00:01:09.530> you<00:01:10.160> don't<00:01:10.340> have<00:01:10.520> complemented<00:01:11.450> with

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
months you don't have complemented with

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.120 
months you don't have complemented with
the<00:01:11.690> leaf<00:01:11.899> and<00:01:12.110> other<00:01:12.259> litter<00:01:12.530> which<00:01:12.979> is

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
the leaf and other litter which is

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.700 
the leaf and other litter which is
critical<00:01:13.670> to<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.090> healthy<00:01:14.539> compost<00:01:15.050> pile<00:01:15.289> so

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
critical to a healthy compost pile so

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.139 
critical to a healthy compost pile so
let's<00:01:15.920> let<00:01:16.070> those<00:01:16.220> clippings<00:01:16.550> fall<00:01:16.910> during

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
let's let those clippings fall during

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.560 
let's let those clippings fall during
the<00:01:17.360> summer<00:01:17.570> months<00:01:17.690> in<00:01:18.640> addition<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:19.880> letting

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
the summer months the interesting thing

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.679 
the summer months the interesting thing
is<00:01:33.500> is<00:01:33.799> that<00:01:33.920> we<00:01:34.070> have<00:01:34.490> a<00:01:34.520> new<00:01:34.759> sort<00:01:35.360> of<00:01:35.450> saying

mower we've got settings from A to E
what<00:02:09.350> is<00:02:09.470> he<00:02:09.619> is<00:02:09.799> that<00:02:09.979> three<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.519> a<00:02:10.549> half

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
what is he is that three and a half

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.970 
what is he is that three and a half
inches<00:02:10.880> is<00:02:11.239> that<00:02:11.390> three<00:02:11.750> inches<00:02:12.079> exactly<00:02:12.410> what

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
inches is that three inches exactly what

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.300 
inches is that three inches exactly what
is<00:02:13.160> that<00:02:13.400> mowing<00:02:13.850> height<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.209> what<00:02:14.600> is<00:02:14.750> a<00:02:14.959> well

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
is that mowing height and what is a well

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.890 
is that mowing height and what is a well
it<00:02:16.310> makes<00:02:16.579> sense<00:02:16.790> that<00:02:16.940> he<00:02:17.269> would<00:02:17.450> be<00:02:17.600> higher

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
it makes sense that he would be higher

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.949 
it makes sense that he would be higher
than<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.560> but<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.040> question<00:02:19.190> is<00:02:19.760> is<00:02:20.030> what<00:02:20.660> is<00:02:20.810> a

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
than a but the question is is what is a

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.810 
than a but the question is is what is a
and<00:02:21.140> what<00:02:21.260> is<00:02:21.380> e<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.680> really<00:02:22.190> those<00:02:22.370> are<00:02:22.430> set

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
and what is e and really those are set

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.729 
and what is e and really those are set
based<00:02:23.389> on<00:02:23.600> a<00:02:23.630> number<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:24.079> different<00:02:24.230> things

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
based on a number of different things

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.030 
based on a number of different things
like<00:02:25.299> how<00:02:26.299> deep<00:02:26.570> is<00:02:26.780> your<00:02:26.810> lawns<00:02:27.169> thatch<00:02:27.590> level

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
like how deep is your lawns thatch level

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.110 
like how deep is your lawns thatch level
if<00:02:28.160> your<00:02:28.280> thatch<00:02:28.519> level<00:02:28.880> is<00:02:28.940> real

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
if your thatch level is real

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.759 
if your thatch level is real
lative<00:02:29.330> lehigh<00:02:29.659> the<00:02:30.170> weight<00:02:30.349> of<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.590> mower

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
lative lehigh the weight of the mower

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.610 
lative lehigh the weight of the mower
will<00:02:31.069> push<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.400> down<00:02:31.549> so<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.000> maybe<00:02:32.599> three<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.560> a

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
will push it down so a maybe three and a

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.940 
will push it down so a maybe three and a
half<00:02:33.650> inches<00:02:34.129> on<00:02:34.580> a<00:02:34.640> thaci<00:02:35.540> lon<00:02:35.959> but<00:02:36.290> in<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.620> not

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
half inches on a thaci lon but in a not

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.860 
half inches on a thaci lon but in a not
throw<00:02:37.159> that<00:02:37.370> seal<00:02:37.610> on<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:37.970> maybe<00:02:38.360> actually

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
throw that seal on it maybe actually

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.660 
throw that seal on it maybe actually
four<00:02:39.140> inches<00:02:39.440> so<00:02:39.650> you<00:02:39.920> really<00:02:40.190> need<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.370> take

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
four inches so you really need to take

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.550 
four inches so you really need to take
some<00:02:40.879> time<00:02:40.909> to<00:02:41.540> physically<00:02:41.930> measure<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.409> on<00:02:42.530> a

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
some time to physically measure it on a

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.920 
some time to physically measure it on a

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
are strictly a guideline even the mowers

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.720 
are strictly a guideline even the mowers
that<00:02:47.659> are<00:02:47.750> designed<00:02:48.170> with<00:02:48.349> the<00:02:49.040> settings<00:02:49.430> on

that are designed with the settings on

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.550 
that are designed with the settings on
them<00:02:49.879> and<00:02:50.000> they<00:02:50.090> actually<00:02:50.269> say<00:02:50.659> this<00:02:51.200> equals

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
them and they actually say this equals

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.589 
them and they actually say this equals
three<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.069> a<00:02:52.099> half<00:02:52.129> this<00:02:52.549> equals<00:02:52.849> three<00:02:53.150> those

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
three and a half this equals three those

when you sharpened it during the spring

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.300 
when you sharpened it during the spring
months<00:03:14.500> take<00:03:15.500> a<00:03:15.530> look<00:03:15.680> at<00:03:15.799> the<00:03:15.890> mower<00:03:16.069> blade
