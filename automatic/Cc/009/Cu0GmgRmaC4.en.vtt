00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
this stump is a beast doesn't like the

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.019 
this stump is a beast doesn't like the
chainsaws<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:22.340> don't<00:00:23.340> know<00:00:23.430> I'm<00:00:23.700> gonna<00:00:23.820> try<00:00:23.939> to

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
chainsaws I don't know I'm gonna try to

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.690 
chainsaws I don't know I'm gonna try to
dig<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.330> up<00:00:25.040> we'll<00:00:26.040> see<00:00:26.220> how<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.520> actually

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
dig it up we'll see how that actually

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:47.410 
dig it up we'll see how that actually
goes

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.620

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
making a mess out here I've been

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.890 
making a mess out here I've been
removing<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:54.770> dirt<00:00:54.980> from<00:00:55.370> around<00:00:55.550> this<00:00:55.910> root

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
removing the dirt from around this root

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.160 
removing the dirt from around this root
in<00:00:57.350> this<00:00:57.530> tree<00:00:58.510> and<00:00:59.510> I've<00:00:59.600> been<00:00:59.720> taking<00:00:59.899> the

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
in this tree and I've been taking the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.479 
in this tree and I've been taking the
axe<00:01:00.379> and<00:01:01.180> just<00:01:02.180> wherever<00:01:02.360> the<00:01:02.540> roots<00:01:02.750> get<00:01:02.989> thin

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
axe and just wherever the roots get thin

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.210 
axe and just wherever the roots get thin
been<00:01:04.489> chopping<00:01:04.790> them<00:01:05.560> so<00:01:06.560> I<00:01:06.590> have<00:01:06.770> one<00:01:07.009> root

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
been chopping them so I have one root

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.050 
been chopping them so I have one root
that<00:01:07.490> I<00:01:07.580> did<00:01:07.820> there<00:01:09.400> another<00:01:10.400> one<00:01:10.580> right<00:01:10.790> here

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
that I did there another one right here

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.430 
that I did there another one right here
is<00:01:11.150> cut<00:01:11.450> but<00:01:11.570> you<00:01:11.630> can't<00:01:11.900> see<00:01:12.110> it<00:01:12.229> because<00:01:12.290> the

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
is cut but you can't see it because the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.469 
is cut but you can't see it because the
dirt<00:01:12.680> came<00:01:12.860> back<00:01:13.100> over<00:01:13.430> it<00:01:13.580> I<00:01:14.860> cut<00:01:15.860> that<00:01:16.040> one

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
dirt came back over it I cut that one

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:24.040 
dirt came back over it I cut that one
and<00:01:17.479> that<00:01:17.509> one<00:01:17.840> so<00:01:18.500> I've<00:01:18.590> got<00:01:18.770> for<00:01:19.220> them<00:01:19.399> up<00:01:23.050> on

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
and that one so I've got for them up on

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.930 
and that one so I've got for them up on
this<00:01:24.259> side<00:01:24.470> looks<00:01:24.680> like<00:01:24.830> I<00:01:24.920> still<00:01:25.130> have<00:01:25.369> one

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
this side looks like I still have one

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.109 
this side looks like I still have one
huge<00:01:26.240> one<00:01:26.300> there<00:01:26.800> two<00:01:27.800> three<00:01:28.520> I<00:01:28.550> probably<00:01:28.910> got

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
huge one there two three I probably got

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.980 
huge one there two three I probably got
about<00:01:29.649> three<00:01:30.649> or<00:01:30.710> four<00:01:30.979> more<00:01:31.190> of<00:01:31.310> these<00:01:31.399> roots

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
about three or four more of these roots

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.279 
about three or four more of these roots
to<00:01:32.990> do<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.229> same<00:01:33.440> thing<00:01:33.710> with<00:01:34.479> now<00:01:35.479> even<00:01:36.110> if<00:01:36.200> I

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
to do the same thing with now even if I

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.889 
to do the same thing with now even if I
get<00:01:36.350> all<00:01:36.619> those<00:01:36.770> roots<00:01:37.039> up<00:01:37.660> still<00:01:38.660> doesn't

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
get all those roots up still doesn't

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.060 
get all those roots up still doesn't
mean<00:01:38.960> I'll<00:01:39.110> be<00:01:39.140> able<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.410> get<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.679> stump<00:01:39.920> out

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
mean I'll be able to get the stump out

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.190 
mean I'll be able to get the stump out
because<00:01:40.490> I<00:01:40.759> don't<00:01:41.509> know<00:01:41.570> how<00:01:41.690> deep<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:41.990> tapper

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
because I don't know how deep the tapper

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.560 
because I don't know how deep the tapper
goes<00:01:42.560> or<00:01:43.090> how<00:01:44.090> far<00:01:44.360> it<00:01:44.479> is<00:01:44.539> so<00:01:44.810> I<00:01:46.420> guess<00:01:47.420> I'll

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
goes or how far it is so I guess I'll

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.749 
goes or how far it is so I guess I'll
keep<00:01:47.720> chipping<00:01:47.899> away<00:01:48.100> well<00:01:49.100> we're<00:01:49.700> making

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
keep chipping away well we're making

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.819 
keep chipping away well we're making
progress<00:01:51.250> we<00:01:52.250> have<00:01:52.280> a<00:01:52.369> lot<00:01:52.549> of<00:01:52.640> these<00:01:52.729> roots

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
progress we have a lot of these roots

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.469 
progress we have a lot of these roots
cut<00:01:54.829> you<00:01:55.340> see<00:01:55.549> we<00:01:55.640> just<00:01:55.670> basically<00:01:56.150> took<00:01:56.360> a

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
cut you see we just basically took a

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.859 
cut you see we just basically took a
little

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.399

to pull it out and that's why I'm

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.770 
to pull it out and that's why I'm
cutting<00:02:15.880> all<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.300> parts<00:02:16.569> that<00:02:16.630> are

extraction of the actual root of the
tree<00:02:37.489> I<00:02:37.700> just<00:02:38.230> was<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.379> eager<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.650> get<00:02:39.799> it<00:02:39.920> out

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
tree I just was so eager to get it out

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.679 
tree I just was so eager to get it out
that<00:02:40.340> didn't<00:02:40.849> even<00:02:40.879> think<00:02:41.180> about<00:02:41.269> it

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
that didn't even think about it
