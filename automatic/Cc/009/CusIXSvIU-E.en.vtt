00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
little pressure as possible so we may

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.490 
little pressure as possible so we may
start<00:00:50.760> out<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.420> most<00:00:51.750> gradual

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500

easy<00:00:52.980> kind<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.520> circle<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.180> then<00:00:54.780> increase

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
easy kind of circle and then increase

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.860 
easy kind of circle and then increase
the<00:00:55.500> balance<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.219> bend<00:00:56.520> by<00:00:57.120> asking<00:00:57.629> for

the balance and the bend by asking for

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.110 
the balance and the bend by asking for
more<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.710> way<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.980> pressure<00:00:59.250> off<00:00:59.609> our<00:00:59.910> leg

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
more in the way of pressure off our leg

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.869 
more in the way of pressure off our leg
in<00:01:00.270> our<00:01:00.390> hand<00:01:00.859> everything<00:01:01.859> we<00:01:02.219> do<00:01:02.370> at<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.550> walk

in our hand everything we do at the walk

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.359 
in our hand everything we do at the walk
will<00:01:03.239> work<00:01:03.390> at<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> jog<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.979> want<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.280> keep

a little ways to go yet till we create

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.310 
a little ways to go yet till we create
that<00:01:37.590> nice<00:01:37.880> organized<00:01:38.880> package<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:40.020> we<00:01:40.140> can

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
that nice organized package but we can

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.260 
that nice organized package but we can
see<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.650> beginning<00:01:41.100> as<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.490> horse<00:01:41.700> starts

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
see the beginning as this horse starts

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.030 
see the beginning as this horse starts
to<00:01:42.450> figure<00:01:42.659> out<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.829> better

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
to figure out that it's a better

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.249 
to figure out that it's a better
position<00:01:44.369> if<00:01:44.880> they<00:01:45.329> use<00:01:45.540> their<00:01:45.750> bodies<00:01:46.079> in

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259
