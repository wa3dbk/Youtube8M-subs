 at least 22 payments you never wanted 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.770
 be a robot vacuum cleaner because here you have 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.960
 the simulator that lets you do it for 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.890
 please let's go over there young what piece of 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.990
 no acid and this how it moves or yes 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.610
 so I have to send but day from 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.310
 soil or not 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.950
 so they leave whole rare dirt 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.430
 no faster 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.010
 I this is a bit depressing but it's a 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.110
 little depressing alone is this 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.240
 so it 's a pill that moved on 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.420
 ground and catch pieces of balls 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.250
 I have never seen calm that 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.800
 it becomes more exciting we have the mode 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.800
 dual mode this is more interesting 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:56.650
 how handsome a career seem pop seems 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.340
 a little that you're worth the one I think about it 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.430
 opposite one another or not 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.780
 a crash 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.579
 rest assured that this is the most 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.349
 exciting is going to happen throughout the game 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.640
 in which it was sixth who is going to be the most 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.110
 exciting that you are going to see in this life 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.090
 this game careful 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.680
 this is torture and here is that I can not 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.610
 with a game like that is that it's exasperating 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.980
 and it depresses you simulator of a playground 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:25.950
 recreation but weird is not exactly a 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.950
 playground in macy's super weird 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.450
 I do not understand that he does not understand this 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.070
 game we do not understand who does that why 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.500
 will do with them and it seems that they 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.140
 they are violating or something from here 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.140
 gay soldiers are all crazy are 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.420
 we're all crazy with the fork track 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.340
 silence a tutorial if maybe 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:04.150
 let's get the weirder no or if not the c 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:08.129
 handsome 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.129
 well let's go to serious driving 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.230
 the bed is a 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.799
 Y 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.739
 7 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.550
 13 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.280
 I believe that this is true in principle 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.000
 I think I have to take a kind of stick 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.000
 from amia 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:36.150
 just ild often 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.639
 as you will see that I have it I have what 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.669
 I have 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.669
 Go up up 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.090
 up we go up today I think that 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.090
 do not 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.050
 the sites that are using 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:05:00.620
 I have a little 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:03.230
 I do not have or if we go we go perfect 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:07.710
 you have balls 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:12.560
 I'm half yes if you take it from your mother 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.560
 or if eleven laps 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:22.699
 very good if you break all this the 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.699
 prophets everything is made to endure 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:25.889
 jover has been broken
