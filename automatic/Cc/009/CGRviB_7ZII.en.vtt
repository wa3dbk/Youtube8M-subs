real contribution to society monetarily
and<00:02:57.540> mentally<00:02:58.540> as<00:02:58.659> well<00:02:58.870> because<00:02:59.230> it's<00:03:00.069> also

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
and mentally as well because it's also

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.369 
and mentally as well because it's also
based<00:03:00.549> upon<00:03:00.700> the<00:03:01.690> model<00:03:01.840> of<00:03:02.019> effective

altruism<00:03:02.739> which<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.340> about<00:03:03.579> using

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
altruism which is about using

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.300 
altruism which is about using
rationality<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.959> figure<00:03:05.470> out<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.829> most

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
rationality to figure out the most

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.050

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.990 

The<00:03:10.270> Situation's

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.789 

I'll<00:03:13.299> fix<00:03:13.599> the<00:03:13.689> world<00:03:13.810> so<00:03:14.260> we<00:03:14.409> have<00:03:14.530> to<00:03:14.620> figure

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
I'll fix the world so we have to figure

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.220 
I'll fix the world so we have to figure
out<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.010> most<00:03:15.099> effective<00:03:15.580> ways<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.760> spend<00:03:16.090> it

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
out the most effective ways to spend it

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.710 
out the most effective ways to spend it
and<00:03:17.230> secondly<00:03:18.000> yeah<00:03:19.000> it's<00:03:19.120> about<00:03:19.269> encouraging

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
and secondly yeah it's about encouraging

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.170 
and secondly yeah it's about encouraging
rational<00:03:20.079> thinking<00:03:20.379> is<00:03:20.560> dead

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
rational thinking is dead

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.390 
rational thinking is dead
