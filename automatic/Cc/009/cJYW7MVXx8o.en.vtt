00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.279
 Hello everyone back with a 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.070
 new video this will be the video tag 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.849
 my furry friend and nothing now there 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.149
 I present my puppy and here we are 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:30.480
 I know that many of you have already seen but 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:32.279
 for those who don't follow him and kiwi and 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.000
 we immediately begin to respond to 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.239
 name questions as it is called just said 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.879
 he is called kiwi then that remains also 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:47.100
 race is obviously a dog and he is 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:51.570
 unique and he is a cross between a pincher 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.989
 and a chihuahua then for how long 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.840
 you have 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.870
 he arrived on July 28th when 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.570
 celebrated my birthday so ce 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.660
 I've had it for three months 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.840
 how did you practically have it then 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.829
 I always wanted a dog because I didn't 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.000
 I say this is my favorite animal 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:13.619
 because I liked all the animals 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.810
 but let's say it's the dog you have to 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.270
 take care and everything else I will have to 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.670
 doing all this kind of things is a 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.859
 little dog and for my nineteenth 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.969
 birthday the company with which I go out 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:26.569
 are my friends it was decided to 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:29.490
 give me the I am too happy 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:32.999
 then how old is he 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.920
 at five months old he is small 

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:41.209
 which is increasingly growing instead of a rally 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.979
 some character traits 

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:46.439
 stubborn ie long do what you do 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.479
 he says he wasn't there he's not happy 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.520
 slowly we are succeeding in making him 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.700
 understand who the master is by color 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.509
 always be right 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.399
 then a strange thing is that it is not strange 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.069
 strange however it goes very well with the 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.560
 with my cat because I two mimes and 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:09.239
 milk mirka the male has us a lot 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.979
 agree however we say that it is a love and 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.530
 hate because they love each other very much 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.690
 they always play but they pull in the sense 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.040
 which takes it bites a thing of the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.630
 his character should stop 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.490
 bitten because bitten 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.170
 maybe a very small, easy city i 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.770
 teeth for really hurts a lot and me 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.310
 miss needle in honor of such from the pain that 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:32.700
 it makes me even cause me a wound or 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.330
 these little teeth however very much 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.270
 sweet so tender and everyone when it is 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.800
 they see god how beautiful how beautiful how beautiful 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.740
 when others do so vi 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.960
 it still comes when I went around and 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.240
 I saw that little candles tells me that 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.650
 how I would like 20 euros now that 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:55.770
 I only have it too happy then what 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.670
 means to you your relationship with him 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.580
 well i point i always said wanted a 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.690
 dog and since heaven I am 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.310
 very happy I don't always want to 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.110
 take him out for walks in 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.600
 what truth though until you have a 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.760
 animal cannot really understand what 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.340
 want to be loved I know it's one 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.260
 sentence a sentence already been made however 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:25.980
 in the end it is reality now that we have it 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:28.410
 I can say that they are called that is 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.420
 for example I go out two seconds to go to 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.610
 spread him cries because now he does not 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.380
 he would like to come with me he doesn't see me yes 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.060
 he starts to cry I come back home 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.580
 does the holidays maybe two minutes that 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.940
 he doesn't see me a person wouldn't do it 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.680
 never 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.700
 I really think that 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.409
 animals are better than 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.069
 men anyway here I always have it 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:52.200
 said my relationship with him and second 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.780
 me is special but i think any 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.560
 person but your own animal relationship 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.019
 be special I love him too much 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.719
 well he is all we can say why it is 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:07.819
 it really is a treasure 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:13.340
 here is I will love you so much 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:18.630
 so nothing in short means 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:21.030
 special love from when I look for them 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.449
 always said after it is missing then there are three 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:27.180
 Limestone months is not so much as ever 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:30.570
 in short, because we have not taken it before 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.570
 I really don't even know how 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:37.650
 really explain to me I want too much 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:41.639
 in short, the relationship that I enjoy 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.620
 we are gorgeous 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.699
 then what are the moments spent with 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.699
 kiwi of your choice 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:55.440

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:58.770
 love at first sight in the sense then me 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.330
 I explain, I had to go to a pizzeria 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.280
 because precisely from the evening I had to 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.830

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.349
 he was a chihuahua 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:26.469
