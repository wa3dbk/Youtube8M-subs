my<00:00:14.030> philosophy<00:00:14.210> is<00:00:14.660> to<00:00:14.750> have<00:00:15.020> new<00:00:15.849> generation

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
cycling team where our sport managers

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.660 
cycling team where our sport managers
not<00:00:21.080> looking<00:00:21.439> for<00:00:21.650> money<00:00:21.680> and<00:00:21.950> not<00:00:22.250> begging

not looking for money and not begging

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.240 
not looking for money and not begging
for<00:00:22.849> money<00:00:23.000> but<00:00:23.360> they<00:00:23.840> are<00:00:24.140> making<00:00:24.650> sure<00:00:24.860> that

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
for money but they are making sure that

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.769 
for money but they are making sure that
the<00:00:25.369> performance<00:00:25.970> of<00:00:26.090> their<00:00:26.240> idols<00:00:26.630> is

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
the performance of their idols is

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.080 
the performance of their idols is
improving<00:00:27.230> and<00:00:27.350> making<00:00:27.980> sure<00:00:28.160> that<00:00:28.400> we<00:00:28.940> have<00:00:29.060> a

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
improving and making sure that we have a

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.840 
improving and making sure that we have a
good<00:00:29.359> team<00:00:29.570> and<00:00:29.750> good<00:00:29.990> sport<00:00:30.920> minutes<00:00:31.310> I<00:00:31.580> think

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:31.850 
good team and good sport minutes I think

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.170 
good team and good sport minutes I think
that<00:00:32.199> it's<00:00:33.199> very<00:00:33.699> interesting<00:00:34.699> for<00:00:34.820> the<00:00:34.940> team

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
that it's very interesting for the team

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.590 
that it's very interesting for the team
to<00:00:35.420> get<00:00:35.960> a<00:00:36.019> strong<00:00:36.710> a<00:00:37.100> strong<00:00:37.850> new<00:00:38.059> partner<00:00:38.510> on

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
to get a strong a strong new partner on

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.619 
to get a strong a strong new partner on
both<00:00:39.160> the<00:00:40.160> team<00:00:40.370> has<00:00:40.519> always<00:00:40.760> been<00:00:40.909> been<00:00:41.239> one

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
both the team has always been been one

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.450 
both the team has always been been one
of<00:00:41.809> the<00:00:42.229> absolute<00:00:42.379> top<00:00:42.800> teams<00:00:43.070> in<00:00:43.220> the<00:00:43.339> world

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
of the absolute top teams in the world

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.399 
of the absolute top teams in the world
but<00:00:43.699> I<00:00:43.760> think<00:00:44.000> this<00:00:44.180> is<00:00:44.330> what<00:00:44.540> could<00:00:44.750> could

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:45.409 
but I think this is what could could

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:46.990 
but I think this is what could could
really<00:00:45.650> take<00:00:45.860> us<00:00:46.010> back<00:00:46.250> to<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.460> absolutely

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
really take us back to the absolutely

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.670 
really take us back to the absolutely
number<00:00:47.449> one<00:00:47.659> spot<00:00:47.960> and<00:00:48.199> of<00:00:48.320> course<00:00:48.530> that's

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
number one spot and of course that's

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.950 
number one spot and of course that's
exciting<00:00:49.129> for<00:00:49.250> also<00:00:50.150> for<00:00:50.299> sex<00:00:50.479> being<00:00:50.780> as<00:00:50.930> a

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
exciting for also for sex being as a

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.560 
exciting for also for sex being as a
sponsor<00:00:51.290> and<00:00:51.710> I<00:00:52.129> think<00:00:52.580> it's<00:00:52.760> a<00:00:52.970> right

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
sponsor and I think it's a right

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.259 
sponsor and I think it's a right
decision<00:00:53.750> for<00:00:54.140> 40<00:00:54.830> honorees<00:00:54.920> to<00:00:55.489> to<00:00:55.760> have<00:00:55.940> to

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
decision for 40 honorees to to have to

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.259 
decision for 40 honorees to to have to
have<00:00:56.420> done<00:00:56.870> this<00:00:57.049> and<00:00:57.680> we<00:00:58.430> are<00:00:58.699> supportive<00:00:59.180> of

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
have done this and we are supportive of

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:00.579 
have done this and we are supportive of
the<00:00:59.479> look<00:00:59.659> forward<00:00:59.960> to<00:01:00.110> working<00:01:00.379> together

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
the look forward to working together

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.299 
the look forward to working together
with<00:01:00.830> both<00:01:01.129> Orlok<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.570> Beyond<00:01:03.260> and<00:01:03.500> about

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
with both Orlok and and Beyond and about

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.609 
with both Orlok and and Beyond and about
making<00:01:05.299> this<00:01:05.420> team<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.869> best<00:01:06.170> in<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.560> world

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
making this team the best in the world

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:07.840 
making this team the best in the world
so<00:01:07.010> I<00:01:07.100> think<00:01:07.369> it's<00:01:07.490> going<00:01:07.580> to<00:01:07.670> make<00:01:07.790> a

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
so I think it's going to make a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.719 
so I think it's going to make a
difference<00:01:08.140> all<00:01:09.140> you<00:01:09.320> think<00:01:09.350> of<00:01:09.710> is<00:01:09.860> a<00:01:09.920> it's<00:01:10.670> a

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
difference all you think of is a it's a

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.639 
difference all you think of is a it's a
very<00:01:10.909> dedicated<00:01:11.150> cycling<00:01:11.960> plan<00:01:12.140> to<00:01:12.350> say<00:01:12.500> the

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:12.649 
very dedicated cycling plan to say the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.279 
very dedicated cycling plan to say the
least<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:13.130> he<00:01:13.789> really<00:01:14.630> is<00:01:14.719> here<00:01:14.930> with<00:01:15.200> his

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
least and he really is here with his

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:17.349 
least and he really is here with his
heart<00:01:15.500> but<00:01:16.009> also<00:01:16.189> with<00:01:16.460> a<00:01:16.520> lot<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:16.729> resources

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:17.359 
heart but also with a lot of resources

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:20.170 
heart but also with a lot of resources
that<00:01:17.750> i<00:01:17.810> think<00:01:17.930> will<00:01:18.920> enable<00:01:19.159> garniture<00:01:19.759> to

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
that i think will enable garniture to

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.020 
that i think will enable garniture to
fulfill<00:01:20.570> his<00:01:20.829> sporting<00:01:21.829> ambitions<00:01:22.340> first<00:01:22.880> of

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
fulfill his sporting ambitions first of

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.080 
fulfill his sporting ambitions first of
all<00:01:23.180> it<00:01:23.450> is<00:01:23.630> indeed<00:01:23.899> fun<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:24.469> I<00:01:24.920> I'm<00:01:25.670> not

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
all it is indeed fun and I I'm not

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.469 
all it is indeed fun and I I'm not
buying<00:01:26.329> this<00:01:26.990> team<00:01:27.289> for<00:01:27.829> any<00:01:28.179> economic<00:01:29.179> or

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
buying this team for any economic or

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.230 
buying this team for any economic or
commercial<00:01:30.170> reasons<00:01:30.530> it<00:01:30.950> eventually<00:01:31.729> then

commercial reasons it eventually then
this<00:01:32.780> disinvested<00:01:33.500> may<00:01:33.619> pay<00:01:33.829> off<00:01:33.979> but<00:01:34.280> it's

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
this disinvested may pay off but it's

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.209 
this disinvested may pay off but it's
maybe<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.329> long-term<00:01:35.810> strategy<00:01:36.500> but<00:01:36.950> short

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
maybe a long-term strategy but short

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.160 
maybe a long-term strategy but short
term<00:01:37.369> strategies<00:01:37.850> have<00:01:37.999> a<00:01:38.060> fun<00:01:38.359> enjoy<00:01:38.810> having

we will do it very soon we fall there to
come<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.009> know<00:01:55.130> why<00:01:55.700> I<00:01:56.359> think<00:01:57.340> anything<00:01:58.340> with<00:01:58.609> a

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
come to know why I think anything with a

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.679 
come to know why I think anything with a
big<00:01:59.060> investment<00:01:59.749> aspires<00:02:00.319> to<00:02:00.469> be<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:01.609> best<00:02:01.880> we

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
big investment aspires to be the best we

big investment aspires to be the best we
finished<00:02:02.960> fourth<00:02:03.319> I<00:02:03.560> think<00:02:03.829> in<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.039> world

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:04.249 
finished fourth I think in the world

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:08.169 
finished fourth I think in the world
rankings<00:02:04.810> last<00:02:05.810> season<00:02:06.350> there's<00:02:07.280> Team<00:02:07.520> Sky<00:02:07.939> of

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.150 
rankings last season there's Team Sky of
course<00:02:08.450> there's<00:02:08.690> movie<00:02:09.080> star<00:02:09.380> who<00:02:09.679> are<00:02:09.860> both

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
course there's movie star who are both

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.250 
course there's movie star who are both
very<00:02:10.490> strong<00:02:10.910> it<00:02:11.569> seems<00:02:11.840> incredibly<00:02:12.319> strong

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
very strong it seems incredibly strong

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.220 
very strong it seems incredibly strong
but<00:02:13.860> looking<00:02:14.129> forward<00:02:14.549> not<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.420> 2014<00:02:16.080> but

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
but looking forward not just a 2014 but

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.699 
but looking forward not just a 2014 but
to<00:02:16.349> 2015<00:02:17.129> with<00:02:17.610> more<00:02:17.790> reinforcements<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:19.140> think

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
to 2015 with more reinforcements I think

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.250 
to 2015 with more reinforcements I think
we<00:02:20.099> aspire<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.700> be<00:02:20.849> if<00:02:21.329> not<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.720> best<00:02:21.900> and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
we aspire to be if not the best and

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.869 
we aspire to be if not the best and
certainly<00:02:22.620> one<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.159> best<00:02:23.370> teams<00:02:23.640> in<00:02:23.819> the

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
certainly one of the best teams in the

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:26.979 
certainly one of the best teams in the
world<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.829> think<00:02:25.829> we<00:02:25.950> stick<00:02:26.370> very<00:02:26.579> much<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.939> our

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
world I think we stick very much to our

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.680 
world I think we stick very much to our
BR<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.079> really<00:02:28.290> believes<00:02:28.590> in<00:02:28.739> is<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:29.069> the

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
BR and really believes in is in the

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.990 
BR and really believes in is in the
individual<00:02:30.690> strands<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.260> make<00:02:31.409> one<00:02:31.680> big<00:02:32.489> team

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
individual strands to make one big team

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.960 
individual strands to make one big team
and<00:02:33.269> a<00:02:33.360> unit<00:02:33.659> and<00:02:33.870> without<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:35.700> wasn't

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
and a unit and without that it wasn't

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.020 
and a unit and without that it wasn't
possible<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.450> do<00:02:36.659> the<00:02:36.780> crosswinds<00:02:37.730> event<00:02:38.730> as

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
possible to do the crosswinds event as

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.449 
possible to do the crosswinds event as
we<00:02:39.299> did<00:02:39.420> in<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.569> tour<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.019> do<00:02:40.890> more<00:02:41.129> stuff

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459
