this once I get to it so I'm going to go

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:44.979 
this once I get to it so I'm going to go
around<00:00:29.980> the<00:00:30.430> leg

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:52.340 

next<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.200> cut<00:00:47.160> out<00:00:47.400> the<00:00:47.730> tail

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.930

not the breasts the fact if you start
with<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:01.550> breast<00:01:01.960> it's<00:01:02.960> probably<00:01:03.320> not<00:01:03.440> going

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
with the breast it's probably not going

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.360 
with the breast it's probably not going
to<00:01:03.710> work<00:01:03.829> out<00:01:03.980> for<00:01:04.220> you<00:01:05.500> I'm<00:01:06.500> good<00:01:06.830> but<00:01:07.100> I<00:01:07.190> would

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.920 
to work out for you I'm good but I would
never<00:01:07.580> start<00:01:07.970> with<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:08.270> breast<00:01:10.090> then<00:01:11.090> I<00:01:11.420> just

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
never start with the breast then I just

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:39.130 
never start with the breast then I just
simply<00:01:12.490> take<00:01:13.490> it<00:01:13.729> straight<00:01:14.450> down<00:01:14.690> leave

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.820 

then<00:01:39.590> I<00:01:39.680> wish<00:01:40.010> to<00:01:40.250> work

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.700 

croaks<00:01:43.490> but<00:01:43.760> I'm<00:01:43.910> boiling

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.290 

skin

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
skin

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.860 
skin
but<00:01:48.480> I'm<00:01:48.630> trying<00:01:48.840> not<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:50.150> create

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.240 

is<00:01:55.870> there<00:01:56.140> any<00:01:56.260> way<00:01:56.409> to<00:01:56.440> save<00:01:56.770> it<00:01:56.890> if<00:01:56.979> you<00:01:57.070> do

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
is there any way to save it if you do

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.960 
is there any way to save it if you do
cut<00:01:57.460> through<00:01:57.670> it<00:01:57.820> here<00:01:58.810> we<00:01:58.990> can<00:01:59.020> work

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
cut through it here we can work

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.870 
cut through it here we can work
it's<00:02:01.570> just<00:02:01.930> you<00:02:02.740> get<00:02:02.920> a<00:02:02.950> better<00:02:03.220> product<00:02:03.700> if

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
it's just you get a better product if

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:23.440 
it's just you get a better product if
you<00:02:04.030> don't<00:02:04.060> take<00:02:04.780> your<00:02:04.990> time

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.720 

yeah

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.699 

start<00:02:27.730> on<00:02:27.849> the<00:02:27.879> other<00:02:28.150> side<00:02:28.390> next<00:02:28.659> again<00:02:29.560> you

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
start on the other side next again you

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.940 
start on the other side next again you
see<00:02:29.920> how<00:02:30.150> I'm<00:02:31.150> not<00:02:31.390> making<00:02:31.780> long<00:02:33.360> bowling<00:02:34.950> as

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:29.690 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.210 

I'd<00:03:30.020> rather<00:03:30.290> cut<00:03:30.650> in<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:30.950> protein

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
I'd rather cut in the protein

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:41.350 
I'd rather cut in the protein
and<00:03:33.520> in<00:03:33.760> the

I want to make sure that I can see where

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.900 
I want to make sure that I can see where
my<00:03:52.200> thumb<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.650> my<00:03:52.740> finger<00:03:52.800> I<00:03:55.400> want<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.490> hold<00:03:56.670> it

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
down I don't want to sit there and I

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:06.640 
down I don't want to sit there and I
want<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.000> gently<00:04:00.270> pull<00:04:02.270> it<00:04:03.270> comes<00:04:03.600> right<00:04:04.020> off

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.920 

same<00:04:07.650> thing<00:04:07.890> in<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.100> past

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
same thing in the past

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:27.640 
same thing in the past
once<00:04:09.930> that<00:04:10.110> can<00:04:10.290> go<00:04:10.440> through<00:04:10.710> there<00:04:10.950> right<00:04:14.150> off

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:37.070 

that's<00:04:28.160> why<00:04:28.460> I<00:04:28.490> took<00:04:28.639> the<00:04:28.970> time<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.330> cut<00:04:29.510> this

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.470 

and<00:04:37.379> then

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
and then

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:48.469 
and then
I<00:04:39.540> go<00:04:39.990> up<00:04:40.080> to<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.320> Parsons<00:04:40.800> neck

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.659 

now<00:04:49.020> you<00:04:49.080> can<00:04:49.349> see<00:04:49.529> how<00:04:49.680> thin<00:04:49.979> it<00:04:50.129> is<00:04:50.219> when<00:04:50.520> it's

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
now you can see how thin it is when it's

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.100 
now you can see how thin it is when it's
up<00:04:50.879> here<00:04:51.150> not<00:04:51.990> much<00:04:52.229> there

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.549 

it's<00:04:55.200> difficult<00:04:55.740> today

00:05:00.549 --> 00:05:00.559 

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:06.469 

again<00:05:01.129> I've<00:05:01.459> got<00:05:01.639> a<00:05:01.669> sheet<00:05:01.999> pan

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.860 

now<00:05:07.050> if<00:05:07.830> you<00:05:08.039> look<00:05:08.249> at<00:05:08.370> this<00:05:08.580> there<00:05:09.509> are<00:05:09.629> fat

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
now if you look at this there are fat

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.879 
now if you look at this there are fat
deposits<00:05:10.590> you<00:05:11.400> do<00:05:11.639> it<00:05:11.789> duck<00:05:12.529> there's<00:05:13.529> a<00:05:13.620> lot

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
deposits you do it duck there's a lot
