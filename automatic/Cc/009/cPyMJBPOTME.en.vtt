know true is going to do is capture flag
over<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:11.510> over<00:01:11.690> again<00:01:12.130> you<00:01:13.130> get<00:01:13.280> three

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
over and over again you get three

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.450 
over and over again you get three
thousand<00:01:13.910> points<00:01:14.330> per<00:01:14.690> ten<00:01:15.680> seconds<00:01:16.040> about

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.060 

you'd<00:01:19.460> five<00:01:19.670> hundred<00:01:19.940> for<00:01:20.620> taking<00:01:21.620> it<00:01:21.740> in<00:01:21.890> two

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
you'd five hundred for taking it in two

you'd five hundred for taking it in two
thousand<00:01:22.490> five<00:01:22.640> hundred<00:01:22.700> for<00:01:23.210> capturing<00:01:23.780> it

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
thousand five hundred for capturing it

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.710
