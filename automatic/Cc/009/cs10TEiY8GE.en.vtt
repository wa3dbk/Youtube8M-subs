nice rubberized coatings that kind of

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.070 
nice rubberized coatings that kind of
keeps<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.340> from<00:00:23.519> slipping<00:00:24.060> out<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.420> your<00:00:24.570> hands

keeps it from slipping out of your hands
it's<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.619> like<00:00:25.830> an<00:00:25.949> Xbox<00:00:26.490> 360<00:00:26.820> kind<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.539> layout

it's in like an Xbox 360 kind of layout

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.480 
it's in like an Xbox 360 kind of layout
so<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.109> have<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.560> clickable<00:00:28.920> thumb<00:00:29.220> sticks

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
so you have the clickable thumb sticks

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.580 
so you have the clickable thumb sticks
four<00:00:30.269> buttons<00:00:30.630> here<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.929> directional<00:00:31.529> pad

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
four buttons here a directional pad

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.500 
four buttons here a directional pad
which<00:00:31.949> feels<00:00:32.189> okay<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.700> feels<00:00:32.730> better<00:00:33.059> than<00:00:33.270> a

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
which feels okay it feels better than a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.420 
which feels okay it feels better than a
lot<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:33.989> joysticks<00:00:34.380> I've<00:00:34.559> used<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.160> form

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
lot of joysticks I've used in this form

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.549 
lot of joysticks I've used in this form
factor<00:00:35.640> but<00:00:36.059> not<00:00:36.630> as<00:00:36.780> nice<00:00:36.960> as<00:00:37.020> maybe<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
factor but not as nice as maybe the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.040 
factor but not as nice as maybe the
PlayStation<00:00:38.160> 3's<00:00:38.489> directional<00:00:39.270> pad<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.660> then

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
PlayStation 3's directional pad and then

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.410 
PlayStation 3's directional pad and then
up<00:00:40.170> top<00:00:40.379> here<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.800> have<00:00:40.829> analog<00:00:41.670> shoulder

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
up top here you have analog shoulder

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.910 
up top here you have analog shoulder
buttons<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.960> trigger<00:00:43.140> buttons<00:00:43.469> up<00:00:43.620> here<00:00:43.800> so

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
buttons and trigger buttons up here so

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.900 
buttons and trigger buttons up here so
you<00:00:43.980> can<00:00:44.070> see<00:00:44.160> there's<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> little<00:00:44.489> bit<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.700> give

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
you can see there's a little bit of give

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.880 
you can see there's a little bit of give
to<00:00:45.090> them<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.390> think<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.629> can<00:00:45.809> more<00:00:46.500> finely

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
to them and I think you can more finely

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.459 
to them and I think you can more finely
control<00:00:47.640> your<00:00:48.000> button<00:00:48.390> presses<00:00:48.840> there<00:00:48.989> now<00:00:49.350> on

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
control your button presses there now on

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.470 
control your button presses there now on
the<00:00:49.590> back<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:50.010> has<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.399> mode<00:00:50.730> button<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.390> can

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
the back it has a mode button and it can

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.450 
the back it has a mode button and it can
operate<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.350> couple<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.710> different<00:00:53.190> modes

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
operate in a couple of different modes

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.340 
operate in a couple of different modes
and<00:00:53.789> I've<00:00:53.879> tried<00:00:54.300> one<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.600> these<00:00:54.780> or<00:00:55.079> something

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
and I've tried one of these or something

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.260 
and I've tried one of these or something
similar<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:55.949> from<00:00:56.699> kind<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.059> one<00:00:57.210> of

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
similar to this from kind of like one of

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.000 
similar to this from kind of like one of
the<00:00:57.329> generic<00:00:57.809> manufacturers<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> while<00:00:58.739> back

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the generic manufacturers a while back

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.950 
the generic manufacturers a while back
and<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.489> was<00:00:59.879> assuming<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.570> when<00:01:00.719> you're<00:01:00.840> in

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
and I was assuming that when you're in

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.080 
and I was assuming that when you're in
game<00:01:01.260> pad<00:01:01.530> mode<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.980> will<00:01:02.070> work<00:01:02.280> with<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.489> PC<00:01:02.910> or

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
game pad mode it will work with a PC or

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.850 
game pad mode it will work with a PC or
Mac<00:01:03.300> also<00:01:03.719> because<00:01:04.049> bluetooth<00:01:04.409> does<00:01:04.650> have

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
Mac also because bluetooth does have

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.609 
Mac also because bluetooth does have
basically<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.640> game<00:01:05.909> controller<00:01:06.439> standard<00:01:07.439> but

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
basically a game controller standard but

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.440 
basically a game controller standard but
this<00:01:07.770> does<00:01:08.040> not<00:01:08.070> conform<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.360> when

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
this does not conform to that so when

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.570 
this does not conform to that so when
you<00:01:09.540> plug<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.930> into<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.200> PC<00:01:10.409> or<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.860> Mac<00:01:11.130> it's

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
you plug it into a PC or a Mac it's

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.980 
you plug it into a PC or a Mac it's
going<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.909> show<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.180> as<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> keyboard<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.930> be

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
going to show up as a keyboard and be

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.840 
going to show up as a keyboard and be
pretty<00:01:13.200> much<00:01:13.380> unusable<00:01:13.830> as<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.280> game

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
pretty much unusable as a game

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.070 
pretty much unusable as a game
controller<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.509> if<00:01:15.600> you're<00:01:15.720> looking<00:01:15.840> for

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
controller so if you're looking for

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.600 
controller so if you're looking for
something<00:01:16.259> that<00:01:16.409> works<00:01:16.710> across<00:01:17.040> every<00:01:17.369> device

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
something that works across every device

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.460 
something that works across every device

into it's like a little mini arcade and
so<00:01:38.700> there's<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.939> lot<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.270> games<00:01:39.479> out<00:01:39.659> kind<00:01:40.049> of

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
so there's a lot of games out kind of

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.870 
so there's a lot of games out kind of
older<00:01:40.409> games<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.799> support<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.490> iCade

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
older games that support the iCade

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.429 
older games that support the iCade
protocol<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.540> will<00:01:42.659> work<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:42.990> iOS<00:01:43.200> devices

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
protocol that will work on iOS devices

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.960 
protocol that will work on iOS devices
I'll<00:01:43.979> show<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.189> how<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.340> works<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.880> minute

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
I'll show you how that works in a minute

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.940 
I'll show you how that works in a minute
but<00:01:45.720> unfortunately<00:01:46.229> allow<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.409> newer<00:01:46.710> games

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
but unfortunately allow the newer games

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.440 
but unfortunately allow the newer games
are<00:01:47.130> going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.430> conform<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.909> Apple's<00:01:48.329> new

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
are going to conform to Apple's new

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.910 
are going to conform to Apple's new
standard<00:01:48.899> which<00:01:49.020> won't<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.350> compatible<00:01:49.649> with

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
standard which won't be compatible with

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.560 
standard which won't be compatible with
this<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.310> you'll<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.549> maybe<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.090> limited<00:01:51.450> run

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
this so you'll have maybe a limited run

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.870 
this so you'll have maybe a limited run
on<00:01:51.720> your<00:01:51.840> iOS<00:01:51.960> device<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:53.040> also<00:01:53.100> has<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> mouse

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
on your iOS device it also has a mouse

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.090 
on your iOS device it also has a mouse
mode<00:01:54.210> where<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.479> use<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.930> as<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.079> mouse<00:01:55.890> on

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
mode where you can use it as a mouse on

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.770 
mode where you can use it as a mouse on
your<00:01:56.250> Android<00:01:56.640> device<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.329> move<00:01:57.509> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
your Android device so you can move the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.139 
your Android device so you can move the
mouse<00:01:58.200> pointer<00:01:58.229> around<00:01:59.189> with<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.640> left

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
mouse pointer around with the left

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.999 
mouse pointer around with the left
thumbstick<00:02:00.390> here<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.079> then<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.500> last<00:02:01.710> mode

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
thumbstick here and then the last mode

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.819 
thumbstick here and then the last mode
is<00:02:02.250> app<00:02:02.820> mode<00:02:03.299> where<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:04.170> can<00:02:04.200> switch<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.649> into

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
is app mode where you can switch it into

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.530 
is app mode where you can switch it into
that<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.250> there's<00:02:05.369> an<00:02:05.490> app<00:02:05.670> from<00:02:05.880> neko<00:02:06.299> that

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
that and there's an app from neko that

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.779 
that and there's an app from neko that
will<00:02:06.689> allow<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.110> map<00:02:08.039> controls<00:02:08.550> for

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
will allow you to map controls for

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.850 
will allow you to map controls for
certain<00:02:09.090> games<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.080> joystick<00:02:10.530> however

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
certain games to the joystick however

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.740 
certain games to the joystick however
you<00:02:11.009> would<00:02:11.129> like<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.459> have<00:02:11.580> done<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:12.090> will<00:02:12.390> also

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
you would like to have done I will also

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.520 
you would like to have done I will also
map<00:02:12.959> keep

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
map keep

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.640 
map keep
two<00:02:14.010> specific<00:02:14.640> buttons<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.540> controls<00:02:15.960> on<00:02:16.470> the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
two specific buttons and controls on the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.680 
two specific buttons and controls on the
stick<00:02:16.890> as<00:02:17.100> well<00:02:17.130> so<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.670> have<00:02:17.760> some<00:02:18.660> options

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
stick as well so you have some options

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.150 
stick as well so you have some options
there<00:02:19.170> although<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.440> don't<00:02:19.560> think<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:19.950> app

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
there although I don't think that app

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.710 
there although I don't think that app
just<00:02:20.400> reading<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.790> app<00:02:20.970> reviews<00:02:21.390> has<00:02:21.540> been

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
just reading the app reviews has been

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.840 
just reading the app reviews has been
all<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.440> useful<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:23.130> also<00:02:23.340> works<00:02:23.670> with<00:02:23.760> the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
all that useful it also works with the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.520 
all that useful it also works with the
Lea<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.750> course<00:02:24.960> as<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.140> mentioned<00:02:25.470> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
Lea and of course as I mentioned the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.190 
Lea and of course as I mentioned the
Amazon<00:02:26.010> Fire<00:02:26.400> HD<00:02:27.000> as<00:02:27.150> well<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:27.660> pretty<00:02:28.080> much

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
Amazon Fire HD as well so pretty much

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.740 
Amazon Fire HD as well so pretty much
anything<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.800> Android<00:02:29.310> ecosystem<00:02:29.750> should

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
anything in the Android ecosystem should

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.150 
anything in the Android ecosystem should
work<00:02:30.959> just<00:02:30.990> fine<00:02:31.380> with<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:31.740> so<00:02:31.830> let's<00:02:31.920> take<00:02:32.130> a

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
work just fine with this so let's take a

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.590 
work just fine with this so let's take a
look<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.520> I'll<00:02:32.610> run<00:02:32.760> through<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.180> few

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
look and I'll run through a few

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.790 
look and I'll run through a few
scenarios<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.320> can<00:02:34.440> see<00:02:34.560> how<00:02:34.680> it

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
scenarios so you can see how it

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.470 
scenarios so you can see how it
functions<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.670> now<00:02:35.760> I've<00:02:35.850> paired<00:02:36.120> up<00:02:36.300> my

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
functions so now I've paired up my

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.180 
functions so now I've paired up my
controller<00:02:37.020> with<00:02:37.260> my<00:02:37.440> Mac<00:02:37.680> which<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:37.950> can<00:02:38.070> see

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
controller with my Mac which you can see

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.620 
controller with my Mac which you can see
in<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.370> background<00:02:38.550> there<00:02:38.880> and<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.180> shows<00:02:39.390> up

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
in the background there and it shows up

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.540 
in the background there and it shows up
but<00:02:39.840> it<00:02:39.930> shows<00:02:40.140> up<00:02:40.380> as<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.590> keyboard<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.459> I've

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
but it shows up as a keyboard and I've

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.130 
but it shows up as a keyboard and I've
tried<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.970> load<00:02:42.120> up<00:02:42.270> a<00:02:42.360> couple<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.750> different

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
tried to load up a couple of different

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.470 
tried to load up a couple of different
Mac<00:02:43.830> apps<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.490> see<00:02:44.670> that<00:02:44.850> support<00:02:45.180> game

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
Mac apps to see that support game

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.910 
Mac apps to see that support game
controllers<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.020> see<00:02:46.170> if<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.380> would<00:02:46.470> function

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
controllers to see if it would function

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.680 
controllers to see if it would function
with<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.550> it<00:02:47.610> doesn't<00:02:47.640> because<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.510> Mac

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
with it and it doesn't because the Mac

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.090 
with it and it doesn't because the Mac
and<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.170> Windows<00:02:49.440> computers<00:02:49.890> for<00:02:50.010> that

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
and the Windows computers for that

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.190 
and the Windows computers for that
matter<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.520> think<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.239> this<00:02:51.390> is<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.690> keyboard

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
matter I think that this is a keyboard

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.990 
matter I think that this is a keyboard
and<00:02:52.470> oddly<00:02:52.830> enough<00:02:53.130> when<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.610> start<00:02:53.880> moving

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
and oddly enough when you start moving

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.449 
and oddly enough when you start moving
the<00:02:54.209> left<00:02:54.570> thumbstick<00:02:54.810> around<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.440> also<00:02:55.590> move

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
the left thumbstick around you also move

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.640 
the left thumbstick around you also move
the<00:02:56.670> mouse<00:02:56.820> pointer<00:02:56.850> around<00:02:57.540> as<00:02:57.720> well<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.140> the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
the mouse pointer around as well and the

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.100 
the mouse pointer around as well and the
little<00:02:59.459> keyboard<00:03:00.030> setup<00:03:00.330> assistant<00:03:00.840> here

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
little keyboard setup assistant here

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.050 
little keyboard setup assistant here
shows<00:03:01.770> up<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.160> try<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.340> figure<00:03:02.670> out<00:03:02.880> what

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
shows up to try to figure out what

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.110 
shows up to try to figure out what
exactly<00:03:03.180> is<00:03:03.750> plugged<00:03:04.110> into<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:04.739> as<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.220> PC<00:03:05.940> or

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
exactly is plugged into it so as a PC or

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.850 
exactly is plugged into it so as a PC or
Mac<00:03:06.239> controller<00:03:06.750> it's<00:03:07.200> not<00:03:07.380> going<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.590> do<00:03:07.739> it

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
Mac controller it's not going to do it

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.070 
Mac controller it's not going to do it
for<00:03:08.040> you<00:03:08.100> but<00:03:08.190> let's<00:03:08.340> take<00:03:08.489> a<00:03:08.520> look<00:03:08.730> at<00:03:08.850> iOS<00:03:09.239> so

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
for you but let's take a look at iOS so

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.540 
for you but let's take a look at iOS so
we<00:03:10.170> have<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.440> game<00:03:10.650> controller<00:03:11.010> hooked<00:03:11.220> up<00:03:11.430> to

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
we have the game controller hooked up to

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.100 
we have the game controller hooked up to
my<00:03:11.670> iPad<00:03:12.090> here<00:03:12.239> as<00:03:12.420> you<00:03:12.540> can<00:03:12.570> see<00:03:12.690> it's<00:03:12.989> working

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
my iPad here as you can see it's working

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.840 
my iPad here as you can see it's working
just<00:03:13.470> fine<00:03:13.680> with<00:03:13.890> Metal<00:03:14.160> Slug<00:03:14.310> which<00:03:14.580> is<00:03:14.700> one

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
just fine with Metal Slug which is one

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.490 
just fine with Metal Slug which is one
of<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.000> iCade<00:03:15.420> compatible<00:03:15.959> games<00:03:16.110> but<00:03:16.410> the

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
of the iCade compatible games but the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.990 
of the iCade compatible games but the
problem<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.519> mapping<00:03:17.880> is<00:03:17.940> a

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
problem is is that the mapping is a

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.820 
problem is is that the mapping is a
little<00:03:18.180> messed<00:03:18.360> up<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:19.110> my<00:03:19.260> jump<00:03:19.530> button

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
little messed up and that my jump button

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.440 
little messed up and that my jump button
is<00:03:19.950> mapped<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.580> shoulder<00:03:20.910> button<00:03:21.180> here

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
is mapped to the shoulder button here

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.720 
is mapped to the shoulder button here
and<00:03:21.600> based<00:03:22.260> on<00:03:22.410> how<00:03:22.650> this<00:03:22.799> iCade<00:03:23.250> stuff<00:03:23.489> works

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
and based on how this iCade stuff works

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.280 
and based on how this iCade stuff works
you<00:03:23.880> really<00:03:23.940> don't<00:03:24.390> have<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.510> lot<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.750> options

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
you really don't have a lot of options

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.020 
you really don't have a lot of options
for<00:03:25.350> mapping<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:25.980> controller's<00:03:26.430> differently

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
for mapping the controller's differently

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.360 
for mapping the controller's differently
so<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:28.110> know<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.440> might<00:03:28.620> see<00:03:28.890> some<00:03:29.100> issues

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
so you know you might see some issues

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.520 
so you know you might see some issues
especially<00:03:29.580> with<00:03:30.239> games<00:03:30.480> like<00:03:30.600> this<00:03:30.900> where<00:03:31.230> if

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
especially with games like this where if

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.690 
especially with games like this where if
you're<00:03:31.739> hoping<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.100> have<00:03:32.280> all<00:03:32.400> your<00:03:32.519> buttons

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
you're hoping to have all your buttons

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.090 
you're hoping to have all your buttons
aligned<00:03:33.209> in<00:03:33.390> one<00:03:33.540> spot<00:03:33.870> it's<00:03:34.410> not<00:03:34.590> gonna<00:03:34.860> work

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
aligned in one spot it's not gonna work

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.100 
aligned in one spot it's not gonna work
that<00:03:35.160> way<00:03:35.340> for<00:03:35.489> you<00:03:35.790> so<00:03:36.480> here<00:03:36.630> we<00:03:36.750> are<00:03:36.780> in<00:03:37.019> the

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
Lea and the Ouya is an Android device

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.699 
Lea and the Ouya is an Android device
and<00:03:39.330> as<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:39.540> can<00:03:39.630> see<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.930> Nikko<00:03:40.230> Play<00:03:40.470> Pad

Pro shows up here again as a keyboard

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.560 
Pro shows up here again as a keyboard
but<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.620> Android<00:03:44.070> devices<00:03:44.430> know<00:03:45.150> how<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.329> make

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
but the Android devices know how to make

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.940 
but the Android devices know how to make
it<00:03:45.720> work<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:46.079> we're<00:03:46.170> gonna<00:03:46.260> take<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.470> look<00:03:46.680> here

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.430 
it work so we're gonna take a look here
at<00:03:47.100> MAME<00:03:47.430> running<00:03:47.910> on<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.360> ouya<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:48.989> as<00:03:49.320> you

at MAME running on the ouya and as you

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.470 
at MAME running on the ouya and as you
can<00:03:49.530> see<00:03:49.709> here<00:03:49.950> a<00:03:50.160> booyah<00:03:50.730> app<00:03:50.910> this<00:03:51.180> is<00:03:51.239> the

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
can see here a booyah app this is the

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.030 
can see here a booyah app this is the
main<00:03:51.690> app<00:03:51.900> running<00:03:52.200> altered<00:03:52.590> beast<00:03:52.769> is

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
main app running altered beast is

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.410 
main app running altered beast is
working<00:03:53.370> just<00:03:53.549> fine<00:03:53.700> with<00:03:53.880> the<00:03:53.970> controller<00:03:54.299> so

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
working just fine with the controller so

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.630 
working just fine with the controller so
that<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.110> Nico<00:03:55.470> Play<00:03:55.769> Pad<00:03:56.040> Pro<00:03:56.070> and

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.160 
that is the Nico Play Pad Pro and
overall<00:03:56.940> it's<00:03:57.090> a<00:03:57.150> pretty<00:03:57.180> nice<00:03:57.540> controller<00:03:57.989> it

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
overall it's a pretty nice controller it

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.900 
overall it's a pretty nice controller it
feels<00:03:58.380> nice<00:03:58.590> in<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:58.890> hand<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.280> supports<00:03:59.730> both

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
feels nice in the hand it supports both

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.690 
feels nice in the hand it supports both
the<00:04:00.390> Amazon<00:04:00.660> Fire<00:04:01.110> HD<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:02.280> Android

the Amazon Fire HD and the Android

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.670 
the Amazon Fire HD and the Android
platform<00:04:03.239> unfortunately<00:04:04.079> it<00:04:04.200> shows<00:04:04.380> up<00:04:04.560> as<00:04:04.650> a

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
platform unfortunately it shows up as a

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.319 
platform unfortunately it shows up as a
keyboard<00:04:04.950> whenever<00:04:05.430> you<00:04:05.519> plug<00:04:05.730> it<00:04:05.880> into<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.120> PC

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
keyboard whenever you plug it into a PC

keyboard whenever you plug it into a PC
or<00:04:06.690> Mac<00:04:06.930> which<00:04:07.170> was<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.320> bit<00:04:07.500> disappointing

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
or Mac which was a bit disappointing

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.500 
or Mac which was a bit disappointing
because<00:04:08.190> I<00:04:08.610> would<00:04:08.970> have<00:04:09.060> liked<00:04:09.239> to<00:04:09.269> have<00:04:09.420> seen

because I would have liked to have seen

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.140 
because I would have liked to have seen
it<00:04:09.810> work<00:04:09.989> across<00:04:10.350> platforms<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.519> it<00:04:11.640> says<00:04:11.910> on

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
it work across platforms and it says on

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.060 
it work across platforms and it says on
the<00:04:12.299> box<00:04:12.510> that's<00:04:12.780> Bluetooth<00:04:13.170> hid<00:04:13.380> but<00:04:13.980> it

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
the box that's Bluetooth hid but it

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.979 
the box that's Bluetooth hid but it
really<00:04:14.220> kind<00:04:14.519> of<00:04:14.670> isn't<00:04:15.030> if<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.600> computers

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
really kind of isn't if the computers

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.289 
really kind of isn't if the computers
don't<00:04:16.229> pick<00:04:16.440> it<00:04:16.560> up<00:04:16.739> as<00:04:16.950> such<00:04:17.280> but<00:04:17.579> overall

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
don't pick it up as such but overall

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.640 
don't pick it up as such but overall
