00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.710
 I start one day benoit we will help all 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.790
 seen from the Koran time river iv and we have 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.860
 we be question does not have a lot of 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.330
 readers on the chalon.com magazine which 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.210
 ask us regular questions 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.550
 and we have young hunters who 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.070
 start their first year and 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.660
 would like to know what kind of weapons 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.470
 could he use for 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.750
 to hunt wild boars 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.850
 okay and so here is the good 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.170
 question so I want to answer that 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.030
 to chase to survive there really 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.559
 a budget question the first thing 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.850
 it's a young hunter does not have 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.170
 necessarily the means to buy a 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.390
 rifle or an express that is even 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.260
 even more expensive than a rifle but we 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.110
 all have a shotgun 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.699
 so quite pull the ashtray in 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.650
 reasonable shooting distances with a 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.870
 rifle and with brenneke bullets or 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.949
 finally rescues debate equivalents 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.989
 the fact for the big game 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.510
 knowing that the shooting distance she is 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.010
 very low and the accuracy is all to 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.690
 does randomly agree when the 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.729
 firing distance is very low with a 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.680
 rifle in general must not exceed 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.540
 walking races effects 1.30m 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.450
 we are already thirty meters far 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.130
 okay but mostly on it's not 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.630
 at all appreciated must also know that 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.740
 bullets brenneke bullets are very 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.020
 dangerous this bean game terribly 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.210
 a lot more than games total look 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.780
 with a rifle bullet and we can 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.590
 as well shot with a shotgun 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.450
 a wild boar with a 12 gauge caliber 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.579
 16 a caliber 20 really there are some 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.210
 calibers who would like there are some 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.619
 calibres to proscribe obviously 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.330
 I do not advise drawing a 28 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.650
 january - greenhouse are often tons 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.540
 Finally, it is necessary to respect 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.340
 animals that are tuned and then all 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.940
 the little 410 caliber obviously this is 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.119
 to forbid 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.710
 this energy is otherwise 12 gauge it's 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.850
 dreadful it's also we are typing a 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.030
 bullet of very big caliber 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.420
 rifle at n is not nice 30-40 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.560
 meters 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.150
 why we must not go beyond 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.489
 I will go three meters 35 to be 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.950
 serious okay and a young hunter 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.709
 can get a weapon around which 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.970
 budget on the chassis for the future 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.790
 other tanks and humble there really 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.459
 all the entry-level prions of 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.170
 russian rifle for example we have 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.760
 made around 500 euros 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.530
 now be able to something 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.680
 seriously you have to stay on brands 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.180
 quite known 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.890
 it is necessary to count around 3000 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.000
 euros for already having a nice little 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.579
 rifle right here 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.709
 and so if nevertheless a young hunter 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:39.579
 hunting regulation the big game of 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.480
 to get a rifle then already what 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.569
 type of rifle 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.829
 is it better for a point a 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.139
 beginner is what garmin who are 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.599
 which will be better there are several types 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:51.609
 of carradine the best known rifle 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.409
 it's this kind of rifle so it has to 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:55.739
 sound rifles bletterans 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:58.930
 the call of future rifles or 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.930
 watchmen 18 that's very reliable it's 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.060
 often we find rifles 9 for 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.319
 around 1000 1500 euros without 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.639
 of optics has passed our little ones who is going 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.810
 to make a difference and often their lives 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.269
 of the bezel and mounting is 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.930
 higher than the price dakar haguenau nano 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.030
 since a good glasses must 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.829
 count an average budget from 1500 to 2000 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.629
 euros and we can even exceed widely 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.819
 the 2 million is what to start 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.579
 one for his first season for example 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.310
 a young hunter can chase him 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.769
 properly without having optical 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.510
 but it is in the optics of the facility 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:33.970
 the task not sorry to the organs of aim 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.280
 often beaten quality of savasse 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.540
 unlimited anyway to the habit of 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.760
 take advantage of that time if we have 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.139
 animals that leave in full wind of 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.659
 distance the glasses and still 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:46.030
 indispensable to agree and in terms of 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:51.129
 caliber what would you advise 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:53.829
 to a young hunter to start in 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:55.540
 term of two calibers are difficult 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.009
 of officials of the once again that 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.549
 depends quite the type of hunt that 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:59.349
 we will do 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.579
 dakar after the caliber in europe 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.380
 which are much more versatile 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.270
 others so to let go 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.160
 channel boards such as the 7 64 which 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.570
 are very versatile gutters and 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.770
 especially a choice of ammunition that is 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.910
 very important since we are going from 25 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.800
 it's very versatile you can shoot anything 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.090
 type of game with that in France and 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.250
 after calibres that are more 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.350
 advocated for the beat so the 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.560
 calibers such as the 9 3 74 for 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.610
 express 962 for rifles 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.550
 qualifiers that are a little heavier a 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.780
 little slower and here is what 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.410
 that they did and especially to pull a 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.900
 not far away 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.250
 okay after that depends on everything to 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.680
 does the type of hunting or but with a 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.620
 7 64 we can do almost everything ok 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:42.250
 the ideal for a young hunter and for 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.190
 to conclude is for you to make your own 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.110
 own idea alone or is it 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.540
 the ideal is still to go see a 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.050
 gunsmith as much as to make a gunsmith 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.340
 adherents in a difference is to my 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.750
 eyes it's true that council first 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.700
 we do not have the infused science had 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.170
 many people have thought they have 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.430
 welcomed dead of choice to the 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.600
 read you have to shoot said 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.110
 future with this one with such 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.120
 ammunition 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.500
 there are versatile qualifications in France 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.880
 does not arrive of bad caliber 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.440
 now there are some who animate it 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.570
 suitable for hunting types well 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.240
 defined here is simon chasing after in 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.750
 mountain it's still other calibres 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.110
 that's where you got it 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.790
 all calibers in 7 8 and 9 August and 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.140
 after the wavy caliber locality said 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:25.010
 that they are more than they are anymore 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:27.170
 used in beat or on the lookout ok very 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.120
 well and good thanks thomas nothing with 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.680
 all this information hoping that 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.340
 you will be able to draw a lot of 110 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.340
 next year
