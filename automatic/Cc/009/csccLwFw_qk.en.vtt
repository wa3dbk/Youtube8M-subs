00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.250 

I<00:00:11.470> think<00:00:12.340> it<00:00:12.610> took<00:00:12.880> a<00:00:12.940> lot<00:00:13.269> of<00:00:13.330> convincing<00:00:13.540> I

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
I think it took a lot of convincing I

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.100 
I think it took a lot of convincing I
mean<00:00:15.070> the<00:00:15.190> original<00:00:15.610> school<00:00:15.879> was<00:00:16.090> past<00:00:16.840> mores

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110

and<00:00:20.740> I<00:00:21.430> think<00:00:21.520> he<00:00:23.460> never<00:00:24.460> liked<00:00:24.759> to<00:00:25.090> sort<00:00:25.300> of

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
and I think he never liked to sort of

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:28.710 
and I think he never liked to sort of
say<00:00:25.810> no<00:00:25.840> to<00:00:26.140> things<00:00:26.500> so<00:00:27.310> it<00:00:27.699> was<00:00:27.880> a<00:00:27.910> sort<00:00:28.539> of<00:00:28.630> a

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
say no to things so it was a sort of a

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.439 
say no to things so it was a sort of a
massive<00:00:29.050> challenge<00:00:29.230> for<00:00:29.740> him<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:31.119> a<00:00:31.240> soar

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
massive challenge for him and a soar

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.310 
massive challenge for him and a soar
brave<00:00:31.750> decision<00:00:32.379> but<00:00:33.449> one<00:00:34.449> that<00:00:34.660> he<00:00:34.960> sort<00:00:35.290> of

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
brave decision but one that he sort of

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.380 
brave decision but one that he sort of
wanted<00:00:35.739> he<00:00:35.920> could<00:00:36.040> see<00:00:36.400> the<00:00:36.610> excitement<00:00:37.000> and

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
wanted he could see the excitement and

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.110 
wanted he could see the excitement and
the<00:00:37.449> sort<00:00:37.720> of<00:00:37.780> that<00:00:38.519> you<00:00:39.519> know<00:00:39.670> it<00:00:39.820> could<00:00:40.090> be

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
the sort of that you know it could be

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.320 
the sort of that you know it could be
something<00:00:40.449> quite<00:00:40.780> special<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:42.100> I<00:00:42.699> mean<00:00:43.210> we

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
something quite special so I mean we

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.440 
something quite special so I mean we
approached<00:00:44.520> hundreds<00:00:45.520> of<00:00:45.850> schools<00:00:46.120> that

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
approached hundreds of schools that

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.560 
approached hundreds of schools that
we've<00:00:47.410> mainly<00:00:47.800> focused<00:00:48.700> on<00:00:48.790> schools<00:00:49.270> that<00:00:49.360> had

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.380 
we've mainly focused on schools that had
good<00:00:49.870> or<00:00:50.050> outstanding<00:00:50.100> Ofsted's<00:00:51.100> so<00:00:51.820> they<00:00:52.059> had

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
good or outstanding Ofsted's so they had

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.779 
good or outstanding Ofsted's so they had
a<00:00:52.420> sort<00:00:52.690> of<00:00:52.719> confidence<00:00:53.260> about<00:00:53.950> what<00:00:54.489> they

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
a sort of confidence about what they

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:56.310 
a sort of confidence about what they
were<00:00:54.850> doing<00:00:55.300> you<00:00:55.510> know<00:00:55.600> we<00:00:55.840> could<00:00:56.020> be<00:00:56.110> very

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
clear that we weren't looking to sort of

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:00.540

that<00:04:56.300> level<00:04:56.690> of<00:04:56.780> teachers<00:04:57.680> being<00:04:57.950> more<00:04:58.610> than

political<00:05:04.070> point<00:05:04.280> I<00:05:04.370> think<00:05:04.430> does<00:05:04.640> the<00:05:04.790> does

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
political point I think does the does

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.900 
political point I think does the does
the<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.870> series<00:05:06.200> that<00:05:06.460> is<00:05:07.460> it<00:05:07.610> political

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
the the series that is it political

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.790 
the the series that is it political
point<00:05:08.060> a<00:05:08.150> kind<00:05:08.420> of<00:05:08.510> a<00:05:08.600> point<00:05:09.290> for<00:05:09.470> everybody

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.070 
point a kind of a point for everybody
that<00:05:09.980> you<00:05:10.910> can<00:05:11.060> identify<00:05:11.180> with<00:05:11.630> at<00:05:11.720> least<00:05:11.810> one

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
that you can identify with at least one

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.390 
that you can identify with at least one

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
in in one of the two series so far and

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.810 
in in one of the two series so far and
it<00:05:16.880> just<00:05:17.330> shows<00:05:17.600> I<00:05:17.960> think<00:05:18.650> it'll<00:05:18.920> take<00:05:19.640> you<00:05:19.730> to

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
it just shows I think it'll take you to

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.010 
it just shows I think it'll take you to
the<00:05:19.910> hearts<00:05:20.060> because<00:05:20.210> they<00:05:20.330> realize<00:05:20.630> actually

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
the hearts because they realize actually

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.600 
the hearts because they realize actually
teachers<00:05:21.530> don't<00:05:21.710> just<00:05:22.010> you<00:05:22.280> know<00:05:22.370> it's<00:05:22.520> not

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
teachers don't just you know it's not

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.190 
teachers don't just you know it's not
just<00:05:22.670> turning<00:05:23.150> up<00:05:23.210> ninth<00:05:23.510> or<00:05:23.690> three<00:05:23.900> and<00:05:24.020> doing

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
just turning up ninth or three and doing

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.680 
just turning up ninth or three and doing
this<00:05:24.290> certainly<00:05:24.650> other<00:05:24.770> it<00:05:25.360> it<00:05:26.360> sees<00:05:26.540> more

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
this certainly other it it sees more

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.300 
this certainly other it it sees more
than<00:05:26.750> job<00:05:26.990> it's<00:05:27.110> a<00:05:27.170> vocation<00:05:27.410> and<00:05:27.770> I<00:05:27.890> think

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
than job it's a vocation and I think

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.520 
than job it's a vocation and I think
people<00:05:28.460> have<00:05:28.520> seen<00:05:29.030> that<00:05:29.180> and<00:05:29.360> could<00:05:29.530> linked

moment I think and it's incredible how
the<00:05:41.690> central<00:05:42.050> themes<00:05:42.290> are<00:05:42.590> pretty<00:05:42.860> much<00:05:43.450> the

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
the central themes are pretty much the

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:45.490 
the central themes are pretty much the
thing<00:05:44.570> you<00:05:44.630> know<00:05:44.690> the<00:05:44.780> same<00:05:44.960> comments<00:05:45.350> come

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
thing you know the same comments come

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.110 
thing you know the same comments come
from<00:05:45.650> from<00:05:45.830> whether<00:05:46.250> it's<00:05:46.400> in<00:05:46.490> the<00:05:46.550> UK<00:05:46.790> or<00:05:46.910> it's

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
from from whether it's in the UK or it's

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.750 
from from whether it's in the UK or it's
Australia<00:05:47.690> it's<00:05:47.780> it's<00:05:48.650> great<00:05:48.830> I<00:05:49.070> think<00:05:49.430> that

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
Australia it's it's great I think that

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.930 
Australia it's it's great I think that
you<00:05:50.630> see<00:05:51.050> teachers<00:05:51.560> as<00:05:51.710> human<00:05:52.070> beings<00:05:52.430> and

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
you see teachers as human beings and

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.240 
you see teachers as human beings and
we've<00:05:53.120> all<00:05:53.330> experienced<00:05:54.290> obviously<00:05:54.770> school

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
we've all experienced obviously school

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.940 
we've all experienced obviously school
life<00:05:55.520> and<00:05:55.880> we<00:05:56.690> never<00:05:56.900> quite<00:05:57.410> there's<00:05:57.830> always

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
life and we never quite there's always

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.830 
life and we never quite there's always
that<00:05:58.190> fear<00:05:58.520> around<00:05:58.790> teachers<00:05:59.270> a<00:05:59.300> little<00:05:59.480> bit

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
that fear around teachers a little bit

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.020 
that fear around teachers a little bit
so<00:06:00.260> seeing<00:06:00.650> teachers<00:06:00.890> as<00:06:01.280> normal<00:06:02.000> people

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
so seeing teachers as normal people

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.720 
so seeing teachers as normal people
having<00:06:02.960> a<00:06:03.020> laugh<00:06:03.230> having<00:06:03.620> a<00:06:03.800> joke<00:06:04.040> you<00:06:04.640> know

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:04.730 
having a laugh having a joke you know

having a laugh having a joke you know
that<00:06:04.910> warmth<00:06:05.360> is<00:06:05.600> I<00:06:05.780> guess<00:06:06.140> probably<00:06:06.620> the

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
that warmth is I guess probably the
