00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
popular than the white but I mean this

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.149 
popular than the white but I mean this
is<00:01:14.130> all<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.880> fad<00:01:15.479> really<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.049> mean<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.409> I

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
is all a fad really I mean I I

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.160 
is all a fad really I mean I I
can't<00:01:17.790> say<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.210> black<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.630> better<00:01:18.869> or<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
can't say the black is better or the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.679 
can't say the black is better or the
white<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.590> better<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:20.159> me<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.479> white

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
white is better for me I like the white

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.800 
white is better for me I like the white
because<00:01:22.369> the<00:01:23.369> Submariner<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.299> strong<00:01:24.659> in

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
because the Submariner is so strong in

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.390 
because the Submariner is so strong in
the<00:01:24.930> black<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.439> think<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.950> white<00:01:26.159> is

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
the black and I think that the white is

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.399 
the black and I think that the white is
just<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.030> great<00:01:27.240> color<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.930> sports<00:01:28.259> watch

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
Omega has a C master which also has a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.020 
Omega has a C master which also has a
white<00:01:31.829> dial<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.430> think<00:01:32.670> that's<00:01:32.820> fantastic

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
white dial and I think that's fantastic

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.859 
white dial and I think that's fantastic
as<00:01:33.720> well<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.770> me<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.430> Rolex<00:01:36.119> explorer<00:01:36.600> too

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
as well but to me the Rolex explorer too

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.990 
as well but to me the Rolex explorer too
just<00:01:37.200> looks<00:01:37.409> great<00:01:37.680> with<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.430> white<00:01:38.460> dial

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
just looks great with the white dial

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.420 
just looks great with the white dial
because<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.540> original<00:01:39.780> Rolex<00:01:40.680> explorer<00:01:41.130> 2

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
because the original Rolex explorer 2

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.730 
because the original Rolex explorer 2
which<00:01:41.640> came<00:01:41.909> out<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.180> 1970<00:01:43.020> that's<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.350> orange

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
which came out in 1970 that's the orange

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.679 
which came out in 1970 that's the orange
hand

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
hand

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.230 
hand
16:55<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:46.020> was<00:01:46.140> only<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.500> black<00:01:46.770> dial<00:01:47.070> piece<00:01:47.460> so

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
16:55 it was only a black dial piece so

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.700 
16:55 it was only a black dial piece so
when<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.759> 16550<00:01:50.759> was<00:01:51.570> released<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.259> came<00:01:52.500> in

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
when the 16550 was released it came in

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.880 
when the 16550 was released it came in
ivory<00:01:53.130> white<00:01:53.520> or<00:01:53.820> black<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:55.229> white<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.770> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
ivory white or black the white and the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.370 
ivory white or black the white and the
ivory<00:01:56.280> was<00:01:56.460> something<00:01:56.820> special<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.960> that's

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
ivory was something special so that's

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.770 
ivory was something special so that's
why<00:01:58.560> I've<00:01:58.740> kind<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.219> I've<00:01:59.790> really<00:02:00.299> warmed<00:02:00.659> to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
why I've kind of I've really warmed to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.080 
why I've kind of I've really warmed to
the<00:02:00.899> white<00:02:01.110> dial<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:02.040> think<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.579> white<00:02:02.790> dial

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
the white dial and I think a white dial

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.330 
the white dial and I think a white dial
sports<00:02:03.509> watch<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:04.170> looks<00:02:04.380> fantastic<00:02:05.189> and

in the collection I could not have no
Rolexes<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.849> I<00:02:41.849> think<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.450> most<00:02:42.659> iconic

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
Rolexes and I think the most iconic

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.129 
Rolexes and I think the most iconic
watch<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.669> have<00:02:44.909> is<00:02:45.150> something<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.719> means<00:02:45.930> a

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
watch to have is something that means a

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.990 
watch to have is something that means a
lot<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:46.709> for<00:02:47.010> me<00:02:47.159> it's<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.519> Explorer

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
lot to you and for me it's the Explorer

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.770 
lot to you and for me it's the Explorer
-<00:02:48.409> I<00:02:49.409> think<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:50.129> Submariner<00:02:50.849> is<00:02:50.969> a<00:02:51.000> bit<00:02:51.239> passé

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
- I think the Submariner is a bit passé

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.990 
- I think the Submariner is a bit passé
everyone<00:02:52.439> seems<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.829> have<00:02:52.949> a<00:02:53.159> Submariner

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
whereas the Explorer 2 is just a bit

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.110 
whereas the Explorer 2 is just a bit
more<00:02:56.760> unusual<00:02:57.510> it's<00:02:58.230> funny<00:02:58.620> because<00:02:58.949> 10<00:02:59.849> years

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
more unusual it's funny because 10 years

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.689 
more unusual it's funny because 10 years
ago<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.840> Explorer<00:03:01.530> 2<00:03:01.829> was<00:03:02.069> so<00:03:02.250> much<00:03:02.430> more
