00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
you know just exploring making sure you

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.410 
you know just exploring making sure you
complete<00:05:06.220> everything<00:05:06.250> in<00:05:06.700> that<00:05:06.850> map<00:05:07.060> and<00:05:07.300> then

complete everything in that map and then

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.420 
complete everything in that map and then
moving<00:05:07.780> to<00:05:07.930> a<00:05:07.960> different<00:05:08.050> zone<00:05:08.650> say<00:05:08.950> Diaz<00:05:09.160> Sora

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
moving to a different zone say Diaz Sora

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.460

or a different races zone and doing

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.140 
or a different races zone and doing
exactly<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.890> same<00:05:12.070> there<00:05:12.340> and<00:05:12.850> then<00:05:13.000> you'll

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
exactly the same there and then you'll

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.000 
exactly the same there and then you'll
find<00:05:13.360> yourself<00:05:13.720> leveling<00:05:14.110> up<00:05:14.320> effectively

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
find yourself leveling up effectively

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.680 
find yourself leveling up effectively
rather<00:05:15.520> than<00:05:15.760> just<00:05:15.880> being<00:05:16.030> stuck<00:05:16.330> in<00:05:16.450> the<00:05:16.510> same

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690
