00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
very simple theme it has to be

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.789 
very simple theme it has to be
absolutely<00:01:10.520> purely<00:01:11.520> about<00:01:12.420> beauty<00:01:13.289> without

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
absolutely purely about beauty without

any<00:01:14.219> trace<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.670> an<00:01:14.759> edge<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.210> but<00:01:15.569> suppose

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
any trace of an edge to it but suppose

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.679 
any trace of an edge to it but suppose
like<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.319> newborn<00:01:16.770> baby<00:01:17.069> you<00:01:17.759> know<00:01:17.880> yes<00:01:18.119> kind<00:01:18.569> of

like a newborn baby you know yes kind of

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.870 
like a newborn baby you know yes kind of
innocence<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.679> think<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.189> was<00:01:20.280> actually<00:01:20.399> been

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880

came<00:01:21.390> up<00:01:21.569> with<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.319> idea<00:01:22.709> of<00:01:22.740> chimes

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
came up with the idea of chimes

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.419 
came up with the idea of chimes
reminiscent<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.869> nursery<00:01:25.349> and<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.099> some

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
reminiscent of a nursery and so on some

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:28.279 
reminiscent of a nursery and so on some
may<00:01:26.939> be<00:01:27.000> conscious<00:01:27.509> or<00:01:27.659> may<00:01:27.810> be<00:01:27.869> unconscious

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
may be conscious or may be unconscious

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:30.050 
may be conscious or may be unconscious
level<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:29.009> sort<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.159> nudges<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.759> away

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
level it just sort of nudges you away

level it just sort of nudges you away
from<00:01:30.770> distrust<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.009> suppose<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.849> all<00:01:33.030> need<00:01:33.479> to

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
from distrust I suppose we all need to

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.349 
from distrust I suppose we all need to
feel<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.560> possible<00:01:35.069> to<00:01:35.429> sort<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.090> fall

feel it's possible to sort of fall

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.419 
feel it's possible to sort of fall
forever<00:01:36.599> in<00:01:36.929> the<00:01:37.020> same<00:01:37.200> way<00:01:37.379> that<00:01:37.590> caleb<00:01:38.189> is
