00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:19.859

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:22.740
 Excited welcome to my format 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.650

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.289

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.109
 shoe have the asics but not 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.600
 some asics left light 5 here 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.770
 but it is a collage with 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.700
 naked naked it out a snickers gate 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.280
 copenhagen 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.070
 but it's not a normal sneaker, either 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.840
 Tor but 1 league store of it 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.070
 Specializing only has shoes for women 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.200

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.930
 that's why this collage is mine too 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.890
 Extremely in the heart I'll show you the times 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.239
 Shoe and go now a bit 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.190
 closer or to one 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.820
 because naked was inspired 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.510
 from the Copenhagen skyline 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.330
 or the copper roofs 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:10.350
 Copenhagen for a mint and here in front 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.150
 well copper choral why wind there 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.950
 I would have asked me what this is all 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.570
 just the copper roofs you know that 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.090
 yes, if that's oxidized then 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.810
 Of course, rather so greenish 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.100
 these two colors and inside you can see 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.220
 rainbow I did not know it that way 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.170
 what can you see that and the logo 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.360
 naked 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.700
 very big cinema ladies and gentlemen 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.500
 or ladies as a girl 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.909
 I would not miss this shoe 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.330
 this is the first turn 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.729
 the sx has released the only for 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.610
 women is i have some on the internet 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.710
 Men with this shoe seen but 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.990
 mainly this is really 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.119
 just for women and the beautiful thing about it 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.039
 shoe it too ladies I know that 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.810
 We want the shoe to look small 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.970
 or the foot looks small 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.369
 and this shoe does that too 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.890
 Asics generally known for that I have 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.350
 started buying asics because i have one 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.450
 co-student had the size 41 had 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.610
 and totally sad was that the school 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.410
 always look so great on her and her 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.640
 has completely switched to asics and 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.350
 that was actually the first one 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.239
 experience I had so as I said 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.790
 it keeps getting smaller 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:23.560
 but this color combination darker 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.819
 perfect really so i would now 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.130
 usually say that to me 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:29.170
 In any case, I'll buy a shoe though 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.489
 These are my shoes 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.320
 Unfortunately, we do not have the school today 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.910
 you always want and feed 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.390
 I just just socks 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.190
 on 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.320
 So this shoe will be in the near future 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.320
 quite often to be seen on my feet 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.030
 I 've got something for me today 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.550
 I came up with something special 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.020
 namely outfit combos to this shoe 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.210
 or with this shoe like 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.120
 always come up with a little and 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.040
 you will show yourself now 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.110
 the first is just totally bad and 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.510
 gray a white t-shirt a black one 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.730
 pants an outfit what you really are 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.930
 Day can dress in the office or how 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.060
 said on work 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.920
 if that's too boring 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.960
 you just use accessories like 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.310
 a bangle or a chain the 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.310
 color matches 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.700
 at the second car I go to this 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.640
 Rain came in what you see in the shoe 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.790
 and also a bit outside it's easy 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.620
 is gray top and a gray jeans 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.290
 it can also be black 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.269
 So the shoe just so to yourself 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.010
 validity comes and you do not somehow 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.250
 Great also any others 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.609
 accessories definitely pay attention to the focus 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.609
 the shoes 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.360
 I have a look at the third outfit 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.670
 a little more dared and have 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.430
 just looked in the closet and have 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.160
 a mint top found relatively old 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:55.260
 but I think every woman has somehow 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.730
 a mint accessory at home in the 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.200
 color then i have in mine 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.300
 cuddly and we have 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.280
 actually found a ring in the 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.750
 color choral because it is this 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.130
 collage around a complete women 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.340
 I have tried the treats 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:11.540
 femininity and white 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.540
 Socks are combined 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.930
