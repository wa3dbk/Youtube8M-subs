00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.230
 clear 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.760
 it is already at first and what is more important is the state 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.640
 of spirit its doors 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.649
 it's towards all the players have played the game a lot and all the players have 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.010
 suffered all the players 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.660
 on his side very festive and his courage it is already 50 his 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.300
 job 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.850
 after what you propose the possible title but the state of mind 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.990
 manifested summer super 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.990
 to sweat the clean results I can say that in terms of work mix 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.890
 energetic all that is forgotten worker 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.050
 he left the south has no real difference with 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.840
 the top 14 players closest French opponent yet that's true 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.780
 than in terms of muscu 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.190
 they are just a little bit late on the roles role lift 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.820
 the class c is on it too we'll be focusing on to equalize 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.450
 on the on the impacts and in the physical commitment he proposed top 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.450
 14 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.620
 later 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.950
 the time of the retirement it is necessary to adapt the physical preparation which explains 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.400
 no doubt why he was getting closer 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.640
 at most in what we offer match intensities 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.460
 especially this subject 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.330
 I think 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.000
 compared to last season thing I sing I'm sick at the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.149
 session of muscu 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.060
 if the intensity known under silence 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.780
 in terms of volume we may be doing less things have made things to me 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.680
 much more intense could start on the work in front for any idea 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.930
 the principle is what we could what I call the coup 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.910
 conditioned rugby 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.430
 that is to say, cd to find it divided magnets 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.430
 who will get closer to the reality of the game 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:15.729
 all that makes the multi task forget 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:18.629
 and percent and if the lawns 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.209
 such dramatic intensity why we also see efforts to stick to 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.759
 the reality of the game 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:27.899
 morvan the traumatic side that is to say capable states and 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:30.299
 contacts and multiply points of contact with thanks 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.379
 but we do not risk the injury so we are in a very high intensity 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.019
 which is getting closer to our match city 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.529
 while minimizing the risk of injury 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:41.739
 that's for sure and tackles have reported clearing and everything will be 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.110
 made with the important beat hess of the ground crossings 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.870
 what we find in rugby with them 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.020
 for small dishes that would go from very quickly back on the support then 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.209
 a fall on the course of support then on the sprint 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.559
 lydie goudenhooft a pass that's all we're trying to 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:58.799
 the intrigued to the maximum 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.569
 laval the whole difficulty is keep yourself is certain intensity more 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.930
 we will offer more playful things some of the players will have the 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.419
 possibility of 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:11.449
 to hide or stay a little bit indoors so I'm trying to find some 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:14.059
 exercises that are both 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:15.599
 very demanding 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:16.889
 but 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.340
 the player also take pleasure when we do not want to say that we will do 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:22.459
 only sessions that take pleasure 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.909
 but I think it's in the dosage that you have to find science 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:25.959
 qualitative 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.249
 oula the lunches at all 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.529
 and the sciences a little bit more integrate with an intensity 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:34.749
 relatively weak trend 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:39.049
 this Lyonnais small public is the equilibrium dosage that must be found 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:39.989
 Why 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.969
 to keep players alert and then to 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:45.969
 to make them perform better in the field 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:54.579
 risk that makes the connection with the players of the training center information 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:55.939
 very valuable tillie 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:57.920
 use scheduled kids 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.379
 essilor acquired in charge 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.619
 the small ones remains the referent with 

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:06.309
 the medical center are they the shops however to repudiation 

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:07.239
 players 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.969
 bic also has an important part in the I assure you in the organization 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:15.749
 he is getting back in place that we really work at 3 on the preparation 

00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:19.069
 physical who is actually a big worker 

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:23.719
 collective and in concert the change courcoult unibook a lot 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:28.830
 but of course it's medical it is signed including pierre keller 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.289
 i am waiting for full employment d 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.599
 you come to work with us I think we were very important 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.539
 work hand in hand with the 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.490
 she's used that's what he's going to do 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.919
 to promote 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.650
 returns have fed up activists on wound returns 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.259
 we do not find any risk 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.159
 but I think it will be released in the interest of the player
