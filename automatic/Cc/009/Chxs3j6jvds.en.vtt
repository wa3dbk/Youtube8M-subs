so<00:00:15.450> let's<00:00:15.660> get<00:00:15.839> started<00:00:16.880> so<00:00:17.880> first<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.330> start

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
so let's get started so first I start

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.660 
so let's get started so first I start
with<00:00:18.720> whole-wheat<00:00:19.350> croutons<00:00:20.039> now<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.400> always

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
with whole-wheat croutons now I always

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.130 
with whole-wheat croutons now I always
prefer<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.240> go<00:00:21.359> with<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.810> whole-wheat

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
prefer to go with the whole-wheat

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.290 
prefer to go with the whole-wheat
version<00:00:22.590> because<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.949> has<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> lot<00:00:23.519> more<00:00:23.550> fiber

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
version because it has a lot more fiber

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.390 
version because it has a lot more fiber
you're<00:00:25.019> not<00:00:25.230> necessarily<00:00:25.410> saving<00:00:26.160> on

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
you're not necessarily saving on

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.060 
you're not necessarily saving on
calories<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:27.480> fiber<00:00:27.810> helps<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.439> fool<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.859> up

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
calories but fiber helps to fool you up

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.560 
calories but fiber helps to fool you up
meaning<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.670> you're<00:00:29.789> less<00:00:30.029> likely<00:00:30.060> to

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
meaning that you're less likely to

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.530

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
medium-high heat because I really want

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.740

those veggies to sizzle when they hit
the<00:01:06.930> pan<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.560> we're<00:01:07.680> gonna<00:01:07.770> do<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> tablespoon

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
the pan so we're gonna do a tablespoon

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.030 
the pan so we're gonna do a tablespoon
of<00:01:08.729> olive<00:01:08.880> oil<00:01:09.740> we've<00:01:10.740> got<00:01:10.950> our<00:01:11.100> butter<00:01:11.340> here

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
of olive oil we've got our butter here

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.679 
of olive oil we've got our butter here
and<00:01:14.040> because<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.580> add<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.909> olive<00:01:15.270> oil<00:01:15.390> that

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
and because I add the olive oil that

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.300 
and because I add the olive oil that
also<00:01:15.869> helps<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.619> keep<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.920> butter<00:01:17.100> from

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
also helps to keep the butter from

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.580 
also helps to keep the butter from
burning<00:01:17.369> because<00:01:18.060> all<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.330> our<00:01:18.540> olive<00:01:19.200> oil<00:01:19.380> has

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
burning because all of our olive oil has

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.640 
burning because all of our olive oil has
a<00:01:19.619> higher<00:01:19.890> smoking<00:01:20.189> point<00:01:21.350> next<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.439> have<00:01:22.530> our

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
a higher smoking point next we have our

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.370 
a higher smoking point next we have our
beautiful<00:01:23.090> vegetables<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.720> can<00:01:24.930> chop<00:01:25.200> these
