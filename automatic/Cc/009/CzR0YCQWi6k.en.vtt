00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.590
 I show you how to apply the new one 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.630
 lipstick to emma tali with from the very high 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:23.150
 pigmentation with an absolutely finish 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:25.730
 opaque fundamental when you decide to 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.380
 wearing a matte lipstick is that of 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.000
 perfectly moisturize the lips 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.650
 above all that they are lips 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.900
 dry veil the contour of the lips 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.180
 with a long-winded pencil combined with 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.920
 lipstick starts from the center of the lip 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.620
 upper lower as vimentis i 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.510
 doctors and I go to the upper corners 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.059
 accuracy of the respect applicator 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.650
 ai matrix fluid also allows 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.370
 the application without the amnesty of the 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.110
 pencil 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.909
 my advice though for super lips 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.620
 of the symmetrical lines is that of 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.140
 always apply first a lissa 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.879
 from the corners I go to the center of the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.780
 lips on both the upper pro and the 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.430
 lower lip 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.559
 defined the contour of the lips 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.780
 use the pencil applicator for 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.979
 dilute only the center and also for 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.740
 correct any precisions from 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.560
 texture of the fluid matte and lipstick 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.630
 smooth and easy to apply 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.330
 it starts from the center of the upper lip 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.930
 and with symmetrical movements you go towards 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.610
 the corners then extend from the corner 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.050
 towards the center of the lips for 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.200
 fill the lip perfectly 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.200
 higher 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.280
 always apply on the lower lip 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.620
 a thin layer of product starting 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.620
 from the corners towards the center following 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.640
 with the applicator the shape of the lip 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.550
 complete the draft and in the part 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.300
 central as you mickey symmetrical 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.130
 taking advantage of the shaped shape 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.690
 of the applicator designed for 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.850
 hug your lips perfectly 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.030
 in a few seconds the fluid texture e 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.590
 velvety heimat li fluid will become 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.450
 completely opaque once applied 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.310
 lipstick if the outline was 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.920
 perfectly defined just use 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.410
 the concealer pupa cover in can still 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.430
 air is a flat brush to redefine 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.430
 perfectly the lips
