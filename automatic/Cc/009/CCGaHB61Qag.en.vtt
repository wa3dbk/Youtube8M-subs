like<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.729> iphones<00:01:57.140> if<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.350> want<00:01:58.530> them<00:01:58.710> you'll

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
like the iphones if you want them you'll

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.249 
like the iphones if you want them you'll
have<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.130> buy<00:01:59.250> them<00:01:59.460> separately<00:02:00.119> at<00:02:00.509> an

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
have to buy them separately at an

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.499 
have to buy them separately at an
additional<00:02:01.649> charge<00:02:02.060> which<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.180> think<00:02:03.360> there's

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
additional charge which I think there's

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.760 
additional charge which I think there's
pretty<00:02:03.689> ridiculous<00:02:04.200> because<00:02:04.350> when<00:02:04.590> you<00:02:04.649> have

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
pretty ridiculous because when you have

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.310 
pretty ridiculous because when you have
a<00:02:04.799> ipod<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.700> your<00:02:05.820> pocket<00:02:06.210> it's<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.200> much

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
a ipod in your pocket it's so much

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.800 
a ipod in your pocket it's so much
easier<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.649> just<00:02:07.890> control<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.789> from<00:02:08.940> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
easier to just control it from the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.300 
easier to just control it from the
remote<00:02:10.050> on<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.349> headphones<00:02:10.500> rather<00:02:11.190> than

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
remote on the headphones rather than

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.400 
remote on the headphones rather than
going<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:11.970> device

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
going to the device

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.510 
going to the device
so<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.100> really<00:02:14.220> should<00:02:14.520> be<00:02:14.670> standard<00:02:15.240> but

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
so that really should be standard but

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.590

Apple problem make money selling them I

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.980 
Apple problem make money selling them I
guess<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:21.330> as<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.690> can<00:02:21.900> see<00:02:22.200> there<00:02:22.410> is<00:02:22.560> no

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
guess so as you can see there is no

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.140 
guess so as you can see there is no
remote<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.530> as<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.280> can<00:02:26.400> see<00:02:26.430> there<00:02:26.970> is<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
remote and as you can see there is the

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.270 
remote and as you can see there is the
earpods<00:02:27.570> they<00:02:28.050> have<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.230> very<00:02:28.500> unique<00:02:28.590> design

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
earpods they have a very unique design

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.250 
earpods they have a very unique design
to<00:02:29.460> them<00:02:29.610> but<00:02:30.360> these<00:02:30.510> actually<00:02:30.810> sound<00:02:31.020> pretty

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
to them but these actually sound pretty

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.950 
to them but these actually sound pretty
good<00:02:31.350> as<00:02:31.740> i<00:02:32.010> have<00:02:32.190> tested<00:02:32.430> them<00:02:32.760> with<00:02:33.540> the

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
good as i have tested them with the

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.660 
good as i have tested them with the
often<00:02:34.200> five<00:02:34.380> so<00:02:34.860> they<00:02:34.980> do<00:02:35.040> sound<00:02:35.280> pretty<00:02:35.370> nice

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
often five so they do sound pretty nice

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.490 
often five so they do sound pretty nice
in<00:02:35.820> my<00:02:35.850> opinion<00:02:35.910> now<00:02:36.810> let's<00:02:37.020> go<00:02:37.200> ahead<00:02:37.320> and

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
in my opinion now let's go ahead and

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:47.170

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
you left off so it actually caches the
