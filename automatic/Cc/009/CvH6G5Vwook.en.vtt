00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.910 
the face and it's not expensive I think
this<00:02:18.250> was<00:02:18.430> like<00:02:18.459> under<00:02:18.820> $10<00:02:19.470> what<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:20.500> don't

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
this was like under $10 what I don't

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.550 
this was like under $10 what I don't
like<00:02:21.250> is<00:02:21.700> how<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:24.010> broke<00:02:24.310> me<00:02:24.490> out<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.630> don't

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
like is how it broke me out and I don't

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.120 
like is how it broke me out and I don't
know<00:02:27.360> why<00:02:28.360> I<00:02:28.950> mean<00:02:29.950> it's<00:02:30.900> very<00:02:32.130> moisturizing

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
know why I mean it's very moisturizing

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.460 
know why I mean it's very moisturizing
because<00:02:33.820> after<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.600> wash<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:35.020> off<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.320> can

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
because after you wash it off you can

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.770 
because after you wash it off you can
almost<00:02:35.650> feel<00:02:36.040> like<00:02:36.100> if<00:02:36.370> there's<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.060> film<00:02:37.570> on

almost feel like if there's a film on
your<00:02:37.900> face<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.770> I<00:02:38.860> think<00:02:38.920> that's<00:02:39.400> what<00:02:39.820> made

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.510 
your face and I think that's what made
me<00:02:40.540> break<00:02:40.780> out<00:02:40.930> because<00:02:41.200> it's<00:02:42.010> supposed<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.459> be

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520

moisturizing<00:02:43.300> you<00:02:43.420> adds<00:02:43.660> like<00:02:44.320> there's

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
moisturizing you adds like there's

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.160 
moisturizing you adds like there's
different<00:02:45.220> essential<00:02:45.400> oils<00:02:45.670> in<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.270> list<00:02:46.900> I

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
different essential oils in the list I

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.810 
different essential oils in the list I
throw<00:02:47.440> away<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.739> box<00:02:47.950> so<00:02:48.130> I<00:02:48.160> don't<00:02:48.400> know<00:02:48.580> what

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820

throw away the box so I don't know what
ingredients<00:02:49.390> are<00:02:49.480> in<00:02:49.570> there<00:02:49.690> but<00:02:50.470> it's

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
ingredients are in there but it's

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.160 
ingredients are in there but it's
supposed<00:02:51.730> to<00:02:51.970> protect<00:02:52.150> your<00:02:52.540> skin<00:02:52.750> as<00:02:52.900> opposed

but for some reasons I think the film

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.729 
but for some reasons I think the film
kind<00:02:58.330> of<00:02:58.650> clog<00:02:59.650> my<00:02:59.890> pores<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.810> just<00:03:02.470> broke
