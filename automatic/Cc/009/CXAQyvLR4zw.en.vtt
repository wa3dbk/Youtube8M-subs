 welcome to the audible version and video 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.390
 of endodontic notes this resource 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.360
 audiovisual is a complement to the 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.340
 Internet page that you consulted was 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.170
 prepared by Dr. Ricardo Rivas 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.720

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.690

 sixth unit embryology physiology e 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.879
 I urged thumbnail the subject that I'm going to 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.730
 reading within pulpal physiology is 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:41.770
 that of the nutritive function of the pulp 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.720
 the dental pulp must maintain the 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.390
 vitality of dentin by procuring 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.820
 oxygen and nutrients to dentists and 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.190
 its extensions as well as seeking a 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.350
 continuous source of dentin fluid on 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.110
 achievement of nutritive function is possible 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.239
 for the rich peripheral capillary network plexus 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.430
 capillary psuv or 'do not or plastic and its 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.160
 numerous projections to the odonto area 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.040
 plastic metabolic substrates a-quo 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.869
 soluble the plasma components are 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.060
 they filter through the capillary wall 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.310
 this happens when the pressure inside the 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.710
 capillary from cardiac pumping 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.289
 Hydrostatic pressure is greater than 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.479
 tissue pressure osmotic pressure of the 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.880
 pulp the tissue fluid enters the 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.830
 capillary in your venous terminal when the 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.110
 difference from the osmotic pressure that 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.360
 favors the resorption and exceeds the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.940
 hydrostatic pressure that favors 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.190
 filtration the dental pulp chamber can 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.560
 vary from 2 to 5 millimeters in diameter 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.170
 in its largest width the arborization 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.820
 vascular so extensive that occurs in this 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.619
 zone emanates from only a few 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.979
 arterioles entering through the foramen 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.690
 whose diameter can be of 1 millimeter 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.420
 besides the arterioles 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.660
 the space of the foramen contains small 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.420
 lymphatic vessels and terminations 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.700
 nervous sensory the subdivision of 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.980
 Blood vessels occur at all levels 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.500
 in the pulp but it is greater in the chamber 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.810
 thumb on multi-rooted teeth 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.470
 there is a large anastomosis in the camera 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.550
 thumb however there is not a quantity 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.040
 significant collateral circulation 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.590
 as a consequence of the relatively 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.140
 few communication glasses by the 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.420
 accessory ducts this is all for 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.460
 now to see the illustrations on 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.630
 the subject and the bibliography should 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:30.370
 consult the site www.ull.es takala

 to the following electronic page and 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.980
 will continue listening and watching this version
