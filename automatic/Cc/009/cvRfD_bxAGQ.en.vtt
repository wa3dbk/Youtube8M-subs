00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.500
 coca-codo-sinclair is a project in 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.240
 construction that for 2016 will generate 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.180
 1,500 megawatts of energy 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.889
 hydroelectric plant in Ecuador this Monday 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.440
 July 23 the president of the 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.299
 republic rafael belt next to esteban 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.250
 bathrobe minister of electricity and 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.010
 renewable energy of ecuador and jorge 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.570
 spinal glass of strategic sectors 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.270
 until the machine house they arrived for 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.619
 verify the progress of the work little thing 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.000
 and that will replace many thermos 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.039
 electric that burn fuels 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.779
 fossils and is the biggest source of 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.329
 pollution of the planet our them 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.530
 and those who say defend nature 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.490
 is opposed to this kind of project there 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.770
 to be 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.720
 later they went to the reservoir 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.940
 compensator and here the chief executive 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.860
 gave the order for one of the tvm 's 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.140
 German manufacture also known 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.090
 as mole or tunnel was the start 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.090
 Drilling of 15 kilometers of tunnel 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:02.300
 the mole is a machine that measures 150 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.030
 meters long whose weight exceeds 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.140
 2,000 tons together 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.120
 self-propelled by rails that will go 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.340
 building in accordance as advance the 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.410
 drilling the tunnel that is 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.870
 composed of a circular front of 9 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.090
 points 10 meters in diameter will be the one 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.690
 like a worm drilling an average of 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.060
 14 to 18 meters of rock every day with 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.410
 these works we will avoid sending to the 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.150
 atmosphere millions of tons of CO2 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.070
 although it is also a 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.340
 immense contribution to the environment 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.410
 the auto tuner by number one after 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.270
 a month that are finished assembled from 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.400
 window 2 will also start the 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.700
 drilling this in exchange for digging 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.860
 9.8 kilometers and will complete the 24 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.600
 points 8 kilometers of tunnel where 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.119
 the water will be taken to the reservoir 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.430
 compensator to then be sent to 8 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.960
 turbines themselves that will generate 1500 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.280
 megawatts of clean energy that 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.830
 will feed the national system 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.360
 interconnected from the equator thought and 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.780
 nun that Ecuador owes its television 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.780
