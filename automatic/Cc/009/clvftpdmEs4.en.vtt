pool<00:00:38.399> I'll<00:00:38.820> go<00:00:39.059> through<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.360> equipment<00:00:39.840> that

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
pool I'll go through the equipment that

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.110 
pool I'll go through the equipment that
you<00:00:40.110> need<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.620> how<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.399> set<00:00:41.700> everything<00:00:41.790> up

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
you need and how to set everything up

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.779 
you need and how to set everything up
together<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:43.260> typically<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:44.129> some<00:00:44.579> type

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
together so typically you have some type

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.790 
together so typically you have some type
of<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.030> universal<00:00:45.629> pole<00:00:45.899> they<00:00:46.500> come<00:00:46.680> in

have different they poles in the bottom

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.250 
have different they poles in the bottom
of<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> pole<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:52.020> interchange

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
of the pole so that you can interchange

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.340 
of the pole so that you can interchange
your<00:00:52.680> equipment<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.430> put<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:54.059> leaf<00:00:54.899> net<00:00:55.199> on

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
your equipment you can put a leaf net on

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.950 
your equipment you can put a leaf net on
there<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.800> skimmer<00:00:56.160> net<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.670> brush<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.809> this

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
there a skimmer net a brush and in this

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.979 
there a skimmer net a brush and in this

brushes<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.920> bottom<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.700> can

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
brushes on the bottom so that you can

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.969 
brushes on the bottom so that you can
brush<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.479> vinyl<00:01:15.810> liner<00:01:15.990> as<00:01:16.290> you're

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
brush the vinyl liner as you're

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.399 
brush the vinyl liner as you're
vacuuming<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.330> difference<00:01:18.659> between<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> vinyl

brush<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.310> bottom<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.540> actually<00:01:27.840> gets

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
brush on the bottom so it actually gets

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.780 
brush on the bottom so it actually gets
a<00:01:28.320> lot<00:01:28.500> closer<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.130> surface<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.670> the

work so you'll attach the swivel end to

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.770 
work so you'll attach the swivel end to
the<00:03:23.340> end<00:03:23.459> of<00:03:23.579> your<00:03:23.669> vac<00:03:23.880> hose<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.510> then<00:03:24.660> you'll

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
the end of your vac hose and then you'll

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.030 
the end of your vac hose and then you'll
put<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.079> hose<00:03:25.290> into<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.739> pool<00:03:26.180> vac<00:03:27.180> hoses<00:03:27.720> are

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
put the hose into the pool vac hoses are

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.009 
put the hose into the pool vac hoses are
notoriously<00:03:29.040> not<00:03:29.340> fun<00:03:29.669> to<00:03:29.819> work<00:03:29.940> with<00:03:30.019> the

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
notoriously not fun to work with the

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.050 
notoriously not fun to work with the
little<00:03:31.260> trick<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.650> if<00:03:31.980> you<00:03:32.220> spread<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:32.790> across

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
little trick is if you spread it across

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.539 
little trick is if you spread it across
the<00:03:33.630> length<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:34.139> the<00:03:34.260> pool<00:03:34.470> before<00:03:35.069> you<00:03:35.250> try<00:03:35.519> to

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
the length of the pool before you try to

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.339 
the length of the pool before you try to
put<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.910> in<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.090> water<00:03:36.269> you'll<00:03:36.870> have<00:03:37.079> less

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
put it in the water you'll have less

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.470 
put it in the water you'll have less
kinks<00:03:37.859> and<00:03:38.010> coils<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.639> deal<00:03:38.819> with<00:03:39.000> so<00:03:39.269> in

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
kinks and coils to deal with so in

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.599 
kinks and coils to deal with so in
general<00:03:39.690> that's<00:03:39.930> what<00:03:40.109> I<00:03:40.230> would<00:03:40.380> recommend<00:03:40.769> to

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
general that's what I would recommend to

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.509 
general that's what I would recommend to
get<00:03:41.880> your<00:03:42.120> hose<00:03:42.930> Prime's<00:03:43.530> basically<00:03:44.400> I'm

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
get your hose Prime's basically I'm

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.580 
get your hose Prime's basically I'm
going<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:44.819> attach<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.419> end<00:03:45.569> to<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.079> bottom<00:03:46.410> of

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
going to attach the end to the bottom of

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
is going to be fed typically you can do

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.240 
is going to be fed typically you can do
it<00:04:43.020> through<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.530> front<00:04:43.740> of<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.890> skimmer<00:04:44.160> or

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
it through the front of the skimmer or

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.159 
it through the front of the skimmer or
you<00:04:44.610> can<00:04:44.760> take<00:04:44.910> it<00:04:45.060> up<00:04:45.240> over<00:04:45.419> the<00:04:45.630> patio<00:04:45.840> it's

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
you can take it up over the patio it's

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.420 
you can take it up over the patio it's
easier<00:04:46.440> to<00:04:46.560> put<00:04:46.740> it<00:04:46.830> through<00:04:46.950> because<00:04:47.160> it

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
easier to put it through because it

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.010 
easier to put it through because it
stays<00:04:47.669> completely<00:04:48.150> underwater

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
stays completely underwater
