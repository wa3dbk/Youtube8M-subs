00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:20.039
 it was the match is not very bright 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.750
 it is 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.820
 michel millet 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.410
 as many matches nba against 1 3 1 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.970
 inches and his event 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.340
 marc ayrault in shades side i know 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.600
 that when I left I stay here 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.600
 I have my dignity 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.000
 m 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.010
 so I did not understand everything there is a 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.710
 match nba caries no it's rather my 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.640
 face coming 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.110
 hello to everyone who is naughty us 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.360
 is a basketball fan is jordan ayew 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.370
 and yes I went to the premises of 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.020
 touquet paris and I was able to do the 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.570
 famous scarface ie power 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.150
 put his face on his own player 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.420
 in career mode and that I admit that I 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:52.080
 been rather bluffed 3 2 1 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.060
 the halal to my god I was waiting for it 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.700
 for so long the face and of 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.990
 coach thann oulala then yes in 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.940
 first impressions i can tell you 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.950
 that it's really like but I 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.750
 think by putting myself on a character of 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.550
 video game 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.590
 I keep my anonymity that is 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.550
 important to me so that's why 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.050
 I have not hesitated to make this video 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.420
 because I know it's like 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.920
 but it's not my twin brother either 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.540
 so how does it happen concretely 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.970
 concretely you put before the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.530
 camera from the ps4 or the xbox one and 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.670
 then all that will be scanned 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.220
 the computer will tell you to go 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.660
 slightly far awaya slightly on 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.010
 the left and sometimes there are small 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.150
 missed as you see there my eyebrows 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.920
 it's me who did a little bit 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.930
 anything by turning your head but 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.130
 in any case you see that the part that 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.350
 is scanned this is the part that yesterday a 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.430
 little more pink and a nothing to do with the 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.930
 egg skull there just above because 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.260
 that yes you know go out with a skull 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.050
 egg 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.640
 but do not be afraid then this step 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.470
 filled I can tell you that you are going 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.060
 have fun but maybe for some 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.250
 hours one like me I could have done it 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.810
 if I had more time it's with the 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.880
 hair groups you can you 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.290
 put anything and I can you 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.760
 make sure that you have typing you 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.170
 nothing bars 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.459
 for my part I opted for the small 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.170
 haircut handsome kid the one that 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.300
 I'm sporting right now so so after 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.470
 for the complexed facial or those 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.770
 who do not agree with the bone 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.840
 cannes 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.520
 you can absolutely set everything up as 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.160
 you see it right now as well of 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.720
 face only profiles and little tips 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.010
 which shows you how much the scan and 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.600
 performances and you see my player 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.340
 came out directly with a beard 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.230
 all because I made the scalp 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.970
 being in fashionable bearded manners of one 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.010
 even sees the little mole there 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.420
 on my left cheek there are and b sc 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.470
 really well done in small board if 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.959
 and then you want to add a 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.750
 beard or mustache does the scan by being 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.030
 well shaved closely with soft skin 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.739
 like a baby qi and once you 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.090
 are satisfied with your facial part 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.040
 you go into the civil status you 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.420
 change the name the first name until then nothing 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.709
 again but that's important you 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.540
 change the skin color story that 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.310
 the scan marries better with the color 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.810
 of the body and even you can go over 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.760
 far away you can look squarely 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.230
 a cagol that has been too much down or if 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.250
 you are black you can be white or 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.040
 if you are white you can be 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.750
 black and frankly it's funny and 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.810
 so here is the definitive version of my 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.069
 first ever fesman on nba touquet 15 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.450
 so I think I could 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.430
 work and then especially I think he 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.959
 there is also a way to do even more 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.459
 funny because if we do this scan by doing 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.660
 already a grimace I do not know at all 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.519
 that it gives but it can be really 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.590
 fun anyway we will leave 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.209
 with the ma mode intro scene 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.010
 career so it's a little spoil 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.660
 so if you do not want to watch do you 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.340
 not force anyway I can tell you 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.560
 there will be no gameplay is 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.180
 just the intro scene that launches the mode 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.329
 my career and the aria yet there is the 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.329
 novelty 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.220
 and here is the first scene of the ma mode 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.020
 career on nba touquet 15 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.550
 and there we see that my agent enter 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.290
 my apartment and that I'm not 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.450
 not very very happy because I come 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.920
 to learn that I was neither selected 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.660
 in the first round nor selected at 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.940
 second round of play-offs so that's it 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.620
 change there is no longer the rookie shocked he 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.910
 is no longer this presentation match 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.920
 shops you can get a good 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.690
 note in order to be even better placed in 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.520
 the draft there it will have to change a 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.230
 little bit his habits he'll have to 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.820
 complete a 10-day contract with 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.890
 arc unikix is a team that had 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.850
 asked to give it a try for them on 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.310
 ten days it will be necessary to try 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.810
 to tear off his place with a little game 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.669
 first of training and then if 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.650
 you're caught you're going to play a few 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.450
 minutes every time on matches on 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.100
 a period so that the pretty tee of ten 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.780
 days and there really have to be good 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.780
 play from the start it'll be a little 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.910
 uncomplicated I made this first match 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.020
 I 'm pretty good at it so the 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.880
 bÃ©gard in ratings rather wins 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.860
 friendly I do not know at all if that 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.390
 is going to be definitive this mode of notation 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.870
 but in any case I'm pretty good 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:29.340
 unraveled and sincerely I think we 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.650
 will still have fun during a whole 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.210
 year on it go the coquinous and 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.430
 coaching basketball fans I hope 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.720
 that this video will be safer 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.130
 case I am really looking forward to 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.229
 rest my hands on a new 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.640
 version of nba touquet 15 I make you 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.110
 poutou poutou the coquinous and that 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.270
 keane is a basketball fan it was jordan 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.630
 scramble I do not care ayew fine 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.630
 belt
