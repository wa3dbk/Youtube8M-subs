00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.770
 and everyone has calls with everyone 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.839
 us and well I'm here this time for 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.180
 give you a little advice that I put in 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:11.799
 practice in your time and the truth that I 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.740
 it was pretty good and it's like increasing the 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.150
 fps the league of legends first 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.400
 we have to know is the kind of 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.900
 computer that I have in my case 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.050
 when I did this was because I had a 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.050
 notebook with integrated graphics card 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.850
 what is known as a chipset that are 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.949
 really bad are not to be played not 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.529
 are for our office not in all 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.880
 that kind of thing and it's not developed 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.030
 to play for which when I put the 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.160
 I say player because I was going to about 15 10 15 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.860
 fps is approximately what it is 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.810
 almost impossible to play as I fix it 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.160
 or I tried to improve after reading 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.260
 thousands of stories online in 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.989
 youtube and so on I did not see any way 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.579
 reliable that I was uploading the fps is so 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.149
 good with a little knowledge and 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.710
 tests and so I got to improve them 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.010
 enough what you can go to almost play 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.899
 with correctly 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.820
 the first thing is what to do if we have a 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.700
 computer is to distinguish what kind of love 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.200
 we have and we have 10 to 20 fps of 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.320
 half or so we have a computer 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:16.259
 pulling for bad if we have instead 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:19.110
 about 30 to 40 to 50 or 60 fps we have 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.690
 a more or less good average dor and 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.030
 We have more than 100 I know of 80 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.250
 doing 200 then we have a downpipe 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.530
 good that throws that throw it without any 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.030
 kind of problems the human eye is 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.039
 made for 30 fps is so if 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.289
 we get even if they are 30 fps is the 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:37.289
 truth is that having more is more than 30 fps 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.409
 they never go wrong but we do not really see it 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.520
 we do not appreciate with our human eyes 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.080
 so good is what we're going to leave 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.330
 of chatter and let's start the topic no 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.390
 what we have to do is if we have 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.850
 the graphics uploaded down to the minimum 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.560
 that is to say put everything very low since 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.470
 our theme then it does not work if 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.850
 we have 10 to 20 fps all very low 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.229
 we remove the shadows that really 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.420
 They seem important but the truth is that 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.490
 the shadows suck a lot and they do not work 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.000
 for nothing the truth without shadow and you 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.350
 we give ok 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.150
 once we do this we are going to 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.649
 get some fps but do not believe 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.810
 that doing this because this is going to be 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.790
 as if we had another new pc the 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.780
 truth is that this is not achieved 23 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.060
 fps if you hurry me a lot 5 with which 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.310
 Well, we are not going to see a big difference 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.410
 but what happens we can 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.380
 still touch different things and it arrives 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.590
 the key parameter there is an option that 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.690
 call 5 vertical organization which yes 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.040
 see online on youtube so you 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.410
 always recommend that you go active 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.570
 always deactivates synchronization 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.610
 vertical I do not I 'm not going to tell you that 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.200
 you feel that disabling it is because 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.239
 under my experience if you inform very 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:49.239
 bad that is 10 10 fps 21 22 23 te 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.660
 I recommend that you activate it because you're going to 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.280
 get if not if it's like my pc and it's 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.400
 as in all those that we tried we are going to 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.780
 get more more fps is why it is 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.880
 really good here we're going to see that 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.070
 I'm recording and I got fps almost to 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.010
 half I have about 35 was activated the 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:09.340
 synchronization is 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.140
 will persist you see that I just activated not 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.599
 I've cut the video for nothing but 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.180
 it's been a streaming failure and look 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:18.790
 I'm recording and I have 100 fps is it has me 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.930
 past 30 and peak at 100 fps 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.790
 what happens is that they are a little more 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.650
 unstable but the truth is that 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.870
 increasing this by activating the 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.510
 synchronization that is increasing the 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.090
 fps celtic legends and then finally if 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.310
 we want it to go this at 30 fps 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.599
 is what we can do is where we see 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.390
 frame rate we give to 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:40.239
 stable going to go the graph pulling without 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.890
 get too much later we can 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:43.900
 stabilize it to sps so it does not stick 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.030
 jerks we can put you in 30 fps if 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.799
 we have in the interval rice and then if 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.349
 we want this to kill we give 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.540
 reference and this will make the 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.970
 graphic good that does not suffer but that 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.620
 go to maximum performance let's 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.470
 activate here to death 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.379
 and here we can see that we have a 99 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.459
 now if we had a fish it's good or 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.530
 more or less good what we have to 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.140
 to do is deactivate the synchronization and 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.459
 that to begin with is good means this 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.260
 it is not necessary to activate it, because if 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.990
 we reference by is almost 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.300
 cutting the fps is 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.670
 and here you can see that I have deactivated in 

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:22.340
 vertical synchronization but not 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.380
 I come back I do not return at 30 fps 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.020
 principle but as I put it in 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.400
 reference as I get 100 now if it's 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.790
 I would propose stable as it came by 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.470
 defect you will see that it goes from 60 to 30 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.640
 fps 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.940
 until it stabilizes this a bit 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.710
 much and recover 30 fps from 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.930
 principle when they are put on when 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.400
 Adjust 1000 changes so already 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.230
 you know if you have a pretty bad PC or 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.380
 activated vertical synchronization 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.630
 because you 're going to notice it a lot and if 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.400
 you want to squeeze your graphics card 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.590
 put the ones of the cities frames 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.120
 in reference and you will see that the 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.730
 performance, it shows, it shows 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.950
 pretty and 15 fps is like that you're going to 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.750
 can even get about 30 fps is 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.220
 able to give and since the game starts to 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.490
 pull here you can see that they are starting to 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.320
 download 40 30 fps is that it's like how 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.720
 So far we have started the beginning 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.250
 of the video so you know that if you 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.530
 you can already give it to me I like the 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.480
 video shared with ye if 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.770
 he also wants to do it and subscribe that 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.569
 song you have done so this is 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.899
 a greeting 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:22.899
 see you later
