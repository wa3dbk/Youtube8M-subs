00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.149
 Ok, I'll try that now 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.160
 Hello and welcome to here 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:31.220
 me with me on a new troop server 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.320
 we now also offer an alien skies 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.510
 server 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.670
 that is in the video 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.320
 launcher and is quite easy too 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.080
 install and we now offer the 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.059
 said here also a server of this kind 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.220
 on 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:50.210
 and yes, it's been going on for two now 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.850
 days and we already see that the 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.239
 people here build a lot so the whole 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.960
 Runs approximately as you start there 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.899
 in front and picks an island as 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.509
 a flying island and can 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.250
 Accordingly, then start here 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.750
 to build 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.420
 and there are certain techniques how to 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:15.740
 So resources comes normal mine 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.710
 There is no such thing in the sense of being here 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.240
 Now I think I'm bucking 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.289
 I'm not sure what just look 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.899
 Definitely looks like I'm watching 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:32.060
 by whom it is so the whole is 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:35.020
 survival here so here will not 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.270
 divorced etc but here everyone can 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.910
 build normally 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:46.849
 the server is currently only for 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.649
 members that means that if you are not 

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:51.800
 rookies are more then you are allowed here 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.819
 play along and the whole thing was from now 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.410
 doc exactly 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:02:00.110
 and here is the box 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:03.380
 nothing is occupied here so that 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:07.340
 whole looks like this when you are here 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.420
 dying would be practical 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.640
 dead and would be banned by the server 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.459
 That's why we do it all here 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.000
 round based that is to one 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.970
 At some point in time we decide 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.250
 whether the map is reset and then 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.270
 so to speak, everyone who died 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.080
 start again 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.989
 here is now straight cent or yet 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.300
 already built a lot has here the 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.010
 actually quite funny to see who then 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.450
 survived the longest and who then what 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.050
 has managed 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.370
 and the map so I would be true now 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.110
 if we then 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.410
 this would also always be available 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.239
 provide that each time the whole 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.730
 we can probably look at it 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.510
 then in extra server where you then through 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.769
 the whole apps can go through yes now 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.410
 Let's have a look again 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.800
 Here is going on 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.930
 my music is scratching loud 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.640
 already somebody needed 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.010
 This time it looks like that 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.870
 still normal 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.090
 we play here in version 2 1 2212 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.180
 That should be 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.170
 It's been around since 214, but only since 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.489
 yesterday 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.940
 That's why we do not have it now 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.290
 updated i find play principle 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.810
 actually very funny so if you 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.180
 you also have to play along 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.049
 you just on the homepage 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.019
 apply and then you will 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.900
 Approved accordingly 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:45.609
 and then we'll see and you'll see 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.609
 then it come on the server 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.639
 he has not built so much yet 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.639
 or cloudy 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:01.830
 and yes , just started as I said 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:06.269
 since two days since not so much me 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:09.209
 believe that was so as said people 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.780
 if you're upset there's always something here 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.319
 Come on 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.420
 We also do mum again like that 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.139
 newer projects like this one here now 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.299
 not so well known and also watches 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.889
 block over he always makes many let's 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.050
 play it gives me on the channel the 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.440
 left or down in the video 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:32.630
 description and we see and that 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.630
 next time so talk show
