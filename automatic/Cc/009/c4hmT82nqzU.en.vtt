00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:08.519
 this is a reflex of the company 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.910
 zeiss ikon with the name konter flex the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:15.120
 camera is expected from the years 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:19.520
 1965 and now I want to show how to 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:24.240
 with this camera a film inserts 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:30.570
 this will be needed once the trigger 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:33.270
 the transport trigger transport on the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.690
 left side the so-called back play 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.910
 lever on which he recognizes and works 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.110
 then in small pointer small 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:50.329
 Metal pin out on the bottom 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.329
 I open the two 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.950
 knobs that I open each one 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.300
 turn outward when I did that 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.880
 I can easily do the back wall 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.660
 pull down 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:08.880
 this is the film that i put on the 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.920
 empty page 1 1 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.700
 then you have to wobble a bit 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:19.460
 then you can pull out the lax and 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:22.770
 I have a long narrow one up here 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.810
 black slot there I just stick 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.869
 the film-something purely 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.740
 please do not turn it too far because 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.440
 then he gets tangled up now dissolves 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.680
 out transport 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.130
 but only until the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.430
 Cogs right and left with the 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.300
 deflation are identical then slide 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.530
 I just go away again soon 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:56.590
 close my where I both size after 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.049
 go and fold them 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.390
 transport the sluice back to the 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:05.979
 end triggered once trigger twice 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.810
 and now you can already see on the left 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.970
 side the lever turns with and 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.510
 I know that I did everything right 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.950
 I'm not clear now 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:21.190
 I bring the black edge on the 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.760
 Pictures I have inserted as 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.720
 in the case a 36 he films and with 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:33.730
 Every now and then he runs down to the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.920
 Of course 1 is also important which film 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.220
 sensitivities I insert 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.989
 This is a bit tricky because I have here 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.860
 to the small lock lever 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.950
 I have to press it and at the same time 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:54.250
 here the fluted crown turn in the 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:57.120
 fall on 400 haase notice what 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.120
 skillful hands 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.230
 Now we have done it anyway 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.960
 everything is set now 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:12.460
 I can trigger you free 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:16.780
 take pictures when my movie too 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:20.610
 the end is then I have to get out again 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:24.810
 I'll open that down here 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:28.120
 back game that is going fold 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:32.920
 only with a small edge turn that he 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.560
 exactly in the position is now believed 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.670
 I was up here stifter it and 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.690
 turn in the indicated direction 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.640
 as long as it is easy 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:50.650
 you notice a jerk it is all right 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:54.120
 easy i can turn the whole outside 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.890
 turn the other side outwards as well 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.870
 where the reserve down and my screen 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.370
 is properly rewound correctly 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.430
 I wish all lovers one 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:10.209
 counter flex no matter if this is a 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:13.900
 camera from the first series is or 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.860
 but also the later pc much fun with
