00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
at the Performing Arts course you do a

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.599 
at the Performing Arts course you do a
lot<00:00:12.860> of<00:00:12.890> theory<00:00:13.730> and<00:00:14.000> practical<00:00:14.930> base<00:00:15.609> and

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
lot of theory and practical base and

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.980 
lot of theory and practical base and
that<00:00:17.000> goes<00:00:17.210> into<00:00:17.449> the<00:00:17.750> second<00:00:18.650> and<00:00:18.800> third<00:00:19.010> year

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
that goes into the second and third year

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.939 
that goes into the second and third year
you<00:00:20.990> always<00:00:21.140> seem<00:00:21.349> to<00:00:21.439> do<00:00:21.529> a<00:00:21.560> little<00:00:21.710> bit<00:00:21.919> more

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
you always seem to do a little bit more

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.769 
you always seem to do a little bit more
theory<00:00:22.550> and<00:00:23.089> then<00:00:23.239> a<00:00:23.269> little<00:00:23.480> bit<00:00:23.630> more

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
theory and then a little bit more

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.450 
theory and then a little bit more
practical<00:00:24.169> and<00:00:24.499> then<00:00:24.619> by<00:00:24.829> the<00:00:24.890> end<00:00:25.009> of<00:00:25.279> each

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
practical and then by the end of each

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.329 
practical and then by the end of each
year<00:00:25.789> you<00:00:26.060> will<00:00:26.269> do<00:00:27.009> practical<00:00:28.009> there's

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:28.339 
year you will do practical there's

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.450 
year you will do practical there's
always<00:00:28.489> like<00:00:28.759> a<00:00:28.939> big<00:00:29.329> performance<00:00:29.509> at<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:30.199> end

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
always like a big performance at the end

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:39.509 
always like a big performance at the end
which<00:00:31.460> is<00:00:31.609> always<00:00:31.759> fun<00:00:32.090> to<00:00:32.270> finish<00:00:32.540> off<00:00:32.720> with<00:00:32.750> I

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:41.770 

tend<00:00:40.519> to<00:00:40.609> find<00:00:40.730> that<00:00:40.789> most<00:00:40.969> of<00:00:41.179> modules<00:00:41.510> tend

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
tend to find that most of modules tend

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.290 
tend to find that most of modules tend
to<00:00:42.019> kind<00:00:42.440> of<00:00:42.530> until<00:00:43.250> inker<00:00:43.579> each<00:00:43.699> other<00:00:43.940> so

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
to kind of until inker each other so

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.750 
to kind of until inker each other so
you'll<00:00:44.510> be<00:00:45.410> doing<00:00:45.679> about<00:00:45.739> practitioner<00:00:46.550> which

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
you'll be doing about practitioner which

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.299 
you'll be doing about practitioner which
becomes<00:00:47.420> useful<00:00:47.750> in<00:00:48.140> your<00:00:48.559> other<00:00:48.710> modules<00:00:49.160> as

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
becomes useful in your other modules as

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.770 
becomes useful in your other modules as
well

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780

need to read a certain book they let you

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.190 
need to read a certain book they let you
always<00:01:10.340> make<00:01:10.550> sure<00:01:10.580> that<00:01:11.120> it's<00:01:11.660> in<00:01:11.990> the

dance studio which is absolutely
fantastic<00:01:26.630> mirrors<00:01:27.470> all<00:01:27.680> the<00:01:27.800> way<00:01:27.890> across<00:01:28.130> it

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
fantastic mirrors all the way across it

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.360 
fantastic mirrors all the way across it
it's<00:01:28.880> really<00:01:29.180> good<00:01:29.300> for<00:01:29.600> new<00:01:29.780> dance<00:01:30.250> we<00:01:31.250> also

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
it's really good for new dance we also

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
it's really good for new dance we also
have<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.670> theatre<00:01:32.030> which<00:01:32.330> is<00:01:32.540> a<00:01:34.090> bonus<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:35.240> the

performance<00:02:06.200> which<00:02:06.410> has<00:02:06.740> been<00:02:07.010> probably<00:02:07.910> one

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
performance which has been probably one

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.779 
performance which has been probably one
of<00:02:08.119> my<00:02:08.269> most<00:02:08.660> favorite<00:02:09.640> performances<00:02:10.640> that

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
of my most favorite performances that

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.660 
of my most favorite performances that
we've<00:02:10.970> ever<00:02:11.150> done<00:02:11.360> was<00:02:12.140> actually<00:02:12.440> last<00:02:13.250> term

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
we've ever done was actually last term

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.610 
we've ever done was actually last term
for<00:02:13.940> our<00:02:14.060> third-year<00:02:14.330> piece<00:02:14.750> we<00:02:14.960> did

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
for our third-year piece we did

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.190 
for our third-year piece we did
a<00:02:16.650> piece<00:02:17.340> based<00:02:17.579> on<00:02:17.849> Pina<00:02:18.209> Bausch<00:02:18.390> which
