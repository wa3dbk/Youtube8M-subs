00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
reproduce so they're all considered one

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:17.030 
reproduce so they're all considered one
species<00:02:14.279> but<00:02:15.180> there's<00:02:15.419> just<00:02:15.659> slight

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
species but there's just slight

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.339

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
genetic variation for instance let me

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.710 
genetic variation for instance let me
give<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.590> an<00:02:19.709> example<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.790> eastern<00:02:21.209> Cougars

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
give you an example the eastern Cougars

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
weigh about 120 to 150 pounds okay their

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.479 
weigh about 120 to 150 pounds okay their
main<00:02:28.230> prey<00:02:28.620> item<00:02:29.069> is<00:02:29.159> going<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.430> be

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
main prey item is going to be

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.920 
main prey item is going to be
white-tailed<00:02:30.030> deer<00:02:30.650> okay<00:02:32.150> it's<00:02:33.150> pretty<00:02:33.660> big

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
white-tailed deer okay it's pretty big

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.000 
white-tailed deer okay it's pretty big
but<00:02:34.519> the<00:02:35.519> mountain<00:02:35.879> lions<00:02:36.470> they<00:02:37.470> weigh<00:02:37.709> in

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
but the mountain lions they weigh in

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.089 
but the mountain lions they weigh in
around<00:02:38.420> 150<00:02:39.420> 200<00:02:39.840> pounds<00:02:40.230> they're<00:02:40.860> bigger

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
around 150 200 pounds they're bigger

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.729 
around 150 200 pounds they're bigger
because<00:02:42.090> their<00:02:42.480> prey<00:02:42.690> size<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.200> bigger<00:02:43.440> you

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
because their prey size is bigger you

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.140 
because their prey size is bigger you
know<00:02:44.549> they're<00:02:44.760> they're<00:02:45.500> they're<00:02:46.500> preying<00:02:46.829> on

moose elk caribou that kind of thing

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.589 
moose elk caribou that kind of thing
which<00:02:52.319> are<00:02:52.500> much<00:02:52.829> bigger<00:02:53.190> much<00:02:53.970> larger<00:02:54.420> than<00:02:54.569> a

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
which are much bigger much larger than a

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.869 
which are much bigger much larger than a
white-tailed<00:02:55.049> deer<00:02:55.290> so<00:02:55.890> they<00:02:56.280> have<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.670> be

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
white-tailed deer so they have to be

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.569 
white-tailed deer so they have to be
bigger<00:02:57.209> in<00:02:57.709> order<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.859> take<00:02:59.129> one<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.459> those

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
bigger in order to take one of those

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.270 
bigger in order to take one of those
bigger<00:03:00.120> animals<00:03:00.660> down<00:03:00.930> makes<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.680> right<00:03:01.829> so

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
bigger animals down makes it right so

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.970 
bigger animals down makes it right so
there<00:03:02.910> there's<00:03:03.299> a<00:03:03.390> slight<00:03:03.870> genetic<00:03:04.379> variation

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
there there's a slight genetic variation

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.390 
there there's a slight genetic variation
in<00:03:05.160> their<00:03:05.370> size<00:03:05.640> okay<00:03:06.450> okay<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.890> same<00:03:08.160> and
