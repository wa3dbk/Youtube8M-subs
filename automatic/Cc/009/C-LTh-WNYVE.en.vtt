 and is in Bahrain manama and recorded subjects that 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.420
 they already live in the region and there it is only beauty 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.519
 I'm back with another video I hope 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.130
 immensely you like this video 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.510
 This gameplay has no better game today 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.029
 It's just a video because it's the second 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.310
 episode of this small series that we 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.250
 we started here on the canal with the arrival of 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.199
 goals called essential tips for 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.779
 Beauty codes in the first episode I 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.189
 I spoke of the mini map the radar 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.540
 for those who do not know but it's that 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.550
 radar that is on the left side 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.410
 top of the screen 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.300
 I talked about that is possible 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.340
 identify if your opponent is in the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.420
 Upstairs downstairs on the floor 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.120
 that you find yourself 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.460
 a lot of people there and it confusing 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.770
 has remained unnoticed and omni map 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.420
 Show us if the opponent is in the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.469
 Upstairs downstairs on the floor 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.360
 that you find yourself 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.920
 I said that in the first video I will 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.140
 leave the link in the description if you do not 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.609
 saw the beauty in this 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.149
 Here I want to talk about this episode. 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.670
 of the predator in the so - called rocket code 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.670
 trinity in Portuguese nor rocket 30 and 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:14.520
 This reduces this rocket was introduced 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:17.430
 in mw2 lopes did not have there returned in w3 and 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.670
 remained in black ops 2 with 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.130
 some differences are mw3 mw2 it 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.520
 was to be a missile just to get you right. 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.310
 a one point map on black ops 2 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.450
 he was a missile that defragments 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.670
 vanelli 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.759
 He is part of it, I'm going to put 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.060
 spread on several levels for you 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.670
 hit that region of the map and goal 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.280
 I did now it's three missiles 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.649
 you active first you hit the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.470
 second and you active have been this is well 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.840
 cool the first and second you point 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.850
 in the direction you want to hit but not 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.710
 It is how you control the speed 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.869
 slow down you have to 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.969
 twist to hit and the third is 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.549
 possible to be active first as 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.469
 fast and the third you control it if 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.420
 it will go faster if he will flee 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.700
 slower it became very interesting is 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.500
 possible to hit three locations on the map 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.500
 same time I'll leave some examples 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.960
 Here for you, for example. 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.990
 is that I accepted both opponents and the 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.000
 the opponent's helicopter at the same time is 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.620
 with the same beginning with the good of the hour 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.170
 I'm pretty cool, I really liked the 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.030
 Product or rocket dynamics 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.840
 trinity in there goals 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:32.300
 I hope I have helped you activate oo 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.300
 the rocket or the first capsule you have 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.840
 that tighten the attractive rt the second you 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.450
 turn and press again and 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.970
 the third again semira in the direction 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.370
 squeeze rt and accelerate it if it goes more 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.800
 slow and steady wins weaker last hope 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.140
 to have helped you hope to be able to 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.180
 make your gameplay better 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.860
 a bit then I'm talking with cei 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.360
 many who are starting now but 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.850
 also with those who are already there 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.890
