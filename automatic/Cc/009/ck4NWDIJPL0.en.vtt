00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
win the losers match and then you still

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
have lost two games and then if you

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.260 
have lost two games and then if you
might<00:01:49.560> win<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.009> final<00:01:50.460> match<00:01:50.610> then<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.030> still

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
might win the final match then you still

and some with 12 and then someone with
02<00:02:00.960> those<00:02:01.799> are<00:02:02.009> what<00:02:02.399> ends<00:02:02.610> up<00:02:02.670> happening<00:02:02.729> in

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
02 those are what ends up happening in

02 those are what ends up happening in
the<00:02:03.509> tournament<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.140> then<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:05.040> get<00:02:05.189> seeded

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
the tournament and then you get seeded

depending<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.329> if<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:07.110> advance

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
depending on if you advance

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.469 
depending on if you advance
then<00:02:09.069> you<00:02:09.280> get<00:02:09.490> seated<00:02:09.759> depending<00:02:10.179> on<00:02:10.300> what

then you get seated depending on what

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.130 
then you get seated depending on what
your<00:02:10.599> score<00:02:10.780> was<00:02:11.020> so<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.830> 20<00:02:12.790> players<00:02:13.360> are

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
your score was so the 20 players are

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.370 
your score was so the 20 players are
considered<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:15.130> be<00:02:15.250> the<00:02:15.660> cops<00:02:16.660> upper<00:02:17.230> echelon

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
considered to be the cops upper echelon

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.470 
considered to be the cops upper echelon
and<00:02:17.860> then<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.040> 21<00:02:18.459> players<00:02:18.790> are<00:02:19.090> seated

assume that he hasn't been playing that
well<00:03:19.390> in<00:03:19.600> practice<00:03:19.840> maybe<00:03:20.260> that's<00:03:20.590> why<00:03:20.709> they

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
well in practice maybe that's why they

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.770 
well in practice maybe that's why they

like<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.299> next<00:04:07.540> week<00:04:07.720> so<00:04:08.319> I<00:04:08.350> don't<00:04:08.680> know<00:04:08.739> if

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
like the next week so I don't know if

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.370 
like the next week so I don't know if
that's<00:04:09.010> true<00:04:09.100> or<00:04:09.280> not<00:04:09.400> but<00:04:09.519> um<00:04:10.200> supposedly<00:04:11.200> got

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
that's true or not but um supposedly got

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.259 
that's true or not but um supposedly got
put<00:04:11.620> on<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.769> B<00:04:11.889> team<00:04:11.920> regardless<00:04:12.579> they<00:04:13.060> have

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
put on the B team regardless they have

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.729 
put on the B team regardless they have
not<00:04:13.510> been<00:04:13.660> putting<00:04:13.930> min<00:04:14.079> and<00:04:14.230> pro<00:04:14.380> league<00:04:14.560> very

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
not been putting min and pro league very

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.659 
not been putting min and pro league very
much<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:16.090> he<00:04:16.359> has<00:04:16.720> obviously<00:04:16.870> not<00:04:17.200> been<00:04:17.380> doing

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
much so he has obviously not been doing

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.209 
much so he has obviously not been doing
spectacularly

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:20.219 
spectacularly

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:22.770 
spectacularly
and<00:04:21.219> just<00:04:21.579> regardless<00:04:22.090> of<00:04:22.210> that<00:04:22.240> he<00:04:22.479> has<00:04:22.599> been

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
and just regardless of that he has been

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.879 
and just regardless of that he has been
really<00:04:22.990> accomplished<00:04:23.409> in<00:04:23.560> any<00:04:23.710> of<00:04:23.770> the

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
really accomplished in any of the

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.020 
really accomplished in any of the
individual<00:04:24.340> dates<00:04:24.550> or<00:04:24.669> anything<00:04:24.699> like<00:04:24.909> that

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
individual dates or anything like that

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.119 
individual dates or anything like that
he<00:04:25.330> used<00:04:25.449> to<00:04:25.509> be<00:04:25.599> pretty<00:04:25.750> decent<00:04:26.139> player<00:04:26.319> facts

00:04:27.119 --> 00:04:27.129 
he used to be pretty decent player facts

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:28.980 
he used to be pretty decent player facts
EG<00:04:27.219> even<00:04:27.550> through<00:04:27.759> min<00:04:27.909> as<00:04:28.060> there<00:04:28.210> a<00:04:28.240> chase<00:04:28.930> a

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
EG even through min as there a chase a

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.290 
EG even through min as there a chase a
couple<00:04:29.500> times<00:04:29.650> i<00:04:30.009> think<00:04:30.490> early<00:04:30.699> last<00:04:31.030> season

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
couple times i think early last season

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.670 
couple times i think early last season
um<00:04:32.759> but<00:04:33.759> he<00:04:34.030> just<00:04:34.270> you<00:04:34.750> know<00:04:34.780> hasn't<00:04:35.469> really

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
um but he just you know hasn't really

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.309 
um but he just you know hasn't really
been<00:04:35.800> doing<00:04:35.860> that<00:04:36.219> well<00:04:36.460> lately<00:04:36.669> so<00:04:37.150> I<00:04:37.599> think

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319 
been doing that well lately so I think

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.570 
been doing that well lately so I think

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
hard to say i don't think so though i

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:21.460 
little bit smaller radius there it's

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.640 
little bit smaller radius there it's
really<00:05:21.909> tough<00:05:22.090> to<00:05:22.120> say<00:05:22.389> though<00:05:22.539> in<00:05:22.960> a<00:05:23.110> case<00:05:23.319> so

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
really tough to say though in a case so

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.170 
really tough to say though in a case so
