honestly<00:04:10.010> it'd<00:04:10.430> be<00:04:10.579> best<00:04:11.030> if<00:04:11.209> we<00:04:11.329> just<00:04:11.359> had<00:04:11.599> one

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
honestly it'd be best if we just had one

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.390 
honestly it'd be best if we just had one
gas<00:04:12.290> for<00:04:12.620> everything<00:04:12.980> you<00:04:13.099> know<00:04:13.220> I<00:04:13.250> know

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
gas for everything you know I know

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.890 
gas for everything you know I know
people<00:04:13.730> at<00:04:13.940> my<00:04:14.000> electric<00:04:14.329> power<00:04:14.510> but<00:04:14.750> that's

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
people at my electric power but that's

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.289 
people at my electric power but that's
not<00:04:15.049> going<00:04:15.260> to<00:04:15.349> be<00:04:15.379> there<00:04:15.650> for<00:04:15.709> a<00:04:15.890> while<00:04:16.209> so<00:04:17.209> I

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
not going to be there for a while so I

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.080 
not going to be there for a while so I
think<00:04:17.359> as<00:04:17.690> far<00:04:17.720> as<00:04:18.019> and<00:04:18.919> it's<00:04:19.669> probably<00:04:19.970> going

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
think as far as and it's probably going

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.159 
think as far as and it's probably going
to<00:04:20.150> be<00:04:20.209> very<00:04:20.449> hard<00:04:20.750> than<00:04:20.900> they<00:04:20.959> do<00:04:21.079> to

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
to be very hard than they do to

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.659 
to be very hard than they do to
completely<00:04:21.560> change<00:04:21.590> our<00:04:21.889> gas<00:04:22.130> was<00:04:22.430> for<00:04:22.610> the

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
completely change our gas was for the

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.070 
completely change our gas was for the
reason<00:04:22.880> that<00:04:22.910> so<00:04:23.150> many<00:04:23.180> older<00:04:23.570> cars<00:04:23.840> on<00:04:23.990> the

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
reason that so many older cars on the

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.760 
reason that so many older cars on the
road

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
road

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.080 
road
it's<00:04:26.770> going<00:04:26.979> to<00:04:27.009> be<00:04:27.099> hard<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.310> do<00:04:27.460> but<00:04:27.759> I<00:04:27.970> do

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
it's going to be hard to do but I do

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.790 
it's going to be hard to do but I do
think<00:04:28.360> we<00:04:28.479> should<00:04:28.509> stick<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:28.870> one<00:04:29.050> gas<00:04:29.289> or

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
think we should stick to one gas or

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.830 
think we should stick to one gas or
technically<00:04:30.220> would<00:04:30.280> be<00:04:30.460> a<00:04:30.490> lot<00:04:30.639> easier<00:04:30.840> every

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
technically would be a lot easier every

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.200 
technically would be a lot easier every
every<00:04:32.110> car<00:04:32.319> ran<00:04:32.530> on<00:04:32.680> 89<00:04:33.159> or<00:04:33.460> every<00:04:33.669> part<00:04:33.940> on

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
every car ran on 89 or every part on

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.399 
every car ran on 89 or every part on
i-87<00:04:34.720> or<00:04:35.259> 91<00:04:35.909> but<00:04:36.909> anyway<00:04:37.150> so<00:04:37.960> that's<00:04:38.080> a<00:04:38.229> three

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409 
i-87 or 91 but anyway so that's a three

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.080 
i-87 or 91 but anyway so that's a three
ways<00:04:38.590> you<00:04:38.740> haven't<00:04:38.919> sometimes<00:04:39.520> some<00:04:39.729> gases

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
ways you haven't sometimes some gases

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.580 
ways you haven't sometimes some gases
actually<00:04:40.389> carry<00:04:40.569> 91<00:04:41.020> and<00:04:41.199> then<00:04:41.319> like<00:04:41.440> when

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
actually carry 91 and then like when

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.399 
actually carry 91 and then like when
they<00:04:41.680> do<00:04:41.740> and<00:04:42.479> the<00:04:43.479> thing<00:04:43.750> that<00:04:43.810> way<00:04:44.080> dog<00:04:44.259> that

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:44.409 
they do and the thing that way dog that

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.670 
they do and the thing that way dog that
is<00:04:44.440> when<00:04:45.099> I'm<00:04:45.250> buying<00:04:45.490> premium<00:04:45.849> fuel<00:04:46.560> have<00:04:47.560> to

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
is when I'm buying premium fuel have to

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.990 
is when I'm buying premium fuel have to
find<00:04:47.860> anything<00:04:48.220> because<00:04:48.430> there's<00:04:48.580> no<00:04:48.699> 91

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
find anything because there's no 91

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.219 
find anything because there's no 91
available<00:04:49.449> and<00:04:51.090> sometimes<00:04:52.090> that<00:04:52.449> you<00:04:52.930> can<00:04:53.080> use

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
available and sometimes that you can use

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:54.570 
available and sometimes that you can use
the<00:04:53.409> 89<00:04:53.770> in<00:04:53.949> mixed<00:04:54.129> with<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.280> night<00:04:54.460> before

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
the 89 in mixed with the night before

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.189 
the 89 in mixed with the night before
together<00:04:54.909> than<00:04:55.030> anyone<00:04:55.330> but<00:04:55.539> usually<00:04:55.990> it's

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 
together than anyone but usually it's

00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:58.589 
together than anyone but usually it's
just<00:04:56.560> complicated<00:04:57.030> mix<00:04:58.030> of<00:04:58.180> people<00:04:58.270> all<00:04:58.539> the

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
just complicated mix of people all the

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.270 
just complicated mix of people all the
time<00:04:58.629> so<00:04:58.960> I'm<00:04:59.020> just<00:04:59.199> you<00:04:59.259> know<00:04:59.289> when<00:05:00.009> I<00:05:00.129> need

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
time so I'm just you know when I need

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.300 
time so I'm just you know when I need
for<00:05:00.460> and<00:05:01.379> because<00:05:02.379> of<00:05:02.409> that<00:05:02.530> as<00:05:02.710> a<00:05:02.770> result<00:05:02.919> on

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
for and because of that as a result on

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.469 
for and because of that as a result on
actually<00:05:03.610> paying<00:05:04.229> extra<00:05:05.229> for<00:05:06.120> no<00:05:07.120> gain

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
actually paying extra for no gain

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.600 
actually paying extra for no gain
because<00:05:07.900> if<00:05:08.050> my<00:05:08.199> car<00:05:08.440> doesn't<00:05:08.590> need<00:05:08.800> 93<00:05:09.370> it's

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
because if my car doesn't need 93 it's

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.510 
because if my car doesn't need 93 it's
91<00:05:10.080> but<00:05:11.080> I'm<00:05:11.199> paying<00:05:11.440> for<00:05:11.560> 93<00:05:12.069> now<00:05:12.190> it's<00:05:12.340> only

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
91 but I'm paying for 93 now it's only

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.490 
91 but I'm paying for 93 now it's only
given<00:05:13.090> probably<00:05:13.659> one<00:05:13.750> two<00:05:14.020> three<00:05:14.289> cents

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
given probably one two three cents

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.360 
given probably one two three cents
difference<00:05:14.919> so<00:05:15.370> it's<00:05:15.550> not<00:05:15.729> big<00:05:16.060> but<00:05:16.990> it's<00:05:17.560> 23

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
difference so it's not big but it's 23

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.399 
difference so it's not big but it's 23
cents<00:05:18.849> don't<00:05:19.060> go

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:21.409 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:22.959 

even<00:05:22.009> they<00:05:22.099> start<00:05:22.279> to<00:05:22.339> inch<00:05:22.519> forward<00:05:22.639> right

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:22.969 
even they start to inch forward right

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:25.619 
even they start to inch forward right
before<00:05:23.330> and<00:05:23.449> you<00:05:23.719> think<00:05:23.959> they<00:05:24.409> go<00:05:24.559> for<00:05:24.739> but<00:05:25.429> um

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:25.629 
before and you think they go for but um

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:28.629 
before and you think they go for but um
there's<00:05:26.629> no<00:05:26.779> need<00:05:27.080> to<00:05:27.409> pay<00:05:27.649> that<00:05:27.919> extra<00:05:27.949> you

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
there's no need to pay that extra you

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.729 
there's no need to pay that extra you
know<00:05:28.669> sense<00:05:29.179> for<00:05:29.659> them<00:05:29.869> actually<00:05:30.589> after

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:30.739 
know sense for them actually after

00:05:30.739 --> 00:05:32.079 
know sense for them actually after
because<00:05:31.069> it<00:05:31.189> doesn't<00:05:31.429> enhance<00:05:31.789> my

00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:32.089 
because it doesn't enhance my

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:33.429 
because it doesn't enhance my
performance<00:05:32.119> anywhere<00:05:32.869> because<00:05:32.989> the<00:05:33.199> car<00:05:33.409> is

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:33.439 
performance anywhere because the car is

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:36.100 
performance anywhere because the car is
optimized<00:05:34.009> for<00:05:34.129> 91<00:05:34.669> kind<00:05:35.539> of<00:05:35.629> if<00:05:35.689> you<00:05:35.779> ran<00:05:36.019> out

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
optimized for 91 kind of if you ran out

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.269 
optimized for 91 kind of if you ran out
you<00:05:36.289> know<00:05:36.409> if<00:05:36.559> you<00:05:36.619> had<00:05:36.709> a<00:05:36.739> regular<00:05:36.889> carpet

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:37.279 
you know if you had a regular carpet

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:38.379 
you know if you had a regular carpet
premium<00:05:37.729> and<00:05:37.849> it<00:05:37.909> wouldn't<00:05:38.119> do<00:05:38.209> anything

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
premium and it wouldn't do anything

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.350 
premium and it wouldn't do anything
better<00:05:38.569> for<00:05:38.689> it<00:05:38.959> same<00:05:39.409> concept<00:05:39.679> here<00:05:40.069> so<00:05:41.059> I

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
better for it same concept here so I

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.070 
better for it same concept here so I
wonder<00:05:41.839> why<00:05:42.019> we<00:05:42.199> have<00:05:42.379> that<00:05:43.039> 93<00:05:43.509> so<00:05:44.509> anyway

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
wonder why we have that 93 so anyway

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.049 
wonder why we have that 93 so anyway
yeah<00:05:45.439> that's<00:05:45.589> what<00:05:45.709> I<00:05:45.739> most<00:05:45.830> about<00:05:46.039> the<00:05:46.249> you

00:05:47.049 --> 00:05:47.059 
yeah that's what I most about the you

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:48.489 
yeah that's what I most about the you
know<00:05:47.179> the<00:05:47.360> different<00:05:47.629> guests<00:05:47.869> we<00:05:48.019> have<00:05:48.169> is<00:05:48.349> why

00:05:48.489 --> 00:05:48.499 
know the different guests we have is why

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:49.989 
know the different guests we have is why
