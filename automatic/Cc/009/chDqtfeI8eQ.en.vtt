00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
videos that we're going to do are going

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.289 
videos that we're going to do are going

to be more about lighting placement what

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.330 
to be more about lighting placement what
do<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.509> mean<00:01:24.720> by<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.229> well<00:01:25.740> it'd<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.100> more

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
do I mean by that well it'd be more

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.390 
do I mean by that well it'd be more
about<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:27.150> after<00:01:27.500> getting<00:01:28.500> nice<00:01:28.799> effects

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
about going after getting nice effects

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.670 
about going after getting nice effects
dramatic<00:01:30.150> effects<00:01:30.540> it'll<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:30.990> be<00:01:31.140> using<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
dramatic effects it'll just be using the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.030 
dramatic effects it'll just be using the
rule<00:01:31.890> like<00:01:32.250> no<00:01:32.610> dimmers<00:01:33.119> no<00:01:33.360> diffusion<00:01:34.009> OCT<00:01:35.009> 0

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
rule like no dimmers no diffusion OCT 0

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.350 
rule like no dimmers no diffusion OCT 0
CT<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:36.360> no<00:01:36.630> scrim<00:01:37.170> no<00:01:37.799> spun<00:01:38.340> any<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.119> stuff

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
CT be no scrim no spun any of that stuff

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.719 
CT be no scrim no spun any of that stuff
it<00:01:39.689> would<00:01:39.810> just<00:01:39.900> be<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.170> straight<00:01:40.710> light<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:41.700> a

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
it would just be the straight light so a

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.760 
it would just be the straight light so a
lot<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.210> lighting<00:01:42.630> will<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:43.020> going<00:01:43.409> hard

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
lot of the lighting will be going hard

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.969 
lot of the lighting will be going hard
and<00:01:44.360> then<00:01:45.360> we'll<00:01:45.600> move<00:01:45.810> on<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.110> using<00:01:46.590> soft

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
and then we'll move on to using soft

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.420 
and then we'll move on to using soft
bounce<00:01:47.460> light<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:49.920> more<00:01:50.220> about

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
bounce light and so it's more about

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.399 
bounce light and so it's more about
strong<00:01:51.590> dramatic<00:01:52.640> shadowy<00:01:53.640> effects<00:01:54.329> but<00:01:55.140> how

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
strong dramatic shadowy effects but how

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.370 
strong dramatic shadowy effects but how
to<00:01:55.470> get<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.920> nice<00:01:56.250> look<00:01:56.820> doing<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.840> but

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
to get a nice look doing that but

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.490 
to get a nice look doing that but
obviously<00:01:59.210> you<00:02:00.210> know<00:02:00.390> some<00:02:00.780> people<00:02:01.259> are<00:02:01.320> going
