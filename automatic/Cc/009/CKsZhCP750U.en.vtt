 so do not forget to unfold it 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.260
 I'm going to start preparing the 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.070
 souffle 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.070
 adding in a pan 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.190
 the butter 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.110
 and I wait for it to melt completely 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.810
 with this what I will do will be a sauce 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.710
 white once the butter is 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.630
 completely melted 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.630
 I add the flour 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.659
 and mix 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.380
 it is important to let the flour 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.380
 cook well 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.890
 and I proceed to add cold milk to 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.890
 little bit 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.880
 when the preparation is right in this 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.770
 point is to say so light is ready 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.429
 to lower the stove 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.500
 once the pan of the fire is gone 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:04.890
 continued the preparation by adding the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.890
 corn 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.100
 Parmesan cheese 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.769
 mozzarella cheese 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:20.060
 after adding the mozzarella cheese 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.060
 I mix the ingredients a little 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.800
 I continue adding salt and 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:31.410
 pepper as you know these two 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.410
 You can add ingredients to taste 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.000
 and continued adding the two yolks of 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.000
 egg 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.200
 I'll take the egg whites to the point of 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.860
 snow to add at the end to this 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.860
 preparation 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.140
 as they realize the mixture is thick 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.320
 once I have the whites about to 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.790
 snow added them to the rest of the 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.790
 soufflé preparation 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:25.130
 and I mix again 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.130
 everything must be very well integrated 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:33.360
 this is the texture that should be left 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.360
 once I have this preparation ready 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.849
 I proceed to place 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.030

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:48.269
 or in a mold you can also do the 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.510
 soufflé individually and in fees 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.510
 individual 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:00.290
 I decided today to do it this way 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.440
 now I will proceed to put the soufflé in the 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.900

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.450
 preheated to 200 degrees 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.019
 this is roughly lasts in the 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:15.230
 oven about 15 or 20 minutes remember that 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.780

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.759

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.759
 Parmesan cheese on top 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.990
