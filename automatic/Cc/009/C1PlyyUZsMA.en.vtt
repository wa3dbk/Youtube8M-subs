legs which is going to show off some of
that<00:01:00.989> white<00:01:01.230> inner<00:01:01.500> frame<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.100> off<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
other side you're going to have this

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.420 
other side you're going to have this
part<00:01:04.080> here<00:01:04.260> which<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.589> going<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.830> attach<00:01:05.189> on

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
part here which is going to attach on

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.760 
part here which is going to attach on
pretty<00:01:06.000> cleanly<00:01:06.299> most<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.960> ugly<00:01:07.530> parts

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
pretty cleanly most of the ugly parts

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
pretty cleanly most of the ugly parts
that<00:01:07.920> are<00:01:08.010> going<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.280> hidden<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.670> back

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
that are going to be hidden in the back

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.060 
that are going to be hidden in the back
so<00:01:09.420> not<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.659> big<00:01:09.869> issue<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.710> white<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
so not a big issue the white on the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.350 
so not a big issue the white on the
inside<00:01:11.159> well<00:01:11.670> you're<00:01:11.820> not<00:01:11.939> really<00:01:12.090> going<00:01:12.270> to

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
inside well you're not really going to

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.789 
inside well you're not really going to
see<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.600> all<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.720> much<00:01:13.020> but<00:01:13.260> in<00:01:13.380> terms<00:01:13.590> of

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
see it all that much but in terms of

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.469 
see it all that much but in terms of
mobility<00:01:13.950> you'll<00:01:14.640> see<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> ankles<00:01:15.330> can

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
mobility you'll see that the ankles can

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.969 
mobility you'll see that the ankles can
move<00:01:15.600> off<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.960> way<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.439> they're<00:01:16.799> just

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
move off this way and that they're just

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.109 
move off this way and that they're just
on<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.100> poly<00:01:17.340> cap<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:17.729> going<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.970> rotate

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
on a poly cap that's going to rotate

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.270 
on a poly cap that's going to rotate
around<00:01:18.390> there<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.530> cannot<00:01:19.920> bend<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
around there and you cannot bend the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.740 
around there and you cannot bend the
toes<00:01:20.460> these<00:01:20.700> are<00:01:20.820> going<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.970> be<00:01:21.030> solid<00:01:21.330> all<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
toes these are going to be solid all the

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.749 
toes these are going to be solid all the
way<00:01:22.229> across<00:01:22.439> you've<00:01:23.280> got<00:01:23.460> some<00:01:23.610> lighting

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
way across you've got some lighting

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.039 
way across you've got some lighting
possibilities<00:01:24.390> there<00:01:24.570> which<00:01:24.720> I've<00:01:24.869> ignored

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
possibilities there which I've ignored

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.929 
possibilities there which I've ignored
for<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.680> knees<00:01:25.890> but<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.729> take<00:01:26.880> that

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
for the knees but you can take that

for the knees but you can take that
you'll<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.540> some<00:01:27.750> white<00:01:27.900> inner<00:01:28.110> frame<00:01:28.290> when

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
you'll see some white inner frame when

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.780 
you'll see some white inner frame when
you<00:01:28.530> bend<00:01:28.710> this<00:01:28.829> which<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> look<00:01:29.520> not

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
you bend this which is going to look not

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.870 
you bend this which is going to look not
too<00:01:30.240> great<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.900> suppose<00:01:31.380> but<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.340> armor<00:01:32.759> off

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
too great I suppose but this armor off

too great I suppose but this armor off
on<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.180> side<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.509> going<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> nice

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
on the side is going to be a nice

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.539 
on the side is going to be a nice
complement<00:01:34.500> I'd<00:01:34.590> say<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.829> these<00:01:35.040> shark<00:01:35.310> fins

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
complement I'd say to these shark fins

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.670 
complement I'd say to these shark fins
off<00:01:35.850> on<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> side<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:37.020> green<00:01:37.229> piping

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.170 
off on the side and the green piping
totally<00:01:38.130> wasted<00:01:38.549> back<00:01:38.700> here<00:01:38.939> nonetheless

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
it's still cool to have it and if you

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.319 
it's still cool to have it and if you
line<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.280> up<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.549> can<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> good<00:01:41.970> job<00:01:42.030> with

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
of gundam although you'll see that

there's<00:03:07.209> not<00:03:07.360> too<00:03:07.630> much<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:08.019> it<00:03:08.140> in<00:03:08.260> terms<00:03:08.440> of

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
there's not too much to it in terms of

there's not too much to it in terms of
mobility<00:03:09.459> let's<00:03:10.420> start<00:03:10.630> with<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.810> back<00:03:10.930> where

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
mobility let's start with the back where

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.300 
mobility let's start with the back where
you're<00:03:11.230> going<00:03:11.350> to<00:03:11.410> have<00:03:11.530> this<00:03:11.680> tail<00:03:11.980> which<00:03:12.220> is

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
you're going to have this tail which is

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.949 
you're going to have this tail which is
going<00:03:12.430> to<00:03:12.489> be<00:03:12.549> folded<00:03:12.970> up<00:03:13.060> here<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:13.570> you<00:03:13.810> can

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
going to be folded up here and you can

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.780 
going to be folded up here and you can
see<00:03:14.170> how<00:03:14.200> it's<00:03:14.470> going<00:03:14.590> to<00:03:14.620> open<00:03:14.739> up<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.160> then

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
see how it's going to open up and then

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.280 
see how it's going to open up and then
down<00:03:16.030> you<00:03:16.209> can<00:03:16.360> use<00:03:16.480> that<00:03:16.600> in<00:03:16.720> mobile<00:03:16.989> armor

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
down you can use that in mobile armor

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.720 
down you can use that in mobile armor
form<00:03:17.560> you're<00:03:18.130> also<00:03:18.280> going<00:03:18.430> to<00:03:18.489> have<00:03:18.579> these

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
form you're also going to have these

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.460 
form you're also going to have these
white<00:03:19.000> guns<00:03:19.269> that<00:03:19.420> are<00:03:19.480> attached<00:03:19.840> onto<00:03:20.140> the

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
white guns that are attached onto the

white guns that are attached onto the

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
back a little bit of lining

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.220 
back a little bit of lining
opportunities<00:03:22.060> to<00:03:22.600> go<00:03:22.720> along<00:03:22.930> with<00:03:23.079> some

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
opportunities to go along with some

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.930 
opportunities to go along with some
green<00:03:23.440> piping<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.040> problem<00:03:24.340> is<00:03:24.459> if<00:03:24.610> you<00:03:24.700> try

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
green piping the problem is if you try

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.250 
green piping the problem is if you try
to<00:03:24.970> move<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.299> it<00:03:25.480> just<00:03:25.510> makes<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:26.019> feel<00:03:26.230> like

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
to move it it just makes it feel like

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.780 
to move it it just makes it feel like
the<00:03:26.410> piping<00:03:26.829> shouldn't<00:03:27.190> be<00:03:27.280> moving<00:03:27.549> in<00:03:27.640> there

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
the piping shouldn't be moving in there

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.660 
the piping shouldn't be moving in there
so<00:03:28.390> probably<00:03:28.690> best<00:03:28.930> just<00:03:29.049> to<00:03:29.290> let<00:03:29.530> them<00:03:29.560> be<00:03:30.040> the

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
so probably best just to let them be the

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.130 
so probably best just to let them be the
green<00:03:30.880> pipes<00:03:31.120> that<00:03:31.299> go<00:03:31.360> over<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.750> shoulders

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
green pipes that go over the shoulders

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.210 
green pipes that go over the shoulders
though<00:03:32.260> are<00:03:32.410> going<00:03:32.560> to<00:03:32.620> be<00:03:32.680> a<00:03:32.709> lot<00:03:32.890> of<00:03:32.950> wind

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
though are going to be a lot of wind

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.470 
though are going to be a lot of wind
because<00:03:33.370> you're<00:03:33.489> going<00:03:33.610> to<00:03:33.700> see<00:03:33.850> those<00:03:34.060> all

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
because you're going to see those all

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.050 
because you're going to see those all
the<00:03:34.959> way<00:03:35.079> on<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.350> front<00:03:35.950> but<00:03:36.519> looking<00:03:36.850> at<00:03:36.970> the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
the way on the front but looking at the

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.430 
the way on the front but looking at the
wings<00:03:37.269> first<00:03:37.690> you<00:03:37.959> can<00:03:38.109> see<00:03:38.200> that<00:03:38.230> they're

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
wings first you can see that they're

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.900 
wings first you can see that they're
going<00:03:38.560> to<00:03:38.620> be<00:03:38.709> attached<00:03:39.010> on<00:03:39.190> by<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.370> poly<00:03:39.640> cap

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
going to be attached on by a poly cap

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.130 
going to be attached on by a poly cap
there<00:03:40.150> and<00:03:40.359> they're<00:03:40.540> just<00:03:40.720> going<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:40.959> bend

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
there and they're just going to bend

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.440 
there and they're just going to bend
like<00:03:41.290> this<00:03:41.320> 90<00:03:41.980> degrees<00:03:42.310> and<00:03:42.609> even<00:03:43.239> when<00:03:43.329> they

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
like this 90 degrees and even when they

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:44.670 
like this 90 degrees and even when they
do<00:03:43.510> that<00:03:43.600> they're<00:03:43.959> not<00:03:44.140> going<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.350> wiggle<00:03:44.470> up

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
do that they're not going to wiggle up

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.020 
do that they're not going to wiggle up
and<00:03:44.829> down<00:03:44.980> so<00:03:45.250> you're<00:03:45.370> not<00:03:45.519> going<00:03:45.670> to<00:03:45.730> get<00:03:45.820> too

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
and down so you're not going to get too

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.729 
and down so you're not going to get too
much<00:03:46.209> motion<00:03:46.420> out<00:03:46.630> of<00:03:46.780> there<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:47.109> little<00:03:47.590> bit

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
much motion out of there a little bit

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.830 
much motion out of there a little bit
disappointing<00:03:48.370> I<00:03:48.579> not<00:03:49.030> sure<00:03:49.180> if<00:03:49.299> it<00:03:49.420> was<00:03:49.510> fixed

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
disappointing I not sure if it was fixed

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.150 
disappointing I not sure if it was fixed
in<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:49.989> anime<00:03:50.260> but<00:03:50.410> it<00:03:50.530> would<00:03:50.650> be<00:03:50.680> cool<00:03:50.980> for

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
in the anime but it would be cool for

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.860 
in the anime but it would be cool for
more<00:03:51.340> dynamic<00:03:51.760> poses<00:03:51.940> just<00:03:52.299> to<00:03:52.390> allow<00:03:52.540> them<00:03:52.720> to

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
more dynamic poses just to allow them to

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.229 
more dynamic poses just to allow them to
move<00:03:53.019> and<00:03:53.290> as<00:03:54.100> if<00:03:54.280> he<00:03:54.430> was<00:03:54.519> flying<00:03:54.820> through<00:03:55.150> the

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
move and as if he was flying through the

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.150 
move and as if he was flying through the
air<00:03:55.269> and<00:03:55.510> being<00:03:55.750> affected<00:03:56.109> by<00:03:56.200> air<00:03:56.440> or<00:03:56.470> wind<00:03:57.010> or

air and being affected by air or wind or
something<00:03:57.519> like<00:03:57.609> that<00:03:57.670> but<00:03:58.570> you've<00:03:58.690> also<00:03:58.840> got

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
something like that but you've also got

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.660 
something like that but you've also got

can put in there so I put pink parts in
there<00:04:55.949> for<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:56.250> mono<00:04:56.430> why<00:04:56.610> but<00:04:56.849> I<00:04:56.880> just<00:04:56.940> used<00:04:57.330> a

there for the mono why but I just used a

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.390 
there for the mono why but I just used a
black<00:04:57.630> lining<00:04:57.900> marker<00:04:58.289> to<00:04:58.470> just<00:04:58.710> add<00:04:58.979> the

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
very little plastic down at the end

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.170 
very little plastic down at the end
makes<00:06:20.710> the<00:06:20.890> sea<00:06:21.100> serpent<00:06:21.580> seem<00:06:21.820> like<00:06:22.030> it's

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
makes the sea serpent seem like it's

going<00:06:22.330> to<00:06:22.390> work<00:06:22.570> out<00:06:22.750> pretty<00:06:23.350> well<00:06:23.470> as<00:06:23.770> long<00:06:23.920> as

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 
going to work out pretty well as long as

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.170 
going to work out pretty well as long as
the<00:06:24.130> wire<00:06:24.280> is<00:06:24.460> actually<00:06:24.760> going<00:06:24.880> to<00:06:24.970> stay<00:06:25.150> in

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:25.180 
the wire is actually going to stay in

the wire is actually going to stay in
the<00:06:25.480> body<00:06:25.660> you<00:06:25.780> can<00:06:25.900> always<00:06:26.110> cut<00:06:26.290> this<00:06:26.410> down<00:06:26.620> if

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:26.890 
the body you can always cut this down if

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.500 
the body you can always cut this down if
it<00:06:27.310> was<00:06:27.430> getting<00:06:27.610> too<00:06:27.730> long<00:06:27.940> and<00:06:28.150> giving<00:06:28.390> you

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
it was getting too long and giving you

it was getting too long and giving you
too<00:06:28.780> many<00:06:28.990> problems<00:06:29.260> but<00:06:30.010> what<00:06:30.130> you<00:06:30.160> can<00:06:30.340> do<00:06:30.460> is

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
too many problems but what you can do is

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.550 
too many problems but what you can do is
you<00:06:30.730> can<00:06:30.760> detach<00:06:31.060> that<00:06:31.600> and<00:06:31.900> take<00:06:32.140> that<00:06:32.320> and

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
you can detach that and take that and

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.140 
you can detach that and take that and
plug<00:06:32.800> it<00:06:32.950> in<00:06:33.070> so<00:06:33.520> if<00:06:33.640> you<00:06:33.730> want<00:06:33.910> to<00:06:34.000> have<00:06:34.090> a

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.210 
the white inner frame was a new take on
it<00:07:01.240> i<00:07:01.300> like<00:07:01.510> both<00:07:01.690> shades<00:07:02.050> of<00:07:02.260> blue<00:07:02.470> the<00:07:03.070> white

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.220 
it i like both shades of blue the white

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.590

in<00:07:03.400> the<00:07:03.460> red<00:07:03.610> and<00:07:03.730> the<00:07:03.790> green<00:07:04.030> just<00:07:04.300> adds<00:07:04.480> a

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:04.600 
in the red and the green just adds a

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.480 
in the red and the green just adds a
nice<00:07:04.750> lot<00:07:05.020> of<00:07:05.140> color<00:07:05.320> a<00:07:05.560> lot<00:07:06.010> of<00:07:06.160> the<00:07:06.220> green<00:07:06.400> is

nice lot of color a lot of the green is

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.830 
nice lot of color a lot of the green is
going<00:07:06.610> to<00:07:06.700> be<00:07:06.760> hidden<00:07:07.060> which<00:07:07.300> is<00:07:07.450> a<00:07:07.480> little<00:07:07.750> bit

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 
going to be hidden which is a little bit

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.150 
going to be hidden which is a little bit
disappointing<00:07:08.380> but<00:07:08.500> then<00:07:08.620> you<00:07:08.770> get<00:07:08.860> it<00:07:09.010> where

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 
disappointing but then you get it where

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.070 
disappointing but then you get it where
it<00:07:09.190> matters<00:07:09.640> most<00:07:09.670> on<00:07:10.120> the<00:07:10.210> front<00:07:10.840> of<00:07:10.870> the<00:07:10.960> head

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 
it matters most on the front of the head

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.720 
it matters most on the front of the head
to<00:07:11.260> go<00:07:11.350> along<00:07:11.590> with<00:07:11.770> the<00:07:11.860> mono<00:07:12.040> eyes<00:07:12.250> I<00:07:12.280> think<00:07:12.640> I

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:12.730 
to go along with the mono eyes I think I

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:13.980 
to go along with the mono eyes I think I
should<00:07:12.970> I<00:07:13.000> didn't<00:07:13.390> show<00:07:13.510> off<00:07:13.660> that<00:07:13.690> there's

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 
should I didn't show off that there's

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.840 
should I didn't show off that there's
also<00:07:14.140> one<00:07:14.380> there<00:07:14.620> on<00:07:14.800> the<00:07:15.250> back<00:07:15.400> of<00:07:15.430> the<00:07:15.670> head

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:15.850 
also one there on the back of the head

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.090 
also one there on the back of the head
to<00:07:16.060> make<00:07:16.090> five<00:07:16.570> strange<00:07:16.990> eyes<00:07:17.230> you'd<00:07:17.860> wonder

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:18.100 
to make five strange eyes you'd wonder

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.730 
to make five strange eyes you'd wonder
why<00:07:18.370> people<00:07:18.730> and<00:07:19.240> other<00:07:19.540> things<00:07:19.870> haven't<00:07:20.590> got

why people and other things haven't got
more<00:07:20.950> than<00:07:21.100> two<00:07:21.310> nonetheless<00:07:22.000> you<00:07:22.360> can<00:07:22.510> see

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:22.660 
more than two nonetheless you can see

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.880 
more than two nonetheless you can see
here<00:07:22.870> that<00:07:22.900> the<00:07:23.080> beam<00:07:23.230> sabers<00:07:23.620> with<00:07:23.770> their

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:23.890
