so if the eating of the room that takes

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.550 
so if the eating of the room that takes
a<00:02:30.120> little<00:02:30.330> bit<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.630> plant<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.260> have<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.470> be

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
a little bit of plant you have to be

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.020 
a little bit of plant you have to be

familiar with your beans because if

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.890 
familiar with your beans because if
you're<00:02:33.150> harvesting<00:02:33.330> too<00:02:33.810> young<00:02:34.080> very<00:02:34.980> bitter

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
you're harvesting too young very bitter

you're harvesting too young very bitter
just<00:02:36.900> right<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.590> most<00:02:37.800> delicious<00:02:38.040> being<00:02:38.459> in

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
just right the most delicious being in

just right the most delicious being in
the<00:02:38.700> world<00:02:38.910> a<00:02:39.209> little<00:02:39.930> bit<00:02:40.140> dry<00:02:40.500> they're<00:02:41.280> very

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
the world a little bit dry they're very

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.000 
the world a little bit dry they're very
hard<00:02:42.360> to

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
hard to

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.890 
hard to
they<00:02:43.459> take<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.760> long<00:02:44.000> time<00:02:44.269> to<00:02:44.330> boil<00:02:44.599> and<00:02:44.840> they

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
they take a long time to boil and they

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.520 
they take a long time to boil and they
stay<00:02:45.170> very<00:02:45.409> tough<00:02:45.769> so<00:02:46.640> it's<00:02:47.349> moronga<00:02:48.349> you<00:02:48.439> have

stay very tough so it's moronga you have

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.350 
stay very tough so it's moronga you have
to<00:02:48.650> be<00:02:48.769> familiar<00:02:49.129> with<00:02:49.159> them<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.970> window<00:02:50.329> for

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
to be familiar with them the window for

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.750 
to be familiar with them the window for
harvesting<00:02:51.110> being<00:02:51.439> lazy<00:02:51.920> like<00:02:52.250> it's<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.489> short

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
harvesting being lazy like it's a short

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.460 
harvesting being lazy like it's a short
window<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.209> probably<00:02:53.569> have<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.780> three<00:02:54.260> week

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
window you probably have a three week

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.190 
window you probably have a three week
month<00:02:54.890> between<00:02:55.720> three<00:02:56.720> weeks<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:57.140> month

month between three weeks to a month

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.929 
month between three weeks to a month
between<00:02:57.560> where<00:02:58.069> and<00:02:58.159> they're<00:02:58.250> immature<00:02:58.519> to

00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:58.939 
between where and they're immature to

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.460 
between where and they're immature to
when<00:02:59.090> they<00:02:59.209> start<00:02:59.480> to<00:02:59.599> dry<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.170> there<00:03:00.319> is<00:03:00.349> a

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
when they start to dry so there is a

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.259 
when they start to dry so there is a
nice<00:03:00.739> window<00:03:01.069> of<00:03:01.400> opportunity<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.090> harvest

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
nice window of opportunity to harvest

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.330 
nice window of opportunity to harvest
them<00:03:02.659> but<00:03:02.840> they<00:03:02.959> do<00:03:03.019> need<00:03:03.319> we<00:03:03.470> are<00:03:03.590> how<00:03:04.099> many

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
them but they do need we are how many

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.220 
them but they do need we are how many
months<00:03:04.519> out<00:03:04.760> of<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.909> year<00:03:05.150> do<00:03:05.329> you<00:03:05.390> have<00:03:05.569> it

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
months out of the year do you have it

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.500 
months out of the year do you have it
the<00:03:06.739> Moringa<00:03:07.190> produces<00:03:07.670> according<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.239> water

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
the Moringa produces according to water

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.289 
the Moringa produces according to water
so<00:03:09.379> if<00:03:09.590> you're<00:03:09.829> watering<00:03:10.310> your<00:03:10.579> garden<00:03:10.760> which

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
so if you're watering your garden which

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.720 
so if you're watering your garden which
per<00:03:12.109> se<00:03:12.290> this<00:03:12.470> maroon<00:03:12.799> does<00:03:12.980> not<00:03:13.189> watered<00:03:13.609> it

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
per se this maroon does not watered it

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.240 
per se this maroon does not watered it
just<00:03:13.970> grows<00:03:14.180> that's<00:03:14.780> basically<00:03:15.530> due<00:03:15.799> to<00:03:15.980> rain

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
just grows that's basically due to rain

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.339 
just grows that's basically due to rain
so<00:03:16.940> they're<00:03:17.299> usually<00:03:17.480> a<00:03:17.720> flower<00:03:18.019> produce

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
so they're usually a flower produce

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:19.750 
so they're usually a flower produce
fruit<00:03:18.650> after<00:03:18.859> the<00:03:19.129> beginning<00:03:19.459> of<00:03:19.519> the<00:03:19.609> summer

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
fruit after the beginning of the summer

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.360 
fruit after the beginning of the summer
rains<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.359> if<00:03:21.019> you<00:03:21.139> have<00:03:21.290> like<00:03:21.980> if<00:03:22.129> we<00:03:22.280> need

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
rains and if you have like if we need

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.670 
rains and if you have like if we need
consistent<00:03:22.970> rain<00:03:23.150> this<00:03:23.359> year<00:03:23.420> I<00:03:23.810> would<00:03:24.319> have

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
consistent rain this year I would have

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.149 
consistent rain this year I would have
flour<00:03:25.069> and<00:03:25.519> beans<00:03:26.180> of<00:03:26.480> all<00:03:27.170> sorts<00:03:27.409> of<00:03:27.620> Ages<00:03:27.980> on

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 
flour and beans of all sorts of Ages on

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.490 
flour and beans of all sorts of Ages on
this<00:03:28.280> tree<00:03:28.629> whereas<00:03:29.629> we<00:03:29.750> had<00:03:29.870> some<00:03:30.079> rain<00:03:30.109> then

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
this tree whereas we had some rain then

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.740 
this tree whereas we had some rain then
it<00:03:30.620> stopped<00:03:30.889> I've<00:03:31.400> got<00:03:31.730> beans<00:03:32.150> of<00:03:32.359> a<00:03:32.420> certain

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
it stopped I've got beans of a certain

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.020 
it stopped I've got beans of a certain
age<00:03:32.840> industry<00:03:33.379> so<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:33.980> harvest<00:03:34.430> visits<00:03:34.790> there

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
age industry so the harvest visits there

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.629 
age industry so the harvest visits there
a<00:03:35.060> summer<00:03:35.389> fruiting<00:03:35.900> tree<00:03:36.799> will<00:03:37.400> get<00:03:37.519> the

a summer fruiting tree will get the

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.759 
a summer fruiting tree will get the
