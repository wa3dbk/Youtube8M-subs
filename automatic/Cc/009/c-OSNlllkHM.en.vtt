00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.410 

now<00:03:54.470> I<00:03:54.860> use<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.280> tape<00:03:55.580> measure<00:03:55.820> to<00:03:55.940> measure<00:03:56.210> it

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
now I use a tape measure to measure it

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.360 
now I use a tape measure to measure it
just<00:03:56.960> to<00:03:57.110> make<00:03:57.260> sure<00:03:57.290> that<00:03:57.770> I'm<00:03:57.890> getting<00:03:58.220> the

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
just to make sure that I'm getting the

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.580 
just to make sure that I'm getting the
proper<00:03:58.580> lens<00:03:58.850> know<00:03:59.540> how<00:03:59.780> I<00:03:59.810> get<00:04:00.020> the<00:04:00.170> lenses

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
proper lens know how I get the lenses

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.350 
proper lens know how I get the lenses
I'll<00:04:00.770> check<00:04:01.040> other<00:04:01.220> websites<00:04:01.760> who<00:04:02.120> make

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
I'll check other websites who make

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.330 
I'll check other websites who make
professional<00:04:03.320> extensions<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:04.130> then<00:04:04.220> I'll

professional extensions and then I'll

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.490 
professional extensions and then I'll
measure<00:04:04.550> it<00:04:04.730> in<00:04:04.880> my<00:04:05.000> head<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.810> longest<00:04:06.230> i'll

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
probably do is 8 inches and I double my

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.650 
probably do is 8 inches and I double my
wife's<00:04:09.920> to<00:04:10.190> get<00:04:10.310> them<00:04:10.460> nice<00:04:10.610> and<00:04:10.670> thick<00:04:11.060> but

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
wife's to get them nice and thick but

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.240 
wife's to get them nice and thick but
depending<00:04:12.110> on<00:04:12.230> how<00:04:12.350> thick<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.710> web<00:04:12.830> star<00:04:13.070> like

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
depending on how thick the web star like

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.610 
depending on how thick the web star like
these<00:04:13.430> webs<00:04:13.700> were<00:04:13.880> really<00:04:14.420> thick<00:04:14.660> so<00:04:15.170> doubling

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
these webs were really thick so doubling

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.830 
these webs were really thick so doubling
it<00:04:15.740> made<00:04:15.920> it<00:04:16.040> really<00:04:16.250> hard<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:16.910> then<00:04:17.420> after<00:04:17.810> I

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
it made it really hard and then after I

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.660 
it made it really hard and then after I
double<00:04:18.440> it<00:04:18.530> or<00:04:18.800> you<00:04:19.040> don't<00:04:19.100> have<00:04:19.190> to<00:04:19.340> double<00:04:19.580> it

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
double it or you don't have to double it

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.840 
double it or you don't have to double it
