00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
you've got a bike mount that's

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.080 
you've got a bike mount that's
compatible<00:01:54.340> that'll<00:01:55.340> work<00:01:55.490> as<00:01:55.670> well<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.000> it

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
compatible that'll work as well and it

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.999 
compatible that'll work as well and it
also<00:01:56.270> oddly<00:01:57.140> enough<00:01:57.229> works<00:01:57.560> as<00:01:57.770> a

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
also oddly enough works as a

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.469 
also oddly enough works as a
speakerphone<00:01:58.550> so<00:01:58.880> you've<00:01:59.000> got<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.119> microphone

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
speakerphone so you've got a microphone

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.749 
speakerphone so you've got a microphone
built<00:01:59.869> into<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.320> front<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:00.860> then<00:02:01.520> you<00:02:01.610> can

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
built into the front and then you can

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.910 
built into the front and then you can
use<00:02:01.940> it<00:02:02.090> to<00:02:02.240> take<00:02:02.479> hands-free<00:02:03.140> calls<00:02:03.530> which<00:02:03.740> is

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
use it to take hands-free calls which is
