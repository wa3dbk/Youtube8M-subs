you today got stuck in this morning to
the<00:00:19.410> loom

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
the loom

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.609 
the loom
yesterday<00:00:20.939> we<00:00:21.180> finished<00:00:21.480> off<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:22.020> chassis

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
yesterday we finished off the chassis

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.109 
yesterday we finished off the chassis
wiring<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.310> smart<00:00:23.609> wire<00:00:23.820> which<00:00:24.000> we

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
wiring and the smart wire which we

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.439 
wiring and the smart wire which we
talked<00:00:24.359> about<00:00:24.619> the<00:00:25.619> start<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.189> today<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.820> turned

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
talked about the start of today I turned

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.450 
talked about the start of today I turned
out<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.750> Autosport<00:00:28.560> connector<00:00:29.010> for<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
out the Autosport connector for the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.150 
out the Autosport connector for the
firewall<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.300> that's<00:00:30.510> where<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.439> moon<00:00:31.859> comes

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
firewall so that's where the moon comes

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.740 
firewall so that's where the moon comes
through<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.489> firewall<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.239> connects<00:00:33.570> up<00:00:33.719> to

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
through the firewall and connects up to

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.260 
through the firewall and connects up to
the<00:00:33.989> engine<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.800> great<00:00:35.250> thing<00:00:35.520> about<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.940> is

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
the engine a great thing about this is

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.840 
the engine a great thing about this is
you<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:37.200> take<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.829> whole<00:00:38.010> engineer<00:00:38.520> art<00:00:38.640> and

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
you can take the whole engineer art and

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.970 
you can take the whole engineer art and
it's<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.690> quarter<00:00:39.960> twist<00:00:40.350> connector<00:00:40.829> on

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
it's just a quarter twist connector on

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.950 
it's just a quarter twist connector on
the<00:00:41.010> firewall<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.969> whole<00:00:42.180> one<00:00:42.420> comes<00:00:42.750> out

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the firewall and the whole one comes out

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.930 
the firewall and the whole one comes out
with<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.200> engine<00:00:43.559> they<00:00:44.010> said<00:00:44.219> heaps<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.730> that

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
with the engine they said heaps is that

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.450 
with the engine they said heaps is that
a<00:00:44.969> work<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.390> car<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:46.440> saves<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.070> having<00:00:47.280> a

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
a work on the car it saves you having a

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.240 
a work on the car it saves you having a
disconnect<00:00:48.090> every<00:00:48.390> connector<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.500> oil

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
disconnect every connector and to oil

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.220 
disconnect every connector and to oil
plug<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.000> engine<00:00:51.360> every<00:00:51.690> time<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.050> want

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
plug on the engine every time you want

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.860 
plug on the engine every time you want
to<00:00:52.289> work<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.100> that's<00:00:53.280> really<00:00:53.520> handy

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
to work on it so that's really handy

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.360 
to work on it so that's really handy
it's<00:00:54.870> quite<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> bit<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.410> work<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.829> panning<00:00:56.250> out

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
it's quite a bit of work and panning out

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.819 
it's quite a bit of work and panning out
one<00:00:56.640> of<00:00:56.670> these<00:00:56.940> Autosport<00:00:57.629> connectors<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
one of these Autosport connectors the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.250 
one of these Autosport connectors the
one<00:00:59.039> we're<00:00:59.250> using<00:00:59.489> as<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.940> 61<00:01:00.719> terminal

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
one we're using as a 61 terminal

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.590 
one we're using as a 61 terminal
connector<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.160> that's<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.460> lot<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.730> pins<00:01:03.090> to

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
connector so that's a lot of pins to

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.140 
connector so that's a lot of pins to
wire<00:01:03.840> up<00:01:04.280> connected<00:01:05.280> up<00:01:05.400> all<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> power

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
wire up connected up all of the power

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.390 
wire up connected up all of the power
and<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.540> supplies<00:01:06.930> two<00:01:07.439> different<00:01:07.860> sensors<00:01:08.250> on

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
and it supplies two different sensors on

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.820 
and it supplies two different sensors on
the<00:01:08.549> engine<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.030> once<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.170> had<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.350> all<00:01:10.590> done

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the engine and once we had that all done

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.160 
the engine and once we had that all done
and<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.640> connector<00:01:12.270> was<00:01:12.420> completely<00:01:12.900> panned

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
and the connector was completely panned

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.190 
and the connector was completely panned
out<00:01:13.939> concentric<00:01:14.939> twisted<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.600> first<00:01:15.840> section

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
out concentric twisted the first section

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.830 
out concentric twisted the first section
of<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> loom<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.610> got<00:01:17.850> there<00:01:18.150> all<00:01:18.420> that

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
of the loom and we got there all that

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.520 
of the loom and we got there all that
and<00:01:19.229> Lake<00:01:19.439> MDR<00:01:19.979> 25<00:01:20.549> chief<00:01:21.020> put<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> rake

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
and Lake MDR 25 chief put on the rake

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.469 
and Lake MDR 25 chief put on the rake
him<00:01:22.860> pitch<00:01:23.280> strength<00:01:23.549> boot<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> connector

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
him pitch strength boot on the connector

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.690 
him pitch strength boot on the connector
so<00:01:24.689> that's<00:01:25.229> all<00:01:25.350> completely<00:01:25.590> finished<00:01:26.340> and

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
so that's all completely finished and

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.450 
so that's all completely finished and
100%<00:01:27.119> weather<00:01:27.600> tight<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.650> tomorrow<00:01:29.220> we'll

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
100% weather tight so tomorrow we'll

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.609 
100% weather tight so tomorrow we'll
continue<00:01:29.700> with<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.329> I'm<00:01:30.689> hoping<00:01:31.259> by<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.500> end

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
continue with that I'm hoping by the end

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.560 
continue with that I'm hoping by the end
of<00:01:31.799> tomorrow<00:01:32.189> we'll<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.030> engine<00:01:33.450> bay

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
of tomorrow we'll have the engine bay

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.630 
of tomorrow we'll have the engine bay
loom<00:01:33.920> 100%<00:01:34.920> complete

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
loom 100% complete

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.880 
loom 100% complete
it'll<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.420> leave<00:01:36.810> us<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.110> short<00:01:37.409> link<00:01:37.619> from

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
it'll just leave us the short link from

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.490 
it'll just leave us the short link from
the<00:01:38.070> ECU<00:01:38.490> up<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.000> firewall<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.079> we'll<00:01:40.380> be

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
the ECU up to the firewall and we'll be

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.080 
the ECU up to the firewall and we'll be
good<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.740> power<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.520> test<00:01:41.790> everything

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
good to power it up and test everything

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.410 
good to power it up and test everything
so<00:01:42.990> hopefully<00:01:43.619> by<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.159> end<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.430> Sunday<00:01:44.640> this

week eight hours a day and yeah it
basically<00:02:11.640> pays<00:02:12.239> for<00:02:12.540> what's<00:02:12.750> behind<00:02:12.959> me<00:02:14.690> it

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
basically pays for what's behind me it

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.330 
basically pays for what's behind me it
yeah<00:02:16.140> it's<00:02:17.599> it's<00:02:18.599> been<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:19.470> fairly<00:02:19.890> busy<00:02:20.040> day

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
yeah it's it's been a fairly busy day

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.710 
yeah it's it's been a fairly busy day
but<00:02:20.400> yeah<00:02:21.060> it's<00:02:21.209> just<00:02:21.420> basically<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:23.730> got<00:02:24.510> home

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
but yeah it's just basically I got home

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.600 
but yeah it's just basically I got home
from<00:02:24.750> work<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.470> started<00:02:26.010> thinking<00:02:26.280> about<00:02:26.370> the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
from work and started thinking about the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.699 
from work and started thinking about the
air<00:02:26.790> filter<00:02:27.239> that<00:02:27.269> I've<00:02:27.660> put<00:02:27.930> off<00:02:28.080> for<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:28.500> long

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
air filter that I've put off for so long

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.130 
air filter that I've put off for so long
I<00:02:29.069> really<00:02:29.819> didn't<00:02:30.180> want<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.630> have<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.900> deal

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
I really didn't want to have to deal

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.640 
I really didn't want to have to deal
with<00:02:31.319> it

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
with it

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.440 
with it
I<00:02:31.680> was<00:02:31.890> hoping<00:02:32.220> on<00:02:32.400> dread<00:02:32.640> come<00:02:32.910> up<00:02:33.030> with<00:02:33.180> some

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
I was hoping on dread come up with some

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.960 
I was hoping on dread come up with some
things<00:02:33.720> but<00:02:33.989> he<00:02:34.950> pretty<00:02:35.160> much<00:02:35.250> fails<00:02:35.640> in<00:02:35.910> that

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
things but he pretty much fails in that

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.110 
things but he pretty much fails in that
area<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:37.370> I<00:02:38.810> built<00:02:39.810> everything<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:41.760> basically

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
area so I built everything to basically

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.690 
area so I built everything to basically
be<00:02:42.390> where<00:02:42.600> it<00:02:42.690> needs<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.019> be<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.500> an<00:02:44.130> air

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
be where it needs to be and an air

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.930 
be where it needs to be and an air
filter<00:02:44.910> I<00:02:45.090> thought<00:02:45.420> clean<00:02:46.380> air<00:02:46.650> who<00:02:47.459> needs<00:02:47.730> it

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
filter I thought clean air who needs it

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.229 
filter I thought clean air who needs it
but<00:02:48.630> turns<00:02:49.560> out<00:02:49.830> we<00:02:50.250> probably<00:02:50.549> actually<00:02:51.030> need

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
but turns out we probably actually need

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.319 
but turns out we probably actually need
it<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:52.880> yeah<00:02:53.880> everything<00:02:54.359> I<00:02:55.049> built<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.370> sort<00:02:57.180> of

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
it so yeah everything I built I sort of

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.080 
it so yeah everything I built I sort of
ended<00:02:57.570> up<00:02:57.810> building<00:02:58.079> myself<00:02:58.670> into<00:02:59.670> like<00:02:59.850> this

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
ended up building myself into like this

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.710 
ended up building myself into like this
little<00:03:01.220> little<00:03:02.220> little<00:03:02.670> corner<00:03:03.209> that<00:03:03.450> I

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
little little little corner that I

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.080 
little little little corner that I
actually<00:03:04.380> can't<00:03:04.859> fit<00:03:05.070> an<00:03:05.160> air<00:03:05.370> filter<00:03:05.609> through

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
actually can't fit an air filter through

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.410 
actually can't fit an air filter through
so<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:07.500> have<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.100> get<00:03:08.280> creative<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:09.120> thought

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
so I have to get creative and thought

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.680 
so I have to get creative and thought
yeah<00:03:10.260> maybe<00:03:10.590> one<00:03:10.950> of<00:03:11.100> those<00:03:11.660> over<00:03:12.660> the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
yeah maybe one of those over the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.930 
yeah maybe one of those over the
radiator<00:03:14.660> Commodore<00:03:15.660> filters<00:03:16.410> would<00:03:16.590> work

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
radiator Commodore filters would work

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.440 
radiator Commodore filters would work
sticking<00:03:17.940> under<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:18.750> radiator<00:03:19.880> so<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:21.180> tried

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
sticking under the radiator so I tried

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.610 
sticking under the radiator so I tried
to<00:03:21.570> get<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:21.720> little<00:03:22.109> bit<00:03:23.359> crazy<00:03:24.359> with<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:25.320> sheet

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
to get a little bit crazy with the sheet

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.310 
to get a little bit crazy with the sheet
metal<00:03:25.829> a<00:03:26.760> lot<00:03:27.359> of<00:03:27.450> cutting<00:03:27.690> on<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.019> angle

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
metal a lot of cutting on the angle

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.430 
metal a lot of cutting on the angle
grinder<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.709> lot<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:28.980> welding<00:03:29.750> I<00:03:30.750> think<00:03:31.140> I<00:03:31.230> came

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
grinder a lot of welding I think I came

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.080 
grinder a lot of welding I think I came
up<00:03:31.620> with<00:03:31.650> something<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.220> might<00:03:32.459> work<00:03:32.730> but

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
up with something that might work but

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.090 
up with something that might work but
I'm<00:03:33.299> not<00:03:33.450> real<00:03:33.690> happy<00:03:34.019> with<00:03:34.049> it<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:34.560> it's

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
I'm not real happy with it and it's

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.250 
I'm not real happy with it and it's
probably<00:03:35.310> something<00:03:35.640> I'll<00:03:35.880> do<00:03:36.090> later<00:03:36.630> on<00:03:36.989> but

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
probably something I'll do later on but

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.920 
probably something I'll do later on but
it'll<00:03:38.010> give<00:03:38.130> us<00:03:38.160> results<00:03:38.760> for<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.000> dyno<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:39.450> I

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
it'll give us results for the dyno and I

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.479 
it'll give us results for the dyno and I
think<00:03:40.440> that's<00:03:40.590> all<00:03:40.769> that<00:03:40.799> matters

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
think that's all that matters

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.030 
think that's all that matters
Andre<00:03:42.480> did<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.720> really<00:03:42.900> nice<00:03:43.170> job<00:03:43.230> on<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.799> loom

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
Andre did a really nice job on the loom

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.870 
Andre did a really nice job on the loom
and<00:03:44.510> it's<00:03:45.510> looking<00:03:46.019> like<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.440> weekend<00:03:46.950> should

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
and it's looking like the weekend should

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.199 
and it's looking like the weekend should

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
see this thing running fingers crossed

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.530 
see this thing running fingers crossed
