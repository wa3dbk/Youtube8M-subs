you can't downgrade these options

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.640 
you can't downgrade these options
meaning<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.570> is<00:02:21.600> possible<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.260> make<00:02:22.470> this

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
meaning that it is possible to make this

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.620 
meaning that it is possible to make this
game<00:02:22.860> too<00:02:23.070> easy<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.700> be<00:02:23.820> locked<00:02:24.060> into<00:02:24.270> an<00:02:24.450> easy

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
game too easy and be locked into an easy

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.990 
game too easy and be locked into an easy
game<00:02:24.870> but<00:02:25.560> surprisingly<00:02:26.130> this<00:02:26.460> game<00:02:26.790> is

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
game but surprisingly this game is

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.940 
game but surprisingly this game is
actually<00:02:27.240> pretty<00:02:27.750> challenging<00:02:28.050> playing<00:02:28.860> on

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
actually pretty challenging playing on

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.740 
actually pretty challenging playing on
hardcore<00:02:29.250> mode<00:02:29.430> actually<00:02:30.150> gave<00:02:30.360> me<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.570> decent

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
hardcore mode actually gave me a decent

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.960 
hardcore mode actually gave me a decent
challenge<00:02:31.080> not<00:02:31.830> like<00:02:32.040> Saints<00:02:32.340> Row<00:02:32.370> 3<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.700> 4

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
challenge not like Saints Row 3 and 4

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.340 
challenge not like Saints Row 3 and 4
where<00:02:33.210> basically<00:02:33.660> you'd<00:02:33.960> have<00:02:34.110> to<00:02:34.260> be

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
where basically you'd have to be

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.620 
where basically you'd have to be
brain-dead<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:35.160> ever<00:02:35.310> die<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:36.330> that's

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
brain-dead to ever die so that's

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.680 
brain-dead to ever die so that's
definitely<00:02:36.960> a<00:02:37.230> plus<00:02:37.520> um<00:02:38.520> there's<00:02:39.180> no<00:02:39.330> radio

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
definitely a plus um there's no radio

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.770 
definitely a plus um there's no radio
whatsoever<00:02:40.440> so<00:02:40.860> no<00:02:41.190> on-foot<00:02:41.640> radio<00:02:42.000> no<00:02:42.360> radio

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
whatsoever so no on-foot radio no radio

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.630 
whatsoever so no on-foot radio no radio
in<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:42.990> cars<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.500> yeah<00:02:44.040> that's<00:02:44.250> kind<00:02:44.490> of<00:02:44.580> a

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
in the cars and yeah that's kind of a

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.370 
in the cars and yeah that's kind of a
bummer<00:02:44.850> because<00:02:45.090> Saints<00:02:45.630> Row<00:02:45.810> has<00:02:45.990> really

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
bummer because Saints Row has really

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.110 
bummer because Saints Row has really

game could have been a lot better once
again<00:03:19.080> in<00:03:19.200> my<00:03:19.290> Dex<00:03:19.530> video<00:03:19.830> I<00:03:19.890> explained<00:03:20.459> that
