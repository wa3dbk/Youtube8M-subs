00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
was awesome I really love this chapter I

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.990 
was awesome I really love this chapter I
don't<00:01:17.070> even<00:01:17.159> think<00:01:17.280> there's<00:01:17.490> all<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.729> much

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
don't even think there's all that much

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.520 
don't even think there's all that much
to<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.299> besides<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.689> Rebecca<00:01:18.990> stuff<00:01:19.320> and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
to it besides the Rebecca stuff and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.020 
to it besides the Rebecca stuff and
luffy<00:01:19.920> coming<00:01:20.159> back<00:01:20.280> there's<00:01:20.759> really<00:01:20.880> not

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
luffy coming back there's really not

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.940 
luffy coming back there's really not
that<00:01:21.090> much<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.500> doesn't<00:01:22.830> matter

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
that much to it but that doesn't matter

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.070 
that much to it but that doesn't matter
because<00:01:23.159> when<00:01:23.549> one<00:01:24.030> piece<00:01:24.240> focuses<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.900> like

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
because when one piece focuses on like

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.050 
because when one piece focuses on like
two<00:01:25.350> things<00:01:25.619> only<00:01:25.830> during<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.280> chapter<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.670> think

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
two things only during a chapter I think

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.880 
two things only during a chapter I think
it<00:01:27.150> works<00:01:27.330> better<00:01:27.450> mm-hmm<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.560> has<00:01:28.710> your

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
it works better mm-hmm and it has your

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.679 
it works better mm-hmm and it has your
attention<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> entire<00:01:29.909> time<00:01:30.240> like<00:01:30.540> when

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
attention the entire time like when

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.480 
attention the entire time like when
God's<00:01:30.960> finally<00:01:31.380> decided<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.799> go<00:01:32.009> up<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.310> high

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
God's finally decided to go up on high

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.399 
God's finally decided to go up on high
and<00:01:32.759> start<00:01:33.210> preaching<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> good<00:01:33.990> word<00:01:34.229> of

so pumped up because I knew only a

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.950

next week that's yeah that was the

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.160 
next week that's yeah that was the
biggest<00:03:24.060> this<00:03:24.270> point<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.690> didn't<00:03:24.840> even<00:03:24.930> notice

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
biggest this point I didn't even notice

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.480 
biggest this point I didn't even notice
that<00:03:25.440> until<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.740> told<00:03:25.890> me<00:03:26.040> about<00:03:26.130> that<00:03:26.340> in<00:03:26.459> the

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
that until you told me about that in the

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.430 
that until you told me about that in the

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
final panel we go in that the way it

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.320 
final panel we go in that the way it
always<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.830> like<00:03:29.250> right<00:03:29.700> before<00:03:29.910> something

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
always is like right before something

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.480 
always is like right before something
really<00:03:30.480> bad<00:03:30.870> ass<00:03:31.320> is<00:03:31.530> about<00:03:31.650> to<00:03:31.800> happen<00:03:32.100> oh

really bad ass is about to happen oh
we're<00:03:33.000> on<00:03:33.150> break<00:03:33.420> that's<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.840> way<00:03:33.930> it's<00:03:34.080> gotta

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
we're on break that's the way it's gotta

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.530 
we're on break that's the way it's gotta
be<00:03:34.350> I<00:03:34.740> think<00:03:35.070> they<00:03:35.160> need<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.490> extra<00:03:35.670> time<00:03:35.940> to

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
be I think they need the extra time to

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.420 
be I think they need the extra time to
make<00:03:36.900> all<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.350> panels<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.860> think<00:03:38.160> that's<00:03:38.280> what

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
make all the panels I think that's what

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.220 
make all the panels I think that's what
it<00:03:38.550> is<00:03:38.580> because<00:03:38.880> one<00:03:39.450> piece<00:03:39.630> just<00:03:39.810> has<00:03:39.959> so<00:03:40.140> many

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
it is because one piece just has so many

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.710 
it is because one piece just has so many
characters<00:03:40.500> it's<00:03:41.040> they<00:03:41.910> can't<00:03:42.180> pull<00:03:42.360> a<00:03:42.390> bleach

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
characters it's they can't pull a bleach

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.000 
characters it's they can't pull a bleach
and<00:03:42.989> just<00:03:43.110> fill<00:03:43.290> everything<00:03:43.590> with<00:03:43.830> white

power<00:05:25.880> is<00:05:26.210> not<00:05:26.599> his<00:05:27.139> devil<00:05:27.500> fruit<00:05:27.530> it's<00:05:27.919> his

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
power is not his devil fruit it's his

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.800

was not really allowed I think he

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.879 
was not really allowed I think he
tolerates<00:05:35.210> Luffy<00:05:35.690> um<00:05:35.930> you<00:05:36.380> know<00:05:36.470> cuz<00:05:36.620> i<00:05:36.710> think

maybe grown more of a relationship with
say<00:05:42.830> Zorro<00:05:43.340> than<00:05:43.610> anyone<00:05:43.940> but<00:05:44.090> only<00:05:44.330> because

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 
say Zorro than anyone but only because

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:45.760 
say Zorro than anyone but only because
you<00:05:44.930> know<00:05:45.050> they<00:05:45.169> kind<00:05:45.320> of<00:05:45.409> had<00:05:45.530> the<00:05:45.650> whole

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.409 
you know they kind of had the whole
swordsman<00:05:46.250> thing<00:05:46.430> going<00:05:46.729> on<00:05:46.789> but<00:05:47.090> luffy

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
swordsman thing going on but luffy

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:48.820 
swordsman thing going on but luffy

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
remember when they first got introduced

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.589 
remember when they first got introduced
luffy<00:05:49.250> saved<00:05:49.760> him<00:05:49.909> from<00:05:49.970> those<00:05:50.180> guys<00:05:50.389> that

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:50.599 
luffy saved him from those guys that

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 
think fujitora really likes Luffy and

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.040 
think fujitora really likes Luffy and
he's<00:05:55.310> even<00:05:55.490> helping<00:05:55.699> with<00:05:56.270> the<00:05:56.360> birdcage<00:05:56.780> but

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
he's even helping with the birdcage but

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.300 
he's even helping with the birdcage but
you<00:05:57.139> could<00:05:57.289> make<00:05:57.440> a<00:05:57.470> case<00:05:57.740> that<00:05:57.800> he's<00:05:58.130> actually

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
you could make a case that he's actually

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.969 
you could make a case that he's actually
just<00:05:58.639> helping<00:05:58.940> himself<00:05:59.060> with<00:05:59.510> that<00:05:59.740> but<00:06:00.740> it

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:00.979

see people from yu yu hakusho and you

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.730 
see people from yu yu hakusho and you
know<00:07:17.330> Dragonball<00:07:17.870> of<00:07:18.050> course<00:07:18.259> on<00:07:18.439> that<00:07:18.590> list

00:07:19.969 --> 00:07:21.429 
but I just think that would be awesome
because<00:07:20.270> they're<00:07:20.360> all<00:07:20.569> so<00:07:20.750> distinctive<00:07:21.349> and

because they're all so distinctive and

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:23.170 
because they're all so distinctive and
awesome<00:07:21.800> and<00:07:21.919> that<00:07:22.069> I<00:07:22.219> don't<00:07:22.610> know<00:07:22.669> just<00:07:23.000> I

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.180 
awesome and that I don't know just I

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.490 
awesome and that I don't know just I
usually<00:07:23.539> don't<00:07:23.629> like<00:07:23.870> those<00:07:24.050> type<00:07:24.229> of<00:07:24.259> side

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:24.500 
usually don't like those type of side

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.019 
usually don't like those type of side
