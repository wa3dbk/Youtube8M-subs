00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 why was there such excitement at the beginning 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.150
 matches in general tass tennis player who 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.260
 Well you obviously lower class 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.269
 well, she is completely different playing than vinus 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.120
 and it seemed to start 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.850
 but even I led 21 was very so important 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.400
 game she even had a couple of chances 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.670
 win moms on my filing game her was 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.480
 22 so the game would be completely different 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.400
 I 'm glad that I could even 31 and from this 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.219
 moment i started more aggressive 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.930
 players and also played the second set I even 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.030
 I thought that maybe she flip 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.430
 once was very straight so cool and and 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.980
 not a lesson yes she won wimbledon 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.860
 whole and maybe many remember and and yet 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.160
 here is why what junior qa I got a 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.469
 I 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.860
 and I remember when she thinks I'm madonna 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.020
 played or me were very wonderful 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.559
 the results I think everything is especially running but 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.020
 they thought that she would be very good 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.449
 the player and us and it showed on this 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.589
 the tournament that she can she is there all different 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.309
 24 Well, I beat 2 ideas and the previous match 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.850
 also 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.720
 in good shape therefore such rivals 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.150
 very dangerous and because they 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.910
 There is such a situation and you know what 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.940
 would lose anything today and she even in 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.550
 late start to the grid often walk with 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.920
 filing is not when we are it not even 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.500
 we see therefore it is necessary well we must be very 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.050
 neatly still interesting that again and 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.220
 also Katya Makarova in the same circle as 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.780
 in that year the water so happened here 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.160
 a year has passed and we are in the same 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.500
 situations but still but i hope that 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.240
 I will be the same result but against 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.320
 she is also very hard to play mascara she 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.700
 lefty need to practice tomorrow 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.740
 train against lefties especially with 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.130
 poprinimat feed it to me a couple of swords 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.770
 will help but today she played great 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.660
 we beat Bartoli so I think with 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.840
 such confidence she will come to ours 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.840
 meeting
