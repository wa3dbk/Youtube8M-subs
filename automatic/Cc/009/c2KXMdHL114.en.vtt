00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
quit the game you exit out of it you're

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.129 
quit the game you exit out of it you're
going<00:02:33.819> to<00:02:33.879> have<00:02:33.969> those<00:02:34.150> like<00:02:34.299> large<00:02:34.840> app

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:35.139 
going to have those like large app

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:38.000 
going to have those like large app
running<00:02:35.500> in<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.739> background<00:02:35.859> but<00:02:36.819> no<00:02:36.939> reason

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
running in the background but no reason

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.559 
running in the background but no reason
so<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.549> task<00:02:39.730> manager<00:02:39.849> will<00:02:40.209> kill<00:02:40.420> it

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
so the task manager will kill it

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.349 
so the task manager will kill it
eventually<00:02:42.659> but<00:02:43.659> I<00:02:43.930> put<00:02:44.439> links<00:02:44.739> in<00:02:44.829> on<00:02:45.069> the<00:02:45.129> bar

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
eventually but I put links in on the bar

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.030 
eventually but I put links in on the bar
the<00:02:46.359> google<00:02:47.109> made<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.290> video<00:02:47.560> of<00:02:47.709> why<00:02:47.980> you

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
the google made a video of why you

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.879 
the google made a video of why you
really<00:02:48.400> don't<00:02:48.639> need<00:02:48.730> a<00:02:48.790> task<00:02:49.030> manager<00:02:49.419> but<00:02:49.889> on

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
really don't need a task manager but on

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.819 
really don't need a task manager but on
the<00:02:51.040> contrary<00:02:51.239> like<00:02:52.239> i<00:02:52.269> said<00:02:52.629> if<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:52.989> start<00:02:53.739> up

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
the contrary like i said if you start up

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.300 
the contrary like i said if you start up
a<00:02:53.950> ton<00:02:54.220> of<00:02:54.250> apps<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:56.590> will<00:02:56.739> notice<00:02:56.950> your

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
a ton of apps you will notice your

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.009 
a ton of apps you will notice your
performance<00:02:57.760> in<00:02:57.849> the<00:02:57.939> slower<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.780> can<00:02:58.930> even

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
performance in the slower you can even

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.559 
performance in the slower you can even
do<00:02:59.169> a<00:02:59.200> benchmark<00:02:59.829> which<00:03:00.040> doesn't<00:03:00.459> really

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
do a benchmark which doesn't really

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.970 
do a benchmark which doesn't really
relate<00:03:01.569> to<00:03:01.989> real<00:03:02.919> performance<00:03:04.230> but<00:03:05.230> you

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
relate to real performance but you

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.250 
relate to real performance but you
benchmark<00:03:06.609> scores<00:03:07.180> will<00:03:07.359> go<00:03:07.540> down<00:03:07.780> if<00:03:08.109> you

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
benchmark scores will go down if you

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.970 
benchmark scores will go down if you
start<00:03:08.500> out<00:03:08.590> more<00:03:08.769> applications<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:11.739> you<00:03:11.859> will

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
start out more applications and you will

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.970 
start out more applications and you will
notice<00:03:12.189> your<00:03:12.969> battery<00:03:13.659> life<00:03:13.719> well<00:03:14.260> lesson<00:03:14.650> as

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
restart your phone you can use the task

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.890 
restart your phone you can use the task
manager<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:37.090> kill<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.449> application<00:03:38.019> and

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
manager to kill the application and

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.699 
manager to kill the application and
short<00:03:40.900> test<00:03:41.739> managers<00:03:42.250> do<00:03:42.609> hope<00:03:43.409> it's<00:03:44.409> just

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
short test managers do hope it's just

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.460 
short test managers do hope it's just
how<00:03:45.099> you<00:03:45.159> use<00:03:45.609> them<00:03:45.819> they<00:03:46.599> can<00:03:46.780> also<00:03:46.900> hurt<00:03:47.259> you

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
how you use them they can also hurt you

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.009 
how you use them they can also hurt you
as<00:03:47.650> well<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:49.150> have<00:03:49.359> them<00:03:49.509> set<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:51.870> kill<00:03:52.870> your

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
as well you have them set to kill your

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.339 
as well you have them set to kill your
apps<00:03:53.169> at<00:03:53.739> large<00:03:54.069> intervals<00:03:54.639> or<00:03:54.909> not<00:03:55.750> even<00:03:56.109> all

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
apps at large intervals or not even all

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.039

just<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.709> have<00:03:56.889> it<00:03:56.919> have<00:03:57.430> it<00:03:57.459> there<00:03:57.879> so<00:03:58.509> you<00:03:58.870> can

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
just to have it have it there so you can

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.839 
just to have it have it there so you can
manually<00:03:59.319> kill<00:03:59.680> it<00:03:59.829> when<00:03:59.949> you<00:04:00.069> have<00:04:00.250> like<00:04:00.430> 20

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
manually kill it when you have like 20

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.319 
manually kill it when you have like 20
applications<00:04:01.209> open<00:04:01.569> even<00:04:02.439> like<00:04:02.970> once<00:04:03.970> a<00:04:04.150> day

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
applications open even like once a day

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.199 
applications open even like once a day
kill<00:04:04.720> it<00:04:04.870> or<00:04:05.079> so<00:04:05.949> I<00:04:06.009> thinner<00:04:06.189> overnight<00:04:06.909> have

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
kill it or so I thinner overnight have

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.110 
kill it or so I thinner overnight have
it<00:04:07.359> kill<00:04:07.599> your<00:04:07.989> apps<00:04:08.220> or<00:04:09.220> like<00:04:09.430> me<00:04:09.609> auto<00:04:09.849> kill

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
it kill your apps or like me auto kill

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.119 
it kill your apps or like me auto kill
you<00:04:10.359> can<00:04:10.509> set<00:04:10.750> it<00:04:10.870> to<00:04:10.900> like<00:04:11.049> 15<00:04:11.409> or<00:04:11.439> 30<00:04:11.769> minutes

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
you can set it to like 15 or 30 minutes

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.270 
you can set it to like 15 or 30 minutes
to<00:04:12.220> kill<00:04:13.139> if<00:04:14.139> you<00:04:14.290> want<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.799> keep<00:04:14.979> your<00:04:15.129> apps

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
to kill if you want to keep your apps

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.949 
to kill if you want to keep your apps
open<00:04:15.489> so<00:04:16.359> they<00:04:16.509> start<00:04:16.750> up<00:04:16.870> faster<00:04:17.729> but<00:04:18.729> in

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
open so they start up faster but in

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.260 
open so they start up faster but in
