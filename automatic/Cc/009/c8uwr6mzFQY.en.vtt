00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.440
 good to all the kids here greater and 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.340
 commenting and good today I bring you a 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.030
 gameplay 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:23.369
 what is a 30 and 32 or 33 3 if I do not remember 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.369
 bad and it's a battery game 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:33.560
 the triple and the ac 130 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.560
 good here at the beginning 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.170
 get on the car this and I do not get almost 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.340
 nothing 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.950
 and well I came to talk about 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.230
 that 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.720
 that 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.880
 I have respect to the guard 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.660
 I know that right now people prefer 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.660
 the coast 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.450
 the truth is also the 29 apart from 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.200
 by the rubÃ©n plant 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.360
 forget that 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.460
 it's a game that I do not like anything 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.430
 it will not know how it has warfare 3 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.750
 to kill and a little bit of everything I like 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.850
 much more 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.440
 also by weapons in warfare 3 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.070
 whether or not you want most of the weapons 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.830
 they kill on the other hand in the 22 because the 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.300
 percussions that the one that does not kill or that 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.300
 Front does not kill you or do anything 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.820
 the snipers we're going to give 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.420
 the list that only marquez does 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.420
 and also 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.899
 the units that have the search engine there 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.899
 of whites that looks like that 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.659
 cast 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.320
 but my mother, that is all there is 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.000
 a camper 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.000
 there is also water is part of the 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.630
 besides that the candle 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.970
 and well I do not know if you want me to decide 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.970
 a little in the comments and that 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.230
 what do you prefer I also have to save 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.230
 two 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.040
 then also surely 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.340
 as you know in uncharted goes with the 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:28.160
 s code that you can only take out 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.550
 the code that you have of the play in the 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.550
 account 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.580
 and we already have that 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.060
 one after another pass the charter tea and 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.720
 good 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.720
 neither 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.650
 Y 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.680
 Well, I also plan to go up 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:59.160
 and some like or something yes or do me 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.160
 a while to think about making contract 9 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.400
 9 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.740
 to a wing gun 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.520
 the best 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:18.910
 and also because I have thought 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.740
 ever competitive and that 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.740
 and well so I said was p 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.280
 and good to say a little in the comments 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.030
 if you want 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.030
 Thank you 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.360
 I saw that he liked a lot in the channel 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.060
 because 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.230
 good what 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.209
 from play four I do not know what to do 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:03.090
 you but I bought it four 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.510
 I probably bought it when I thought 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.510
 when 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.110
 because the first version never 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.660
 It is usually the best 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.080
 always get a first version that gives 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.080
 many problems 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:26.430
 and the heat, even if it's third 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.860
 surely what they had to do 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.090
 was 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.090
 the first for the movie 3 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.830
 it was finished 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:58.120
 you have seen that he only threw the rifles 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.120
 then of life 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.479
 units fasten 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.669
 good if you take me out 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.669
 but little more 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.350
 of the account of the thing I have very 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.350
 communities 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:29.820
 at the level that the exercise was explained 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.190
 22 what happened to me because I bought the 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.199
 back up 2 and then I went to the games 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:37.780
 of a little computer 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:39.250
 for a long time until a little 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.520
 of the computer good more than anything my 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.520
 computer 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:52.030
 and that during what I'm going to do is 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.030
 climb to the first prestige 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:58.350
 why 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.240
 because I do not know I do not feel like 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.740
 game but you know guys that has 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.180
