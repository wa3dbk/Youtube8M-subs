in<00:01:05.159> iphones<00:01:05.700> ipads<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.540> Apple<00:01:06.780> TV<00:01:07.049> into<00:01:07.260> one

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
in iphones ipads and Apple TV into one

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.840 
in iphones ipads and Apple TV into one
event<00:01:07.680> that's<00:01:08.070> going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.310> be<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> lot<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.610> stuff

I would love it but I think it might be
smarter<00:01:11.430> for<00:01:11.520> them<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.760> spread<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.119> out

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
smarter for them to spread it out

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.120 
smarter for them to spread it out
definitely<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:13.080> terms<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.470> some<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.799> specs
