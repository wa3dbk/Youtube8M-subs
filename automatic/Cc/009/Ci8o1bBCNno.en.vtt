00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
definitely worth picking up start the

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:37.360 
definitely worth picking up start the
beginning<00:04:35.630> I<00:04:35.960> think<00:04:36.199> this<00:04:36.620> so<00:04:36.830> if<00:04:37.010> you<00:04:37.130> are<00:04:37.220> not

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
beginning I think this so if you are not

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.790 
beginning I think this so if you are not
reading<00:04:37.580> it's<00:04:37.880> a<00:04:38.000> 2ft<00:04:38.780> a<00:04:38.960> numbers<00:04:39.470> and<00:04:39.590> fifty

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
reading it's a 2ft a numbers and fifty

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.689 
reading it's a 2ft a numbers and fifty
it<00:04:39.889> takes<00:04:40.039> place<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.340> sort<00:04:40.460> of<00:04:40.520> another

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
it takes place and sort of another

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.510 
it takes place and sort of another
dimension<00:04:41.539> where<00:04:42.169> there's<00:04:42.380> no<00:04:42.500> chicken<00:04:42.830> or

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
dimension where there's no chicken or

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.810 
dimension where there's no chicken or
well<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:44.690> this<00:04:45.350> the<00:04:45.590> main<00:04:45.770> character<00:04:46.250> can

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
well and this the main character can

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.840 
well and this the main character can
sort<00:04:47.479> of<00:04:47.570> solve<00:04:48.320> murders<00:04:48.680> by<00:04:48.889> eating<00:04:49.580> things

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
sort of solve murders by eating things

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.000 
sort of solve murders by eating things
but<00:04:50.660> what<00:04:50.810> I<00:04:50.840> really<00:04:51.139> like<00:04:51.350> about<00:04:51.380> this<00:04:51.770> is

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
but what I really like about this is

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.159 
but what I really like about this is
there's<00:04:52.669> always<00:04:53.000> a<00:04:53.030> couple<00:04:53.270> things<00:04:53.630> going<00:04:53.990> on

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.500 
there's always a couple things going on
it's<00:04:54.470> never<00:04:54.889> just<00:04:55.250> what<00:04:55.520> you<00:04:55.639> think<00:04:55.970> the

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
it's never just what you think the

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.170 
it's never just what you think the
writing<00:04:56.990> is<00:04:57.260> very<00:04:57.620> smart<00:04:58.220> very<00:04:58.310> funny<00:04:58.849> and

then<00:04:59.599> the<00:05:00.200> art<00:05:00.500> really<00:05:01.160> supports<00:05:01.520> it<00:05:01.669> but<00:05:01.700> it's

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
then the art really supports it but it's

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:03.850
