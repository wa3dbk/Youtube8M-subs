can see the GoPro is tilting but I want
to<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.299> concentrating<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.200> flying<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:11.040> don't

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
to be concentrating on flying I don't

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.410 
to be concentrating on flying I don't
want<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:11.670> concentrating<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.560> using<00:01:13.560> this

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
want to be concentrating on using this

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.990

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
knob here to control the tilt I want the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.910 
knob here to control the tilt I want the
person<00:01:18.210> on<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> telemetry<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.439> control<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
person on the telemetry to control the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.600 
person on the telemetry to control the
tilt<00:01:20.509> so<00:01:21.509> I'm<00:01:22.320> going<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.530> show<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.770> exactly

tilt so I'm going to show you exactly

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.580 
tilt so I'm going to show you exactly
how<00:01:23.900> this<00:01:24.900> works

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
how this works

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.080 
how this works
the<00:01:26.490> DX<00:01:26.909> 8<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.270> now<00:01:27.450> powered<00:01:27.900> up<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:29.000> what<00:01:30.000> I'm

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the DX 8 is now powered up and what I'm

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.550 
the DX 8 is now powered up and what I'm
gonna<00:01:30.210> do<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.540> I'm<00:01:30.659> gonna<00:01:30.720> flip<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.350> switch

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
gonna do is I'm gonna flip this switch

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.800 
gonna do is I'm gonna flip this switch
right<00:01:31.979> here<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:34.520> as<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:36.210> could<00:01:36.329> see<00:01:36.390> now

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
right here and as you could see now

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.840 
right here and as you could see now
using<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.829> D<00:01:37.979> X<00:01:38.130> 8<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:40.040> can<00:01:41.040> use<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.430> knob<00:01:41.729> so

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
using the D X 8 I can use this knob so

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.450 
using the D X 8 I can use this knob so
the<00:01:44.850> person<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.840> telemetry<00:01:46.259> can<00:01:47.070> be

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
the person on the telemetry can be

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.100 
the person on the telemetry can be
watching<00:01:47.700> where<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> craft<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.570> going<00:01:48.960> and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
watching where the craft is going and

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.160 
watching where the craft is going and
using<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.070> knob<00:01:50.369> on<00:01:50.700> their<00:01:51.210> own<00:01:51.360> radio<00:01:51.659> to

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
using this knob on their own radio to

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.200 
using this knob on their own radio to
tilt<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.740> H<00:01:53.009> 3<00:01:53.399> 2<00:01:53.729> D<00:01:53.939> gimbal

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.070 

the<00:01:59.130> whole<00:02:00.130> trick<00:02:00.640> to<00:02:00.940> getting<00:02:01.600> this<00:02:01.690> to<00:02:01.870> work

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
the whole trick to getting this to work

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.540 
the whole trick to getting this to work
is<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.730> wireless<00:02:03.730> buddy<00:02:04.450> box<00:02:04.750> feature<00:02:05.170> of<00:02:05.590> the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
is the wireless buddy box feature of the

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.770 
is the wireless buddy box feature of the
dx9<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:08.380> powering<00:02:09.040> it<00:02:09.160> up<00:02:09.280> I'm<00:02:10.180> going<00:02:10.570> to<00:02:10.630> show

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
dx9 so powering it up I'm going to show

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.250 
dx9 so powering it up I'm going to show
you<00:02:10.840> exactly<00:02:11.260> what<00:02:11.560> I<00:02:11.590> did

that allows you to do is that allows you
to<00:02:46.510> throw<00:02:47.040> features<00:02:48.040> over<00:02:48.459> to<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.700> slave<00:02:49.000> unit

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
to throw features over to the slave unit

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.120 
to throw features over to the slave unit
and<00:02:51.100> keep<00:02:51.730> all<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.240> main<00:02:52.440> features<00:02:53.440> here<00:02:53.950> in

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
and keep all the main features here in

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.790 
and keep all the main features here in
this<00:02:54.310> radio<00:02:54.730> so<00:02:55.720> as<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:56.050> could<00:02:56.200> see<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.590> top

it has all the programming for the spy

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.270 
it has all the programming for the spy
900<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:06.310> if<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.360> look<00:03:07.570> down<00:03:07.780> closely<00:03:08.470> all<00:03:09.250> I

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
900 and if you look down closely all I

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.860 
900 and if you look down closely all I
did<00:03:09.670> was<00:03:09.850> I<00:03:10.030> moved<00:03:10.440> auxilary<00:03:11.440> 3<00:03:12.360> by<00:03:13.360> pressing

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
did was I moved auxilary 3 by pressing

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.970 
did was I moved auxilary 3 by pressing
the<00:03:13.959> wheel<00:03:14.110> I<00:03:14.500> moved<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:15.100> up<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.580> slave<00:03:15.880> and

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
the wheel I moved it up to the slave and

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.490 
the wheel I moved it up to the slave and
then<00:03:17.980> what<00:03:18.459> I<00:03:18.489> did<00:03:18.610> was<00:03:18.790> I<00:03:19.330> went<00:03:19.930> down<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.380> the

then what I did was I went down to the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.060 
then what I did was I went down to the
switch<00:03:20.739> feature<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:22.870> just<00:03:23.200> enabled<00:03:23.650> switch

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
switch feature and I just enabled switch

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.370 
switch feature and I just enabled switch
this<00:03:24.519> switch<00:03:24.580> to<00:03:24.910> be<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.600> switch<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:26.140> send

this video is to show you that I used

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.400 
this video is to show you that I used
the<00:04:06.130> trainer<00:04:06.489> feature<00:04:06.880> to<00:04:07.570> send<00:04:07.840> this<00:04:08.139> knob

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
the trainer feature to send this knob

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.550 
the trainer feature to send this knob
which<00:04:08.859> is<00:04:08.980> on<00:04:09.130> aux<00:04:09.459> 3<00:04:09.670> over<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.209> my<00:04:10.329> DX<00:04:10.660> 8

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
which is on aux 3 over to my DX 8

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.620 
which is on aux 3 over to my DX 8
so<00:04:12.010> on<00:04:12.160> the<00:04:12.250> dx8<00:04:13.530> we<00:04:14.530> can<00:04:14.680> put<00:04:14.830> this<00:04:14.950> down<00:04:15.630> now

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
so on the dx8 we can put this down now

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.300 
so on the dx8 we can put this down now
if<00:04:16.750> you<00:04:16.870> take<00:04:17.019> a<00:04:17.079> look<00:04:17.290> over<00:04:17.410> here<00:04:17.530> on<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:17.920> dx8

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
if you take a look over here on the dx8

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.879 
if you take a look over here on the dx8
I'll<00:04:18.459> power<00:04:18.700> it<00:04:18.880> up<00:04:21.210> and<00:04:22.290> I<00:04:23.290> just<00:04:23.560> set<00:04:23.710> up<00:04:23.800> a

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
I'll power it up and I just set up a

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.090 
I'll power it up and I just set up a
simple<00:04:24.130> model<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.760> this<00:04:25.720> model<00:04:25.780> is<00:04:26.320> a<00:04:26.710> simple

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
simple model and this model is a simple

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.120 
simple model and this model is a simple
airplane<00:04:27.280> model<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:29.130> let's<00:04:30.130> just<00:04:31.889> I'll<00:04:32.889> show

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
airplane model and let's just I'll show

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:34.740 
airplane model and let's just I'll show
you<00:04:33.190> what<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.490> simple<00:04:33.790> model<00:04:34.150> feature<00:04:34.389> looks

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
you what the simple model feature looks

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.240 
you what the simple model feature looks
like<00:04:34.960> and<00:04:35.820> I'll<00:04:36.820> go<00:04:37.030> to<00:04:37.090> switch<00:04:37.389> select<00:04:37.840> and

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
like and I'll go to switch select and

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.930 
like and I'll go to switch select and
the<00:04:39.250> real<00:04:40.050> feature<00:04:41.050> or<00:04:41.440> issue<00:04:41.770> here<00:04:42.280> to<00:04:42.550> setup

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:42.940 
the real feature or issue here to setup

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.640 
the real feature or issue here to setup
is<00:04:43.300> on<00:04:43.570> the<00:04:44.140> knob<00:04:44.350> use<00:04:45.310> aux<00:04:45.820> 3<00:04:46.330> ok<00:04:47.169> so<00:04:47.230> that's

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
is on the knob use aux 3 ok so that's

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.510 
is on the knob use aux 3 ok so that's
important<00:04:48.220> and<00:04:49.560> then<00:04:50.560> I<00:04:50.590> just<00:04:50.890> bind<00:04:51.220> this

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
important and then I just bind this

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:58.590 
important and then I just bind this
model<00:04:53.820> to<00:04:54.820> my<00:04:55.300> dx9<00:04:55.930> and<00:04:57.270> that's<00:04:58.270> how<00:04:58.419> this

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
model to my dx9 and that's how this

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.440 
model to my dx9 and that's how this
works

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
works

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.030 
works
so<00:05:01.450> you're<00:05:01.630> using<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:02.080> training<00:05:02.350> feature<00:05:02.680> to

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
so you're using the training feature to

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.690 
so you're using the training feature to
send<00:05:03.280> aux<00:05:03.640> 3<00:05:04.090> over<00:05:04.600> to<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:04.870> knob<00:05:05.050> and<00:05:05.700> you

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
send aux 3 over to the knob and you

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.000 
send aux 3 over to the knob and you
could<00:05:06.850> take<00:05:07.030> a<00:05:07.060> look<00:05:07.240> at<00:05:07.360> the<00:05:07.570> you<00:05:08.260> go<00:05:08.800> over

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
could take a look at the you go over

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.529 
to the dx9 a channel but when I flipped
the<00:05:30.820> switch<00:05:31.860> ok<00:05:32.860> now<00:05:33.250> I<00:05:33.310> go<00:05:33.669> over<00:05:33.850> to<00:05:33.970> the<00:05:34.090> dx8
