all that proves a lot of this in his
book<00:00:06.299> we<00:00:06.540> think<00:00:06.779> we're<00:00:06.899> getting<00:00:07.020> energy

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
book we think we're getting energy

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.400 
book we think we're getting energy
through<00:00:08.179> through<00:00:09.179> through<00:00:09.510> calories<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.349> all

through through through calories and all

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.900 
through through through calories and all
those<00:00:10.500> other<00:00:10.679> stuff<00:00:10.889> there's<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.580> big

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
those other stuff there's a big

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.549 
those other stuff there's a big
difference<00:00:12.269> between<00:00:12.809> energy<00:00:13.290> and

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
difference between energy and

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.450 
difference between energy and
stimulation<00:00:14.960> big<00:00:15.960> difference<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:17.250> can<00:00:17.369> be

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
stimulation big difference you can be

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.370 
stimulation big difference you can be
stimulated<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:18.119> have<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.330> lot<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.570> false<00:00:18.930> energy

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
stimulated to have a lot of false energy

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.779 
stimulated to have a lot of false energy
for<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> little<00:00:19.740> while<00:00:19.949> but<00:00:20.490> it's<00:00:20.609> going<00:00:20.730> to

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
for a little while but it's going to

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.179 
for a little while but it's going to
catch<00:00:20.910> up<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.420> but<00:00:22.380> true<00:00:22.619> energy<00:00:22.830> is

catch up to you but true energy is

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.800 
catch up to you but true energy is
something's<00:00:23.580> going<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.730> last<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.570> have

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
something's going to last and you have

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.580 
something's going to last and you have
control<00:00:25.170> over<00:00:26.990> big<00:00:27.990> difference<00:00:28.439> and

control over big difference and

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.849 
control over big difference and
stimulation<00:00:29.460> will<00:00:29.789> equal<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.859> obstruction

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
stimulation will equal the obstruction

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.799 
stimulation will equal the obstruction
where<00:00:32.489> true<00:00:32.700> energy<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.180> going<00:00:33.360> to<00:00:33.420> keep<00:00:33.660> the

obstruction<00:00:38.820> equals<00:00:39.270> vitality<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.590> we<00:00:40.739> look

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
obstruction equals vitality so we look

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.530 
obstruction equals vitality so we look
at<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> diet<00:00:41.340> standpoint<00:00:42.000> we<00:00:42.120> look<00:00:42.270> at<00:00:42.390> this

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
at a diet standpoint we look at this

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.810 
at a diet standpoint we look at this
what's<00:00:43.290> creating<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.100> problem<00:00:44.489> why<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.670> we

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
what's creating this problem why do we

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.790 
what's creating this problem why do we
overeat<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.270> begin<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.950> food<00:00:46.950> has<00:00:47.520> nutrients

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
overeat to begin with food has nutrients

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.160 
overeat to begin with food has nutrients
food<00:00:49.800> has<00:00:50.100> enzymes<00:00:50.430> have<00:00:51.270> minerals<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.020> has

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
food has enzymes have minerals that has

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.100 
food has enzymes have minerals that has
vitamins<00:00:52.710> that's<00:00:53.100> what<00:00:53.550> food<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:54.600> use<00:00:54.870> our

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
vitamins that's what food is we use our

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.270 
vitamins that's what food is we use our
food<00:00:55.410> or<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.890> should<00:00:56.129> be<00:00:56.280> using<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.730> food<00:00:58.280> for

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
food or we should be using that food for

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.819 
food or we should be using that food for
to<00:00:59.879> prevent<00:01:00.239> starvation<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.649> give

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
to prevent starvation and to give

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.050 
to prevent starvation and to give
ourselves<00:01:02.010> what<00:01:02.520> we<00:01:02.550> need<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.120> keep<00:01:04.110> our<00:01:05.060> power

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
ourselves what we need to keep our power

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.840 
ourselves what we need to keep our power
supply<00:01:06.540> up<00:01:06.720> or<00:01:06.900> energy<00:01:07.290> up<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:08.400> these<00:01:08.610> are<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
supply up or energy up so these are the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.310 
supply up or energy up so these are the
two<00:01:09.060> main<00:01:09.240> reasons<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.930> then<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.170> third

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
two main reasons and then the third

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.830 
two main reasons and then the third
reason<00:01:10.530> most<00:01:10.770> people<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.280> pleasure<00:01:11.840> and

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
reason most people it is pleasure and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.160 
reason most people it is pleasure and
this<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> big<00:01:13.380> problem<00:01:14.509> it's<00:01:15.509> not<00:01:15.780> about

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
this is the big problem it's not about

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.840 
this is the big problem it's not about
how<00:01:16.470> much<00:01:16.710> food<00:01:17.009> you're<00:01:17.159> eating<00:01:17.369> when<00:01:17.759> it

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
how much food you're eating when it

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.160 
how much food you're eating when it
comes<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.210> health<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.659> about<00:01:18.840> how<00:01:18.990> much

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
comes to health it's about how much

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.620 
comes to health it's about how much
nutrients<00:01:19.740> your<00:01:19.830> body<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.220> getting<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.790> if

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
nutrients your body is getting and if
