00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.960 
yours got shipped the way it did I would
definitely<00:02:30.270> recommend<00:02:31.430> complaining<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.820> them

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
definitely recommend complaining to them

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.870 
definitely recommend complaining to them
especially<00:02:33.209> since<00:02:33.810> what<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.230> ordered<00:02:34.560> was

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
especially since what you ordered was

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.850 
especially since what you ordered was
wasn't<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:36.090> full-priced<00:02:36.630> album<00:02:37.170> when<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.500> would

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
wasn't a full-priced album when I would

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.110 
wasn't a full-priced album when I would
i<00:02:37.890> originally<00:02:38.280> ordered<00:02:38.490> that<00:02:38.670> was<00:02:38.790> packaged

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
i originally ordered that was packaged

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.790 
i originally ordered that was packaged
incorrectly<00:02:39.510> was<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.900> clearance<00:02:40.350> album<00:02:40.650> anyway

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
incorrectly was a clearance album anyway

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.770 
incorrectly was a clearance album anyway
it<00:02:41.130> was<00:02:41.250> only<00:02:41.430> like<00:02:41.670> five<00:02:41.940> dollars<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:42.660> it

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
it was only like five dollars so it

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.050 
it was only like five dollars so it
wasn't<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.350> big<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.010> deal<00:02:44.280> wasn't<00:02:44.610> that<00:02:44.820> badly

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
wasn't that big a deal wasn't that badly

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.509 
wasn't that big a deal wasn't that badly
damaged<00:02:45.600> but<00:02:46.500> i<00:02:46.560> would<00:02:46.830> definitely<00:02:47.040> complain

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
damaged but i would definitely complain

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.910

send you another one or give you back
some<00:02:52.260> of<00:02:52.500> them<00:02:52.680> some<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.220> money<00:02:53.370> on<00:02:53.640> that

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
some of them some of the money on that

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.750 
some of them some of the money on that
but<00:02:55.440> i<00:02:55.590> just<00:02:55.769> want<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.010> say<00:02:56.190> that<00:02:56.400> I've<00:02:56.489> had

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
but i just want to say that I've had

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.970 
but i just want to say that I've had
I've<00:02:57.030> had<00:02:57.180> good<00:02:57.540> experiences<00:02:58.170> ever<00:02:58.560> since

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
I've had good experiences ever since

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.680 
I've had good experiences ever since
that<00:02:59.040> first<00:02:59.459> one<00:02:59.730> bad<00:02:59.970> experience<00:03:00.000> I've<00:03:00.660> had

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
that first one bad experience I've had

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.490 
that first one bad experience I've had
so<00:03:01.940> your<00:03:02.940> mileage<00:03:03.090> may<00:03:03.300> vary<00:03:03.450> but<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:04.140> think<00:03:04.380> for

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
so your mileage may vary but I think for

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.000 
so your mileage may vary but I think for
the<00:03:04.590> most<00:03:04.769> part<00:03:04.860> amazon<00:03:05.459> is<00:03:05.880> getting<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.510> and

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
the most part amazon is getting it and

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.470 
the most part amazon is getting it and
maybe<00:03:08.010> there's<00:03:08.250> just<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.519> few<00:03:08.550> bad<00:03:08.880> apples<00:03:09.120> here

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
maybe there's just a few bad apples here

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.610 
maybe there's just a few bad apples here
and<00:03:09.630> there<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.900> still<00:03:09.989> don't<00:03:10.230> know<00:03:10.440> how<00:03:10.560> to

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
and there that still don't know how to

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.100 
and there that still don't know how to
package<00:03:10.860> records<00:03:11.340> with<00:03:11.459> them<00:03:11.750> so<00:03:12.750> anyway

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
package records with them so anyway

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.390 
package records with them so anyway
that's<00:03:13.260> it<00:03:13.500> just<00:03:13.680> want<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.920> do<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.040> quick<00:03:14.190> update

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
that's it just want to do a quick update

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.790
