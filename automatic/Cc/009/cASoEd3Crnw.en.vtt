00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 and here but men as they are I hope 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.230
 that they are very, very good because I am 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.090
 very happy with loans in a new 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.309
 mini tutorial very special because in 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.530
 this time I will show you how to make a 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.199
 mini farm totally fishing 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.600
 fully automatic here and it is 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.029
 Much love this farm as you can see it is 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.970
 quite small and is different from what 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.070
 I've seen on many fishing farms and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.369
 well something else I do more than all this 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.920
 this mechanism because the one I had in 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.350
 the other minutes and it's good for us 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.680
 for this beautiful 1.8 in which we are 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.690
 so that because this farm is 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.820
 love because it is very easy to use and 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.829
 because it has a very good efficiency and 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.210
 obviously there are many better ones 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.100
 farms but because of the size it has 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.140
 this and for the efficiency that you can 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.840
 take off while being pick at a time 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.640
 which is pure love because among more reeds 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.660
 have that is the limit that this 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.609
 fish market if you get it there are 400 caÃ±as or 300 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.140
 reeds you will have to fish 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.239
 then it does is simply by 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.400
 here you close because you will be at efe 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.480
 here then you fill your inventory 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.390
 of 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:14.840
 you want and basically we start ay 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:17.050
 start working here look there is 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.650
 Let's see 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.650
 you know 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.600
 and there it is 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.330
 As you can see there, the farm is no longer 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.060
 make sound then here the farm will 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.950
 is fishing is doing its work 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.110
 now because you see the animation so 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.790
 It's rare but each other is not being 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.220
 your nest the farm that you are fishing 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.860
 obviously in aipe is that a fish 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.420
 you saw it then on the farm 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.460
 It will have a higher efficiency if 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.010
 you occupy a reed for like being that 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.380
 is in luck with marine luck 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.750
 then the time that can be greater then 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.580
 you can leave about 10 hours and I 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.410
 I think this trunk if you fill it in 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.540
 many different things but if you 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.790
 full now yes this chest you fill it 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.340
 with reeds like that when you wear the 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.789
 farm 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.799
 the bytes and then you here you can put 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.849
 the reeds that you want the amount of 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.739
 reeds as I told you 400 thousand 12 and that's going to 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.030
 be the limit that this farm has as 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.849
 can see does not have any kind of 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.530
 mechanism limit or anything and the time that 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.810
 cure but it 's pure love is orange 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.150
 You can stay here as long as you 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.400
 want how many more fishing rods 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.400
 So you have more time but I really 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.920
 I think one night you get a lot of name 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.870
 tags a lot of food a lot of everything 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.430
 enchanted books then then nothing 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.230
 before I continue I like to say that 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.690
 see the original tutorial is in 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.579
 English go to see him and give him a fucking 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.069
 like because he deserves it then 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:45.019
 nothing we will see how it is done very well 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.420
 let's start by placing two propers 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.670
 here one down one up 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.530
 then we will place a chest of this 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.720
 way later we are going to do here the 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.879
 holes we are going to place a hopper that 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.470
 is connected to this broker and other 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.840
 hopper that is connected to this 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.150
 hopper we will place two chests here 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.220
 then we are going to put a carpet 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.400
 the color you want after we go to 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.349
 place two hoppers in this way 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.180
 is connected to this chest and is 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.790
 with hopper is connected to this 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.129
 hopper after we are going to place here the 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.640
 stone fence after we are going to place 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:21.170
 here two blocks worth you can remove 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.140
 work if you want or you can 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.670
 leave after we are going to place here 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.920
 something like that is perfect after we place 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.860
 an iron trapdoor there is 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.600
 perfectly and then we put two of 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.370
 glass on each side can be the color 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.959
 that you want and put we are going to 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.180
 continue very well let's continue 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.490
 putting three blocks in this way by 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.010
 here after we are going to put here two 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.290
 hooks after one of this thread 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.630
 way to connect and then here 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.820
 let's put a pressure plate of 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.040
 stone then then nothing we are going to 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.560
 continue very well we continue and we are going to 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.510
 place here a block we will place 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.850
 around here a reds torch where after 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.400
 let's place once redstone a 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.260
 block here a re peter with three 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.200
 clicks it is very important that you are like this 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.180
 then we are going to place here 8 block a 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.310
 little more of networks with then here up 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.100
 another little bit more of network this we are going to 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.070
 place a block here plus redstone 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.680
 we are going to place here another block 2 of 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.900
 rest more let's put another block here 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.530
 we are going to place a re peter without any 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.840
 type and then we place 3 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.270
 and in this way, we are almost done 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.010
 so then let's continue well 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.840
 let's finish with the mechanism then 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.540
 Well, what are we going to do? 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.550
 here one of the redstone then here a 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.130
 repeat with three ticks equal very 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.250
 important a solid block of what you 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:49.250
 you want to place here eight of 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.530
 redstone and you're going to remove all this here 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.200
 there is no fear then we go to 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:56.300
 place here a repeat then here a 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.820
 solid block after here one of the 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.740
 redstone and here another solid block this 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.990
 If you want, you can cover it or 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.940
 you can leave like this then then nothing 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.919
 now we are going to end up on the farm 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.930
 well to finish we'll put a 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.330
 lever and to pay or light the 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.800
 mechanism when you want later on in 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.570
 the case that the solid block that 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.160
 you have chosen to have stairs for some 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.380
 take them out that will look pretty good 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.169
 We are going to place two item frames here 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.150
 to indicate which chest has to things 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.590
 on this side will go what you get 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.169
 can be fish name tags 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.210
 enchantments many things and here the 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.220
 fishing rods 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.250
 a door you get through here you can 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.710
 choose the one you want later here 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.860
 you are going to put in this block where 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.380
 from the stone fence you will place a 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.630
 block of water there is and now if this 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.550
 farm would be finished then they 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.470
 I will explain how it works 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.660
 they work very very well then we are going to 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:52.639
 get many reeds there is with 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.800
 these are enough then good what 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.470
 you are going to do you are going to put all in this 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.910
 chest is perfectly fine after you go 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.190
 to fill with what you want 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.690
 the inventory can be items blocks what 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.789
 that you want does not necessarily have 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.949
 that being wood there is this is so that 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:09.590
 so that once we are inside and 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:12.229
 let's close the door we only spend the 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.539
 cane that is in our hand and when 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.250
 we presented this mechanism as they can 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:18.800
 see us going to start throwing here the 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.960
 reeds that are going to go to this chest and that 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.659
 it's going to be an infinite loop until we 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.970
 let's spend all the rods and that takes 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:27.800
 much now to fish the only thing that 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.500
 you have to do is fix more or less the 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.780
 point to see if I succeed 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.530
 It costs work there at first there 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.000
 is 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.520
 when the farm stops making sound 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.930
 As you can already see, the 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.000
 farm is fishing right now I 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.340
 I'm fishing no no, it does not look like it 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.870
 fishing but I'm fishing now 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.340
 Efficiency will vary depends on the 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.350
 cane that occupies center better be the 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.660
 enchantment more efficiency made more 

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:52.670
 time as many fish and 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.480
 all that you are going to have is very good 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.640
 orange because it 's totally 

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.740
 building you do not need to do anything else 

00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.050
 the farm and is working when it 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.060
 I have finished cane is selected 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.360
 will automatically put another and so 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.040
 until all of them are over then I 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:09.620
 truth with count now you can already 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.870
 I like very much work this is 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.630
 this farm is very very easy to make 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:17.000
 they do a few minutes and then nothing 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.820
 this epic return of the ministerials 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.220
 and the tutorials, we're going for 200 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.560
 likes 200 likes is a quantity of 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.180
 men of gentlemen then nothing 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.680
 thank you very much for watching 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.390
 this mini tutorial you already know that if you 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.460
 liked you can leave a like so comment 

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.910
 what did you think about it and well, nothing we see in 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:36.540
 the next video so 

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.540
 bye
