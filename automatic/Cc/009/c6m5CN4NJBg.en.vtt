00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.550 

well<00:00:01.469> hello<00:00:01.740> so<00:00:02.520> I<00:00:02.879> finally<00:00:03.360> got<00:00:03.689> my<00:00:04.020> flip

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
well hello so I finally got my flip

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.360 
well hello so I finally got my flip
Video<00:00:05.220> camcorder<00:00:06.029> so<00:00:06.899> now<00:00:07.319> I<00:00:07.350> can<00:00:07.890> start<00:00:08.099> doing

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
Video camcorder so now I can start doing

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.629 
Video camcorder so now I can start doing
videos<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:09.570> thought<00:00:10.410> that<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:11.070> would<00:00:11.340> start

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
videos and I thought that I would start

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.350 
videos and I thought that I would start
with<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:12.469> first<00:00:13.469> video<00:00:14.400> talking<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.240> little

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
with the first video talking a little

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.630 
with the first video talking a little
bit<00:00:15.509> about<00:00:15.630> something<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.350> has<00:00:16.980> been<00:00:17.010> coming

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
bit about something that has been coming

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.599 
bit about something that has been coming
up<00:00:17.880> on<00:00:18.510> some<00:00:18.869> raw<00:00:19.050> forums<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.279> I've<00:00:20.460> been

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
up on some raw forums that I've been

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.689 
up on some raw forums that I've been
noticing<00:00:20.789> not<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:21.510> much<00:00:21.660> on<00:00:21.869> ours<00:00:22.080> but<00:00:23.039> on<00:00:23.369> some

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
noticing not so much on ours but on some

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.320 
noticing not so much on ours but on some
other<00:00:23.850> ones<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.480> it's<00:00:24.990> about<00:00:25.970> bone<00:00:26.970> health

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
other ones and it's about bone health

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.950 
other ones and it's about bone health
and<00:00:27.710> teeth<00:00:28.710> health<00:00:29.660> something<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.750> lot<00:00:30.900> of

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
and teeth health something a lot of

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.170 
and teeth health something a lot of
people<00:00:31.109> are<00:00:31.650> really<00:00:31.890> really<00:00:32.250> concerned<00:00:32.910> about

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
people are really really concerned about

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.780 
people are really really concerned about
and<00:00:34.790> interestingly<00:00:35.790> enough<00:00:36.300> some<00:00:36.630> long-term

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
and interestingly enough some long-term

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.700 
and interestingly enough some long-term
raw<00:00:38.790> foodists<00:00:39.510> have<00:00:39.719> been<00:00:39.899> coming<00:00:40.290> down<00:00:40.320> with

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
raw foodists have been coming down with

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.830 
raw foodists have been coming down with
osteoporosis<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.879> lot<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.120> raw<00:00:42.420> foodists

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
osteoporosis and a lot of raw foodists

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.229 
osteoporosis and a lot of raw foodists
have<00:00:42.960> been<00:00:43.190> complaining<00:00:44.190> about<00:00:44.340> having<00:00:44.879> teeth

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
have been complaining about having teeth

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.690 
have been complaining about having teeth
issues<00:00:45.620> so<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.980> thought<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.280> would<00:00:47.520> talk<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
issues so I thought I would talk a

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.000 
issues so I thought I would talk a
little<00:00:48.000> bit<00:00:48.180> about<00:00:48.210> how<00:00:48.840> important<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.739> for

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
little bit about how important it is for

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.209 
little bit about how important it is for
us<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:51.329> predominant<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.410> our<00:00:52.620> alkaline

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
us to be predominant in our alkaline

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.920 
us to be predominant in our alkaline
minerals<00:00:53.670> because<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.180> know<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.360> our<00:00:54.539> teeth

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
minerals because we know that our teeth

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.990 
minerals because we know that our teeth
and<00:00:55.379> our<00:00:55.530> bones<00:00:55.739> are<00:00:55.980> made<00:00:56.100> primarily<00:00:56.280> of

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
and our bones are made primarily of

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.340 
and our bones are made primarily of
calcium<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.969> they're<00:01:00.020> also<00:01:01.020> made<00:01:01.199> of

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
calcium and they're also made of

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.690 
calcium and they're also made of
phosphorus<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:03.000> less<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.530> if<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.250> if

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
phosphorus but less so and if that if

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.350 
phosphorus but less so and if that if
our<00:01:06.630> blood<00:01:06.900> chemistry<00:01:07.770> our<00:01:08.580> body<00:01:08.850> always

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
our blood chemistry our body always

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.030 
our blood chemistry our body always
maintains<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.700> homeostasis<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:12.470> 7.5<00:01:13.470> which<00:01:13.860> is

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
maintains a homeostasis of 7.5 which is

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.760 
maintains a homeostasis of 7.5 which is
slightly<00:01:14.280> alkaline<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.380> that<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.530> so

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
slightly alkaline and that is so

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.210 
slightly alkaline and that is so
important<00:01:17.400> for<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.090> maintain<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:19.220> narrow

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
important for it to maintain that narrow

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.920 
important for it to maintain that narrow
range<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.970> alkalinity<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:22.259> if<00:01:22.470> we<00:01:22.920> take<00:01:23.189> in

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
range of alkalinity that if we take in

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.260 
range of alkalinity that if we take in
acidic<00:01:25.580> amino<00:01:26.580> acids<00:01:27.540> or<00:01:27.780> acidic<00:01:28.350> acids<00:01:29.270> and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
acidic amino acids or acidic acids and

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.620 
acidic amino acids or acidic acids and
and<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:30.869> enough<00:01:31.259> alkaline<00:01:31.829> minerals<00:01:32.630> our

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
and not enough alkaline minerals our

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.800 
and not enough alkaline minerals our
body<00:01:33.930> pulls<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:35.040> from<00:01:35.610> our<00:01:35.790> own<00:01:35.820> skeletal

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
body pulls it from our own skeletal

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.069 
body pulls it from our own skeletal
structure<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.770> order<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.579> neutralize<00:01:39.479> and

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
structure in order to neutralize and

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.609 
structure in order to neutralize and
buffer<00:01:40.409> those<00:01:40.560> acids<00:01:41.570> not<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.630> good<00:01:42.930> thing<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.590> I

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
buffer those acids not a good thing so I

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.200 
buffer those acids not a good thing so I
thought<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.100> would<00:01:44.280> do<00:01:44.369> kind<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.790> little<00:01:45.030> bit

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
thought we would do kind of a little bit

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.499 
thought we would do kind of a little bit
of<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.649> chemistry<00:01:46.649> lesson<00:01:47.030> those<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.390> in

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
of a chemistry lesson those of you in

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.670 
of a chemistry lesson those of you in
the<00:01:48.600> United<00:01:48.869> States<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.229> don't<00:01:49.380> know<00:01:49.500> if<00:01:49.590> you

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
the United States I don't know if you

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.710 
the United States I don't know if you
have<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.430> Australia<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.270> other<00:01:51.390> parts

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
have this in Australia and other parts

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.109 
have this in Australia and other parts
of<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.869> UK<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.860> Europe<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.399> there's<00:01:54.060> a

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
of the UK and in Europe but there's a

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.310 
of the UK and in Europe but there's a
product<00:01:54.420> called<00:01:54.600> lime<00:01:55.200> away<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:57.060> is

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
product called lime away and it is

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.350 
product called lime away and it is
designed<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.649> dissolve<00:01:59.030> hard<00:02:00.030> water<00:02:00.240> deposits

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
designed to dissolve hard water deposits

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.840 
designed to dissolve hard water deposits
that<00:02:01.079> get<00:02:01.259> on<00:02:01.469> your<00:02:01.530> sink<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.369> on<00:02:02.520> your<00:02:02.670> shower

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that get on your sink and on your shower

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.380 
that get on your sink and on your shower
door<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.659> type<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.930> thing<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.939> lime<00:02:05.939> is

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
door and that type of thing and lime is

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.230 
door and that type of thing and lime is
basically

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
basically

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.630 
basically
it's<00:02:07.780> it's<00:02:08.200> calcium<00:02:08.740> found<00:02:09.130> in<00:02:09.340> your<00:02:09.459> water

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
it's it's calcium found in your water

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.080 
it's it's calcium found in your water
and<00:02:09.940> then<00:02:10.630> rust<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:11.770> is<00:02:11.980> basically<00:02:12.400> oxidized

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
and then rust it is basically oxidized

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.640 
and then rust it is basically oxidized
iron<00:02:13.330> which<00:02:13.810> both<00:02:14.260> calcium<00:02:14.530> and<00:02:15.100> iron<00:02:15.400> are

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
iron which both calcium and iron are

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.400 
iron which both calcium and iron are
alkaline<00:02:17.650> minerals<00:02:18.040> so<00:02:19.030> interestingly<00:02:19.690> the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
alkaline minerals so interestingly the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.680 
alkaline minerals so interestingly the
active<00:02:20.920> ingredient<00:02:21.550> in<00:02:21.700> this<00:02:21.850> is<00:02:22.090> sulfuric

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
active ingredient in this is sulfuric

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.280 
active ingredient in this is sulfuric
acid

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
acid

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.140

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
particular bones let's say I do a bicep

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.090 
particular bones let's say I do a bicep
curl<00:05:25.680> that<00:05:26.580> particular<00:05:27.530> bone<00:05:28.530> that<00:05:28.890> that

curl that particular bone that that

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.430 
curl that particular bone that that
muscle<00:05:29.790> is<00:05:29.880> attached<00:05:30.210> to<00:05:30.390> will<00:05:30.960> then

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
muscle is attached to will then

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.250 
muscle is attached to will then
strengthen<00:05:32.250> that<00:05:32.460> particular<00:05:33.030> bone<00:05:33.240> so<00:05:33.990> doing

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
strengthen that particular bone so doing

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.480 
strengthen that particular bone so doing
weight<00:05:34.410> training<00:05:34.740> is<00:05:34.920> going<00:05:35.070> to<00:05:35.160> be<00:05:35.250> really
