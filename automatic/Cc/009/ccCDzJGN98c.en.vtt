00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:08.019
 his bunker class is very good for her. 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.019
 skin to skin and in note 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:35.090
 very well here we have a vision 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.730
 of the central nervous system 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.210
 at the top we have the brain 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.010
 cerebellum the brain stem and the medulla 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.010
 nervous system inside the spine 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.629
 when we get on that first button 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:55.129
 We'll see a detail of the region. 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:58.220
 lumbar but here the skin here column 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.769
 vertebral in blue the membranes that 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.640
 involve the nervous system and in gray 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:07.880
 lumbar and end of the spinal cord 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.470
 called the neural tube defects 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:15.890
 which mainly occurs the fault in the 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.729
 formation of the back of the bones of the 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.280
 column 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.340
 this will cause a shift in 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.900
 various degrees of channel content 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.420
 and we will see how this occurs and 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:35.030
 what are the names of the different 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:37.040
 degrees well into the hidden spina bifida 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.180
 which is the lightest degree 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.180
 see what happens when training fails 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.820
 bone that causes a reaction 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.150
 membranes that surround the nervous system 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:53.270
 externally we can have a signal 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:56.540
 an indirect collection as a collection of hairs 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.570
 small cutaneous scar looks set 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.990
 in the spina bifida hides the medulla 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.870
 nervousness continues at your site 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:10.340
 operating without changes 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:16.910
 baby already in meningo is c l a degree more 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:19.530
 of the inaction of membranes 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.680
 they end up being Iranian and in a more 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:27.810
 intense and even 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:32.430
 external visualization of this immense note 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:35.400
 although the nervous system constituted 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.890
 fear continues in its place without 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.370
 therefore cause changes in the 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.580
 neurological in my language follows with a 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.570
 most serious degree of this reaction 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.570
 see what happens 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.959
 the girls of the week to project 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.040
 externally 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:59.570
 often even without skin coverage 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:04.070
 and the nervous system is also designed 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:07.500
 beyond its normal location and in 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:11.400
 consequence the back part to the 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:15.150
 lower body will suffer from deficits 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.980
 neurological type engines sites 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.280
 let's make a comparison again 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.340
 between these three degrees of bad 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.230
 spine formation 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.350
 here the normal with the back 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.110
 normally formed our part 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.650
 of the vertebral column and here the 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.900
 comparison of spina bifida conceals a 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.530
 lightweight unchanged 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.269
 Neurological or you're a reaction 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.480
 even more intense 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:49.620
 but still with the neurological part 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:54.690
 preserved and in the aml Sunday series a and 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:57.720
 much more intense action with the meninges 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.140
 often exposed to the outside and a 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.299
 displacement of the nervous part 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.380
 causing motor and sensory deficit in the 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.380
 lower body 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.379
 it's the leg in the wood 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:35.570
 Hi, my name is quoted now, I was going to roll.
