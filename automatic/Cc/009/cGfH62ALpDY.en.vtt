00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hi I'm Ellie from Gilbert table tennis

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.160 
hi I'm Ellie from Gilbert table tennis
center<00:00:02.939> and<00:00:03.120> today<00:00:03.330> I'm<00:00:03.570> going<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.929> tell<00:00:04.140> you

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
center and today I'm going to tell you

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.880 
center and today I'm going to tell you
about<00:00:04.520> basic<00:00:05.520> strokes<00:00:05.850> in<00:00:06.089> table<00:00:06.629> tennis<00:00:06.890> so

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
about basic strokes in table tennis so

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.890 
about basic strokes in table tennis so
on<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.250> backhand<00:00:08.580> side<00:00:08.820> we<00:00:09.090> have<00:00:09.120> backhand

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
on the backhand side we have backhand

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.220 
on the backhand side we have backhand
push<00:00:10.139> which<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.309> which<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.269> produces<00:00:12.960> back

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
push which is which is produces back

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.099 
push which is which is produces back
backspin<00:00:14.099> so<00:00:14.940> that's<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.330> stroke<00:00:15.599> with<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
backspin so that's the stroke with the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.099 
backspin so that's the stroke with the
back<00:00:16.320> back<00:00:17.220> spin<00:00:17.580> or<00:00:17.760> under<00:00:18.210> spin<00:00:18.480> as<00:00:18.660> we<00:00:18.840> call

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
back back spin or under spin as we call

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.010 
back back spin or under spin as we call
so<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.160> back<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.550> push<00:00:20.820> are<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.779> pretty

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
so in the back and push are you pretty

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.769 
so in the back and push are you pretty
much<00:00:22.109> just<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:23.400> know<00:00:23.550> brushing<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.600> ball

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
much just you know brushing the ball

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.960 
much just you know brushing the ball
trying<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.289> spin<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:26.039> way<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.519> racket

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
trying to spin it this way on the racket

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.410 
trying to spin it this way on the racket
right<00:00:27.840> here<00:00:28.289> just<00:00:29.010> spin<00:00:29.340> through<00:00:32.120> this<00:00:33.120> way

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
right here just spin through this way

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.600 
right here just spin through this way
and<00:00:34.410> try<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.399> keep<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.850> low<00:00:36.059> above<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.079> net

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.049 

this<00:00:41.610> way<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:43.040> then<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.309> backhand<00:00:44.730> drive

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
this way and then on the backhand drive

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.330 
this way and then on the backhand drive
it's<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:46.050> shot<00:00:46.289> with<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.789> topspin<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:50.160> over

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
it's the shot with a topspin so over

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.360 
it's the shot with a topspin so over
here<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:54.530> catching<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> ball<00:00:55.770> at<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.070> top<00:00:56.340> of

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
here you catching the ball at the top of

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.010 
here you catching the ball at the top of
the<00:00:56.610> bounds<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.870> hit<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.199> ball<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:59.809> then<00:01:00.809> you

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
the bounds to hit the ball and then you

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.910 
the bounds to hit the ball and then you
use<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.379> your<00:01:01.410> wrist<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.359> follow<00:01:03.359> through

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
use in your wrist and follow through

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.230 
use in your wrist and follow through
pick<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.040> ball<00:01:05.220> up<00:01:05.250> at<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.729> top<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
pick the ball up at the top of the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.600 
pick the ball up at the top of the
bounds<00:01:06.659> right<00:01:07.320> here<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.830> keeping<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.310> racket

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
bounds right here and keeping the racket

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.850 
bounds right here and keeping the racket
closed<00:01:08.909> try<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.720> push<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.380> ball<00:01:10.530> through

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
closed try to push the ball through

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.260 
closed try to push the ball through
forward<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:12.560> follow<00:01:13.560> through<00:01:14.330> with<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.390> ball

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
forward and follow through with a ball

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.030 
forward and follow through with a ball
so<00:01:18.270> that's<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.570> shot<00:01:18.840> which<00:01:19.140> produces<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
so that's the shot which produces the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.300 
so that's the shot which produces the
topspin<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.060> ball<00:01:21.710> so<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
topspin for the ball so that is on the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.880 
topspin for the ball so that is on the
backhand<00:01:23.729> side<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.390> then<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> forehand

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
backhand side and then on the forehand

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.960 
backhand side and then on the forehand
side<00:01:26.130> we<00:01:26.400> have<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:27.860> four<00:01:28.860> hands<00:01:29.189> under<00:01:29.670> spin

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
side we have the four hands under spin

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.069 
side we have the four hands under spin
and<00:01:30.210> forehand<00:01:30.840> topspin<00:01:31.619> ok<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.450> for<00:01:33.450> hell<00:01:33.750> push

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
and forehand topspin ok so for hell push

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.380 
and forehand topspin ok so for hell push
or<00:01:34.890> four<00:01:35.310> hands<00:01:35.729> under<00:01:36.360> spin

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.630 

produces<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:40.600> under<00:01:40.960> spin<00:01:41.260> to<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:41.799> ball<00:01:42.130> we

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
produces the under spin to the ball we

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.580 
produces the under spin to the ball we
use<00:01:42.820> that<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.060> lot<00:01:43.180> of<00:01:43.390> receiving<00:01:44.049> services

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
use that a lot of receiving services

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.430 
use that a lot of receiving services
with<00:01:44.830> under<00:01:45.190> spin<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.760> on<00:01:46.450> this<00:01:46.659> drove<00:01:47.049> so<00:01:47.380> you

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
with under spin and on this drove so you

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.050 
with under spin and on this drove so you
pay<00:01:47.710> attention<00:01:47.799> you<00:01:48.250> catching<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:48.909> ball

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
pay attention you catching the ball

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.469 
pay attention you catching the ball
right<00:01:49.299> here<00:01:49.690> and<00:01:49.869> you<00:01:50.880> spin<00:01:51.880> through<00:01:52.330> the

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
right here and you spin through the

00:01:52.479 --> 00:02:04.530 
right here and you spin through the
racket<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:54.040> way<00:01:58.440> right<00:01:59.440> here<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:03.360> then<00:02:04.360> on

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
racket this way right here and then on

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:12.030 
racket this way right here and then on
the<00:02:04.659> forehand<00:02:05.110> topspin<00:02:09.360> looks<00:02:10.360> like<00:02:10.600> this<00:02:11.040> so

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
the forehand topspin looks like this so

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
the forehand topspin looks like this so
here<00:02:12.280> they<00:02:12.580> pay<00:02:13.000> attention<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:14.970> catching<00:02:15.970> the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
here they pay attention to catching the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.479 
here they pay attention to catching the
ball<00:02:16.209> at<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.570> top<00:02:16.810> of<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.110> bounds<00:02:17.560> right<00:02:18.070> here

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
ball at the top of the bounds right here

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.020 
ball at the top of the bounds right here
racket<00:02:19.239> angle<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.750> closed<00:02:20.790> driving<00:02:21.790> through

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
racket angle is closed driving through

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.420 
racket angle is closed driving through
the<00:02:22.180> ball<00:02:22.360> following<00:02:23.350> through<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.970> way<00:02:25.239> I'm

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
the ball following through this way I'm

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.220 
the ball following through this way I'm
