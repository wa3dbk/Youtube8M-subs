00:00:01.899 --> 00:00:03.889
 this is a lower opening 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:08.910
 what is next to that means that more use of instability and 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.779
 combination 

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:15.089
 which starts with the acquisition of the left arm 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.990
 none of them any more 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.990
 you then speak your left arm 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.749
 a bit to work away after behind 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.109
 then the roads that elbow and knee 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.449
 a straight leg together 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.840
 a plug according to off 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.950
 that is the start of the scheme 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.060
 And there the intention is that you do the movement 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.890
 6 going fast 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.890
 as quickly as possible 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.070
 a dynamic move 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.950
 by ten times 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.680
 and I'll be back and the transition 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.960
 and also exchanged an opportunity 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.210
 start second cell the other side with your left leg 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.770
 who is the strongest right arm 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.770
 first slowly knee and elbow towards each other 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.500
 and make bad roads slowly 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.290
 a temple 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.290
 already 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.190
 and I could take the pressure of tradition 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.280
 we are going to make the exercise a bit more difficult and we are going to be comparable 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.650
 that is, your left arm 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.490
 and in the left 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.310
 so that the ball is already standing 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.549
 a movement is very quietly three knee and elbow towards each other 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.780
 and in my thirtieth states 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.780
 I have to keep moving 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.390
 then I come back to tradition 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.710
 and we do the same with the right side 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.750
 cross the right leg 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.990
 and right arm 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.670
 I'm not worried about the elbow 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.270
 a lot slower 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.790
 poldermans found 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.600
 that always goes 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.130
 fast 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.609
 and I will return to the grieving process
