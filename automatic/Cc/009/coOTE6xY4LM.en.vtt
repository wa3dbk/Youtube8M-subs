00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.969
 today I got up with a desire 

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.500
 irresistible chocolate so I've 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.580
 put to prepare these cookies 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.580
 vanilla with chocolate 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.910
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:19.220
 they are 150 grams of tulip margarine 250 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.770
 grams of flour 150 grams of sugar 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.760
 glas 5 ml of vanilla essence and one 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.460
 pinch of salt 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.530
 and here we have the flour the pinch of salt 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.020
 the essence of vanilla margarine 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.120
 tulip and icing sugar the first thing that 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.739
 let's do is put the icing sugar in 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.020
 a bowl together with the diaz mark in 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.150
 felipe and with the help of a blender 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:47.879
 We are going to beat it until we 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:49.800
 there is a whitish cream when 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.110
 we have the cream we are going to add too 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.850
 the essence of vanilla and let's beat 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.850
 until it is fully integrated 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.740
 when everything is well incorporated 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.570
 let's add the pinch of salt to the 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.089
 flour and with the help of a processor 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.830
 We are going to sift the flour on the 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.520
 tulip margarine cream that we had 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.890
 prepared 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.799
 that we will be mixing it with the help of a 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.420
 spatula to me personally I like 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.920
 use more margarine than 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.049
 butter since it has a lower 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.020
 saturated fat content due to 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.509
 the vegetable oils that contain 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.579
 when you see you can not knead more with 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.439
 the spatula we put it on our 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.360
 work bench and when we see that 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.880
 we have a mass that does not have already the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.369
 we'll have a list so we put it between 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.229
 two sheets of vegetable paper we make a 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:44.100
 little bit of pressure and with the help of a 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:46.229
 roll let's knead it and when the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.209
 let 's have the desired bread we're going to 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.209
 let stand in the refrigerator two hours 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.970
 After this time, as you can see, 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.159
 mass has hardened so we removed the 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.470
 upper part of the vegetal paper and with 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.640
 the help of a cutter to furrows we go to 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.640
 go cutting our dough 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.550
 when we have all the dough cut 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.950
 We are going to eliminate the excess 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.989
 biscuit dough and this I what soil 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.580
 to do is to return it to mass I return it to 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.830
 enter in the fridge and return to 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.720
 provide more cookies and with the help of a 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.269
 spatula we are going to put them on 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:28.090
 a cooking mat and we're going to 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.090
 bake for 10 minutes at 175 degrees 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.569
 and once baked we let them cool 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.190
 on a grid and on the other hand we're going 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.170
 to prepare the ingredients for the 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.180
 decorated that is going to be dark chocolate 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.819
 to melt and here we have ready the 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.239
 chocolate which we are going to melt at 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.239
 water bath 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.170
 and once it's melted we 're going to 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.470
 remove from the fire and we will put it in 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.060
 a bowl below we take our 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.130
 silicone mold to make the 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.200
 personalized chocolate tablets that 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.980
 they will go on the cookie let's go 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.500
 pouring the chocolate over the mold 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.390
 and with the help of a stick like you see 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.220
 that I'm using, let's go 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.989
 causing the chocolate to penetrate 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.590
 all the holes and so we stay 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.590
 perfect 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.129
 once we have them all filled with the 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.129
 stick we will go perfecting the 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.150
 and already as a last touch what we are going to 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.590
 to do is take the mold and let's leave 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.780
 what there is about our bank of 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.489
 work like this we will eliminate all 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.190
 air bubbles and our chocolate 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.019
 will be perfect and then what 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:44.780
 let's cool in the fridge 10 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:46.700
 minutes once the chocolate has 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.970
 hardened let's unmold it with 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.610
 watch out 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.350
 and as you can see we have our first 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.270
 personalized chocolate tablet 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.270

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.099

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.010
 chocolate chip cookie 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.540
 that we're going to put a little bit of 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.060
 molten chocolate in the center of the 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.150
 We scatter the cookie and take the 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.130
 tablet and we paste it right over 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.980

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.010
