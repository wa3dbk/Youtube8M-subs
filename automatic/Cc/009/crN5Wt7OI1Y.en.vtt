00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
twist it until I do one full turn and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.010 
twist it until I do one full turn and
then<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.850> pull<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.299> flat<00:01:27.479> iron<00:01:27.689> all<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
then I just pull the flat iron all the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.420 
then I just pull the flat iron all the
way<00:01:28.259> down<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.710> you'll<00:01:28.860> get<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.040> curl<00:01:29.310> that

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
way down and you'll get a curl that

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.719 
way down and you'll get a curl that
looks<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.720> I'll<00:01:30.810> show<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.020> again

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
looks like that so I'll show you again

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.490 
looks like that so I'll show you again
pay<00:01:32.729> attention<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.479> color<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:34.049> my<00:01:34.229> flat

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
pay attention to the color of my flat

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.039 
pay attention to the color of my flat

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
iron and so you can see that it's black

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.929 
iron and so you can see that it's black
on<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.350> side<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.100> then<00:01:38.310> I'm<00:01:38.400> going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> twist

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
on that side and then I'm going to twist

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.679 
on that side and then I'm going to twist
until<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:40.170> black<00:01:40.500> again<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.360> then<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.390> just

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
until it's black again and then I just

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.460 
until it's black again and then I just
pull<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.200> flat<00:01:43.439> iron<00:01:43.649> down<00:01:43.950> gently<00:01:44.610> until<00:01:45.470> I

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
pull the flat iron down gently until I

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.499 
pull the flat iron down gently until I
get<00:01:46.829> all<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.490> my<00:01:47.520> hair<00:01:47.850> through<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.390> that's

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
going all the way until I reach the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.840 
going all the way until I reach the

make sure that you get any missing

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.220 
make sure that you get any missing
pieces<00:02:21.880> sometimes<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:23.180> miss<00:02:23.300> pieces<00:02:23.720> so<00:02:23.990> just

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
pieces sometimes you miss pieces so just

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.110 
pieces sometimes you miss pieces so just

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
make sure that you get them so that way

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:37.990

everything<00:02:26.360> blends<00:02:26.810> well<00:02:27.170> I<00:02:36.640> love<00:02:37.640> doing<00:02:37.910> it

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
everything blends well I love doing it

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.699 
everything blends well I love doing it
this<00:02:38.120> way<00:02:38.180> as<00:02:38.600> opposed<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.140> curling<00:02:39.530> iron

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
this way as opposed to a curling iron

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.740 
this way as opposed to a curling iron
because<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.520> curls<00:02:40.820> just<00:02:40.880> last<00:02:41.180> a<00:02:41.360> little<00:02:41.630> bit

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
because the curls just last a little bit

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.190 
because the curls just last a little bit
longer<00:02:41.900> without<00:02:42.800> having<00:02:43.340> to<00:02:43.580> use<00:02:43.760> any<00:02:44.200> holding

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
longer without having to use any holding

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.260 
longer without having to use any holding
spray<00:02:45.530> I<00:02:45.950> don't<00:02:46.490> like<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.850> feeling<00:02:47.090> of

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
spray I don't like the feeling of

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.060 
spray I don't like the feeling of
holding<00:02:47.480> spray<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:48.080> just<00:02:48.320> I<00:02:48.500> feel<00:02:48.770> like<00:02:48.830> my

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
holding spray it just I feel like my

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.250 
holding spray it just I feel like my
hair<00:02:49.310> doesn't<00:02:49.670> last<00:02:50.030> straight<00:02:50.900> as<00:02:51.020> long

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
hair doesn't last straight as long

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.370 
hair doesn't last straight as long
because<00:02:51.860> of<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.190> aerosol<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.600> alcohol<00:02:54.080> I

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
because of the aerosol and alcohol I

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.960 
because of the aerosol and alcohol I
just<00:02:54.410> try<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.010> keep<00:02:55.130> my<00:02:55.340> products<00:02:55.820> to<00:02:55.880> a

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
minimum so I'm doing the same on the

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.680 
minimum so I'm doing the same on the

down cute little curls i section the top
portion<00:03:37.580> of<00:03:37.670> my<00:03:37.730> hair<00:03:37.880> differently<00:03:38.720> than<00:03:38.959> the

portion of my hair differently than the
bottom<00:03:39.440> you'll<00:03:40.160> want<00:03:40.430> one<00:03:40.850> big<00:03:41.120> section

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
bottom you'll want one big section

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.440 
bottom you'll want one big section
almost<00:03:42.410> as<00:03:42.620> wide<00:03:42.860> as<00:03:43.250> your<00:03:43.489> flat<00:03:43.760> iron<00:03:44.000> plates

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
almost as wide as your flat iron plates

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.870 
almost as wide as your flat iron plates
so<00:03:45.230> that<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.590> crown<00:03:45.830> will<00:03:46.130> have<00:03:46.280> tons<00:03:46.580> of

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
so that the crown will have tons of

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.250 
so that the crown will have tons of
volume<00:03:47.150> with<00:03:47.540> this<00:03:47.780> technique<00:03:49.720> this<00:03:50.720> concept

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
volume with this technique this concept

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.259 
volume with this technique this concept
will<00:03:51.410> get<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.620> lot<00:03:51.950> more<00:03:51.980> clear<00:03:52.519> once<00:03:52.880> I<00:03:53.060> reach

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
will get a lot more clear once I reach

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.380 
will get a lot more clear once I reach
the<00:03:53.510> front<00:03:53.840> of<00:03:53.959> my<00:03:53.989> head<00:03:54.910> this<00:03:55.910> time<00:03:55.970> I'm

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
taking a thin section horizontally and

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.120 
taking a thin section horizontally and
this<00:03:59.959> is<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.290> way<00:04:00.410> I'm<00:04:00.560> going<00:04:00.739> to<00:04:00.799> curl<00:04:01.070> my

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
this is the way I'm going to curl my

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.750

section<00:04:07.489> I'm<00:04:07.760> going<00:04:07.970> to<00:04:08.380> turn<00:04:09.380> the<00:04:09.620> flat<00:04:09.830> iron

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
section I'm going to turn the flat iron

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.500 
section I'm going to turn the flat iron
one<00:04:11.269> full<00:04:11.540> time<00:04:11.750> again<00:04:12.140> and<00:04:13.209> this<00:04:14.209> is<00:04:14.360> going<00:04:14.450> to
