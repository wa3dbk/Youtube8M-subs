more air now one thing about this whole

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.060 
more air now one thing about this whole
setup<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:12.000> one<00:00:12.240> I'm<00:00:12.389> ultimately<00:00:13.170> going

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
setup and this one I'm ultimately going

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.779 
setup and this one I'm ultimately going
to<00:00:14.160> do<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:15.420> want<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.410> create<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.789> generator

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
to do is I want to create a generator

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.900 
to do is I want to create a generator
that<00:00:18.060> runs<00:00:18.119> off<00:00:18.570> this<00:00:18.900> motor<00:00:19.550> and<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.670> just

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
that runs off this motor and I just

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.410 
that runs off this motor and I just
wanted<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.240> demonstrate<00:00:23.060> kind<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.150> how<00:00:24.240> much

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
wanted to demonstrate kind of how much

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.599 
wanted to demonstrate kind of how much
work<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:25.380> thing<00:00:25.769> can<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.519> know

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
work this thing can do you know

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.480 
work this thing can do you know
basically<00:00:27.539> putting<00:00:27.900> pressure<00:00:28.289> on<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.250> motor

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
basically putting pressure on the motor

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.999 
basically putting pressure on the motor
while<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.210> spinning<00:00:30.470> and<00:00:31.470> then<00:00:31.710> once<00:00:31.890> you

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
while it's spinning and then once you

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.590 
while it's spinning and then once you
just<00:00:32.250> watch<00:00:32.460> watch<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:35.250> ant<00:00:35.610> draws<00:00:36.059> and

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
just watch watch the the ant draws and

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.150 
just watch watch the the ant draws and
on<00:00:36.890> the<00:00:37.890> two<00:00:38.070> things<00:00:38.340> when<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.850> do<00:00:39.000> this<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:40.160> try

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
on the two things when I do this so try

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.000 
on the two things when I do this so try
to<00:00:41.190> get<00:00:41.399> this<00:00:41.610> good<00:00:41.840> do<00:00:42.840> its<00:00:43.020> little<00:00:43.379> dance

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
to get this good do its little dance

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.010 
to get this good do its little dance
there

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.470 

let<00:00:49.620> me<00:00:49.710> get<00:00:49.890> up<00:00:50.040> speed<00:00:50.880> here<00:00:51.210> for<00:00:51.480> sale<00:00:53.480> but

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
let me get up speed here for sale but

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.100 
let me get up speed here for sale but
you<00:00:54.990> could<00:00:55.170> easily<00:00:55.310> you<00:00:56.310> know<00:00:56.900> have<00:00:57.900> this

you could easily you know have this

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.320 
you could easily you know have this
thing<00:00:58.350> do<00:00:58.620> work<00:00:58.860> like<00:00:59.130> you<00:00:59.550> know<00:00:59.670> have<00:01:00.150> it

running another motor another generator
or<00:01:03.030> something<00:01:04.760> so<00:01:07.970> I'm<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.270> putting

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
or something so I'm just putting

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.620 
or something so I'm just putting
pressure<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.340> thing<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:14.420> mean<00:01:15.420> other

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
pressure on this thing I mean other

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.840 
pressure on this thing I mean other
people<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:16.140> showed<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:16.979> i<00:01:17.070> want<00:01:17.790> to

trying<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.100> achieve<00:01:23.490> over<00:01:23.820> unity<00:01:24.509> or<00:01:24.630> getting

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
trying to achieve over unity or getting

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.590 
trying to achieve over unity or getting
this<00:01:25.380> thing<00:01:25.440> to<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> self<00:01:26.310> running<00:01:26.729> thing<00:01:27.210> i

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
this thing to be a self running thing i

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.060 
this thing to be a self running thing i
want<00:01:28.440> it<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.560> be<00:01:28.800> a<00:01:29.130> practical<00:01:29.940> device<00:01:30.420> so

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.300 

putting<00:01:35.070> some<00:01:35.509> decent<00:01:36.509> pressure<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:37.140> that

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
putting some decent pressure on that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.410 
putting some decent pressure on that
sucker<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.899> it<00:01:39.899> could<00:01:40.440> definitely<00:01:41.420> run

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
sucker so it could definitely run

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.800 
sucker so it could definitely run
something<00:01:43.050> and<00:01:43.770> if<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.390> consider<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.570> put<00:01:45.780> a

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
something and if you consider you put a

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.870 
something and if you consider you put a
generator<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.830> kind<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.580> motor

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.790 

running<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:51.119> off<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.540> battery<00:01:51.780> while<00:01:52.259> still

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
running it off of a battery while still

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.190 
running it off of a battery while still
being<00:01:52.830> able<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.369> charge<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.910> because<00:01:54.149> here<00:01:55.020> i'm

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
being able to charge it because here i'm

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.510 
being able to charge it because here i'm
doing<00:01:55.560> work<00:01:56.479> let<00:01:57.479> me<00:01:57.600> slow<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.020> down<00:01:58.080> I<00:01:58.709> mean

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
doing work let me slow this down I mean

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.980 
doing work let me slow this down I mean
look<00:02:00.080> a<00:02:01.080> little<00:02:01.380> too<00:02:01.649> much<00:02:01.860> there<00:02:02.240> now<00:02:03.240> look<00:02:03.869> at

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
look a little too much there now look at

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.850 
look a little too much there now look at
how<00:02:04.110> many<00:02:05.539> milliamps<00:02:06.539> it<00:02:06.690> continues<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:07.649> put

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
how many milliamps it continues to put

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.910 
how many milliamps it continues to put
out<00:02:08.069> so

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.670 

I<00:02:10.979> think<00:02:11.760> these<00:02:11.849> things<00:02:12.180> have<00:02:12.540> great<00:02:12.930> great

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
I think these things have great great

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.520 
I think these things have great great
potential<00:02:14.599> anyway<00:02:15.599> I<00:02:15.630> just<00:02:15.840> wanted<00:02:16.319> to<00:02:16.440> add

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
potential anyway I just wanted to add

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.360 
potential anyway I just wanted to add
that<00:02:16.560> all<00:02:17.069> right<00:02:17.790> have<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.120> good<00:02:18.300> one
