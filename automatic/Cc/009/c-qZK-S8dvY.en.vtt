00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
on overclocking your samsung galaxy

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.330 
on overclocking your samsung galaxy
player<00:00:06.170> found<00:00:07.170> two<00:00:07.379> programs<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:08.010> work<00:00:08.160> well

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
player found two programs to work well

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.250 
player found two programs to work well
together<00:00:08.490> one<00:00:09.150> that<00:00:09.269> I've<00:00:09.360> already<00:00:09.510> have<00:00:09.840> it's

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
together one that I've already have it's

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.879 
together one that I've already have it's
called<00:00:10.469> tag<00:00:11.070> rat<00:00:11.340> overclock<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.559> can<00:00:13.710> set

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
called tag rat overclock and you can set

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.349 
called tag rat overclock and you can set
your<00:00:13.980> frequency<00:00:14.460> from<00:00:16.190> one<00:00:17.190> gigahertz<00:00:17.490> up<00:00:17.850> to

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
your frequency from one gigahertz up to

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.099 
your frequency from one gigahertz up to
1.3<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:20.240> say<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.270> said<00:00:21.420> its<00:00:21.660> 1.3<00:00:22.189> confirm<00:00:24.109> okay

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
1.3 and say I said its 1.3 confirm okay

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.240 
1.3 and say I said its 1.3 confirm okay
now<00:00:25.560> go<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.769> my<00:00:26.779> cpu<00:00:27.779> tuner<00:00:28.080> already<00:00:28.680> has<00:00:29.039> said

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
now go to my cpu tuner already has said

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.200 
now go to my cpu tuner already has said
it<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:30.650> when<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.340> batteries<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.790> certain<00:00:33.090> level

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
it so when the batteries a certain level

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.900 
it so when the batteries a certain level
it<00:00:33.510> uses<00:00:33.780> its<00:00:33.960> performance<00:00:34.710> mode<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.190> right

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
it uses its performance mode and right

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.880 
it uses its performance mode and right
now<00:00:36.030> set<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.239> auto<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:37.850> some<00:00:38.850> performance<00:00:39.890> it's

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
now set to auto so some performance it's

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.040 
now set to auto so some performance it's
running<00:00:41.190> at<00:00:41.430> thirteen<00:00:42.329> hundred<00:00:42.570> megahertz

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
running at thirteen hundred megahertz

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.350 
running at thirteen hundred megahertz
and<00:00:43.969> the<00:00:44.969> minimum<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.270> 100<00:00:45.690> megahertz<00:00:46.219> and<00:00:47.360> so

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
and the minimum is 100 megahertz and so

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.029 
and the minimum is 100 megahertz and so
when<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.570> battery<00:00:48.870> gets<00:00:48.930> down<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.710> fifteen

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
when the battery gets down to fifteen

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.590 
when the battery gets down to fifteen
percent<00:00:50.370> it'll<00:00:50.789> go<00:00:50.910> down<00:00:52.789> to<00:00:53.789> 0<00:00:55.670> yeah<00:00:56.670> hundred

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
percent it'll go down to 0 yeah hundred

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.540 
percent it'll go down to 0 yeah hundred
megahertz<00:00:57.840> at<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.199> most<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:59.840> go<00:01:00.840> back<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.550> go

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
megahertz at the most and go back to go

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.480 
megahertz at the most and go back to go
back<00:01:04.309> go<00:01:05.309> back<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.580> normal<00:01:05.760> auto<00:01:07.880> refresh<00:01:08.880> it

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
back go back to normal auto refresh it

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.679 
back go back to normal auto refresh it
well<00:01:11.490> it's<00:01:11.670> not<00:01:11.790> showing<00:01:12.030> me<00:01:12.180> that's<00:01:12.360> working

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
well it's not showing me that's working

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.780 
well it's not showing me that's working
but<00:01:13.010> you<00:01:14.010> can<00:01:14.130> see<00:01:14.280> here<00:01:15.200> showing<00:01:16.200> me<00:01:16.380> that

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
but you can see here showing me that

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.920 
but you can see here showing me that
it's<00:01:17.790> going<00:01:17.939> back<00:01:18.180> up<00:01:19.040> the<00:01:20.040> clock<00:01:20.310> speeds<00:01:20.930> and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
it's going back up the clock speeds and

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.770 
it's going back up the clock speeds and
also<00:01:22.170> perform<00:01:22.619> us<00:01:22.740> who<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.009> have<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> set<00:01:23.780> should

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
also perform us who I have a set should

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.950 
also perform us who I have a set should
show<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.170> second<00:01:25.500> here<00:01:25.650> goes<00:01:26.240> mosis<00:01:27.240> 1300

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
show in a second here goes mosis 1300

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.140 
show in a second here goes mosis 1300
1300<00:01:28.530> megahertz<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.369> Louis<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:29.759> 100

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
1300 megahertz and Louis is 100

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.630 
1300 megahertz and Louis is 100
megahertz<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:32.509> it<00:01:33.509> works<00:01:33.689> well<00:01:34.340> now<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.400> are

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
megahertz and it works well now we are

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.210 
megahertz and it works well now we are
not<00:01:35.759> always<00:01:36.140> not<00:01:37.140> knowing<00:01:37.530> what<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:37.890> running

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
not always not knowing what it's running

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.080 
not always not knowing what it's running
so<00:01:38.369> you're<00:01:38.490> not<00:01:38.549> overclocking<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.450> like<00:01:39.600> 24<00:01:40.590> 7

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
so you're not overclocking it like 24 7

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.999 
so you're not overclocking it like 24 7
it's<00:01:42.090> not<00:01:42.240> going<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.509> really<00:01:42.990> heat<00:01:43.590> up<00:01:43.619> it's

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
it's not going to really heat up it's

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.969 
it's not going to really heat up it's
only<00:01:44.159> 18<00:01:44.640> degrees<00:01:44.909> Celsius<00:01:45.299> right<00:01:45.450> now<00:01:45.979> so

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
only 18 degrees Celsius right now so

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.200 
only 18 degrees Celsius right now so
it's<00:01:47.220> not<00:01:47.369> hot<00:01:47.640> at<00:01:47.790> all<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.909> don't<00:01:51.060> think

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
it's not hot at all and I don't think

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.399 
it's not hot at all and I don't think
there's<00:01:51.329> anything<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.750> worry<00:01:51.869> about<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.320> you

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
there's anything to worry about if you

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.399 
there's anything to worry about if you
overclock<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.920> using<00:01:53.310> these<00:01:53.369> two<00:01:53.549> things

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
overclock it using these two things

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.709 
overclock it using these two things
because<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:55.590> never<00:01:55.710> always<00:01:56.250> running<00:01:56.729> at<00:01:56.939> one

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
because it's never always running at one

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.179 
because it's never always running at one
point<00:01:57.899> three<00:01:58.040> burgers<00:01:59.329> or<00:02:00.680> gigahertz<00:02:01.680> my<00:02:02.250> bed

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
point three burgers or gigahertz my bed

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.169 
point three burgers or gigahertz my bed
and<00:02:06.200> it's<00:02:07.200> pretty<00:02:07.350> much<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.680> really<00:02:08.670> simple<00:02:09.119> to

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
and it's pretty much it really simple to

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.839 
and it's pretty much it really simple to
use<00:02:10.250> quick<00:02:11.250> easy<00:02:11.640> it's<00:02:12.510> free

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
use quick easy it's free

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.770 
use quick easy it's free
and<00:02:14.849> I<00:02:15.629> really<00:02:16.410> like<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:17.120> i'm<00:02:18.120> using<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.599> from

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
and I really like it i'm using that from

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.930 
and I really like it i'm using that from
now<00:02:18.930> on<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:20.010> I<00:02:20.040> know<00:02:20.160> now<00:02:20.519> that<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.700> know<00:02:20.760> about

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
now on that I know now that I know about

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.220 
now on that I know now that I know about
it<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:22.610> forget<00:02:23.610> what<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.360> user<00:02:24.540> name<00:02:24.780> was<00:02:24.989> on

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
it I forget what the user name was on

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.580
