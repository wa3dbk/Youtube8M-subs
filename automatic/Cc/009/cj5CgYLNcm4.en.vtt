00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.900
 hello today on our review 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.910
 new soldering station company che 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.350
 model and s6500 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:37.900
 which is modernized 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:39.000
 version of the model air 6000 unpack on 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:46.210
 we have a bottom 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:52.980
 thermo table thermo table complete with 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.980
 station supplied power cable 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.300
 Toby Lewis thermocouple and additional 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:06.790
 brackets are right as well as screws and 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:10.659
 key for mounting the station separately 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:14.259
 disassembled table which consists 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:18.030
 a lot of parts here 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:20.409
 actually my later we collect 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.960
 top heater which 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.960
 is installed on this pipe 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:32.079
 reflective clicking foil as well as a disc with 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.030
 by 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.409
 visual inspection of the station can 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.180
 discover a few significant 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.060
 changes in design compared to 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.310
 model 6000 well then let's go 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.310
 for each of them the first thing that rushes into 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:49.270
 eyes this is the presence of protective glass on 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.820
 glass bottom heater contributes 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.630
 protection of heaters from mechanical 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.740
 damage 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.610
 and 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.409
 improves heating spot uniformity 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.430
 The following manufacturer has equipped the station 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.020
 standard 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.640
 thermocouple to-type synchronization with 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.700
 the computer is going through 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.580
 Yusbi connector included with the station go 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:20.959
 drivers for 64 bit and 32 bit 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:23.440
 systems on the back can 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.920
 detect circuit breakers 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.780
 which increase the overall reliability of systems 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.850
 table holder card changes not 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.580
 has undergone a table designed to 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.340
 hold as rectangular boards such 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.989
 boards of any other form for example 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.310
 laptop motherboards for this 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.310
 there are additional brackets 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.549
 you can actually install a fee for any 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.930
 sizes and any shape and now 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.900
 get acquainted with the authorities 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.670
 soldering station as I said on 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.440
 the back is automatic 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.280
 switches which is actually and 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:05.980
 launch the soldering station on the front 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:09.470
 the panels are two thermal controllers 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.900
 This is responsible for the lower heater and 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.260
 this programmable is responsible for the top 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:18.190
 heater buttons are also present 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.190
 backlight on 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:26.900
 cooler power button which 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.610
 is located on the top of the heater as well 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.450
 two buttons that differ launch and 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.460
 stopping the soldering process of almost 6500 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.900
 the same thermo controller is used and 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:40.430
 like the rest of the models, I want detailed 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.230
 The algorithm of their operation is described in 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.210
 previous video options 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.270
 heating elements compared to 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:50.720
 and whose 6000 has not changed the size of the bottom 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.480
 heater 180 by 180 millimeters of it 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:57.230
 power 800 watt 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.980
 top heater parameters size 80 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.300
 at 80 millimeters power 400 watt 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.670
 The main conclusion that I want to do in 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.920
 As a result, this is what 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.360
 a slight increase in the price of about 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.160
 10 percent at the soldering station 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.630
 6,500 major weaknesses were resolved 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.350
 who were present in the 6000 model what 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.239
 significantly improves operational 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.239
 soldering station specifications
