is going to do basically if I enter my

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.470 
is going to do basically if I enter my
battle<00:01:01.350> stance<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:02.430> apply<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.820> macro<00:01:03.180> i

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
battle stance and I apply this macro i

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.190 
battle stance and I apply this macro i
called<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.899> macro<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.489> sparta<00:01:06.200> so

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
called this macro this is sparta so

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.859 
called this macro this is sparta so
basically<00:01:07.590> whenever<00:01:08.280> i<00:01:08.490> do<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:09.000> macro<00:01:09.240> if<00:01:09.659> I

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
basically whenever i do this macro if I

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.410 
basically whenever i do this macro if I
hold<00:01:10.080> my<00:01:10.260> l2<00:01:10.740> button<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.340> hit<00:01:11.460> triangle<00:01:12.030> it's

hold my l2 button and hit triangle it's

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.000 
hold my l2 button and hit triangle it's
going<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.659> run<00:01:12.900> through<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.439> certain<00:01:13.740> set<00:01:13.979> of

code<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.700> I've<00:01:14.820> written<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.600> it's

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
code that I've written for it and it's

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.050 
code that I've written for it and it's
gonna<00:01:16.380> it's<00:01:16.650> going<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:16.979> apply<00:01:17.220> some<00:01:17.490> skill<00:01:17.759> so

that i applied into this macro and as
you<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:38.040> see<00:01:38.070> because<00:01:38.520> i<00:01:38.640> have<00:01:38.880> some<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
you can see because i have some of the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.780 
you can see because i have some of the
individual<00:01:40.170> skills<00:01:40.530> still<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.189> my<00:01:41.310> crossbar

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
individual skills still in my crossbar

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.069 
individual skills still in my crossbar
you<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.030> see<00:01:42.180> they're<00:01:42.329> still<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.659> cool<00:01:42.869> down

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
you can see they're still in cool down

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.219 
you can see they're still in cool down
so<00:01:43.259> they<00:01:43.380> can't<00:01:43.409> be<00:01:43.740> used<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:45.090> let<00:01:45.840> me<00:01:45.869> show<00:01:46.200> you

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
so they can't be used so let me show you

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.560 
so they can't be used so let me show you
these<00:01:46.619> skills<00:01:47.070> basically<00:01:48.030> if<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.299> go<00:01:48.420> into

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
these skills basically if you go into

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.690 
these skills basically if you go into
your<00:01:48.659> action<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.290> traits<00:01:49.530> menu<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.100> look<00:01:50.460> at

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
your action and traits menu and look at

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.060 
your action and traits menu and look at
your<00:01:51.860> actions<00:01:53.149> you<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.329> few<00:01:54.799> skills<00:01:55.799> that

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
your actions you have a few skills that

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.709 
your actions you have a few skills that
you<00:01:56.159> could<00:01:56.310> actually<00:01:56.460> benefit<00:01:57.090> from<00:01:57.450> putting

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
you could actually benefit from putting

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.789 
you could actually benefit from putting
into<00:01:58.020> one<00:01:58.710> particular<00:01:59.040> macro<00:02:00.320> these<00:02:01.320> being

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
into one particular macro these being

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.399 
into one particular macro these being
your<00:02:02.130> buff<00:02:02.430> skills<00:02:02.880> now<00:02:03.570> depending<00:02:04.200> on<00:02:04.290> your

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
your buff skills now depending on your

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.830 
your buff skills now depending on your
class<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.979> could<00:02:05.280> vary<00:02:05.700> but<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.360> have<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.689> look

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
class it could vary but you have to look

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.240 
class it could vary but you have to look
at<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> few<00:02:07.200> things<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.619> want<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:07.860> look<00:02:07.920> at<00:02:08.099> your

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
at a few things you want to look at your

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.639 
at a few things you want to look at your
recast<00:02:08.700> time<00:02:09.060> which<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.360> 90<00:02:09.840> seconds<00:02:10.259> here<00:02:10.470> for

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
recast time which is 90 seconds here for

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.880 
recast time which is 90 seconds here for
rampart<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:12.260> basically

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
rampart and basically

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.590 
rampart and basically
all<00:02:14.280> your<00:02:14.700> other<00:02:14.910> buses<00:02:15.300> that<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.450> want<00:02:15.569> to

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
all your other buses that you want to

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.900 
all your other buses that you want to
apply<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:16.140> because<00:02:16.470> some<00:02:17.190> can<00:02:17.490> conflict

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
apply to it because some can conflict

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.559 
apply to it because some can conflict
within<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.630> macro<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.319> it's<00:02:19.980> all<00:02:20.730> on<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.090> varied

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
within a macro and it's all on a varied

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.150 
within a macro and it's all on a varied
case<00:02:21.810> on<00:02:22.080> how<00:02:22.260> you're<00:02:22.470> trying<00:02:22.740> to<00:02:22.800> write<00:02:22.980> it

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
case on how you're trying to write it

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.010 
case on how you're trying to write it
but<00:02:23.730> this<00:02:24.000> guide<00:02:24.240> should<00:02:24.450> help<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.810> get

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
but this guide should help you get

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.380 
but this guide should help you get
started<00:02:25.350> so<00:02:26.190> basically<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.910> four<00:02:27.120> skills

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
started so basically the four skills

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.970 
started so basically the four skills
that<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.600> have<00:02:27.780> on<00:02:27.990> here<00:02:28.230> are<00:02:28.380> rampart

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
that I have on here are rampart

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.610 
that I have on here are rampart
fight-or-flight<00:02:30.080> convalescence<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.290> then

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
fight-or-flight convalescence and then

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.990 
fight-or-flight convalescence and then
bloodbath<00:02:32.459> from<00:02:32.970> my<00:02:33.090> router<00:02:33.420> class<00:02:33.950> so<00:02:35.000> how

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
bloodbath from my router class so how

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.510 
bloodbath from my router class so how
did<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.240> do<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:36.600> well<00:02:37.050> basically<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:38.070> go<00:02:38.250> into

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
did I do this well basically you go into

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.840 
did I do this well basically you go into
your<00:02:38.640> system<00:02:38.940> settings<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.709> you<00:02:40.709> go<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.730> your

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
your system settings and you go to your

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.559 
your system settings and you go to your
user<00:02:42.150> macros<00:02:43.459> once<00:02:44.459> you're<00:02:44.640> in<00:02:44.760> here<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:45.390> can

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
user macros once you're in here you can

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.300 
user macros once you're in here you can
create<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.930> new<00:02:46.050> macro<00:02:46.410> pretty<00:02:46.800> much<00:02:46.950> anywhere

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
create a new macro pretty much anywhere

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.160 
create a new macro pretty much anywhere
change<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.090> icon<00:02:48.360> whatever<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:48.870> want<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.110> to

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
change the icon whatever you want it to

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.350 
change the icon whatever you want it to
look<00:02:49.290> like<00:02:49.350> change<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.100> name<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:51.000> is<00:02:51.150> sparta

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
look like change the name this is sparta

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.900 
look like change the name this is sparta
and<00:02:51.800> you<00:02:52.800> write<00:02:53.040> your<00:02:53.160> code<00:02:53.370> in<00:02:53.550> this<00:02:53.670> box

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
and you write your code in this box

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.440 
and you write your code in this box
right<00:02:54.030> here<00:02:54.150> now<00:02:54.630> once<00:02:54.840> again<00:02:54.959> i'll<00:02:55.290> link<00:02:55.530> a

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
right here now once again i'll link a

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.900 
right here now once again i'll link a
link<00:02:57.450> down<00:02:57.630> below<00:02:57.690> which<00:02:58.530> will<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.640> pretty

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
link down below which will have a pretty

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.880 
link down below which will have a pretty
decent<00:03:00.239> article<00:03:00.600> on<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.840> types<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.650> code<00:03:01.860> that

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
decent article on the types of code that

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.240 
decent article on the types of code that
you<00:03:02.100> could<00:03:02.220> use<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.700> write<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:04.250> that

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
you could use to write it and that

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.820 
you could use to write it and that
should<00:03:05.489> pretty<00:03:06.090> much<00:03:06.209> get<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.570> going<00:03:06.750> but<00:03:07.380> you

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
should pretty much get you going but you

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.860 
should pretty much get you going but you
know<00:03:07.980> this<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.610> just<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.910> show<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.090> how<00:03:09.420> its

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
know this is just to show you how its

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.250 
know this is just to show you how its
implemented<00:03:10.550> so<00:03:11.550> if<00:03:12.209> you<00:03:12.330> look<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.750> have<00:03:13.110> it

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
implemented so if you look I have it

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.400 
implemented so if you look I have it
apply<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.620> action<00:03:14.810> convalescence<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.019> the

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
apply the action convalescence and the

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.280 
apply the action convalescence and the
target<00:03:16.739> is<00:03:16.890> me<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.340> then<00:03:17.850> I<00:03:17.940> have<00:03:18.150> it<00:03:18.360> apply

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
target is me and then I have it apply

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.440 
target is me and then I have it apply
the<00:03:19.320> action<00:03:19.799> fight<00:03:20.100> or<00:03:20.130> flight<00:03:20.250> on<00:03:20.549> me<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.030> so

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
the action fight or flight on me and so

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.710 
the action fight or flight on me and so
forth<00:03:21.720> now<00:03:22.290> how<00:03:22.860> this<00:03:23.070> works<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.579> because<00:03:24.150> this

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
forth now how this works is because this

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.960 
forth now how this works is because this
skill<00:03:25.260> was<00:03:25.530> applied<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:26.070> first<00:03:26.340> time<00:03:26.670> it's

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
skill was applied the first time it's

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.880 
skill was applied the first time it's
not<00:03:27.660> going<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.900> run<00:03:28.079> any<00:03:28.350> of<00:03:28.500> these<00:03:28.650> other

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
not going to run any of these other

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.990 
not going to run any of these other
skills<00:03:29.489> so<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.269> macro<00:03:30.660> will<00:03:30.900> finish<00:03:31.110> itself

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
skills so the macro will finish itself

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.880 
skills so the macro will finish itself
but<00:03:33.000> if<00:03:33.299> you<00:03:33.989> run<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.320> again<00:03:34.620> because

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
but if you run it again because

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.770 
but if you run it again because
convalescence<00:03:35.640> isn't<00:03:35.910> cool<00:03:36.150> down<00:03:36.390> it's<00:03:36.630> going

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
convalescence isn't cool down it's going

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.150 
convalescence isn't cool down it's going
to<00:03:36.870> go<00:03:37.019> to<00:03:37.079> the<00:03:37.350> next<00:03:37.500> score<00:03:37.739> because<00:03:37.920> it

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
to go to the next score because it

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.060 
to go to the next score because it
couldn't<00:03:38.370> apply<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:39.329> line<00:03:40.079> of<00:03:40.230> code<00:03:40.470> it's

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
couldn't apply this line of code it's

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.890 
couldn't apply this line of code it's
going<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.280> move<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.850> next<00:03:42.120> so<00:03:42.600> that<00:03:42.780> it

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
going to move to the next so that it

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.250 
going to move to the next so that it
finishes<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.590> macro<00:03:44.010> now<00:03:45.019> once<00:03:46.019> it<00:03:46.140> runs

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
finishes the macro now once it runs

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.340 
finishes the macro now once it runs
fight<00:03:46.590> or<00:03:46.709> flight<00:03:47.390> you<00:03:48.390> can<00:03:48.540> apply<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.079> again

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
fight or flight you can apply it again

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.550 
fight or flight you can apply it again
to<00:03:50.010> do<00:03:50.160> rampart<00:03:50.670> and<00:03:50.760> again<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:52.019> do<00:03:52.140> bloodbath

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
to do rampart and again to do bloodbath

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.920 
to do rampart and again to do bloodbath
now<00:03:53.130> once<00:03:53.549> all<00:03:53.760> of<00:03:53.820> these<00:03:54.150> are<00:03:54.360> in<00:03:54.450> cool<00:03:54.690> down

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
now once all of these are in cool down

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.020 
now once all of these are in cool down
the<00:03:55.680> whole<00:03:55.860> macro<00:03:56.220> can't<00:03:56.430> do<00:03:56.519> anything<00:03:56.730> so

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
the whole macro can't do anything so

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.280 
the whole macro can't do anything so
it's<00:03:57.150> just<00:03:57.209> going<00:03:57.390> to<00:03:57.420> say<00:03:57.570> not<00:03:57.750> ready<00:03:58.019> and

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
it's just going to say not ready and

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.080 
it's just going to say not ready and
it's<00:03:58.680> not<00:03:58.920> going<00:03:59.070> to<00:03:59.160> finish<00:03:59.519> out<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.760> macro

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
it's not going to finish out the macro

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.600 
it's not going to finish out the macro
so<00:04:00.360> you're<00:04:01.110> basically<00:04:01.260> just<00:04:01.829> waiting<00:04:02.459> for

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
so you're basically just waiting for

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.030 
so you're basically just waiting for
your<00:04:02.670> cooldown<00:04:03.090> time<00:04:03.420> to<00:04:03.810> finish<00:04:03.959> too<00:04:04.500> so<00:04:04.920> you

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
your cooldown time to finish too so you

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.720 
your cooldown time to finish too so you
can<00:04:05.280> reapply<00:04:06.049> any<00:04:07.049> bus<00:04:07.410> so<00:04:08.100> this<00:04:08.489> simplifies

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
can reapply any bus so this simplifies

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.789 
can reapply any bus so this simplifies
everything<00:04:09.239> a<00:04:09.510> lot<00:04:09.660> once<00:04:09.959> you<00:04:10.109> set<00:04:10.410> this<00:04:10.590> to

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
everything a lot once you set this to

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.770 
everything a lot once you set this to
your<00:04:10.920> hotbar<00:04:11.160> you<00:04:12.060> can<00:04:12.180> put<00:04:12.329> it<00:04:12.420> anywhere<00:04:12.480> you

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
your hotbar you can put it anywhere you

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.020 
your hotbar you can put it anywhere you
want<00:04:13.109> and<00:04:13.320> you<00:04:13.380> could<00:04:13.890> basically<00:04:14.130> alleviate

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
want and you could basically alleviate

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.340 
want and you could basically alleviate
having<00:04:15.870> a<00:04:16.049> bunch<00:04:16.470> of<00:04:16.560> bus<00:04:16.799> skills<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.280> one<00:04:17.370> a

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
having a bunch of bus skills and one a

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.820 
having a bunch of bus skills and one a
one<00:04:19.350> whole<00:04:19.590> side<00:04:20.039> of<00:04:20.430> your<00:04:21.419> crossbar<00:04:21.930> because

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
one whole side of your crossbar because

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:23.870 
one whole side of your crossbar because
once<00:04:22.979> you<00:04:23.099> start<00:04:23.310> getting<00:04:23.400> more<00:04:23.669> and<00:04:23.789> more

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
once you start getting more and more

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.700 
once you start getting more and more
buffs<00:04:24.240> for<00:04:24.599> your<00:04:24.810> character<00:04:25.169> you<00:04:25.470> know<00:04:25.530> they

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
buffs for your character you know they

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.990 
buffs for your character you know they
tend<00:04:25.890> to<00:04:25.979> take<00:04:26.070> up<00:04:26.250> more<00:04:26.370> space<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:26.820> that

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
tend to take up more space and that

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.440 
tend to take up more space and that
leaves

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
leaves

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.170 
leaves
less<00:04:27.570> combat<00:04:28.110> skills<00:04:28.410> that<00:04:28.590> you<00:04:28.680> could<00:04:28.800> apply

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
less combat skills that you could apply

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.480 
less combat skills that you could apply
so<00:04:30.180> this<00:04:30.570> makes<00:04:30.810> it<00:04:30.930> a<00:04:31.020> lot<00:04:31.170> easier<00:04:31.380> to<00:04:31.680> when

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
so this makes it a lot easier to when

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.950 
so this makes it a lot easier to when
you're<00:04:32.610> about<00:04:32.760> to<00:04:32.940> get<00:04:33.060> into<00:04:33.270> battle<00:04:33.570> like<00:04:33.750> for

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
you're about to get into battle like for

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.660 
you're about to get into battle like for
example<00:04:34.050> if<00:04:34.380> I<00:04:34.470> was<00:04:34.590> just<00:04:34.710> walking<00:04:34.980> up<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:35.640> I

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
example if I was just walking up and I

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.340 
example if I was just walking up and I
wanted<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:36.000> get<00:04:36.120> into<00:04:36.270> a<00:04:36.390> battle<00:04:36.630> I<00:04:36.930> could

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
wanted to get into a battle I could

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.110 
wanted to get into a battle I could
basically<00:04:37.530> just<00:04:38.040> hit<00:04:38.250> triangle<00:04:38.700> four<00:04:38.940> times

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
basically just hit triangle four times

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.090 
basically just hit triangle four times
as<00:04:39.360> fast<00:04:39.420> as<00:04:39.660> I<00:04:39.750> can<00:04:39.810> watch<00:04:40.350> these<00:04:40.590> bus<00:04:40.830> run

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
as fast as I can watch these bus run

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.570 
as fast as I can watch these bus run
through<00:04:41.340> and<00:04:42.080> then<00:04:43.080> just<00:04:43.920> run<00:04:44.160> straight<00:04:44.310> into

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
through and then just run straight into

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.190 
through and then just run straight into
it<00:04:44.700> now<00:04:45.000> of<00:04:45.180> course<00:04:45.240> you<00:04:45.570> get<00:04:45.720> a<00:04:45.750> little<00:04:46.050> thing

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
it now of course you get a little thing

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.140 
it now of course you get a little thing
it<00:04:46.320> says<00:04:46.470> this<00:04:46.710> is<00:04:46.800> not<00:04:46.830> ready<00:04:47.190> and<00:04:47.430> some

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
it says this is not ready and some

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.610 
it says this is not ready and some
people<00:04:48.390> might<00:04:48.480> find<00:04:48.660> that<00:04:48.870> annoying<00:04:49.050> but<00:04:49.410> I

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
people might find that annoying but I

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.020 
people might find that annoying but I
find<00:04:49.920> that<00:04:50.130> that<00:04:50.670> is<00:04:50.850> a<00:04:50.880> small<00:04:51.350> minut<00:04:52.350> problem

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
find that that is a small minut problem

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.060 
find that that is a small minut problem
for<00:04:54.380> convenience<00:04:55.820> basically<00:04:56.820> so<00:04:57.750> yeah<00:04:58.070> that's

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
for convenience basically so yeah that's

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.220 
for convenience basically so yeah that's
gonna<00:04:59.250> basically<00:04:59.850> be<00:05:00.090> a<00:05:00.240> super<00:05:00.660> buff<00:05:00.840> button

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
gonna basically be a super buff button

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.620 
gonna basically be a super buff button
all<00:05:02.190> of<00:05:02.490> that<00:05:02.640> applies<00:05:03.000> you<00:05:03.330> wait<00:05:03.450> for<00:05:03.600> the

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
all of that applies you wait for the

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.330 
all of that applies you wait for the
cooldown<00:05:03.990> and<00:05:04.020> you<00:05:04.230> could<00:05:04.380> do<00:05:04.500> it<00:05:04.620> again<00:05:04.830> now

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
cooldown and you could do it again now

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.450 
cooldown and you could do it again now
since<00:05:06.060> some<00:05:06.590> skills<00:05:07.590> have<00:05:07.890> a<00:05:07.920> shorter

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
since some skills have a shorter

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.160 
since some skills have a shorter
cooldown<00:05:08.670> time<00:05:09.180> you<00:05:09.420> could<00:05:09.570> hit<00:05:09.690> rampart

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
cooldown time you could hit rampart

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.140 
cooldown time you could hit rampart
whenever<00:05:10.530> to<00:05:10.830> just<00:05:11.040> apply<00:05:11.280> skills<00:05:11.730> whenever

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
whenever to just apply skills whenever

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.310 
whenever to just apply skills whenever
you<00:05:12.360> see<00:05:12.750> that<00:05:13.380> your<00:05:13.800> buffs<00:05:14.400> have<00:05:14.880> run<00:05:15.120> out<00:05:15.320> so

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
you see that your buffs have run out so

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.460 
you see that your buffs have run out so
yeah<00:05:16.530> that<00:05:16.830> helps<00:05:17.280> a<00:05:17.640> a<00:05:18.240> lot<00:05:18.750> of<00:05:18.870> people<00:05:19.140> and<00:05:19.320> I

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
yeah that helps a a lot of people and I

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.720 
yeah that helps a a lot of people and I
think<00:05:19.500> that's<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:19.950> most<00:05:20.070> effective<00:05:20.580> way<00:05:20.700> to

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
think that's the most effective way to

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.760 
think that's the most effective way to
use<00:05:20.910> a<00:05:21.030> macro<00:05:21.570> there<00:05:21.990> are<00:05:22.110> other<00:05:22.230> ways<00:05:22.470> and

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
use a macro there are other ways and

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.130 
use a macro there are other ways and
we'll<00:05:22.860> get<00:05:22.980> into<00:05:23.100> that<00:05:23.220> in<00:05:23.520> a<00:05:24.180> later<00:05:24.780> part<00:05:25.050> of
