00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 we return now with the information to 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.279
 country it has to be said that the modality 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.440
 put into practice three years ago and that 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.050
 it was really an event a success we are 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.730
 talking about the buenos aires zoo 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.370
 that opens its doors not only by day but 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.320
 also at night and obviously as it is 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.539
 suppose nighttime visits are 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.119
 guided to know the zoo under the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.010
 moonlight a journey that proposes 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.930
 discover the lesser known side of 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.000
 the animals that have habits 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.910
 nocturnal and that the public only sees 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.730
 during the day those traveled by 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.050
 some sectors of the zoo and the other 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.430
 and there comes the other comes off 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.200
 objective that is to show animals of 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.090
 nocturnal habits of animals that 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.890
 during the day there are not so 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.840
 assets and that at night they have 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.149
 particular behaviors that is what 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.920
 that you just want to show in this 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.449
 visit and for that, for example, we have 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.879
 two caregivers accompanying the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.410
 visit and they go interacting of some 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.870
 way with the animals feeding him 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.880
 and seeing how is the management that makes 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.410
 caretaker with that animal 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.680
 besides the part of course 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.380
 historical recreative of the enclosures 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.470
 for them this work is a privilege 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.910
 and they emphasize that the most important thing is the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.280
 permanent respect for animals is 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.450
 as 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:25.240
 have children or a child and one gives you a 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:28.159
 teaching and receiving is also reciprocal 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.979
 as they realize what they 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.869
 it provides the attention the feeding the 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:37.130
 care is there, there is a feeling 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.950
 constant they have to do 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.049
 approximately 18 years is an experience 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.780
 unique that allows you to enter the 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.540
 magical world of wildlife and 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.050
 discover new mysteries of our 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.789
 general animals are not altered the 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.259
 behavior because of not being 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.600
 us for example doing this 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.190
 traveled in a small group of people from 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.500
 20 to 30 people maximum 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.350
 the animal would be active or 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.390
 eating or moving or doing some 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.580
 activity that would also do it but not 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.910
 is the visit but it does not change the 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.680
 behavior of the animal since 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.200
 it comes all day 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.859
 during the zoo open to the night 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.859
 I do not know very lonely 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:28.189
