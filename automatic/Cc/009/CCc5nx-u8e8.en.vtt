00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.509
 hi everyone today like 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:15.519
 first we find ourselves on a new 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.160
 video of the cigarette and today we 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.829
 will test the airlock 37 a blond tobacco 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.990
 So that's the particularity of 6.37 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:25.660
 it is that it is manufactured in the 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.340
 southwest they are tobacco leaves 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.960
 who grew in the southwest of the 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.460
 France so it's really nice to 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.470
 here we see the little description here 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.519
 and so it's really an advantage that 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.629
 I find in stable today we 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:39.190
 manufactures a lot of the european union 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.989
 and all and for exactly the same price 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.970
 we can have a tobacco made in France 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.070
 so for me it was a little psy me 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:51.850
 actually buy the 16 37 to find out 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:53.729
 so otherwise level composition I have 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.170
 always this focus that is not 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:59.559
 unfortunately not very fast here 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.530
 therefore tobacco 97 25% flavoring agents and 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.879
 textures of 25% so it stays moderate at 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.740
 agent level of flavors textures so 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.439
 it's still drinkable I mean it's 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.610
 not his not big amounts like 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.259
 what we can find on the mall moreau 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.420
 philippe maury are tobaccos with 10 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.869
 10 enemies of the flavor agent the 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.260
 texture 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.820
 so here is the little discussion 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.340
 100% cultivate and harvest under the sun 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.380
 Occitan Here's where I come 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.790
 to buy jelly already tasted several 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.500
 times this tobacco but I had no time 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.360
 to do so if the test level 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.120
 cut then it's a bit like the flank 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.320
 of the country neither much drier but that 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.180
 makes grandchildren 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.280
 it's creepy little girls 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.770
 like that there are some small 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.020
 impurities like the branch but otherwise the 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.490
 rather nice cut it is slightly 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.970
 wet but not too much so that makes a 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.210
 tobacco 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.810
 I think humility level that is perfect 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.960
 we have nothing to say and so here after 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.290
 a level of smell it smells nice nice on 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.450
 it smells little smell of honey tobacco 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.700
 a little bit but good after 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.070
 look for black so that's it for this 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.440
 test as usual the ocb slim and 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.560
 the premium ocb here we will be you 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.119
 for the test so here I come from 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.599
 roll the cigarette it remains only 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.599
 to light it 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.790
 give me a little time to find 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.790
 the flavours 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.340
 so it's a tobacco that's pretty strong 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.540
 but a little less than doing the country 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.630
 that is, they assault my throat 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.640
 it's pretty cool so if you want 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.930
 whether similar level 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.880
 particularities it's the tobacco that 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.440
 looks more like the flowers of the country but 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.910
 I have a good I prefer largely 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.570
 I would classify this one even in 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.200
 favorite tobaccos really a taste in 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.780
 mouth which is rather nice but not 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.980
 to be masked by very surprising tastes 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.450
 as on the drama even if I like 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.090
 a lot it really is a taste of 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:05.620
 simple tara and that I appreciate a lot 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:07.090
 on this tobacco so really to taste in 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.100
 mouth that I find very pleasant 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.170
 I would not have much what you describe 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.870
 like you but just the taste of tobacco 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:19.000
 simple there is no flavor when 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.350
 spring game it's really really 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.140
 lantabat interesting because he has the 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.120
 rest - the throat that make the country and 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.130
 with cases remain characteristic 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.590
 rather rather similar I mean 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.030
 it's basically here I want to make 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.790
 sculptures of beating a future of the country 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.200
 in addition it is more humid so 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.120
 that's really a very good too 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.470
 still this tobacco 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.910
 I do not have much to blame him 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.560
 really game it's a favorite for 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.790
 me it's really a favorite in 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.680
 the more it is done in the southwest so 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.660
 it all fits so a beer is 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.430
 maybe the fact that it's grown in 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.200
 france all that does that some not 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.450
 better quality 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:57.400
 Ben and I seriously feel 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:59.410
 way and after animals smoking does the 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:03.160
 smoke normally it's not a little 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.570
 like all the templates the hard cig 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.470
 longer than an end of the country because 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.209
 that it is wetter 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.130
 frankly some interesting bars 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.800
 I really advise you to test this 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.300
 tobacco you would be I think pleasantly 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.440
 surprised and 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.630
 there really I recommend it to all 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.190
 world would not be really like the 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.380
 taste is not extremely pronounced that 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.489
 is rather neutral it's a taboo that 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.690
 will please everyone anyway 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.890
 those who love doing the country what 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.020
 I think you'll love it 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.920
 even the favorite to see of the country but it's 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.660
 really a crush for me I 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.130
 him I think that lens moment I the 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.490
 would rank no but you have beautiful number one 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.380
 in my smoking a tobacco roll number 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.910
 even over the top of the rome 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.930
 because the drone I smoked a lot 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.380
 and it's true that after a while 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.770
 becomes disgusting and so it's really 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.850
 my favorite 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.550
 I really recommend this tobacco 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.310
 first first choice of channels the shrink 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.080
 stop it's this tobacco and so that's it 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.490
 after tell me in the comments this 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.060
 what do you think if you already have it 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.140
 tested and and that's so the arguments get 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.520
 join with me if you are 

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.290
 okay that looks a bit like iron 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.000
 of the country in more humid 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:05.230
 here are all the comments are 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.600
 Allowed so I leave you free 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.290
