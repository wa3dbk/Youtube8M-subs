 the application top chrono an application 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.720
 which will make you win lots of presents 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.950
 on ios and android of course every 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.950
 links are description of videos 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.290
 hello to all and all friends sekkat 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.000
 enemies who is talking to you I hope you 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.770
 all of them are great anyway for my 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.210
 share and well it's going great today I 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.950
 showed you a trick that consists of 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.930
 transfer photos and videos from his 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.910
 apple device directly on his pc 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.160
 so you will need the case to connect 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.210
 the computer to the device so less 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.610
 it's an iphone I simply 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.140
 open itunes to show you that he 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.550
 is not plugged yet so here I 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.920
 live bronze and it should 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.360
 just appear here normally a 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.920
 once it is detected we will wait 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.449
 on the desk that there is a small 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.129
 message that will allow us to bring 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.379
 camera photos and videos 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.140
 so he should not be long in his record 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.540
 and here it is here we have two buttons 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.850
 end 3 but the two main 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.010
 it is to bring images and 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.449
 videos so that will detect all the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.040
 videos and all the photos for then 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.229
 create a folder I showed you frozen 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.420
 already done it's worth doing a record in 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.159
 your pictures with the date of the day with 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.350
 all your pictures inside so me 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.760
 I do not know how many pictures 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.460
 but in any case it's almost 10 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.260
 gigas of photos and videos so that's it 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.790
 then if you just want a picture 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.020
 or a video that you are not taking 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.969
 bus you will discover the device 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.579
 mobile and then well you're going 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:28.320
 directly into the internal memory of 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.840
 your device you choose the photo 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.369
 that you want to take if you want 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.009
 so do the manipulation as I 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.600
 were saying for to actually transfer and 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.100
 recover all your photos and videos 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.020
 in one fell swoop to make a backup 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.969
 well you click on the button that 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.590
 is shown to wear all this if you 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.450
 missed the button it was not 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.310
 display and admits click on this button 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.780
 and makes you import the images and 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.280
 videos it's exactly the same 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.469
 and there he will automatically detect 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.479
 all the pictures and videos of your 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:56.490
 device to then copy them do 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.340
 a backup in the images folder 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.439
 which you are importing and so here 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.880
 I have a since it was the 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.380
 the only one I added since 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.939
 last backup I did everything to 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.640
 the time so that's why it got me 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.259
 transferred know also if you do not 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.450
 not the message that appears and that you 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.560
 do not have access to your device that he 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.150
 do not show up there that's all 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.370
 simply that you did not put your 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.870
 code on your device so it is 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.980
 locked you can not access 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.870
 to information 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.610
 so here I hope that this little 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.000
 video tutorial you will have pleased me I tell you 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.560
 after 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.560
