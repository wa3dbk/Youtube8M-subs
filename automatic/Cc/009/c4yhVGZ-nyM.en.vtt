 again granite from which we are made 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:13.500
 nothing is able to break what is with us 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.500
 us dwarves fans can especially their axes 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.600
 grind of king art comes 2016

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.210
 history of the first band after and 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.279
 Move into tactical group battles 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.890
 around the sheltered land from an invasion 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.449
 to rescue 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.759
 we slip into the role of tom den 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.070
 oyo driver the only one worth 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.530
 cleats of his magician zieh father's lotion 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.390
 grew up as one of us on one 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.309
 apparently harmless open gear sends 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.219
 we stumble in the middle of a dark one 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.020
 conspiracy the journey leads him to 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.420
 his own origins in the rich 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.079
 the dwarven tribes around there allied too 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.180
 Find 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.070
 we move on this map 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.469
 the game world and can from there 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.230
 drive over 200 locations 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.940
 in the area of ​​pilot jonas 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.539
 Above all, they drive the story 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.460
 Ahead 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.379
 we conduct dialogues 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.439
 discovery tour and feel hidden 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.400
 items on riddles should be synonymous but there 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.659
 rather seldom slaughter more 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.100
 Indications with a group of up to 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.920
 four figures and stand against 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.659
 impressive ork horden on with physics 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.759
 engine taste we sweep the greens 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.509
 today by storm attack and active in the 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.060
 Abyss 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.729
 everyone has such special skills 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.560
 holds only limited action points 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.720
 should encourage us regularly between 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.369
 to change the stretches and their whole 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.380
 exploit points pool 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.659
 The developers promise tactically 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.880
 challenging battles in ours 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.280
 team must work together cleverly 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.170
 in the version shown, the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.600
 Slaughter something simple and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.130
 action-heavy the dwarves beat each other 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.720
 namely quite easily through 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.090
 tons of cannon fodder 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.340
 but that was also a pre alpha 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.110
 in the final game, among other things 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.090
 shape positioning of our warriors 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.340
 we play an important role in this 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.689
 not surrounded 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.939
 besides us, as well as orks 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.770
 more dangerous enemies like or the alb 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.530
 horace make life difficult 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.360
 to face those we look in the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.489
 Run a group of twelve 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.290
 companions around us before every battle 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.060
 we choose with which of them we 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.739
 want to fight equip our 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.650
 select four skills 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.170
 or magical items and choose one 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.430
 passive property falls with that 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.050
 skills selection and the 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.540
 Character development for the individual 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.040
 Heroes are quite economical compared 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.650
 heavyweight the pillars of 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.330
 Eternity We level each hero right 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.250
 times to level 10 and decide us 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.269
 every few ranks for one in two 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.220
 talents 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.019
 for it should be varied 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.120
 group members provide diversity 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.100
 alongside classic dwarf warriors 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.870
 we also collect characters like the fight 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.959
 magician in doing so and her armored 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.910
 monster bodyguard a particularly cool 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.380
 our comrades all have theirs 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.019
 own head and get in touch regularly 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.519
 In conversations we forge ahead 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.080
 stronger ties between ours 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.390
 We turn on similar ones like in the 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.700
 consoles roleplay fire emblem too 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.859
 playful advantages when free 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.230
 to understand two characters very well 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.239
 They also fight better together 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.280
 Incidentally, conversations are similar to 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.890
 in pillars of eternity a narrator of 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.620
 here even set to music he also reads times 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.850
 direct book quotes in front 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.920
 has stood for many cycles 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.600
 gieselmann iron eye the ancestor of 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.090
 fifth no longer at the front 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.590
 to meet the creative teams 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.730
 to stem 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.989
 in general, the developers have the book 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.950
 mood already really good 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.930
 captured 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.459
 you have every single description 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.109
 detail out of the template 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.390
 written and from it design 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.859
 interpretation we tinkered through 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.109
 find the bank suitable 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.150
 maybe author markus heitz should even 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.500
 a few next or in new ones 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.769
 Contribute to companions 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.480
 especially for the game made the 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.220
 biggest or most complex 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.440
 Of course, the dwarves will be involved in role-playing games 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.060
 not the individual areas we over 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.380
 the world map of taxes are right 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.000
 manageable and the 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.660
 character development could still be 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.180
 scope 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.200
 The tactics sound richer 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.960
 Butchering and the group dynamics 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.520
 really promising with it 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.130
 one of the most successful german 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.420
 In fact, fantasy series is a worthy one 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.420
 get game implementation 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.390
