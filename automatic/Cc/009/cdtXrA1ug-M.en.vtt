00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.279 
this just came out um like last week but
I<00:00:14.030> saw<00:00:15.030> these<00:00:15.179> in<00:00:15.240> Sally's<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.870> couple<00:00:16.139> days<00:00:16.260> ago

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
I saw these in Sally's a couple days ago

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.189 
I saw these in Sally's a couple days ago
and<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.800> just<00:00:17.160> decided<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.670> get<00:00:18.270> them<00:00:18.480> all<00:00:18.720> and

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
and I just decided to get them all and

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.480 
and I just decided to get them all and
it<00:00:19.470> was<00:00:19.560> really<00:00:19.770> hard<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.010> pick<00:00:20.220> them<00:00:20.369> out

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
it was really hard to pick them out

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.910 
it was really hard to pick them out
because<00:00:20.699> they<00:00:21.570> were<00:00:21.630> all<00:00:21.920> very

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
because they were all very

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.920 
because they were all very
similar-looking<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:24.000> there's<00:00:24.570> two<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:24.900> here

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
and with all these you do could have to

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.730 
and with all these you do could have to
dab<00:01:35.040> them<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.400> but<00:01:35.640> they<00:01:35.759> are<00:01:35.970> like<00:01:36.500> I<00:01:37.500> would

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
dab them on but they are like I would

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.149 
dab them on but they are like I would
say<00:01:37.920> half<00:01:38.159> way<00:01:38.430> like<00:01:39.329> pretty<00:01:39.630> opaque<00:01:40.320> with<00:01:40.799> one

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
say half way like pretty opaque with one

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.969 
say half way like pretty opaque with one
code<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.729> could<00:01:41.820> maybe<00:01:42.350> maybe<00:01:43.350> if<00:01:43.770> you're

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
code you could maybe maybe if you're

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.889 
code you could maybe maybe if you're
looking<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.149> get<00:01:45.479> away<00:01:45.570> with

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
looking for it you can get away with

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.139 
looking for it you can get away with
making<00:01:46.680> them<00:01:46.920> full<00:01:47.159> fully<00:01:47.490> opaque<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:48.000> like

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
making them full fully opaque with like

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.060 
making them full fully opaque with like
two<00:01:48.329> or<00:01:48.450> three<00:01:48.479> coats<00:01:48.750> but<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.439> think<00:01:49.740> it'll<00:01:49.890> get

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
two or three coats but I think it'll get

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.889 
two or three coats but I think it'll get
kind<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.310> chunky<00:01:50.490> at<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.850> point<00:01:51.090> but<00:01:51.750> yeah

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
kind of chunky at that point but yeah

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.310 
kind of chunky at that point but yeah
you<00:01:51.960> do<00:01:52.200> kind<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.439> have<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:53.450> fish<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.720> little<00:01:55.020> bit

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
you do kind of have to fish a little bit

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.899 
you do kind of have to fish a little bit
through<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> bottle<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.100> get<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> polish<00:01:56.759> out

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
through the bottle to get the polish out

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.100 
through the bottle to get the polish out
like<00:01:57.180> I'll<00:01:57.329> even<00:01:57.479> show<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.869> little<00:01:58.229> bit<00:01:58.500> but

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
like I'll even show you a little bit but

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.179 
like I'll even show you a little bit but
if<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.259> can<00:02:01.380> see<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:01.829> there's<00:02:02.009> not<00:02:02.130> very

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
um other than that I think this

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.010 
um other than that I think this
collection<00:04:35.820> is<00:04:35.850> really<00:04:35.910> interesting<00:04:36.870> as<00:04:36.990> a

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
collection is really interesting as a

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.560 
collection is really interesting as a
whole<00:04:37.290> because<00:04:38.030> there's<00:04:39.030> so<00:04:39.300> many<00:04:39.420> different

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
whole because there's so many different

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.540 
whole because there's so many different
glitter<00:04:40.380> combinations<00:04:41.040> the<00:04:41.220> only<00:04:41.400> thing

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
glitter combinations the only thing

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.570 
glitter combinations the only thing
that's<00:04:41.730> kind<00:04:41.850> of<00:04:41.940> constant<00:04:42.510> is<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:43.580> pink

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
that's kind of constant is the pink

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.540 
that's kind of constant is the pink
glitter<00:04:44.850> which<00:04:45.240> I<00:04:45.870> think<00:04:46.320> three<00:04:47.040> of<00:04:47.160> them<00:04:47.340> have

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
glitter which I think three of them have

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.640 
glitter which I think three of them have
the<00:04:47.730> pink<00:04:47.910> glitter<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:48.450> then<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:49.200> rest<00:04:49.380> are

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
the pink glitter and then the rest are

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.380 
the pink glitter and then the rest are
kind<00:04:49.830> of<00:04:49.890> like<00:04:50.070> weird<00:04:50.910> but<00:04:51.090> they<00:04:51.210> all<00:04:51.360> have

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
kind of like weird but they all have

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.260 
kind of like weird but they all have
matt<00:04:51.840> glitter<00:04:52.080> at<00:04:52.920> least<00:04:53.130> one<00:04:53.460> Matt<00:04:53.970> glitter
