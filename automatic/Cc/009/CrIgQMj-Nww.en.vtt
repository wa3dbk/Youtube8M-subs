can<00:01:46.679> lift<00:01:47.159> up<00:01:47.369> dead<00:01:47.579> skin<00:01:47.850> cells<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.359> just

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
can lift up dead skin cells and just

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.559 
can lift up dead skin cells and just
create<00:01:48.630> flakiness<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.229> I'm<00:01:49.709> going<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.609> apply

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
create flakiness and I'm going to apply

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.690 
create flakiness and I'm going to apply
it<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.899> with<00:01:52.319> your<00:01:52.439> fingers<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.249> can<00:01:53.280> usually

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
it in with your fingers you can usually

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.879 
it in with your fingers you can usually
smooth<00:01:54.209> it<00:01:54.329> in<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.899> your<00:01:55.079> fingers<00:01:55.350> are<00:01:55.469> gentle

00:01:55.879 --> 00:01:55.889 
smooth it in and your fingers are gentle

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:58.340 
smooth it in and your fingers are gentle
and<00:01:55.939> warm<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.299> will<00:01:57.479> help<00:01:57.569> it<00:01:57.840> sink<00:01:58.229> into

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
and warm and that will help it sink into

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.410 
and warm and that will help it sink into
your<00:01:58.469> skin<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.799> little<00:01:59.100> bit<00:01:59.219> better<00:01:59.459> and<00:01:59.789> you're

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
your skin a little bit better and you're

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.499 
your skin a little bit better and you're
less<00:02:00.569> likely<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:01.670> experience<00:02:02.670> any<00:02:03.060> flakiness

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
less likely to experience any flakiness

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.389 
less likely to experience any flakiness
because<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.139> the<00:02:04.229> third<00:02:04.409> tip<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.859> I<00:02:04.889> have<00:02:05.159> is

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
because of the third tip that I have is

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.699 
because of the third tip that I have is
to<00:02:05.609> exfoliate<00:02:05.789> and<00:02:06.240> on<00:02:06.569> a<00:02:06.630> daily<00:02:06.929> basis<00:02:07.469> if<00:02:07.619> you

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
to exfoliate and on a daily basis if you

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.639 
to exfoliate and on a daily basis if you
don't<00:02:07.920> already<00:02:08.100> do<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:08.819> what<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.840> like<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.140> use

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
don't already do so what I like to use

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.250 
don't already do so what I like to use
the<00:02:10.860> Clarisonic<00:02:11.400> Mia<00:02:11.430> I've<00:02:12.329> had<00:02:12.599> this<00:02:12.840> for

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the Clarisonic Mia I've had this for

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.500 
the Clarisonic Mia I've had this for
over<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:14.010> year<00:02:14.129> i<00:02:14.370> would<00:02:14.640> say<00:02:14.849> and<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.150> definitely

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
over a year i would say and I definitely

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.420 
over a year i would say and I definitely
noticed<00:02:15.930> an<00:02:15.989> improvement<00:02:16.079> once<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:17.040> started

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
noticed an improvement once I started

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.550 
noticed an improvement once I started
using<00:02:17.700> this<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.599> recommends<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.290> can

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
using this it recommends that you can

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.470 
using this it recommends that you can
use<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:19.739> up<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.159> twice<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.489> day<00:02:20.760> but<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.150> don't<00:02:21.390> use

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
use it up to twice a day but I don't use

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.270 
use it up to twice a day but I don't use
it<00:02:21.510> twice<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.810> day<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.019> only<00:02:22.200> use<00:02:22.379> it<00:02:22.560> once<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.250> day

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
it twice a day I only use it once a day

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.960 
it twice a day I only use it once a day
or<00:02:23.519> every<00:02:23.700> other<00:02:23.849> day<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:26.159> is<00:02:26.459> basically

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
or every other day and this is basically

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.420 
or every other day and this is basically
like<00:02:27.120> an<00:02:27.599> exfoliating<00:02:28.290> machine<00:02:28.799> and<00:02:29.159> four

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
like an exfoliating machine and four

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.089 
like an exfoliating machine and four
runs<00:02:29.909> for<00:02:30.090> about<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.299> minute<00:02:30.659> and<00:02:30.959> it<00:02:31.709> takes<00:02:31.920> off

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
runs for about a minute and it takes off

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.580 
runs for about a minute and it takes off
all<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.579> dead<00:02:33.150> skin<00:02:33.180> cells<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.049> gunk<00:02:34.349> and

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
all the dead skin cells and gunk and

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.250 
all the dead skin cells and gunk and
whatnot<00:02:34.970> from<00:02:35.970> your<00:02:36.180> face<00:02:36.420> but<00:02:36.780> if<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:37.049> don't

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
whatnot from your face but if you don't

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.720 
whatnot from your face but if you don't
want<00:02:37.409> to<00:02:37.500> invest<00:02:37.769> in<00:02:37.890> something<00:02:38.099> like<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:38.370> a

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
want to invest in something like this a

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.030 
want to invest in something like this a
washcloth<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.540> your<00:02:39.989> regular<00:02:40.470> cleanser

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
washcloth and your regular cleanser

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.190 
washcloth and your regular cleanser
works<00:02:41.310> just<00:02:41.549> as<00:02:41.730> well<00:02:41.790> just<00:02:42.569> make<00:02:42.720> sure<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.930> go

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
works just as well just make sure to go

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.920 
works just as well just make sure to go
in<00:02:43.349> gentle<00:02:43.709> circular<00:02:43.950> motions<00:02:44.609> and<00:02:44.819> I<00:02:45.569> noticed

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
in gentle circular motions and I noticed

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.039 
in gentle circular motions and I noticed
that<00:02:46.019> um<00:02:46.549> when<00:02:47.549> I<00:02:47.579> don't<00:02:47.849> exfoliate<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.900> know

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
that um when I don't exfoliate you know

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.960 
that um when I don't exfoliate you know
for<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.590> couple<00:02:49.859> of<00:02:49.950> days<00:02:50.159> it<00:02:50.400> starts<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.819> build

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
for a couple of days it starts to build

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.360 
for a couple of days it starts to build
up<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:51.780> I'm<00:02:51.870> more<00:02:52.019> susceptible<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.829> drive

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
up and I'm more susceptible to drive

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.179 
up and I'm more susceptible to drive
flakiness<00:02:53.849> so<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.510> exfoliation<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:55.799> definitely

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
flakiness so I exfoliation is definitely

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.490 
flakiness so I exfoliation is definitely
something<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.730> I<00:02:56.939> have<00:02:57.599> made<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:58.049> key<00:02:58.260> point

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
something that I have made a key point

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.069 
something that I have made a key point
in<00:02:58.769> my<00:02:59.099> daily<00:02:59.489> skincare<00:02:59.879> routine<00:03:00.180> the<00:03:00.659> forces

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
in my daily skincare routine the forces

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.569 
in my daily skincare routine the forces
that<00:03:01.109> i<00:03:01.260> have<00:03:01.500> is<00:03:01.680> avoid<00:03:01.950> petroleum-based

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
that i have is avoid petroleum-based

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.449 
that i have is avoid petroleum-based
products<00:03:03.269> in<00:03:03.420> your<00:03:03.629> lotions<00:03:04.379> or<00:03:04.680> lip<00:03:05.010> balms<00:03:05.250> or

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
products in your lotions or lip balms or

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.399 
products in your lotions or lip balms or
whatever<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:05.849> use<00:03:05.879> because<00:03:06.659> petroleum<00:03:07.290> which

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
whatever you use because petroleum which

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.679 
whatever you use because petroleum which
isn't<00:03:07.950> great<00:03:08.069> for<00:03:08.189> your<00:03:08.400> skin<00:03:08.459> what<00:03:09.389> it<00:03:09.510> does

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
isn't great for your skin what it does

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.690 
isn't great for your skin what it does
it<00:03:09.870> creates<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.290> false<00:03:10.530> sense<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.159> moisture<00:03:11.609> and

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
it creates a false sense of moisture and

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.280 
it creates a false sense of moisture and
hydration<00:03:11.819> over<00:03:12.540> your<00:03:12.659> skin<00:03:12.840> when<00:03:13.049> in<00:03:13.139> reality

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
hydration over your skin when in reality

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.259 
hydration over your skin when in reality
all<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:14.010> does<00:03:14.129> is<00:03:14.280> create<00:03:14.579> a<00:03:14.639> barrier<00:03:14.879> over

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
all it does is create a barrier over

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.379 
all it does is create a barrier over
your<00:03:15.629> skin<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.079> so<00:03:16.799> it<00:03:17.069> traps<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.669> dirt<00:03:18.180> and

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
your skin and so it traps in dirt and

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.830 
your skin and so it traps in dirt and
stuff<00:03:18.690> inside<00:03:19.139> so<00:03:19.699> things<00:03:20.699> like<00:03:20.849> vaseline

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
stuff inside so things like vaseline

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.960 
stuff inside so things like vaseline
vaseline<00:03:22.109> petroleum<00:03:22.739> jelly<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:23.459> really<00:03:23.849> not

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
vaseline petroleum jelly is really not

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.089 
vaseline petroleum jelly is really not
good<00:03:24.209> if<00:03:24.299> you<00:03:24.419> have<00:03:24.599> oily<00:03:24.840> acne<00:03:25.680> prone<00:03:26.040> skin

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
good if you have oily acne prone skin

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.729 
good if you have oily acne prone skin
because<00:03:26.609> all<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.819> does<00:03:26.849> is<00:03:27.090> trap<00:03:27.419> a<00:03:27.690> dirt<00:03:28.470> and

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
because all it does is trap a dirt and

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.680 
because all it does is trap a dirt and
whatever<00:03:29.190> other<00:03:29.400> impurities<00:03:29.849> you<00:03:30.180> have<00:03:30.389> in

its natural oils leaving it dry and

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.620 
its natural oils leaving it dry and
flaky<00:05:54.260> and<00:05:54.710> it<00:05:55.100> can<00:05:55.280> also<00:05:55.430> irritate<00:05:55.940> and<00:05:56.480> cause
