00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110
 educate tina 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:09.800
 hello let's study a topic for others 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.690
 interesting human intelligence to 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.240
 Although intelligence has been 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.490
 reason for study for many years and 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.869
 by many different disciplines not 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.390
 There is only one definition of 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.119
 intelligence accepted by all and exists 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.160
 consensus on how to measure it has been 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.009
 considered intelligence as the 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.130
 ability of the subject to adapt to 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.870
 environment which is also 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.340
 has said that intelligence is the 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.450
 ability to think abstractly 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.239
 other definitions speak of 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.699
 concrete thought the ability to 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:48.180
 the performance the facility for the 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:50.430
 learning etc. and so on 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.230
 intelligence has also tried to 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.480
 be described as a faculty 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:02.760
 intellectual that allows you to understand ideas 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:04.589
 processes phenomena events relations and 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.530
 which also induces to come from a 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.860
 productive way thereby obtaining a 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.460
 superior performance this definition demands 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.990
 of intelligence concrete results 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.790
 palpable that translate into a 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.820
 effective resolution of the different 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.340
 situations that life presents thus 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.950
 Sight intelligence is not just understanding 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.229
 but an understanding of the world that 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.100
 translates into actions in actions 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.100
 correct 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.740
 to a large extent the effectiveness of 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.720
 actions is due to the capacity that 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.120
 have the person to use 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.550
 adequately your experience and your 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.000
 memory capacity and recovery 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:50.370
 timely information is to say a 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.540
 much of the matter is susceptible of 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:57.300
 be learned improved, elevated training 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.920
 in its potential in other words the 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.920
 intelligence at least in one of his 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.560
 components can be learned improved 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.479
 through exercise this can 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.790
 be controversial to the extent that it 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.709
 can you argue you have the intelligence 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.690
 what is being improved but the 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.160
 ability but if we measure the 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.440
 intelligence for the results 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.330
 practical ones that you provide us if you 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.550
 could think that what improves is the 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.680
 intelligence or acting with greater 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.470
 intelligence when you have better 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.470
 use of these resources 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.470
 mentioned 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.750
 On the other hand there is talk that for 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.360
 develop intelligence can be 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.090
 do mental exercise of it 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.050
 way that physical exercise 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.050
 develops the body 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.750
 the intelligence is classified 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.780
 as follows intelligence 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.090
 fluid that has to do with the 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.250
 associations the formation of concepts 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.550
 the relationships between elements and 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:05.150
 concepts and so on 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.920
 crystallized intelligence which makes 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.960
 reference to the use of 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.950
 previously incorporated information 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:15.840
 for the solution of new problems 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.019
 concrete intelligence 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.000
 this is due more to the instinct to the innate 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.000
 than to development and acquisition by 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.500
 exercise the most important part of 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.750
 what has been called intelligence 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.720
 concrete are given early 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.489
 life in this time the individual learns 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.040
 to deal with the environment in a 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.440
 practice in this aspect the medium 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.780
 The individual's family and social 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.549
 great weight during adolescence in the 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.220
 adult age this intelligence 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.830
 it practically does not develop anymore 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.829
 that new learning is supported 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:54.530
 in what you already know new techniques and 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.530
 new ways but not new skills 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.660
 abstract intelligence 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.250
 is more related to ideas and the 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.770
 development from the skills 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.569
 that have new new techniques 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.160
 inventions and so on 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.170
 global intelligence 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.420
 it is a way of considering the 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.000
 intelligence in such a way that it does not 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.040
 limit to a set of attitudes or of 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.170
 skills but that is evidence 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.590
 general that manifests itself from multiple 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.510
 forms and in multiple situations is 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.350
 have the awareness of the ability to 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.880
 deduction and induction abstraction without 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.970
 that it is necessary to reduce that 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.430
 intelligence to a range of skills 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:40.240
 particular 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.430
 composite intelligence contrary to 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.620
 previous consideration is the conception 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.720
 whereby intelligence implies the 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.360
 awareness that you have 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.640
 aptitudes and functions that mix and 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.180
 support each other as they are memory 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:58.510
 learning perception the 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.600
 reasoning understanding criticism 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.370
 the inventive and so on 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.530
 there is also the theory of 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.669
 multiple intelligences of gardner that 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.380
 posits eight types of intelligence 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.900
 concluding finally we can assert 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.660
 that intelligence is the ability to 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.460
 choose among several possibilities 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.500
 that best option for the 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.630
 resolution of a problem the 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.940
 intelligence is a quality that all 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.620
 we humans possess though not 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.440
 we can all have it in the same way 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.780
 stimulated and developed and this 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.759
 capacity is exploited within the 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.280
 organizations to achieve 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:38.800
 objectives both personal and those of 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.900
 the company I recommend you see the 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.490
 next video then in which to explain 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.650
 the origin and application of 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.910
 multiple intelligences of howard 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:51.010
 gardner liked the video subscribe to the 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.870
 Educa tina channel also tea 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.870
 I recommend watching the following videos
