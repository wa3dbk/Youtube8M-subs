00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.030
 Oh 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.619
 hello to all and lease no case I hope 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.189
 that you're fine in any case me that 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.450
 go nickel 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.740
 today we find ourselves in a 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.980
 new video where I 'm going to show you 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.300
 a secret place no laboratory that 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.129
 is hidden under the map and for there 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.989
 access must really go through a 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.730
 glitch what the fuck so to you could 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.809
 see some pictures right now I 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.239
 will show you how to do it 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.610
 go so in my opinion this place is 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.140
 available online but me 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.000
 really advise you wants to do a 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.890
 story mode it will really be a lot 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.940
 much simpler ones that already 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.080
 as you could see it referred to that 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.159
 it was much simpler I just 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.199
 to do a little cheat codes 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.879
 to have my helicopter that lands next 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.199
 of me then here you go you 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.390
 go to the same place as me in the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.110
 map and here we already wall breached this 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.570
 first building 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.430
 So here we go and it's still 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.200
 to do it gently enough 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.580
 start so that your helicopter is not 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.119
 damaged afterwards we will have the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.650
 backups 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.790
 so it's really going to help us this 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.950
 for that you ask to go into mode 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.840
 story goes to help us backups 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.369
 automatic quick backups 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.560
 excuse me and it will really be able to 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.360
 we facilitate the glitch so that more 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.580
 difficult for the beginning frankly 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.470
 that's where it is to pass this building 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.580
 center have damaged the helicopter otherwise we 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.200
 will not be able to go further 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.970
 you'll see that after one or two 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.390
 Once frankly it's really easy 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.160
 get there 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.510
 you will understand a little the demo 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.610
 you switch from left to right and a 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.380
 moment the lives that he will spend so there 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.820
 this is my helicopter it is passed then 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.020
 like me in the video you are going 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.790
 put right here and there you go 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.080
 go down so you go down you go 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.900
 see that will make you go first 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.090
 to first floor here then the same you 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.530
 get off that make you pass the 2nd floor 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.390
 so there I bugged I had I have 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.950
 see the lyssois who blocked I had to 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.780
 backward you see that then I have 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.220
 come down there we will arrive under the map 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.140
 so some people knew 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.530
 already small this glitch to go under the 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.750
 map 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.610
 me it'll be a little further that goes 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.350
 to happen the manip so then you 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.130
 you have to go here on the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.630
 map all to the right 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.479
 so I'll show you that all of 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.229
 next here you head up there 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.400
 why during that time I'm going 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.090
 invite you to join us on our 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.830
 facebook group 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.629
 if you ever have any questions 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.760
 trick if you're looking for a crew 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.920
 deduplication do not hesitate do you like 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.209
 the links in the description so like 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.620
 just now I told you I got you 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.580
 advised to do this gritche a mode 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.260
 story you're going to see it's really 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.519
 very simple there you see that my chopper 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.200
 is smoking that will soon be 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.879
 to be destroyed there they smoke outright 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.480
 black limit is so you're actually going 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.129
 take out your phone and 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.019
 make a quick backup to 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.120
 less if ever your life that explodes 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.220
 you just have to reload your 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.450
 backup and the game will give you back to 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.099
 same place so the game will put you 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.840
 under the map what is beautiful he 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.760
 will you glitch and even resuming the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.360
 backup and in addition your helicopter will be 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.400
 intact 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.760
 you could go even further than 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.140
 the place where you were already so you 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.700
 go see it's still a little long 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.150
 must still go and half of 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.799
 the map 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.910
 I'll make you go to 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.420
 right to then make you go 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.610
 on top 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.560
 you will actually see if for example 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.970
 when you go under the map like that 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.560
 when you walk under the map 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.000
 if you ever see that speech 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.040
 in front of us we will pass in front of halak 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.690
 if you ever take it in there 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.040
 the deepest lake is actually it's 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.579
 like the dsi as if there was a wall 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.950
 invisible 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.849
 in fact your helicopter will be destroyed and 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.079
 you will have to start again 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.220
 for me what I advise you in 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.870
 do it's really go all right 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.299
 where right and actually follow 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.560
 the highway you fly below 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.299
 from the highway at least you are sure 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.560
 that from there that has nothing and 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.180
 then I will show you where is 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.500
 have to go to the case I made you 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.030
 a small cut precisely this is 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.230
 the place where I discovered bath that 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.790
 had a lake right in front of me and 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.140
 that there was an invisible wall so I 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.519
 had to resume my backup and I 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.319
 bypassed which I took the highway 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.970
 here you redo a little backup 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.260
 fast we were had a little 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.000
 way end story that if ever he 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.650
 is an invisible wall does not go all to 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.549
 restart 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.630
 here you have seen that I did 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.889
 a second backup 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.750
 I really did not want to eat a 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.980
 surprise a wall or whatever in the skull and 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.109
 start all over again that was really 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.970
 Breaks down so here's the next 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.230
 happen here I 'll press you on the 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.370
 start button to really show you 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.220
 where is it that you should arrive 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.139
 so we'll get there it's here so here 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.970
 you will have to arrive later 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.470
 here along the highway as I 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.849
 showed you in the video so this is 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.959
 just here 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.910
 then once you have arrived 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.380
 here the same as me in the video you 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.160
 will have to place you like me 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.129
 on this building 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.810
 you see that here there is one who the 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.250
 species of coins that is open on 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.539
 can see two big pipes so that's 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.360
 really here that we have to go in this 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.860
 little room here you will try to 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.960
 go inside the same without tronic 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.610
 and your and ico so go for it enough 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.430
 gently still make better ten 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.780
 seconds here that 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.160
 than lose five minutes to everything 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.600
 start again once you are 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.190
 ask the same well reflects a small 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.660
 save once you would have jumped 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.110
 helicopter and was able to get out your 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.550
 phone 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.530
 then once everything is fine 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.060
 past that you are laid that you have 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.050
 did your little backup wanted 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.370
 that we are really just below 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.350
 soil 1 we can see the species of small 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.580
 bases which just above so a 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.770
 once you've done all this 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.730
 go out of your helicopter so there me 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.750
 I just a little back at home 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.380
 why did I do that I thought 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.170
 I was misplaced 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.790
 hop you put the essential it is 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.500
 to really be just ask once 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.820
 you are asked as I wanted to say you 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.350
 go to press the triangle button 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.240
 so there you go see you go 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.050
 get off your helicopter here you go 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.760
 jump into the void 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.380
 you jumped into the void you go 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.850
 see that at some point you are going to land 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.020
 in the water and once you go 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.950
 to land in the water I do not know if you 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.480
 have seen in your fall 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.980
 you had a species like two 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.080
 pools a little river like that 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.730
 bizarre cashmere moves hardly shown 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.410
 to show you how far she is 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.750
 you see below me there is the ol 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.010
 is not the same right here on the left and 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.110
 you will try to get closer to a 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.070
 maximum of this place you will see 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.480
 that there is still a small wall 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.830
 invisible but it does not matter you 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.600
 really try to get closer 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.500
 you try m then go by by 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.910
 below you'll see that I'm going 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.990
 try to go below you go 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:35.820
 see that when you go down and 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.900
 is going to be a little fuck coach of them 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.940
 losing felt really 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.800
 quickly and want to be brought into 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.630
 another room in a small vat 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.340
 filled with water so right here you go 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.420
 see there I started bugging my 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.740
 character is going to take a lot of shots 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.620
 in the mouth he will lose his bone and 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.670
 not his energy his health you'll see 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.440
 that we will reappear in a place 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.670
 weird enough that's where it starts 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.170
 to take slaps it looks like you see 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.380
 here is taking full slaps in the 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.090
 mouth 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.860
 and there he reappears in a room enough 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.510
 weird as I told you then a 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.880
 once you reappear here you 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.080
 just have to swim to the surface 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.360
 hawks and arty you swim up to the 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.310
 surface and normand on the surface will have a 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.140
 small scale that will take you to 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.820
 secret lab to frankly I 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.270
 had never heard of the existence of 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.310
 this piece 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.570
 until last night it's really a 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.430
 piece I think there may be way 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.780
 even to discover that you see that ya 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.700
 even had small invisible steps 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.900
 the fuck and I even think that thanks to 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.640
 this little room as I say them the 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.840
 head there was easter egg or 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.700
 maybe even to arrive in a room 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.990
 weird you see that really on the 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.030
 mini cars that the building is intended 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.910
 so it's not a weird thing it's 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.830
 really good 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.240

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.190

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.170
 suffers we still have the stars so the 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.890
 cops it was taking here oh yes it's 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.570
 really interesting 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.220
