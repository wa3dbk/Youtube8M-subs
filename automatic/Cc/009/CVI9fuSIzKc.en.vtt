and<00:03:22.250> this<00:03:22.760> part<00:03:23.000> is<00:03:23.120> super<00:03:23.360> easy<00:03:23.810> so<00:03:24.770> don't

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
and this part is super easy so don't

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.670 
and this part is super easy so don't
worry<00:03:25.209> you<00:03:26.209> just<00:03:26.240> split<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:26.900> hair<00:03:27.140> in<00:03:27.350> two

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
worry you just split the hair in two

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.660 
worry you just split the hair in two
with<00:03:28.459> your<00:03:28.580> fingers<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:29.830> then<00:03:30.830> you<00:03:31.190> take<00:03:31.459> the

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
with your fingers and then you take the

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.740 
with your fingers and then you take the
end<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:32.470> put<00:03:33.470> it<00:03:33.590> through<00:03:33.770> the<00:03:33.950> loop<00:03:34.000> okay<00:03:35.000> so

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
end and put it through the loop okay so

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.680 
end and put it through the loop okay so
you<00:03:35.840> just<00:03:36.110> taking<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.590> end<00:03:36.830> and<00:03:37.569> flipping<00:03:38.569> it

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
you just taking that end and flipping it

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:46.080 
you just taking that end and flipping it
over<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:40.300> pulling<00:03:41.300> it<00:03:41.569> through<00:03:41.600> the<00:03:42.819> loop<00:03:44.590> and

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
over and pulling it through the loop and

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:53.310 
over and pulling it through the loop and
voila<00:03:47.680> let<00:03:48.680> me<00:03:48.800> just<00:03:49.010> see<00:03:49.250> if<00:03:49.400> I<00:03:49.550> did<00:03:49.610> it<00:03:49.880> right

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.330 

yeah<00:03:54.320> that<00:03:54.650> looks<00:03:54.860> good

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.100 

see<00:03:58.340> you<00:03:58.430> can't<00:03:58.670> even<00:03:58.910> detect<00:03:59.360> the<00:03:59.600> elastic

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
see you can't even detect the elastic

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.430 
see you can't even detect the elastic
band<00:04:00.350> so<00:04:01.340> that<00:04:01.370> makes<00:04:01.760> it<00:04:01.940> even<00:04:02.209> nicer<00:04:05.410> alright

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
band so that makes it even nicer alright

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.699 
band so that makes it even nicer alright
and<00:04:06.769> in<00:04:07.069> the<00:04:07.220> end<00:04:07.340> I'll<00:04:07.700> just<00:04:08.000> spray<00:04:08.300> a<00:04:08.709> little

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
and in the end I'll just spray a little

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.920 
and in the end I'll just spray a little
bit<00:04:09.830> about<00:04:10.040> that<00:04:10.340> just<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.239> hold<00:04:11.450> up<00:04:11.690> better

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
bit about that just to hold up better

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:20.949 
bit about that just to hold up better
for<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.500> day<00:04:16.479> and<00:04:17.479> that<00:04:17.889> is<00:04:18.889> it<00:04:19.780> see<00:04:20.780> I<00:04:20.810> told
