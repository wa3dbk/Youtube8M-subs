this is obviously the receiving end of
the<00:02:17.299> wireless<00:02:18.299> redstone<00:02:18.930> line<00:02:19.610> now<00:02:20.610> we<00:02:20.940> need

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
the wireless redstone line now we need

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.979 
the wireless redstone line now we need
the<00:02:21.629> transmitter<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:23.720> for<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.840> you're

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
the transmitter and for that you're

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.180 
the transmitter and for that you're
gonna<00:02:25.080> want<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.409> do<00:02:25.470> pretty<00:02:25.739> much<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.010> same

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
gonna want to do pretty much the same

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.820 
gonna want to do pretty much the same
recipe<00:02:26.459> except<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.209> time<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.830> transceivers

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
recipe except this time the transceivers

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.369 
recipe except this time the transceivers
not<00:02:29.010> into<00:02:29.220> Bowl<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.959> get<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.170> wireless

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
not into Bowl and you get the wireless

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:37.729 
not into Bowl and you get the wireless
transmitter<00:02:33.410> okay<00:02:34.700> now<00:02:35.700> we<00:02:36.120> are<00:02:36.150> going<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.959> go

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
transmitter okay now we are going to go

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:49.339 
transmitter okay now we are going to go
down<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.489> test<00:02:39.329> this<00:02:39.569> out<00:02:40.310> out<00:02:47.930> just<00:02:48.930> going<00:02:49.260> to

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
down and test this out out just going to

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:50.839 
down and test this out out just going to
run<00:02:49.530> over<00:02:49.650> here<00:02:49.950> where<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.220> made<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.430> bit<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.760> a

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
run over here where I made a bit of a

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:58.160 
run over here where I made a bit of a
test<00:02:51.060> site<00:02:53.629> as<00:02:54.629> you<00:02:54.690> see<00:02:55.109> here<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.440> have<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:57.170> bit

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
test site as you see here I have a bit

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.050 
test site as you see here I have a bit
of<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.349> test<00:02:58.590> setup<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.690> first<00:03:00.690> I'm<00:03:01.079> actually

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
of a test setup and first I'm actually

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.089 
of a test setup and first I'm actually
going<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.470> make<00:03:04.470> a<00:03:04.530> red<00:03:04.739> stone<00:03:04.950> torch<00:03:05.280> for<00:03:05.579> this

flowing tree we're going to make normal

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.970 
flowing tree we're going to make normal
sticks

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.350 
okay anyways as you can see here I have
two<00:03:22.230> transmitters<00:03:24.200> first<00:03:25.200> let<00:03:25.530> me<00:03:25.560> explain

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
two transmitters first let me explain

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.320 
two transmitters first let me explain
how<00:03:27.360> these<00:03:27.540> work<00:03:28.110> let<00:03:28.290> me<00:03:28.349> just<00:03:28.500> put<00:03:28.650> the

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
how these work let me just put the

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.250 
how these work let me just put the
transceiver<00:03:30.330> down<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.590> receiver<00:03:32.069> and<00:03:33.260> as

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
transceiver down and the receiver and as

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.380 
transceiver down and the receiver and as
you<00:03:34.380> can<00:03:34.470> see<00:03:34.530> here<00:03:34.860> they're<00:03:35.130> kind<00:03:35.489> of<00:03:35.580> the

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
you can see here they're kind of the

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.449 
you can see here they're kind of the
objects<00:03:37.080> that<00:03:37.170> we<00:03:37.290> made<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.680> they've<00:03:38.250> got

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
objects that we made and they've got

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.780 
objects that we made and they've got
numbers<00:03:38.760> over<00:03:39.330> here<00:03:40.069> now<00:03:41.069> these<00:03:41.220> numbers<00:03:41.459> if

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
numbers over here now these numbers if

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.000 
numbers over here now these numbers if
you<00:03:41.880> right-click<00:03:42.090> on<00:03:42.420> them<00:03:42.569> will<00:03:43.200> give<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:43.500> a

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
you right-click on them will give you a

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.460 
you right-click on them will give you a
frequency<00:03:44.700> now<00:03:45.480> you<00:03:45.540> can<00:03:45.900> make<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.200> frequency

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
frequency now you can make the frequency

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.539 
frequency now you can make the frequency
whatever<00:03:47.160> number<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:47.910> want<00:03:47.940> really<00:03:48.420> I<00:03:49.549> guess

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
whatever number you want really I guess

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:56.150 
whatever number you want really I guess
it<00:03:50.670> goes<00:03:50.790> up<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.060> five<00:03:51.209> thousand<00:03:52.160> and<00:03:55.099> okay<00:03:56.099> you

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
it goes up to five thousand and okay you

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.069 
it goes up to five thousand and okay you
can<00:03:56.370> just<00:03:56.519> kind<00:03:56.880> of<00:03:56.940> pick<00:03:57.390> whatever<00:03:57.660> number

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
can just kind of pick whatever number

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.360 
can just kind of pick whatever number
you<00:03:58.170> want<00:03:58.349> I<00:03:58.440> guess<00:03:58.910> so<00:04:00.260> let's<00:04:01.260> just<00:04:01.560> put<00:04:02.130> this

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
you want I guess so let's just put this

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:09.229 
you want I guess so let's just put this
one<00:04:02.430> at<00:04:03.709> sixteen<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:06.769> yeah<00:04:07.769> so<00:04:08.760> the

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
one at sixteen and yeah so the

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.240 
one at sixteen and yeah so the
transmitter<00:04:09.660> is<00:04:09.840> now<00:04:09.870> at<00:04:10.079> frequency<00:04:10.709> sixteen

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
transmitter is now at frequency sixteen

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.020 
transmitter is now at frequency sixteen
so<00:04:11.880> it<00:04:12.299> will<00:04:12.510> only<00:04:12.810> work<00:04:13.730> it'll<00:04:14.730> only<00:04:14.819> be

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
so it will only work it'll only be

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.789 
so it will only work it'll only be
received<00:04:15.510> by<00:04:15.930> an<00:04:16.470> object<00:04:16.950> that<00:04:17.100> is<00:04:17.160> at<00:04:17.579> 350<00:04:18.180> 16

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
received by an object that is at 350 16

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.979 
received by an object that is at 350 16
cause<00:04:19.799> if<00:04:19.950> I<00:04:20.039> our<00:04:20.160> power<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.459> this<00:04:20.720> not<00:04:21.720> receive

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
cause if I our power to this not receive

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.370 
cause if I our power to this not receive
power<00:04:22.639> however<00:04:23.639> if<00:04:23.970> I<00:04:24.030> were<00:04:24.180> to<00:04:24.270> take<00:04:24.450> wireless

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
power however if I were to take wireless

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.340 
power however if I were to take wireless
receiver<00:04:25.830> right<00:04:26.130> click<00:04:26.310> on<00:04:26.460> it<00:04:26.639> and<00:04:27.110> set<00:04:28.110> this

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
receiver right click on it and set this

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.730 
receiver right click on it and set this
to<00:04:28.590> 16<00:04:29.039> then<00:04:29.789> these<00:04:30.300> two<00:04:30.600> are<00:04:30.740> nested

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
to 16 then these two are nested

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.469 
to 16 then these two are nested
wirelessly<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:32.580> if<00:04:32.970> I<00:04:33.090> were<00:04:33.210> to<00:04:33.240> put<00:04:33.419> the

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
wirelessly and if I were to put the

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.180 
wirelessly and if I were to put the
torch<00:04:33.690> down<00:04:33.720> here<00:04:34.139> this<00:04:34.860> would<00:04:35.070> become

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
torch down here this would become

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.090 
torch down here this would become
powered<00:04:35.690> and<00:04:37.700> also<00:04:38.700> I<00:04:39.450> don't<00:04:40.260> believe<00:04:40.650> there

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
powered and also I don't believe there

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.719 
powered and also I don't believe there
is<00:04:41.130> a<00:04:41.850> range<00:04:42.780> for<00:04:43.139> distance<00:04:43.530> on<00:04:43.680> this<00:04:43.830> thing<00:04:44.100> or

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
is a range for distance on this thing or

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:50.540 
is a range for distance on this thing or
at<00:04:45.270> least<00:04:45.300> I've<00:04:46.020> managed<00:04:46.530> to<00:04:46.710> go<00:04:46.889> a<00:04:47.510> good<00:04:49.550> 300

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
at least I've managed to go a good 300

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.659 
at least I've managed to go a good 300
400<00:04:51.030> blocks<00:04:51.270> and<00:04:51.660> have<00:04:51.870> no<00:04:52.139> trouble<00:04:52.590> with<00:04:52.830> the

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
400 blocks and have no trouble with the

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:58.159 
400 blocks and have no trouble with the
signal<00:04:54.120> being<00:04:55.160> taken<00:04:56.160> away<00:04:56.539> well<00:04:57.539> as<00:04:57.720> long<00:04:57.960> as

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
signal being taken away well as long as

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.370 
signal being taken away well as long as
the<00:04:58.820> chunk<00:04:59.820> is<00:04:59.940> spawn<00:05:00.270> I<00:05:00.570> think<00:05:00.960> you<00:05:01.080> have<00:05:01.229> no

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
the chunk is spawn I think you have no

I've got in the iron door here and it's
got<00:05:14.070> a<00:05:14.130> receiver<00:05:14.550> on<00:05:14.820> one<00:05:15.470> and<00:05:16.470> it<00:05:16.740> has<00:05:16.860> two

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
got a receiver on one and it has two

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:19.700 
got a receiver on one and it has two
transmitters<00:05:17.570> one<00:05:18.570> with<00:05:18.840> frequency<00:05:19.320> one<00:05:19.500> and

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
transmitters one with frequency one and

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.700 
transmitters one with frequency one and
one<00:05:19.830> with<00:05:19.950> frequency<00:05:20.430> two<00:05:20.960> now<00:05:21.960> I<00:05:21.990> could<00:05:22.470> quiz

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
one with frequency two now I could quiz

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.700 
one with frequency two now I could quiz
you<00:05:22.830> guys<00:05:23.010> on<00:05:23.370> which<00:05:23.849> one<00:05:24.090> will<00:05:24.390> make<00:05:24.470> the<00:05:25.470> iron

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
you guys on which one will make the iron

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.190 
you guys on which one will make the iron
door<00:05:25.830> open<00:05:26.250> but<00:05:26.940> I'm<00:05:27.630> sure<00:05:27.870> it's<00:05:28.020> in<00:05:28.080> the

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
door open but I'm sure it's in the

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.350 
door open but I'm sure it's in the
garden<00:05:28.470> it<00:05:28.530> could<00:05:28.650> figure<00:05:28.800> that<00:05:29.010> out<00:05:29.180> so<00:05:30.180> yeah

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
garden it could figure that out so yeah

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.960 
garden it could figure that out so yeah
I'm<00:05:30.479> gonna<00:05:30.599> put<00:05:30.810> it<00:05:30.870> on<00:05:30.930> too<00:05:31.580> and<00:05:32.580> as<00:05:32.669> you<00:05:32.849> can

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.440 
guess nothing happened so if you thought
it<00:05:36.510> was<00:05:36.630> going<00:05:36.750> to<00:05:36.870> work

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
it was going to work

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.690 
it was going to work
now<00:05:39.450> if<00:05:39.510> I<00:05:39.659> were<00:05:39.720> to<00:05:39.780> put<00:05:39.930> it<00:05:40.020> on<00:05:40.080> one<00:05:40.550> the<00:05:41.550> door

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:41.700 
now if I were to put it on one the door

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:48.230 
now if I were to put it on one the door
opens<00:05:42.919> look<00:05:43.919> at<00:05:45.020> open<00:05:46.159> without<00:05:47.159> you<00:05:47.340> being
