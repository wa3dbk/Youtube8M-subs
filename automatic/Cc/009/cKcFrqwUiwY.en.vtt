guns that kills George Romero the
fastest<00:02:19.920> i<00:02:20.010> believe<00:02:20.280> it's<00:02:20.430> about<00:02:20.670> 40<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.630> 50

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
fastest i believe it's about 40 to 50

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.750 
fastest i believe it's about 40 to 50
shots<00:02:22.350> in<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.650> head<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:23.100> George<00:02:23.310> Romero<00:02:23.610> which

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
shots in the head to George Romero which

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.880 
shots in the head to George Romero which
may<00:02:23.940> sound<00:02:24.270> like<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.480> lot<00:02:24.510> but<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:25.410> really<00:02:25.650> isn't

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
may sound like a lot but it really isn't

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.610 
may sound like a lot but it really isn't
because<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.580> full<00:02:27.209> ray<00:02:27.420> gun<00:02:27.690> won't<00:02:27.930> kill<00:02:28.260> George

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.800 
because a full ray gun won't kill George
Romero<00:02:29.070> may<00:02:29.730> be<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.880> pack<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.150> punch<00:02:30.450> Bray<00:02:30.630> gun

Romero may be a pack a punch Bray gun

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.660 
Romero may be a pack a punch Bray gun
will<00:02:30.990> but<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.200> full<00:02:31.620> normal<00:02:32.100> ray<00:02:32.250> gun<00:02:32.490> won't

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
will but a full normal ray gun won't

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.699
