00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:15.269
 yes hello my sweet fresh tv has me 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.550
 asked when will come back unboxing and 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.850
 synonymous my question what I box because 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.500
 should nothing strange and I have there 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.420
 let my head play a little 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.119
 I thought okay I do everything for 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.189
 my dear ones and if there is nothing 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.960
 current to boxing then gives 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.809
 always something for me 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.170
 box and this package came today 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.879
 with the post office and I still think so 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.739
 Do not say what that is for 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.020
 is a little secret project but me 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.100
 can still show you what's inside 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.379
 Unfortunately I do not have the old one 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.329
 original model got it again 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.289
 says again what to do with retro so much 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.910
 I can say that's not all 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:10.229
 bring where you plugged module but 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:12.299
 incidentally with sd card I think if 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:19.909
 he happens to be watching a subscriber 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:22.320
 I am to be sent to marseille 5 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.150
 if you have some retro card after it 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.770
 want to turn me on later my 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:32.460
 Postfach I look there is not under 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:34.619
 the video war and the departure already 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.439
 who is it I do not believe that we 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.950
 still paper 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:43.590
 Here we have two packages 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.210
 the first package that could do a lot 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:51.320
 power 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:55.600
 there are 23 bands in the sega mega 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:59.000
 drive style yes that belong to it and or 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.940
 yes, the one even has juice lights 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.380
 Unfortunately, the lamb does not exist 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.070
 you can also search player 1 player two 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:11.000
 groups are namely the over the radio 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:15.860
 and something occurs here which is a 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.180
 great thing and it is the sega 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.570
 mega drive in total mini tiny 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.640
 modeled after the sega it used to be 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.900
 I actually liked that 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.720
 but also here with 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.120
 velcro fastener 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.610
 then there is such a small waver here 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.120
 a manual is called sega mega 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.760
 drive or seehofer or in some 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:46.310
 I have read other regions seeger 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:48.500
 firefox and yes that's it 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.000
 I still have an SD card in it 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.050
 not if it is standard 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.810
 two gigabytes 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.300
 There are also 20 games preprogrammed 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.200
 and then we'll see, I 'll do it 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:04.550
 look quietly the attack here unfortunately 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:08.950
 the battery is all on but not so well 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:12.290
 there we have what we start my game 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.840
 Alex Kidd wanted it like erotic comics 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.630

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.840

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.200

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.350
 bonn instead 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.010
 you can already hear the sound a bit 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.710
 again that's because I'm full 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.030
 turned up and because the battery 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.310
 certainly not so full 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.400
 because the land is and it actually is 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.160
 No longer can one say so 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.070
 and yes it may be that it is one 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.470
 small display is really mini 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:23.190
 look how big my fingers are when 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.510
 I will rehearse there now I will have 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.680
 I'm actually bigger now 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:30.360
 thought maybe I do too 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.990
 a review but only that you see 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.580
 an unboxing haha yes oh, up here 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.660
 even a green light maybe 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.280
 that is for the juice usb connection 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.900
 and so on I can get closer 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.860
 if I have such a small one 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:50.070
 test make something with unboxing yet 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.380
 while a mini usb cable 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.060
 there you can take this up and 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.630
 then we have an av connection 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.450
 and that 's it with the unboxing me 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:04.020
 I hope I have fresh tv really great 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:07.890

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.730
 normal mega drive I'm curious 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.410

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.180
