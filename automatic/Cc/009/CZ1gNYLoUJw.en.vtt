operates there's a couple of things that
makes<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.759> an<00:02:03.450> interesting<00:02:03.780> knife<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.430> we

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
makes this an interesting knife and we

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.510 
makes this an interesting knife and we
will<00:02:05.670> I'll<00:02:06.630> try<00:02:07.140> not<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.409> bring<00:02:07.799> up<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.280> me

cough similarities

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.610 
cough similarities
because<00:02:11.810> I'll<00:02:11.900> do<00:02:12.020> that<00:02:12.110> in<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.260> separate<00:02:12.530> video

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
because I'll do that in a separate video

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.500 
because I'll do that in a separate video
but<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.370> definitely<00:02:13.760> will<00:02:13.880> bring<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.180> up<00:02:14.300> in

but I definitely will bring it up in
some<00:02:14.810> points<00:02:15.170> but<00:02:15.590> this<00:02:15.710> is<00:02:15.890> an<00:02:15.980> interesting

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
some points but this is an interesting

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.060 
some points but this is an interesting
knife<00:02:16.580> because<00:02:17.530> it's<00:02:18.530> not<00:02:18.710> what<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:18.980> would

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
use a coil spring it uses the classic

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.410 
use a coil spring it uses the classic

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
leaf springs two of them like I just

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.440 
leaf springs two of them like I just
mentioned<00:02:29.930> before<00:02:30.020> and<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:31.190> uses<00:02:31.370> this<00:02:31.760> lever

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
mentioned before and it uses this lever

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.140 
mentioned before and it uses this lever
lock<00:02:32.690> system<00:02:33.140> so<00:02:33.710> basically<00:02:34.190> when<00:02:34.730> you<00:02:34.760> lift

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
lock system so basically when you lift

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.320 
lock system so basically when you lift
this<00:02:35.360> up<00:02:35.740> it<00:02:36.740> hits<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:39.010> I'm<00:02:40.010> not<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.580> guard<00:02:40.940> with

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
this up it hits the I'm not a guard with

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.810 
this up it hits the I'm not a guard with
this<00:02:41.510> lip<00:02:41.810> right<00:02:42.050> there<00:02:42.220> which<00:02:43.220> provides<00:02:43.670> a

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
this lip right there which provides a

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.020 
this lip right there which provides a
pivot<00:02:44.150> point<00:02:44.830> against<00:02:45.830> another<00:02:46.250> spring<00:02:46.730> that

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
pivot point against another spring that

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.540 
pivot point against another spring that
holds<00:02:47.270> this<00:02:47.690> into<00:02:47.990> place<00:02:48.230> that<00:02:48.920> pulls<00:02:49.220> up<00:02:49.430> a

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
holds this into place that pulls up a

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.060 
holds this into place that pulls up a
pin<00:02:49.850> which<00:02:50.270> allows<00:02:50.630> the<00:02:50.990> blade<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.290> go<00:02:51.680> free

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
pin which allows the blade to go free

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.270 
pin which allows the blade to go free
then<00:02:52.880> when<00:02:53.210> you<00:02:53.360> close<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:54.020> blade<00:02:54.230> that<00:02:55.010> pin

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
then when you close the blade that pin

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.690 
then when you close the blade that pin
goes<00:02:55.520> inside<00:02:55.910> locking<00:02:56.630> in<00:02:56.750> place<00:02:57.550> pull<00:02:58.550> it

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
goes inside locking in place pull it

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.850 
goes inside locking in place pull it
down<00:02:58.910> as<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.660> safety<00:02:59.930> you<00:03:00.140> can<00:03:00.320> see<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.680> lip

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
down as the safety you can see the lip

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.770 
down as the safety you can see the lip
right<00:03:01.010> there<00:03:01.070> then<00:03:01.820> when<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:02.120> lift<00:03:02.360> it<00:03:02.510> up<00:03:02.600> and

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
right there then when you lift it up and

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.210 
right there then when you lift it up and
you<00:03:02.840> do<00:03:02.960> the<00:03:03.080> same<00:03:03.260> thing<00:03:03.560> you<00:03:03.770> anchor<00:03:04.130> it

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
you do the same thing you anchor it

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.130 
you do the same thing you anchor it
right<00:03:04.550> there<00:03:04.730> on<00:03:04.850> that<00:03:05.000> lip<00:03:05.240> it's<00:03:05.690> gonna<00:03:05.810> pull

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
right there on that lip it's gonna pull

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.220 
right there on that lip it's gonna pull
the<00:03:06.290> pin<00:03:06.500> up<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:07.150> allow<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.210> try<00:03:09.140> and

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
the pin up and allow the try and

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.600 
the pin up and allow the try and
consistent<00:03:09.650> camera<00:03:10.040> without<00:03:10.160> hitting<00:03:10.460> my

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
afford expensive knives and they copy it

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.490 
afford expensive knives and they copy it
to<00:04:16.220> make<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:16.669> cheaper<00:04:17.120> version<00:04:17.150> so<00:04:18.109> that<00:04:18.140> people

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
to make a cheaper version so that people

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.710 
to make a cheaper version so that people
that<00:04:18.620> can't<00:04:18.830> afford<00:04:18.890> the<00:04:19.280> real<00:04:19.430> deal<00:04:19.700> can<00:04:20.450> buy

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
that can't afford the real deal can buy

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.330 
that can't afford the real deal can buy
the<00:04:21.260> cheaper<00:04:21.799> version

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
the cheaper version

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.180 
the cheaper version
and<00:04:24.000> rock<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.200> roll<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.380> that's<00:04:25.770> what<00:04:26.010> you

and rock and roll and that's what you

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.680 
and rock and roll and that's what you
know<00:04:26.310> all<00:04:26.430> these<00:04:26.580> Chinese<00:04:26.820> copies<00:04:27.450> it's

know all these Chinese copies it's

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.659 
know all these Chinese copies it's
that's<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.620> principle<00:04:29.070> they're<00:04:29.220> based<00:04:29.430> off

deal some more than others
some<00:04:34.380> are<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.530> little<00:04:34.710> closer<00:04:34.919> in<00:04:35.190> price<00:04:35.460> and

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
some are a little closer in price and

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.570 
some are a little closer in price and
quality<00:04:36.260> some<00:04:37.260> are<00:04:37.380> farther<00:04:37.740> away<00:04:37.830> but<00:04:38.220> they

quality some are farther away but they
all<00:04:38.790> are<00:04:39.090> cheaper<00:04:39.540> and<00:04:39.780> more<00:04:40.410> inexpensive

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
all are cheaper and more inexpensive

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.680 
all are cheaper and more inexpensive
than<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:42.270> real<00:04:42.450> deal<00:04:42.720> now<00:04:42.960> with<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:44.070> me<00:04:44.250> cough

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
than the real deal now with the me cough

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.000 
than the real deal now with the me cough
it's<00:04:45.690> completely<00:04:46.139> different<00:04:46.470> because<00:04:46.650> they

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
it's completely different because they

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.390 
it's completely different because they
have<00:04:47.160> taken<00:04:47.370> a<00:04:47.880> fairly<00:04:48.690> simple<00:04:49.530> plane<00:04:50.070> knife

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
have taken a fairly simple plane knife

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.600 
have taken a fairly simple plane knife
and<00:04:51.169> an<00:04:52.169> inexpensive<00:04:52.740> knife<00:04:53.100> and<00:04:53.430> they

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
and an inexpensive knife and they

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.180 
and an inexpensive knife and they
upgraded<00:04:54.240> everything<00:04:54.630> micro<00:04:55.260> textile<00:04:55.889> and

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
upgraded everything micro textile and

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.960 
upgraded everything micro textile and
actually<00:04:57.060> turned<00:04:57.330> it<00:04:57.510> into<00:04:57.690> a<00:04:57.900> high-end

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
actually turned it into a high-end

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.050 
actually turned it into a high-end
automatic<00:04:59.970> knife<00:05:00.150> as<00:05:00.479> opposed<00:05:00.990> to<00:05:01.200> a<00:05:02.190> cheaper

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
automatic knife as opposed to a cheaper

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.390 
automatic knife as opposed to a cheaper
automatic<00:05:03.900> knife<00:05:04.050> so<00:05:04.410> that<00:05:04.590> is<00:05:04.950> quite<00:05:05.070> unique

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
automatic knife so that is quite unique

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.860 
automatic knife so that is quite unique

but<00:06:30.419> this<00:06:30.660> particular<00:06:30.870> design<00:06:31.590> is<00:06:31.919> still

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
but this particular design is still

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.440 
but this particular design is still

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:38.420 
company
created<00:06:36.840> it<00:06:36.960> so<00:06:37.169> it's<00:06:37.710> a<00:06:37.770> little<00:06:37.949> bit<00:06:38.069> of<00:06:38.309> a

created it so it's a little bit of a
different<00:06:38.879> story<00:06:39.090> so<00:06:39.749> anyways<00:06:40.050> I<00:06:40.199> don't<00:06:40.259> know

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:40.439 
different story so anyways I don't know

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
that they were kind of taking the design

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.179 
that they were kind of taking the design
