00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
that void for me was to return back to

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
off a battlefield and I think it was a

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.160 
off a battlefield and I think it was a

again it was the only thing that ever

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.880 
again it was the only thing that ever
mattered<00:03:03.860> to<00:03:03.860> me<00:03:04.130> it<00:03:04.400> was<00:03:04.459> my<00:03:04.700> driving<00:03:05.060> force

during my recovery my experience and how

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.660 
during my recovery my experience and how
it<00:03:11.810> is<00:03:11.900> shaped<00:03:12.200> me<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:12.739> don't<00:03:13.190> think<00:03:13.430> it<00:03:13.550> has

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
it is shaped me I don't think it has

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.400 
it is shaped me I don't think it has
