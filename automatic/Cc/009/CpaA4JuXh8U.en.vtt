00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
long arms in the bench press I actually

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.630 
long arms in the bench press I actually
had<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.720> couple<00:00:28.289> comments<00:00:28.650> on<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.189> one<00:00:29.460> guy

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
determine that if that's a problem of

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.310 
determine that if that's a problem of
yours<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.620> that's<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.860> great<00:00:38.070> problem<00:00:38.309> have

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
yours and that's a great problem have

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.250 
yours and that's a great problem have
but<00:00:41.120> you<00:00:42.120> know<00:00:42.210> if<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:42.750> long<00:00:42.989> arms

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
but you know if you have long arms

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.630 
but you know if you have long arms
you've<00:00:43.469> probably<00:00:43.620> kind<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:43.980> realized<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.550> at

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
you've probably kind of realized it at

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.270 
you've probably kind of realized it at
this<00:00:44.789> point<00:00:45.230> if<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.350> have<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.680> ask<00:00:46.800> them<00:00:47.129> your

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
this point if you have to ask them your

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.779 
this point if you have to ask them your
arms<00:00:47.700> probably<00:00:48.090> aren't<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.420> long

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
arms probably aren't that long

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.700 
arms probably aren't that long
the<00:00:50.789> other<00:00:51.329> thing<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.719> it's<00:00:51.930> not<00:00:52.079> just<00:00:52.140> long

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
the other thing is it's not just long

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.970 
the other thing is it's not just long
arms<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:54.270> kind<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.600> long<00:00:54.840> limbs<00:00:55.289> along

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
arms it's it's kind of long limbs along

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.010 
arms it's it's kind of long limbs along
with<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.460> slender<00:00:57.109> slim<00:00:58.109> physique<00:00:58.980> or<00:01:00.020> we're

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
with a slender slim physique or we're

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.830 
with a slender slim physique or we're
not<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.260> very<00:01:01.590> thick<00:01:02.010> build<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.879> that'll<00:01:03.629> lead

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
not a very thick build and that'll lead

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.800 
not a very thick build and that'll lead
to<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.409> huge<00:01:05.339> range<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.729> motion<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.390> your

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
to a huge range of motion in your

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.690 
to a huge range of motion in your
benchpress<00:01:07.229> not<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> lead<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> sucky

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
benchpress not a lead to a sucky

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.250 
benchpress not a lead to a sucky
benchpress<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.420> that'll<00:01:09.659> lead<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> lot<00:01:10.229> of

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
benchpress and that'll lead to a lot of

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.160 
benchpress and that'll lead to a lot of
problems<00:01:10.580> so<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.729> guy<00:01:12.000> here<00:01:13.159> his<00:01:14.159> name<00:01:14.490> is

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
arms you can build up a huge tricep that

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.639 
arms you can build up a huge tricep that
was<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.719> what<00:01:59.060> but<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:01.049> know<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.290> kind<00:02:01.560> of

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
was like what but you know it kind of

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.260 
was like what but you know it kind of
makes<00:02:01.799> sense<00:02:01.920> what<00:02:02.280> he<00:02:02.369> was<00:02:02.490> basically<00:02:02.939> saying

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
makes sense what he was basically saying

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.030 
makes sense what he was basically saying
is<00:02:03.570> like<00:02:03.750> you're<00:02:03.990> aren't<00:02:04.320> because<00:02:04.649> your<00:02:04.799> arm

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
is like you're aren't because your arm

more<00:05:39.750> bicep<00:05:40.289> work<00:05:40.530> because<00:05:40.770> I've<00:05:40.890> always

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
more bicep work because I've always

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.040 
more bicep work because I've always
noticed<00:05:41.370> the<00:05:41.610> difference<00:05:42.000> when<00:05:42.660> I<00:05:42.690> did<00:05:43.020> it

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
noticed the difference when I did it

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.480 
noticed the difference when I did it
because<00:05:43.440> it<00:05:43.560> helped<00:05:43.830> balance<00:05:44.070> out<00:05:44.460> my

me like I said it kind of acts as a

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.900 
me like I said it kind of acts as a
