00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hello everyone, Kirill Serov and you 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.609
 I looked here a couple of days ago 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.309
 new anime 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.570
 rock era bakumatsu while only 5 came out 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.300
 series of 12 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.160
 but I looked 2 Syria and I like this 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.619
 I had enough at all to be honest not even 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.539
 I know how I mastered the second series probably 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.070
 just for the sake of review, but if we are 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.289
 quite honest, I still think that 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.960
 probably this anime is not quite a failure 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.640
 although yes I did not like it and there 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.650
 There are a couple of moments that generally 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.050
 caused me wildly and resentment 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.149
 but let's take it in order and as I said 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.430
 they are mine called rock era bakumatsu and 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.790
 I do not know for what history textbooks 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.010
 learned the creators that so portray this 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.410
 epoch can in a cartoon 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.320
 In general, the main character of this anime 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.360
 this guy who is dressed more like a clone 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.850
 who lagged behind the circus and lost his 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.070
 clown nose and washed away makeup and he has 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.140
 electric guitar with which he speaks 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.629
 city and annoying locals 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.059
 trying to conquer them with your music 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.820
 rock music that nobody has there yet 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.650
 and he heard all such a ruffian straight and 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.229
 violator because his music 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.000
 banned like any other music 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.040
 except what is officially recognized 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.170
 recognized by the government 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.630
 there music with which goes on tour 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.830
 several guys around the country are playing creepy 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.340
 popsyatina 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.650
 and maddening bunch of girls and now I 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.439
 tell you what it really is 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.540
 Bakumatsu era is a troubled time 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:33.750
 Japan covering the period from 1853 to 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.210
 1869 that is, this is the 19th century of the middle of 19 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.460
 century that is quite a long time ago and it was 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.890
 rather harsh time at the end of it 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.960
 period even started a civil war 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.939
 no, you are naturally cute 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.340
 boys singing terrible pop music 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.770
 and no more rockers who 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.490
 dressed like clowns if someone in 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.040
 real life at the time so dressed then 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.909
 I don't even know him probably would have been taken to 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.210
 dark corner 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.270
 would beat there with chopsticks and beat all 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.789
 dope 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.649
 and it is at least on this story 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.379
 about this guy would have ended well 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.110
 of course in the 19th century and there was no mention 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.239
 no rock music for rock reference 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.879
 Music began to emerge in the 50s 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:19.120
 twentieth century that is already almost through 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:22.000
 one hundred years after the era of bakumatsu and the beginning 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.760
 she originated in the United States but not in any way 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.099
 Japan and even if you imagine that the lesson 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.140
 began to appear just then in the era 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.569
 Bakumatsu then he would have looked anyway 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.150
 completely different not as shown in 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.880
 This anime and roughly as the middle 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.380
 twentieth century in america and in this anime 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.840
 he actually looks the same as 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.690
 modern pop rock in japan and with it 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.310
 here again the era of bakumatsu is unclear well and 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.370
 the most important thing that makes me the most 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.930
 finished off the fact that he had in this anime 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.579
 have electric guitar electric guitar in 19 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.680
 century of course 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:03:00.370
 electric lighting for example the beginning 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.530
 appear only after 1872 after 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.870
 incandescent invention is 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.389
 there is obtained 10 years after the end 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.549
 Bakumutsu era that is in this anime 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.049
 electricity is not even used 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.670
 Apparently the lighting is created using 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.609
 ordinary wax candles 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.049
 nude electric guitar is already playing and 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:21.549
 and she plays herself without connection 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.670
 combo in columns or even 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.410
 Now that the guitar published decent 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.359
 sounds of electric guitars on her need 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.670
 I don’t know 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.799
 to any sound source on their 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.160
 the word first kind of electric guitar was 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:38.560
 established in 1924 that is again 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.639
 a bunch of time after the end of an era 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.769
 bakumatsu 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.720
 Well, someone can say what are you 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.450
 pounced on this anime only type 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.980
 alternative japan everything matters in such 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.530
 If any absurdity can be called 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.750
 alternative and type prokanaet yes and why 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.970
 then you can just make that name 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.060
 It would be called as you like but just not 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.639
 anyway, even then there would be 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.700
 question with an electric guitar in general yes 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:06.040
 absurdity of children well, everything would be wrong 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.459
 bad if this anime would be 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.500
 interesting plot but it's not there no there 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.300
 interesting plot not to mention 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.340
 some tricks of history in 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.530
 take for example the most popular TV series 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.630
 attack of the titans who like you probably 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.730
 You know, I didn't much like it, but 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.920
 in spite of this i can't help but admit 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.270
 that there is very interesting and very 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.640
 unusual plot 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.670
 a bunch of unexpected turns spectacularly and 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.710
 action dynamics saturation all this 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.140
 there is in the anime attack of the titans 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.510
 but all this is completely absent in the anime 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.170
 rock era bakumatsu can in this them 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.450
 there are some other advantages you ask 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.220
 Well, I do n’t know, I didn’t find any 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.490
 maybe she likes a lover 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.980
 rock music can but i didn't like 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.380
 although I love rock music but in spite of 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.480
 all of the above I don't know exactly why 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.330
 but for some reason I do n't care 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.620
 this anime is one hundred percent failed i 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.230
 don't even rule out the fact that she 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.910
 someone really like 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.950
 it is quite possible to look likely if 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.110
 you want a lot of time and want to unleash 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.270
 your brain but as for me it's better just 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.300
 it will be more useful to look at the carpet 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.040
 unload the brain can be more interesting 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.930
 there are many other pictures in general 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.910
 good pictures which is better for this 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.230
 fit some people wrote that there 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.410
 good music for example 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.690
 probably agree but music alone 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.450
 not enough to watch anime and someone 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:32.390
 still wrote that this anime is so 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:34.940
 uprataya and stupid that it even cheers 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.070
 and I also understand such people sometimes 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.440
 you look something so crazy 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.390
 any kind of brainwashing you 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.700
 you understand that this is some kind of trash for example 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.640
 and still you watch and frighten it 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.050
 this yes, this also happens but to me 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.180
 In this case, for some reason, not at all 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.040
 I wanted to spend time on this case 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.680
 I'll see what is really worth 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.790
 good anime and better still go and write 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.669
 review script 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.270
 it will be more useful and more interesting even 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:01.220
 eg 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.870
 the first association that I have 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.550
 arises from the word bakutsatsu it 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.230
 completely different anime 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.620
 which is called the power struggle 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.990
 bakumatsu times no one's there forever 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.510
 really harsh shown 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.730
 reality is very close to that 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.700
 what most likely happened in this 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.060
 an era 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.820
 in reality, and this is historical 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.410
 them well she's a little more mystical there 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.620
 added to mystic 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:31.080
 but still it's just heaven and earth 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.610
 look rate and compare and quite 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.500
 not comedy if you want to again 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.540
 dispel something like unload 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.390
 brain then maybe for that course 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.670
 better fit rock era bakumatsu well and 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.830
 for today with you perhaps enough with me 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.420
 perhaps the first impressions too 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.130
 turned out to be rather unusual 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.200
 and combined with them trash 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.300
 Write in the comments as you well 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.280
 today's release and the anime itself 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.410
 if you dare to see it of course 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.240

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.990
 goodbye for now 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:06.090
 Well, by the way if someone else does not know 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.970
 Here is a wonderful T-shirt for me 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:12.360
 created 1 artist who draws on 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:14.430
 T-shirts on bags and even on his sneakers 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.290

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.420
 own sketch or agree with 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.650
 she she you think up something in 

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:21.270
