00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.689
 hello if laura sanchez in this video les 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.940
 will teach how to make this makeup 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:12.190
 super dark in the eyes 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.990
 I do it because I 've used it this moment 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.299
 to leave and they have asked me then to 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.130
 teach to do it and I will also show 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.599
 as a stack at the end recommending 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.340
 where can they get the clothes that I have 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.689
 put and already that what they like the 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.699
 video 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.500
 We started by putting a cream base 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.380
 for the area that we are going to put that era 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.420
 as dark or brown or as you want what 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.120
 matter is that it is in cream with the 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.890
 you can have the black shadow hold a lot 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.750
 better and will be more pigmented 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.750
 they put it on the entire mobile eyelid what 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.400
 important that afterwards a 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.130
 little bit of the edge 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.160
 now we are going to use a brown shadow 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.960
 neira sorry we put it concentrated 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.820
 brings the lashes closer and we're taking it 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.390
 up and from the top part clark 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.390
 blur 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.410
 we take almost it is under the eyebrow 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.500
 and we are blurring the edge a bit 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.850
 with the same brush as we put the base 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.230
 in cream underneath it will stay the same 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:14.440
 dark down and up less fragmented 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.840
 now let's use a shadow as a color 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.610
 cream to put it under the seat to 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.180
 light up a bit and keep blurring 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.180
 the cuts 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.380
 but if it has to be a clean brush 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.080
 so that we are not going to give as the part 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.020
 from above your mind 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.880
 now we put pencil in the line of the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.300
 tabs below can be dark blue 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.910
 black paper because if we go to put 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.470
 like the black shadow also use the 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.470
 paint so they are more pigmentation 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.210
 we enter the tabs 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:52.020
 and how my eyes are small that pencil 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.450
 white sees in the line of the eyelashes of 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.140
 down if we leave you are very large can 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:04.670
 fill this part is also in black 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:06.890
 Now we clean with a cloth 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.350
 remove makeup 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:19.520
 cream to expand and now if we can 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:21.510
 make the base that we are going to light up with 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.560
 loose powder 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.560
 and translucent 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.180
 now we put the blush I'm using a 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.010
 scene that have the brightness and 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.120
 We put on the cheekbones 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.120
 we walk from above 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:44.050
 and we put one the fields of blink 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.040
 let it dry between caracas and also in 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.040
 the districts below 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.950
 in the mouth because it also sounds 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.530
 and I put it with my finger so that 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.129
 the color will be so strong 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.129
 and is doing it 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.790

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:14.280
