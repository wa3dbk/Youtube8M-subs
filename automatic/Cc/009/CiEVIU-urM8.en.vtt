00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.320
 Hey, youtube group today. I'm 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.160
 bringing here another video of minecraft 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:29.310
 the arena and today I will show that the 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:32.830
 combat between the skeletons and the golem 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.989
 so let's get things going to be 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.379
 virtually the same drawing that will 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.000
 be and will be much more skeleton right 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:46.420
 the same amount of blood as this 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.460
 And that's it, that's it. 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.400
 Let's start here to spread to 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.350
 skeletons created the system that also 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.229
 to make it easier to put a 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.989
 audience will start 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:01.510
 It's when they become all I'm coming back 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.449
 It was very fast with this new 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.880
 system then let's see what skeletons 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.880
 Everyone seems agitated and I do not like 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.670
 will have so many chances so will not let 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.930
 I shake them a little more I'll put 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:23.140
 here one is no no can not are they me 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:27.270
 I'm even going to shoot myself in the middle and see 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.270
 How are they going to start fighting? 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:35.030
 they will definitely try to shoot at 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:38.180
 me is too much mess or turn the volume down 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.910
 Ready now, say a shot in the middle. 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.140
 Czech is not delighted 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.990
 so the damage is very weak what will not 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:54.230
 change much result 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:58.790
 Let's see, it's now, let's put it. 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:05.270
 here will not raise the sound again and 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:07.220
 now it begins 321 goes beyond and already 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.860
 it's worth gov is waiting for what? 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.930
 Look at this, man. I'm going to give it a shot. 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.830
 cat because he thinks that he 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.830
 A war will start. 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:23.140
 If that was the case 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.140
 He's shooting at me, he's fine. 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:32.299
 Now she says that he had so much 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:36.920
 fight or let's see it started the fight 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:41.540
 skeleton and it seems the goal and goes 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.540
 need help in vain said shame 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:51.639
 They do not have to see their lives to 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:54.230
 to lower the volume milta lutem z 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:56.659
 they run 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.000
 I think he's missing out on what 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:01.280
 so much damage it has already taken but also the 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.239
 skeletons are if taking self 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:09.439
 killing only by committing suicide in here 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:15.769
 very calm but here is always war 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:17.930
 so put it here but in the complete set the 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:24.669
 talent complete set everyone here already 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.669
 It's 7 full that way. 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:35.790
 I'm going to run a commentator now if it's 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.110
 What are you thinking about this fight? 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.040
 I think he got scared of me is 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.690
 very shy 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.280
 You 're what you're thinking about this fight. 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.110
 it is not 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.460
 There's a lot of Tokyo shot for fear of being 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.230
 It's okay, then let's go, yes it was. 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.330
 a choke in interviewing others and that 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.850
 You 're not calling the fight you're fighting. 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.650
 yes, talking to who is 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.260
 Watching you watching, I know. 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.220
 you are watching 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.710
 so the guy you're thinking of 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.570
 I fight, I find this fight a lot 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:10.530
 exciting I think the goal is going 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:15.390
 end up losing so let's go here like 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.640
 that such result golem gogh died a 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.860
 sip and died 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.489
 it seems that the golem will need a 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.489
 little help 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:30.480
 so let's see I think the second goal 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.510
 and manages to kill two goals in jajÃ¡ 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.730
 end it all 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:39.780
 good then the end of the fight and that golem already 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.760
 lost a life here in total the people 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:46.500
 will try a minimum of chances to 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:49.400
 he what I three more glue him that is 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.280
 who creates courage and does not go forward 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.639
 ready, now it's gone 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:58.190
 damn many shots 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:01.669
 Let's collect all these bones and these 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:05.680
 I do not want any wreck here. 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.680
 Come on and get it in here. 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.249
 the ball won the zombies without taking 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.490
 no damage 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:18.560
 but that one died in attack was well 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:24.210
 hard for him and he's got no brother 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:26.550
 Skeleton moves him in the face if he 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.939
 championing these skeletons 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:34.379
 if it does not work like that, it's kind of unfair 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:37.020
 good then the golem lost because of 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:40.490
 a super strategy of cancers these 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.490
 What are skeletons? 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:48.689
 but as he won he will win the 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:52.759
 skeleton head but will not stay in the 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:52.759
 top will also be down here 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:00.050
 so this is personal if you like the idea 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:03.120
 of the scoring match against the skeletons 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:06.839
 a like a favorite 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.150
 if they sign up the first time and that's it 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:13.110
 So let's end here with the words 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.580
 a just a spectator of the 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.400
 so I want you to find this fight 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.659
 that the other will be a microphone and that 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.729
 think of this fight 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:23.009
 Good, I thought this fight was a lot 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:24.060
 the first goal and it was over. 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.550
 dying 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:31.020
 but given that the second goal and ended 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:32.370
 winning then ending up with the 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.039
 his words 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.599
 I hope it leaves a like the favorite and if 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:44.180
 subscribe 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:44.180
 That 's it until the next video and spoke
