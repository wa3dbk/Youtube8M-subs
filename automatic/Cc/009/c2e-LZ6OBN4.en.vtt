00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.110 

well<00:00:04.950> I<00:00:04.980> think<00:00:05.220> just<00:00:05.400> being<00:00:05.549> more<00:00:05.759> consistent

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
well I think just being more consistent

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.560 
well I think just being more consistent
down<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.540> stretch<00:00:07.099> you<00:00:08.099> know<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:09.030> two<00:00:09.210> AFC

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
down the stretch you know the two AFC

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.959 
down the stretch you know the two AFC
championship<00:00:10.110> games<00:00:10.320> we<00:00:10.530> did<00:00:10.710> playing<00:00:11.309> we

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
championship games we did playing we

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.490 
championship games we did playing we
really<00:00:12.179> only<00:00:12.269> played<00:00:12.660> one<00:00:12.840> good<00:00:13.080> half<00:00:13.259> each

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
really only played one good half each

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.350 
really only played one good half each
game<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.280> was<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.519> first<00:00:14.670> half<00:00:14.969> against

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
game and it was the first half against

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.300 
game and it was the first half against
the<00:00:15.450> colts<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:16.260> know<00:00:16.379> three<00:00:16.650> years<00:00:16.859> ago<00:00:17.070> and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
the colts you know three years ago and

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.830 
the colts you know three years ago and
then<00:00:17.430> two<00:00:17.730> years<00:00:17.760> ago<00:00:18.000> against<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.510> steelers

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
then two years ago against the steelers

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.420 
then two years ago against the steelers
the<00:00:19.020> second<00:00:19.350> half<00:00:19.470> was<00:00:19.619> great<00:00:19.859> but<00:00:20.100> our<00:00:20.220> first

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
the second half was great but our first

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.189 
the second half was great but our first
half<00:00:20.640> we<00:00:21.090> put<00:00:21.270> ourselves<00:00:21.359> in<00:00:21.720> too<00:00:21.869> much<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.020> a

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
half we put ourselves in too much of a

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.870 
half we put ourselves in too much of a
hole<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.560> we<00:00:22.650> didn't<00:00:22.890> we<00:00:23.519> didn't<00:00:23.699> have<00:00:23.820> enough

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
hole so we didn't we didn't have enough

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.240 
hole so we didn't we didn't have enough
time<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.420> come<00:00:24.720> back<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.590> think<00:00:25.859> it's<00:00:26.160> going

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
time to come back and I think it's going

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.609 
time to come back and I think it's going
to<00:00:26.310> take<00:00:26.519> playing<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.090> complete<00:00:27.510> game<00:00:27.720> but<00:00:28.230> even

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
to take playing a complete game but even

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.500 
to take playing a complete game but even
before<00:00:28.949> all<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.970> know<00:00:30.060> we<00:00:30.179> got<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.390> get

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
before all that you know we got to get

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.659 
before all that you know we got to get
through<00:00:30.630> training<00:00:30.990> camp<00:00:31.140> first<00:00:31.579> you<00:00:32.579> know

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
through training camp first you know

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.639 
through training camp first you know
grow<00:00:32.880> as<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.030> team<00:00:33.120> first<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.930> then<00:00:34.079> we'll<00:00:34.440> see

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
grow as a team first and then we'll see

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.520 
grow as a team first and then we'll see
how<00:00:34.770> we'll<00:00:34.890> do<00:00:38.360> first<00:00:39.360> thing<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:40.200> know<00:00:40.290> my

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
how we'll do first thing you know my

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.889 
how we'll do first thing you know my
mind<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.219> new<00:00:41.460> playbook<00:00:41.670> with<00:00:42.180> our<00:00:42.750> new

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
mind is a new playbook with our new

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.450 
mind is a new playbook with our new
offensive<00:00:43.170> coordinator<00:00:43.410> coach<00:00:43.829> toronto<00:00:44.309> and

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
offensive coordinator coach toronto and

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.319 
offensive coordinator coach toronto and
that<00:00:45.360> first<00:00:45.809> chance<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.590> had<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.309> run<00:00:48.149> through

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
that first chance we had to run through

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.729 
that first chance we had to run through
those<00:00:48.420> plays<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:48.989> first<00:00:49.200> chance<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.590> heard

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
those plays in the first chance we heard

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.200 
those plays in the first chance we heard
it<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.010> thought<00:00:50.039> our<00:00:50.280> often<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.610> performed<00:00:51.000> very

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
it I thought our often is performed very

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.810 
it I thought our often is performed very
well<00:00:51.350> all<00:00:52.350> things<00:00:52.559> considered<00:00:52.730> against<00:00:53.730> a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
well all things considered against a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.990 
well all things considered against a
tough<00:00:54.000> defense<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.719> OTAs<00:00:55.230> but<00:00:55.910> you<00:00:56.910> know

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
tough defense in OTAs but you know

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.220 
tough defense in OTAs but you know
that's<00:00:57.149> that's<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.600> biggest<00:00:57.780> thing<00:00:57.989> is

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
that's that's the biggest thing is

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.580 
that's that's the biggest thing is
really<00:00:58.730> understanding<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.820> playbook<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
really understanding that playbook and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.389 
really understanding that playbook and
mastering<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.739> by<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.920> time<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.219> season

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
mastering it by the time the season

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.280 
mastering it by the time the season
comes<00:01:02.730> other<00:01:03.420> than<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.899> physical

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
comes other than that the physical

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.600 
comes other than that the physical

human<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.720> will<00:01:09.960> physically<00:01:10.439> will<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.830> ready

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
human so will physically will be ready

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.850 
human so will physically will be ready
and<00:01:11.270> and<00:01:12.270> then<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.869> matter<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.140> executing

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
and and then it's a matter of executing

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.820 
and and then it's a matter of executing
our<00:01:14.010> plays<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.640> playing<00:01:14.850> well

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
our plays and playing well

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.240 
our plays and playing well
I<00:01:17.900> think<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.080> was<00:01:19.140> another<00:01:19.380> chance<00:01:19.680> for<00:01:19.890> us<00:01:19.920> as

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
I think it was another chance for us as

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.010 
I think it was another chance for us as
offensive<00:01:21.120> skill<00:01:21.450> players<00:01:21.660> you<00:01:21.930> know

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
offensive skill players you know

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.170 
offensive skill players you know
receivers<00:01:22.590> tight<00:01:22.860> ends<00:01:23.160> running<00:01:23.430> backs<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
receivers tight ends running backs and

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.330 
receivers tight ends running backs and
quarterbacks<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:25.050> go<00:01:26.010> through<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
quarterbacks to go through the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.130 
quarterbacks to go through the
terminology<00:01:26.970> again<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.420> speak<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.780> language

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
terminology again to speak the language

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.810 
terminology again to speak the language
one<00:01:28.320> more<00:01:28.500> time<00:01:28.710> away<00:01:28.920> from<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.280> coaches<00:01:29.640> get

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
one more time away from the coaches get

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.570 
one more time away from the coaches get
a<00:01:29.850> chance<00:01:30.120> to<00:01:30.300> really<00:01:30.480> talk<00:01:31.320> about<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.250> amongst

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
a chance to really talk about it amongst

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.240 
a chance to really talk about it amongst
ourselves<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.230> understand<00:01:34.230> it<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.830> best<00:01:35.040> we

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
ourselves and understand it the best we

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.030 
ourselves and understand it the best we
could<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.670> think<00:01:36.440> given<00:01:37.440> us<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.770> gave<00:01:37.860> us<00:01:38.010> a

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
could I think given us it gave us a

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.440 
could I think given us it gave us a
chance<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.340> watch<00:01:38.550> them<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:38.910> film<00:01:39.210> from

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
chance to watch them of that film from

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.900 
chance to watch them of that film from
the<00:01:39.480> OTAs<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.260> had<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.530> completed<00:01:40.950> and

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
the OTAs that we had just completed and

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.580 
the OTAs that we had just completed and
reflect<00:01:42.330> on<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.510> lot<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.810> those<00:01:42.900> plays<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.470> that

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
reflect on a lot of those plays and that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.460

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
they really enjoyed it it's you know we

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.670 
they really enjoyed it it's you know we
were<00:02:49.090> so<00:02:49.270> close<00:02:49.420> a<00:02:49.540> couple<00:02:49.810> years<00:02:50.110> ago<00:02:50.170> with

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
were so close a couple years ago with

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.280 
were so close a couple years ago with
two<00:02:50.920> AFC<00:02:51.430> Championship<00:02:51.970> appearances<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:52.690> you

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
two AFC Championship appearances so you

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.990 
two AFC Championship appearances so you
know<00:02:53.380> we<00:02:53.920> know<00:02:54.040> what<00:02:54.190> it's<00:02:54.310> like<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.490> get<00:02:54.820> to

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
know we know what it's like to get to

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.850 
know we know what it's like to get to
that<00:02:55.120> point<00:02:55.360> we<00:02:55.600> just<00:02:55.630> gotta<00:02:55.990> get<00:02:56.530> over<00:02:56.650> the

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
that point we just gotta get over the

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.520 
that point we just gotta get over the
hump<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.690> that's<00:02:58.690> our<00:02:58.840> next<00:02:59.110> goal<00:02:59.260> but

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
hump and so that's our next goal but

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.380 
hump and so that's our next goal but
obviously<00:03:00.340> once<00:03:00.760> we<00:03:00.970> were<00:03:01.090> out<00:03:01.209> of<00:03:01.330> the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
obviously once we were out of the

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.760 
obviously once we were out of the
playoffs<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:01.959> know<00:03:01.990> that's<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.350> team<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.680> you

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
hope they play well but it was great to

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.910 
hope they play well but it was great to
see<00:03:07.330> that<00:03:07.510> last<00:03:07.930> year<00:03:08.080> at<00:03:08.200> nine<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:08.560> seven

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
see that last year at nine and seven

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.010 
see that last year at nine and seven
they<00:03:09.430> finish<00:03:09.459> their<00:03:09.880> season<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.480> really<00:03:10.840> take

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
they finish their season and really take

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.360 
they finish their season and really take
that<00:03:11.050> momentum<00:03:11.260> into<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.770> playoffs<00:03:12.130> and

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
that momentum into the playoffs and

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.699 
that momentum into the playoffs and
eventually<00:03:12.850> win<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.030> Super<00:03:13.239> Bowl<00:03:16.530> well<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:17.620> think

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
eventually win a Super Bowl well I think

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.280 
eventually win a Super Bowl well I think
