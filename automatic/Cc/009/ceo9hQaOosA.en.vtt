with these Japanese import cars in New
Zealand<00:00:19.510> is<00:00:19.750> that<00:00:20.020> the<00:00:20.260> radios<00:00:20.860> that<00:00:20.890> they

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
Zealand is that the radios that they

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.320 
Zealand is that the radios that they
come<00:00:21.400> from<00:00:22.380> tend<00:00:23.380> to<00:00:23.590> not<00:00:24.340> pick<00:00:24.580> up<00:00:24.730> our<00:00:25.150> local

come from tend to not pick up our local

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.410 
come from tend to not pick up our local
stations<00:00:25.990> obviously<00:00:26.560> and<00:00:27.460> so<00:00:27.970> one<00:00:28.210> of<00:00:28.240> the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
stations obviously and so one of the

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.630 
stations obviously and so one of the
things<00:00:28.630> that<00:00:28.840> I<00:00:28.930> wanted<00:00:29.529> to<00:00:29.650> do<00:00:29.860> here<00:00:30.250> was<00:00:30.610> to

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
things that I wanted to do here was to

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.420 
things that I wanted to do here was to
at<00:00:31.119> least<00:00:31.300> but<00:00:31.630> I<00:00:31.869> either<00:00:32.529> a<00:00:32.680> new<00:00:32.890> radio<00:00:33.250> or<00:00:33.400> a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
at least but I either a new radio or a

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.420 
at least but I either a new radio or a
band<00:00:33.730> expander<00:00:34.239> and<00:00:34.270> and<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:35.710> fairly

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:36.430 
band expander and and it's fairly

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.689 
band expander and and it's fairly
challenging<00:00:36.730> actually<00:00:37.449> getting<00:00:37.750> access<00:00:38.110> to

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
challenging actually getting access to

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.280 
challenging actually getting access to
the<00:00:39.699> radio<00:00:40.030> so<00:00:40.449> I<00:00:40.480> feel<00:00:40.690> like<00:00:40.720> quickly<00:00:41.080> make<00:00:41.260> a

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
the radio so I feel like quickly make a

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.110 
the radio so I feel like quickly make a
video<00:00:41.650> because<00:00:42.280> I<00:00:42.370> couldn't<00:00:42.640> find<00:00:42.790> anything

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
video because I couldn't find anything

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.660 
video because I couldn't find anything
online<00:00:43.269> that<00:00:43.660> describe<00:00:44.110> the<00:00:44.980> process<00:00:45.460> and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
online that describe the process and

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.110 
online that describe the process and
then<00:00:45.790> thereby<00:00:46.180> hopefully<00:00:47.699> help<00:00:48.699> someone<00:00:49.030> else

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
then thereby hopefully help someone else

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.939 
then thereby hopefully help someone else
out<00:00:49.420> who<00:00:49.659> was<00:00:49.870> struggling<00:00:50.530> with<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:50.920> same

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
out who was struggling with the same

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.350 
out who was struggling with the same
thing<00:00:51.309> so<00:00:52.030> the<00:00:52.360> the<00:00:52.659> first<00:00:52.870> step<00:00:53.019> was

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
thing so the the first step was

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.450 
thing so the the first step was
basically<00:00:55.360> your<00:00:55.510> objective<00:00:56.080> is<00:00:56.320> to<00:00:56.949> give<00:00:57.280> this

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
basically your objective is to give this

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.910 
basically your objective is to give this
thing<00:00:58.089> off<00:00:58.299> this<00:00:58.809> cover<00:00:59.199> which<00:00:59.500> basically

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
thing off this cover which basically

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.060 
thing off this cover which basically
goes<00:01:00.190> around<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.610> radio<00:01:00.909> and<00:01:01.589> the<00:01:02.589> first<00:01:02.830> step

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
goes around the radio and the first step

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:10.010 
goes around the radio and the first step
in<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.339> process<00:01:03.900> was<00:01:04.900> to<00:01:05.320> take<00:01:05.650> the<00:01:07.650> KBL<00:01:08.650> out

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
in the process was to take the KBL out

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.080 
in the process was to take the KBL out
which<00:01:11.020> is<00:01:11.200> fairly<00:01:11.500> easy<00:01:11.680> is<00:01:12.549> just<00:01:12.850> show<00:01:13.030> you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
which is fairly easy is just show you

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.039 
which is fairly easy is just show you
here<00:01:13.740> looks<00:01:14.740> like<00:01:14.830> this<00:01:15.270> basically<00:01:16.270> what<00:01:16.750> it

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
here looks like this basically what it

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.580 
here looks like this basically what it
has<00:01:17.320> got<00:01:17.619> is<00:01:18.390> two<00:01:19.390> screws<00:01:19.840> that<00:01:19.869> hold<00:01:20.380> these

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
has got is two screws that hold these

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.109 
has got is two screws that hold these
things<00:01:21.280> down<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:21.700> bottom<00:01:22.030> these<00:01:22.270> little

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
things down the bottom these little

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.660 
things down the bottom these little
hinges<00:01:25.119> and<00:01:25.390> it<00:01:26.200> also<00:01:26.380> had<00:01:26.680> two<00:01:26.950> little<00:01:27.159> clefts

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
hinges and it also had two little clefts

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.429 
hinges and it also had two little clefts
that<00:01:27.880> basically<00:01:28.270> go<00:01:28.509> through<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.899> sides<00:01:29.170> with

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
that basically go through the sides with

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.499 
that basically go through the sides with
little<00:01:29.710> rubbers<00:01:30.039> that<00:01:30.219> make<00:01:30.399> it<00:01:30.549> to<00:01:31.149> the<00:01:31.270> right

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
little rubbers that make it to the right

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.779 
little rubbers that make it to the right
place<00:01:31.750> it's<00:01:32.049> it's<00:01:32.409> fairly<00:01:32.679> self-explanatory

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
place it's it's fairly self-explanatory

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.510 
place it's it's fairly self-explanatory
now<00:01:34.539> the<00:01:34.600> next<00:01:34.990> step<00:01:35.170> then<00:01:35.409> was<00:01:35.920> to<00:01:36.250> reach

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
now the next step then was to reach

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.330 
now the next step then was to reach
around<00:01:36.759> and<00:01:37.270> you'll<00:01:37.929> see<00:01:37.960> that<00:01:38.259> this<00:01:38.500> gear

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
around and you'll see that this gear

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.990 
around and you'll see that this gear
lever<00:01:39.609> surround<00:01:40.469> basically<00:01:41.469> had<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:42.850> got

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
lever surround basically had it's got

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.969 
lever surround basically had it's got
these<00:01:43.119> little<00:01:43.390> plastic<00:01:43.570> clubs<00:01:44.049> that<00:01:44.320> look<00:01:44.439> you

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
these little plastic clubs that look you

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.499 
these little plastic clubs that look you
know<00:01:45.100> metal<00:01:45.549> metal<00:01:45.820> clips<00:01:46.090> that<00:01:46.179> go<00:01:46.359> into

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
know metal metal clips that go into

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.289 
know metal metal clips that go into
plastic<00:01:46.990> spaces<00:01:47.590> they<00:01:47.710> look<00:01:47.890> like<00:01:48.009> that<00:01:48.299> that

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
plastic spaces they look like that that

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.410 
plastic spaces they look like that that
one<00:01:49.479> over<00:01:49.689> there<00:01:49.929> and<00:01:50.520> basically<00:01:51.520> I<00:01:51.789> reached

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
one over there and basically I reached

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.510 
one over there and basically I reached
around<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:53.049> just<00:01:53.320> pushed<00:01:53.950> as<00:01:54.130> hard<00:01:54.159> as<00:01:54.460> I

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
around and just pushed as hard as I

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.550 
around and just pushed as hard as I
could<00:01:54.579> with<00:01:54.909> my<00:01:55.030> fingers<00:01:55.420> on<00:01:55.630> on<00:01:55.929> the<00:01:56.109> on<00:01:56.380> this

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
could with my fingers on on the on this

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.249 
could with my fingers on on the on this
this<00:01:57.039> clip<00:01:57.340> up<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.640> top<00:01:57.850> corner<00:01:58.240> which<00:01:59.020> then

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
this clip up the top corner which then

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.840 
this clip up the top corner which then
my<00:01:59.409> dad<00:01:59.619> pop<00:01:59.859> out<00:02:00.069> so<00:02:00.249> I<00:02:00.280> was<00:02:00.369> then<00:02:00.549> able<00:02:00.670> to

the car in neutral or one of the lower

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.559 
the car in neutral or one of the lower
ones<00:02:06.130> to<00:02:06.429> keep<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:06.729> gear<00:02:06.909> lever<00:02:07.149> out<00:02:07.359> of<00:02:07.509> the

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
ones to keep the gear lever out of the

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.510 
ones to keep the gear lever out of the
way<00:02:07.659> I<00:02:07.899> don't<00:02:08.319> have<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.619> take<00:02:08.800> that<00:02:08.830> completely

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
way I don't have to take that completely

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.950 
way I don't have to take that completely
over<00:02:09.819> disconnect<00:02:10.240> any<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.539> wires<00:02:10.720> that

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
over disconnect any of the wires that

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.190 
over disconnect any of the wires that
can<00:02:11.110> just<00:02:11.350> hang<00:02:11.530> there<00:02:12.150> next<00:02:13.150> step<00:02:13.330> is<00:02:13.540> this

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
can just hang there next step is this

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
bit up here had two screws one there and

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.200 
bit up here had two screws one there and
one<00:02:16.840> there<00:02:17.250> holding<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.370> into<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.730> car<00:02:18.970> and

one there holding it into the car and

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.090 
one there holding it into the car and
what<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:19.990> want<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.230> do<00:02:20.350> obviously<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.860> take

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
what you want to do obviously is take

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.670 
what you want to do obviously is take
those<00:02:21.250> screws<00:02:21.610> out<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.000> then<00:02:22.810> slowly<00:02:23.350> work

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
those screws out and then slowly work

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.800 
those screws out and then slowly work
your<00:02:23.709> way<00:02:23.890> around<00:02:24.099> and<00:02:24.700> unfortunately<00:02:25.690> you

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
your way around and unfortunately you

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.420 
your way around and unfortunately you
have<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.019> apply<00:02:26.319> a<00:02:26.349> little<00:02:26.590> bit<00:02:26.709> of<00:02:26.890> force<00:02:27.159> to

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
have to apply a little bit of force to

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.980 
have to apply a little bit of force to
get<00:02:28.120> this

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
get this

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.470 
get this
thing<00:02:29.410> off<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.850> should<00:02:31.060> see<00:02:31.270> then

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
thing off and you should see then

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.180 
thing off and you should see then
that'll<00:02:32.080> help<00:02:32.260> them<00:02:32.560> right<00:02:32.710> off<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.070> it's

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
that'll help them right off and it's

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.490 
that'll help them right off and it's
just<00:02:33.370> got<00:02:33.520> two<00:02:33.760> big<00:02:34.000> plugs<00:02:34.300> that<00:02:35.110> plug<00:02:35.350> into

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
just got two big plugs that plug into

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.360 
just got two big plugs that plug into
the<00:02:35.710> back<00:02:35.890> of<00:02:36.000> those<00:02:37.000> things<00:02:37.390> there<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:38.370> then

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
the back of those things there and then

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.130 
the back of those things there and then
should<00:02:39.760> be<00:02:39.880> fairly<00:02:40.180> straightforward<00:02:40.330> just<00:02:41.050> a

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
should be fairly straightforward just a

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.810 
should be fairly straightforward just a
couple<00:02:41.350> of<00:02:41.500> screws<00:02:41.710> on<00:02:41.890> either<00:02:41.980> side<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.640> take

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
couple of screws on either side to take

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.330 
couple of screws on either side to take
the<00:02:43.000> radio<00:02:43.300> mount<00:02:43.780> out<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:44.320> then<00:02:45.100> you<00:02:45.220> can

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
the radio mount out and then you can

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.670 
the radio mount out and then you can
either<00:02:45.370> fit<00:02:45.820> a<00:02:45.850> new<00:02:46.210> radio<00:02:46.600> or<00:02:46.840> your<00:02:47.500> band

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
either fit a new radio or your band

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.070 
either fit a new radio or your band

I put the radio back in so I've got the

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.660 
I put the radio back in so I've got the
band<00:02:55.930> expander<00:02:56.590> wired<00:02:56.830> in<00:02:57.100> and<00:02:57.280> you<00:02:57.340> can<00:02:57.460> see

band expander wired in and you can see

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.190 
band expander wired in and you can see
it<00:02:57.790> back<00:02:58.000> there<00:02:58.210> I've<00:02:58.510> tucked<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:58.930> in<00:02:59.050> and
