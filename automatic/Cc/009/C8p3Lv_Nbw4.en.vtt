this map is actually quite a great map
and<00:00:21.890> it<00:00:22.890> was<00:00:22.980> originally<00:00:23.160> done<00:00:23.460> by<00:00:23.539> brutes<00:00:24.539> map

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
and it was originally done by brutes map

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.980

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the areas of the maps are and hopefully

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.049 
the areas of the maps are and hopefully
we'll<00:01:01.170> see<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:01.829> one<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> operations

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
we'll see this in one of the operations

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.660 
we'll see this in one of the operations
if<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.539> gets<00:01:03.719> enough<00:01:03.870> votes<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.890> I'll<00:01:05.339> leave

on the next operation along with cash we

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.240 
on the next operation along with cash we
need<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.400> have<00:01:17.610> these<00:01:18.030> maps<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.570> our<00:01:18.720> normal

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
need to have these maps in our normal

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.130 
need to have these maps in our normal
map<00:01:20.250> hall<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.909> we're<00:01:21.030> not<00:01:21.119> playing<00:01:21.390> just<00:01:21.900> dust

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
map hall so we're not playing just dust

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.670 
map hall so we're not playing just dust
to<00:01:22.380> all<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.100> time<00:01:23.450> so<00:01:24.450> let's<00:01:25.110> go<00:01:25.259> round<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.650> it

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
to all the time so let's go round to it

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.510 
to all the time so let's go round to it
so<00:01:26.159> I'm<00:01:26.280> starting<00:01:26.909> CT<00:01:27.330> side<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.369> have<00:01:29.460> a

so I'm starting CT side and you have a
choice<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.790> obviously<00:01:30.240> A<00:01:30.270> or<00:01:30.540> B<00:01:30.689> you've<00:01:31.590> got

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
choice of obviously A or B you've got

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.179 
choice of obviously A or B you've got
your<00:01:31.979> middle<00:01:32.640> here<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.450> middle<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.619> then<00:01:35.009> a

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
your middle here so middle and then a

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.630 
your middle here so middle and then a
site<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.619> terms<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.829> middle<00:01:38.159> site<00:01:38.400> you

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
site so on terms of middle site you

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.870 
site so on terms of middle site you
normally<00:01:38.939> jump<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.420> box<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.880> watch

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
normally jump on this box and watch

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.230 
normally jump on this box and watch
anyone<00:01:42.390> coming<00:01:42.630> out<00:01:42.840> of<00:01:43.020> connector<00:01:43.619> or<00:01:44.520> B

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
anyone coming out of connector or B

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.469 
anyone coming out of connector or B
storage<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.049> then<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.250> have<00:01:47.460> house<00:01:47.790> which

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
storage and then we have house which

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.330 
storage and then we have house which
I'll<00:01:48.689> go<00:01:48.840> over<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:49.049> second<00:01:49.439> but<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:50.100> want<00:01:50.310> to

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
I'll go over a second but you want to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.999 
I'll go over a second but you want to
watch<00:01:50.490> people<00:01:50.939> coming<00:01:51.479> up<00:01:51.600> Kitty<00:01:51.930> from<00:01:52.829> there

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
watch people coming up Kitty from there

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.130 
watch people coming up Kitty from there
so<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:54.329> go<00:01:54.509> over<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.649> site<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:57.140> normal

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
so we go over this is a site and normal

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.020 
so we go over this is a site and normal
normal<00:01:58.590> place<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:58.979> plant<00:01:59.189> is<00:01:59.460> over<00:01:59.820> here

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
normal place to the plant is over here

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.530 
normal place to the plant is over here
so<00:02:00.420> nice<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.810> open<00:02:01.110> plant<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:02.360> then<00:02:03.360> you've

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
so nice and open plant and then you've

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.850 
so nice and open plant and then you've
got<00:02:04.310> your<00:02:05.310> other<00:02:05.610> sides<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.719> site<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.259> then

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
got your other sides of a site and then

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.740 
got your other sides of a site and then
you've<00:02:07.979> got<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.220> ramp<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:08.910> ramp<00:02:09.209> is

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
you've got this ramp this ramp is

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.300 
you've got this ramp this ramp is
replication<00:02:10.500> from<00:02:10.920> Cpl<00:02:11.640> mill<00:02:11.879> and

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
replication from Cpl mill and

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.630 
replication from Cpl mill and
English<00:02:13.790> players<00:02:14.030> call<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.510> kitty<00:02:14.900> and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
English players call it kitty and

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.300 
English players call it kitty and
hopefully<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:16.910> replication<00:02:17.720> goes<00:02:18.530> for<00:02:18.800> out

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
hopefully that replication goes for out

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.150 
hopefully that replication goes for out
because<00:02:19.790> on<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.750> mill<00:02:21.020> does<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.230> picture<00:02:22.010> of<00:02:22.069> a

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
because on the mill does a picture of a

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.500 
because on the mill does a picture of a
kitty<00:02:22.370> or<00:02:22.730> kitten<00:02:23.300> previously<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.500> then

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
kitty or kitten previously and then

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.930 
kitty or kitten previously and then
you've<00:02:26.510> got<00:02:26.690> door<00:02:26.990> so<00:02:27.440> instead<00:02:27.709> of<00:02:27.770> vents<00:02:28.220> in

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
you've got door so instead of vents in

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.199 
you've got door so instead of vents in
meal<00:02:29.270> you've<00:02:29.840> got<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.350> door<00:02:30.709> which<00:02:31.640> goes<00:02:31.880> on<00:02:32.120> the

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
meal you've got a door which goes on the

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.960 
meal you've got a door which goes on the
grounds<00:02:32.569> which<00:02:33.140> I'll<00:02:33.319> go<00:02:33.500> over<00:02:33.550> in<00:02:34.550> a<00:02:34.700> bit<00:02:34.850> and

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
grounds which I'll go over in a bit and

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.350 
grounds which I'll go over in a bit and
then<00:02:37.970> we<00:02:38.209> go<00:02:38.450> down<00:02:38.750> middle<00:02:39.260> into<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.040> storage<00:02:40.400> so

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
then we go down middle into a storage so

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.890 
then we go down middle into a storage so
we<00:02:41.810> come<00:02:42.290> through<00:02:42.500> connector<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.690> then<00:02:44.690> we

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
we come through connector and then we

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.360 
we come through connector and then we
are<00:02:45.050> in<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.650> storage<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:47.450> storage<00:02:48.310> is<00:02:49.310> a

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
are in a storage so a storage is a

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.610 
are in a storage so a storage is a
normal<00:02:49.760> set<00:02:49.940> up<00:02:50.060> spot<00:02:50.360> you<00:02:50.840> obviously<00:02:51.500> just

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
normal set up spot you obviously just

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.330 
normal set up spot you obviously just
walk<00:02:51.800> up<00:02:51.980> Kitty<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:53.170> try<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.290> work<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:54.800> site

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
walk up Kitty and try and work a site

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.479 
walk up Kitty and try and work a site
then<00:02:56.120> you<00:02:56.450> have<00:02:56.600> access<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:57.320> underground<00:02:57.860> to

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
then you have access to underground to

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.290 
then you have access to underground to
access<00:02:59.030> on<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.269> ground<00:02:59.450> you<00:03:00.319> have<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.560> hit

that and go down and now we're on
underground

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
underground

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.890 
underground

underground has access both to a and B

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.009 
underground has access both to a and B
however<00:03:15.890> this<00:03:16.760> is<00:03:16.880> not<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.120> case<00:03:17.329> with<00:03:17.600> Tuscan

however this is not the case with Tuscan

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.460 
however this is not the case with Tuscan
underground<00:03:18.799> is<00:03:19.100> only<00:03:19.370> giving<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:19.730> access<00:03:19.880> to

much more CT side it's however let's go

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.110 
much more CT side it's however let's go
into<00:03:57.049> the<00:03:57.470> B<00:03:57.620> side<00:03:57.859> so<00:03:58.280> you've<00:03:58.760> got<00:03:58.880> two

two middle two entrances from B side on
the<00:04:08.420> lower<00:04:08.570> side<00:04:08.840> of<00:04:08.870> middle<00:04:09.170> but<00:04:10.010> we'll<00:04:10.160> go

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
the lower side of middle but we'll go

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.030 
the lower side of middle but we'll go
through<00:04:10.489> CT<00:04:10.970> side<00:04:11.150> first<00:04:11.390> so<00:04:11.660> you<00:04:12.290> got<00:04:12.590> house

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
through CT side first so you got house

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.770 
through CT side first so you got house
first<00:04:13.400> and<00:04:13.720> house<00:04:14.720> gives<00:04:15.680> you<00:04:15.769> access<00:04:16.010> to

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
shorts and short is this area here okay

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.100 
shorts and short is this area here okay
so<00:04:22.820> you're<00:04:23.000> unsure

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
so you're unsure

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.010 
so you're unsure

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
and then we've got bridge so you've got

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.559 
and then we've got bridge so you've got
the<00:04:28.139> bridge<00:04:28.379> which<00:04:29.009> gains<00:04:29.819> you<00:04:29.969> access<00:04:30.000> to

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:30.569 
the bridge which gains you access to

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.589 
the bridge which gains you access to
actual<00:04:30.840> B<00:04:31.259> sites<00:04:31.680> and<00:04:32.099> then<00:04:33.000> you've<00:04:33.180> got<00:04:33.360> V

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
actual B sites and then you've got V

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:36.320 
actual B sites and then you've got V
upper<00:04:34.050> which<00:04:34.289> I'm<00:04:34.439> standing<00:04:34.800> in<00:04:34.979> and<00:04:35.520> then

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
upper which I'm standing in and then

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.510 
upper which I'm standing in and then
you've<00:04:36.840> got<00:04:39.500> under<00:04:40.500> canopy<00:04:40.770> so<00:04:41.219> this<00:04:41.400> is

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
you've got under canopy so this is

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.719 
you've got under canopy so this is
called<00:04:41.759> a<00:04:41.819> canopy<00:04:42.409> or<00:04:43.409> canopy<00:04:43.889> you<00:04:44.099> removed

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
called a canopy or canopy you removed

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.129 
called a canopy or canopy you removed
and<00:04:45.180> then<00:04:45.539> you<00:04:46.379> can<00:04:47.069> go<00:04:47.759> into<00:04:47.939> L<00:04:48.479> block<00:04:48.810> and

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
and then you can go into L block and

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.459 
and then you can go into L block and
this<00:04:49.590> it<00:04:49.800> gives<00:04:50.009> you<00:04:50.159> access<00:04:50.400> to<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:52.080> actual<00:04:52.199> B

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:52.469 
this it gives you access to the actual B

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:54.890 
this it gives you access to the actual B
site<00:04:52.740> as<00:04:52.889> well<00:04:53.129> so<00:04:53.580> this<00:04:53.729> is<00:04:53.789> called<00:04:54.180> L<00:04:54.539> block

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
site as well so this is called L block

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.990 
site as well so this is called L block
or<00:04:55.169> white<00:04:55.650> walls<00:04:55.949> as<00:04:56.219> some<00:04:56.460> players<00:04:56.729> like<00:04:56.789> to

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
or white walls as some players like to

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.610 
or white walls as some players like to
call<00:04:57.150> it<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:58.069> then<00:04:59.069> we've<00:05:00.029> covered<00:05:00.779> B<00:05:01.050> site<00:05:01.319> so

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
call it and then we've covered B site so

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.499 
call it and then we've covered B site so
you've<00:05:01.740> got<00:05:01.889> B<00:05:02.509> B<00:05:03.509> upper<00:05:03.810> canopy

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
you've got B B upper canopy

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:12.679 
you've got B B upper canopy
L<00:05:06.509> block<00:05:06.840> and<00:05:08.509> long<00:05:09.509> so<00:05:10.110> this<00:05:10.740> area<00:05:11.039> here<00:05:11.689> is

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:12.689 
L block and long so this area here is

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:18.619 
L block and long so this area here is
long<00:05:13.080> and<00:05:13.879> then<00:05:14.879> you've<00:05:15.779> got<00:05:16.789> B<00:05:17.789> long<00:05:18.029> as<00:05:18.210> well

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:18.629 
long and then you've got B long as well

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:21.980 
long and then you've got B long as well
so<00:05:18.840> you've<00:05:19.710> got<00:05:20.060> or<00:05:21.060> people<00:05:21.509> used<00:05:21.689> to<00:05:21.719> call<00:05:21.930> it

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
so you've got or people used to call it

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.830 
so you've got or people used to call it
banana<00:05:22.259> as<00:05:22.439> well<00:05:22.650> some<00:05:23.460> people<00:05:23.580> but<00:05:24.180> normal<00:05:24.719> to

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
banana as well some people but normal to

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.200 
banana as well some people but normal to
call<00:05:24.960> it<00:05:25.050> be<00:05:25.169> long<00:05:25.379> in<00:05:25.729> English<00:05:26.729> course<00:05:27.000> and

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
call it be long in English course and

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.420 
call it be long in English course and
then<00:05:28.169> that<00:05:28.349> gives<00:05:28.529> you<00:05:28.650> a<00:05:28.710> connection<00:05:28.979> to

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
then that gives you a connection to

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.829 
then that gives you a connection to
short<00:05:30.180> so<00:05:30.839> again<00:05:31.199> you<00:05:31.500> got<00:05:31.620> to<00:05:31.680> shore<00:05:32.509> and<00:05:33.509> you

00:05:33.829 --> 00:05:33.839 
short so again you got to shore and you

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:37.040 
short so again you got to shore and you
connect<00:05:34.139> to<00:05:34.349> the<00:05:34.770> B<00:05:34.949> house<00:05:35.159> so<00:05:35.789> often<00:05:36.029> often<00:05:36.479> CT

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
connect to the B house so often often CT

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.399 
connect to the B house so often often CT
players<00:05:37.319> will<00:05:37.529> be<00:05:37.680> staying<00:05:38.370> in<00:05:38.460> the<00:05:38.520> house<00:05:38.729> and

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
players will be staying in the house and

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:43.040 
players will be staying in the house and
then<00:05:40.409> you'll<00:05:41.069> have<00:05:41.400> access<00:05:41.669> to<00:05:42.360> be<00:05:42.629> storage

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
then you'll have access to be storage

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.129 
then you'll have access to be storage
which<00:05:43.560> also<00:05:43.800> connects<00:05:44.460> the<00:05:44.580> middle<00:05:44.900> like<00:05:45.900> so

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
which also connects the middle like so

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.990 
which also connects the middle like so
and<00:05:46.440> then<00:05:47.400> you<00:05:48.029> go<00:05:48.210> back<00:05:48.419> and<00:05:49.490> urine<00:05:50.490> t-spawn

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
and then you go back and urine t-spawn

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.360 
and then you go back and urine t-spawn
basically<00:05:51.539> so<00:05:51.960> if<00:05:52.529> we<00:05:52.680> go<00:05:52.800> round<00:05:53.129> to<00:05:53.279> T<00:05:53.430> spawn

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
basically so if we go round to T spawn

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.860 
basically so if we go round to T spawn
this<00:05:56.370> is<00:05:56.610> the<00:05:56.759> actual<00:05:56.939> T<00:05:57.180> spawn<00:05:57.449> where<00:05:57.779> you

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
this is the actual T spawn where you

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.990 
this is the actual T spawn where you
start<00:05:58.139> and<00:05:58.319> then<00:05:58.379> you<00:05:59.009> have<00:05:59.129> quick<00:05:59.610> access<00:05:59.759> to

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
start and then you have quick access to

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.450 
start and then you have quick access to
be<00:06:00.240> storage<00:06:00.599> or<00:06:00.810> a<00:06:00.839> storage<00:06:01.259> within<00:06:02.069> the<00:06:02.279> T

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
be storage or a storage within the T

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.390 
be storage or a storage within the T
side<00:06:02.699> you<00:06:02.969> always<00:06:03.150> start<00:06:03.509> on<00:06:04.129> the<00:06:05.129> storage

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
side you always start on the storage

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.510 
side you always start on the storage
side<00:06:05.699> and<00:06:06.029> then<00:06:06.240> walk<00:06:06.449> opposite<00:06:06.810> side<00:06:07.520> and

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
side and then walk opposite side and

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.740 
side and then walk opposite side and
then<00:06:08.879> that's<00:06:09.779> done<00:06:10.339> okay<00:06:11.339> so<00:06:11.400> that's<00:06:12.270> what<00:06:12.479> you

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
then that's done okay so that's what you

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:15.320 
then that's done okay so that's what you
really<00:06:13.020> cover<00:06:13.259> and<00:06:13.909> hopefully<00:06:14.909> that's<00:06:15.120> given

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
really cover and hopefully that's given

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.019 
really cover and hopefully that's given
you<00:06:15.479> a<00:06:15.599> give<00:06:15.810> good<00:06:16.229> insight<00:06:16.560> onto<00:06:16.939> what<00:06:17.939> the

00:06:18.019 --> 00:06:18.029 
you a give good insight onto what the

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:20.119 
you a give good insight onto what the
map<00:06:18.210> does<00:06:18.449> I<00:06:18.810> hopefully<00:06:19.229> will<00:06:19.560> see<00:06:19.800> this<00:06:19.949> an

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:20.129 
map does I hopefully will see this an

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:21.409 
map does I hopefully will see this an
actual<00:06:20.339> competitive<00:06:20.669> play<00:06:21.029> in<00:06:21.150> actual

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
actual competitive play in actual

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:21.950 
actual competitive play in actual
leagues

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960

I've<00:06:22.409> seen<00:06:22.770> ESEA<00:06:23.310> Illuminati<00:06:24.089> saying<00:06:25.460> that

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
I've seen ESEA Illuminati saying that

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.019 
I've seen ESEA Illuminati saying that
you<00:06:27.120> know<00:06:27.240> the<00:06:27.419> perhaps<00:06:27.599> potential<00:06:29.029> what

00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:30.029 
you know the perhaps potential what

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:32.540 
you know the perhaps potential what
bourbon<00:06:30.599> needs<00:06:30.810> work<00:06:31.080> is<00:06:31.469> just<00:06:32.159> the<00:06:32.279> general

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:32.550 
bourbon needs work is just the general

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:34.760 
bourbon needs work is just the general
brightness<00:06:33.060> is<00:06:33.479> far<00:06:33.750> too<00:06:33.930> dark<00:06:34.139> in<00:06:34.349> a<00:06:34.409> moment

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
brightness is far too dark in a moment

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.870 
brightness is far too dark in a moment
in<00:06:35.669> B<00:06:35.969> storage<00:06:36.330> a<00:06:36.509> storage<00:06:36.990> and

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 
in B storage a storage and

in B storage a storage and
short<00:06:38.360> just<00:06:39.080> far<00:06:39.320> too<00:06:39.350> dark<00:06:39.800> so<00:06:40.120> just<00:06:41.120> brighten

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:41.330 
short just far too dark so just brighten
