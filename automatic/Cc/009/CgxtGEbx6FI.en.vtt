 tool is a platform 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.050
 work to find 30 not 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.779
 international is therefore a closed 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.809
 tendency to open up to bring the made in 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.699
 italy also on different car markets 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.180

 it really seems to me 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.390
 COSAP of the exciting and ausl 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.720
 sharing step to be able to exchange 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:01.820
 different ideas and different visions 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:04.920
 dialogue between professionals and receives 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.300
 also creative answers from users but 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.180
 even from these six months of this it is 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.119
 useful his first love but also for puts 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.130
 the user to see these curtains in the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.520
 neither mine nor casini but ends beyond 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.590
 to be an inspiration for others 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.450
 it can also be instead inspiration for 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.130
 we obviously because they are a lot of 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.750
 very beautiful and very interesting things 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.970
 I did n't break it in we used it too 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.320
 for inspirations on those already in as the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.000
 showcase of strong despair anyway 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.580
 and rather it was worth however there was also 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.040
 from the Italian profile we can 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.140
 see projects of different nature 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.900
 this has never put us there 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.300
 of projects is a bit of a get on 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.550

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.970
