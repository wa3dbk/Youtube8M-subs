do you put on there exactly we call it
an<00:00:48.780> applicator<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.770> set<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> suction

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
an applicator it's a set of a suction

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.520 
an applicator it's a set of a suction
cup<00:00:50.730> think<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.719> suction<00:00:52.020> cup<00:00:52.170> about

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
cup think of it as a suction cup about

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.799 
cup think of it as a suction cup about
the<00:00:52.649> size<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.980> your<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:53.550> palm<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.270> hand

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the size of your of your palm and hand

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.750 
the size of your of your palm and hand
it's<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.559> before<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:55.949> after<00:00:56.010> pictures<00:00:56.430> Frank

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
it's a before and after pictures Frank

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.549 
it's a before and after pictures Frank
after<00:00:57.030> just<00:00:57.210> one<00:00:57.390> measurement<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.899> amazing

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
after just one measurement it's amazing

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.639 
after just one measurement it's amazing
so<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:59.010> doesn't<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.640> mean<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.780> doesn't<00:01:01.020> burn<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
so it doesn't I mean it doesn't burn the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.560 
so it doesn't I mean it doesn't burn the
skin<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.070> like<00:01:02.190> normal<00:01:02.550> ice<00:01:02.760> would<00:01:03.149> even<00:01:03.390> rise

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
skin is like normal ice would even rise

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.149 
skin is like normal ice would even rise
on<00:01:03.750> your<00:01:03.780> skin<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.170> goes<00:01:04.439> through<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> skin

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
on your skin it goes through the skin

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.070 
on your skin it goes through the skin
somehow<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.700> freezes<00:01:06.090> fat<00:01:06.299> right<00:01:06.780> because

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
somehow and freezes fat right because

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.240 
somehow and freezes fat right because
there's<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.350> temperature<00:01:07.770> where<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.010> fat

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
there's a temperature where the fat

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.730 
there's a temperature where the fat
suffers<00:01:08.939> but<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> skin<00:01:09.479> doesn't<00:01:09.720> know<00:01:10.409> if<00:01:10.530> you

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
suffers but the skin doesn't know if you

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.740 
suffers but the skin doesn't know if you
go<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.890> cold<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.580> course<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.150> get<00:01:12.270> frostbite

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
go to cold of course you get frostbite

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.570 
go to cold of course you get frostbite
right<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.710> that's<00:01:13.860> why<00:01:14.040> we<00:01:14.159> never<00:01:14.280> thought

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
right and so that's why we never thought

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.760 
right and so that's why we never thought
of<00:01:14.760> this<00:01:14.790> before<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.509> turns<00:01:15.810> out<00:01:16.110> fat<00:01:16.560> is

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
of this before but it turns out fat is

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.920 
of this before but it turns out fat is
more<00:01:16.979> sensitive<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.610> cold<00:01:17.790> than<00:01:18.000> skin<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.810> we

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
more sensitive to cold than skin so we

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.530 
more sensitive to cold than skin so we
can<00:01:19.049> go<00:01:19.170> down<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.770> temperature<00:01:20.340> not<00:01:21.119> hurt<00:01:21.360> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
can go down in temperature not hurt the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.020 
can go down in temperature not hurt the
skin<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:22.530> still<00:01:22.920> kill<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.310> fat<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.759> that's

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
skin but still kill the fat and that's

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.370 
skin but still kill the fat and that's
the<00:01:24.270> amazing<00:01:24.420> beauty<00:01:24.930> of<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.140> it's

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the amazing beauty of this it's

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.770 
the amazing beauty of this it's
non-surgical<00:01:26.220> just<00:01:26.670> put<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.030> outside<00:01:27.540> its

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
non-surgical just put on the outside its

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.810 
non-surgical just put on the outside its
permanent<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.470> has<00:01:29.009> great<00:01:29.189> result<00:01:29.610> how<00:01:29.670> does

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
permanent and has great result how does

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.859 
permanent and has great result how does
somebody<00:01:30.000> know<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.360> they're<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.600> ideal
