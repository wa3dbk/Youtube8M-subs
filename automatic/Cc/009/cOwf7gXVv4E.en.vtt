00:00:27.709 --> 00:00:27.719 
in this build okay it's been hot wired

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:30.259 
in this build okay it's been hot wired
now<00:00:27.929> I've<00:00:28.079> sanded<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.559> and<00:00:28.849> I'm<00:00:29.849> actually

formed<00:00:37.610> while<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.640> was<00:00:39.120> sanding<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.659> and<00:00:39.949> things

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
formed while I was sanding it and things

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.299 
formed while I was sanding it and things
that<00:00:41.360> you<00:00:42.360> know<00:00:42.510> irregular<00:00:43.320> irregularities

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
that you know irregular irregularities

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.590 
that you know irregular irregularities
that<00:00:44.339> were<00:00:44.519> created<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> hot<00:00:45.390> wiring

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
that were created in the hot wiring

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.820 
that were created in the hot wiring
process<00:00:46.199> so<00:00:46.469> i<00:00:46.680> take<00:00:47.339> spackle<00:00:48.830> lightweight

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
process so i take spackle lightweight

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:57.049 
process so i take spackle lightweight
spackle<00:00:51.409> okay<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:54.420> some<00:00:54.900> trowels<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:56.059> i'm

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
spackle okay and some trowels and i'm

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.189 
spackle okay and some trowels and i'm
now<00:00:58.670> basically<00:00:59.670> going<00:01:00.000> over<00:01:00.479> the<00:01:00.689> engine

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
now basically going over the engine

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.469 
now basically going over the engine
nacelle<00:01:01.619> p.m.<00:01:01.890> dat<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:03.150> could<00:01:03.269> do<00:01:03.360> this

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
nacelle p.m. dat and you could do this

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.109 
nacelle p.m. dat and you could do this
with<00:01:03.659> any<00:01:03.809> engine<00:01:04.290> nacelle<00:01:04.619> now<00:01:05.519> one<00:01:05.820> thing<00:01:05.850> I

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
with any engine nacelle now one thing I

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.520 
with any engine nacelle now one thing I
don't<00:01:06.299> want<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.509> do<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.720> make<00:01:06.869> redundant<00:01:07.380> that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
don't want to do is make redundant that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.289 
don't want to do is make redundant that
redundant<00:01:08.189> videos<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.790> don't<00:01:08.820> want<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.119> copy

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
redundant videos I don't want to copy

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.530 
redundant videos I don't want to copy
myself<00:01:09.950> alright<00:01:10.950> how<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.729> saw<00:01:12.090> me<00:01:12.329> Hotwire

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
myself alright how you saw me Hotwire

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.819 
myself alright how you saw me Hotwire
the<00:01:13.310> md80<00:01:14.310> nose<00:01:14.610> section<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.240> exactly<00:01:16.229> how<00:01:16.770> you

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829 
the md80 nose section is exactly how you

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:18.889 
the md80 nose section is exactly how you
Hotwire<00:01:17.130> any<00:01:17.610> other<00:01:17.820> section<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.479> did<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
Hotwire any other section you did it the

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.750 
Hotwire any other section you did it the
same<00:01:19.140> way<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:20.000> cardboard<00:01:21.000> stencil<00:01:21.690> or

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
same way with a cardboard stencil or

same way with a cardboard stencil or
hard<00:01:23.760> cardboard<00:01:24.210> for<00:01:27.500> plastic<00:01:29.150> Formica<00:01:30.150> I

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
hard cardboard for plastic Formica I

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.149 
hard cardboard for plastic Formica I
mean<00:01:30.690> whatever<00:01:30.870> you<00:01:31.080> want<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.350> use<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.800> doesn't

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
mean whatever you want to use it doesn't

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.890 
mean whatever you want to use it doesn't
matter<00:01:32.310> as<00:01:32.490> long<00:01:32.520> as<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.240> hot<00:01:33.450> wire<00:01:33.600> won't

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
matter as long as it the hot wire won't

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.500 
matter as long as it the hot wire won't
burn<00:01:34.110> it

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.230 

so<00:01:40.510> I'm<00:01:40.600> just<00:01:40.780> troweling<00:01:41.230> in<00:01:41.880> seams<00:01:42.880> and

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
so I'm just troweling in seams and

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.660 
so I'm just troweling in seams and
cracks<00:01:43.540> and<00:01:43.900> little<00:01:44.590> things<00:01:44.620> that<00:01:45.010> have

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
cracks and little things that have

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.380 
cracks and little things that have
popped<00:01:45.940> up<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:47.470> way<00:01:47.650> I<00:01:47.680> get<00:01:48.040> a<00:01:48.150> smooth<00:01:49.150> finish

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
popped up that way I get a smooth finish

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.950 
popped up that way I get a smooth finish
because<00:01:49.780> i'm<00:01:50.050> going<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.530> laminate<00:01:51.960> this

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
because i'm going to laminate this

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.020 
because i'm going to laminate this
engine<00:01:53.200> to<00:01:53.410> sell<00:01:53.650> eventually<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.580> i'm<00:01:54.760> going

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
engine to sell eventually and i'm going

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.420 
engine to sell eventually and i'm going
to<00:01:58.200> hollow<00:01:59.200> it<00:01:59.470> out<00:01:59.560> and<00:01:59.860> then<00:01:59.890> i'm<00:02:00.280> going<00:02:00.369> to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
to hollow it out and then i'm going to

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.000 
to hollow it out and then i'm going to
mold<00:02:00.640> it<00:02:00.850> so<00:02:01.090> that<00:02:01.240> i<00:02:01.270> have<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.660> md80<00:02:02.470> engine

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
mold it so that i have a md80 engine

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.550 
mold it so that i have a md80 engine
nacelle<00:02:03.310> mold<00:02:03.520> and<00:02:03.729> also<00:02:04.360> do<00:02:04.540> an<00:02:04.660> md-90<00:02:05.140> bolt

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
nacelle mold and also do an md-90 bolt

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.320 
nacelle mold and also do an md-90 bolt
I'll<00:02:06.490> make<00:02:06.700> an<00:02:06.820> ND<00:02:07.090> 90<00:02:07.450> nacelle<00:02:09.000> which<00:02:10.000> will<00:02:10.179> be

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
I'll make an ND 90 nacelle which will be

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.020 
I'll make an ND 90 nacelle which will be
wider<00:02:10.600> and<00:02:10.959> shorter<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:12.400> won't<00:02:12.580> be<00:02:12.700> as<00:02:12.790> long

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
wider and shorter it won't be as long

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.890 
wider and shorter it won't be as long
but<00:02:13.750> it'll<00:02:13.989> be<00:02:14.020> wider<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.850> that<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.780> know

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
but it'll be wider so that you know

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.180 
but it'll be wider so that you know
bigger<00:02:17.140> turbo<00:02:17.500> fan<00:02:17.709> engine<00:02:18.130> like<00:02:18.370> on<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.610> md

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
bigger turbo fan engine like on the md

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.310 
bigger turbo fan engine like on the md
md-90<00:02:21.190> can<00:02:21.489> fit<00:02:21.640> inside<00:02:21.790> the<00:02:22.630> md-90<00:02:23.050> has<00:02:23.290> a

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
md-90 can fit inside the md-90 has a

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.800 
md-90 can fit inside the md-90 has a
bigger<00:02:23.590> turbo<00:02:23.920> fan<00:02:24.100> engine<00:02:24.370> so<00:02:24.580> when<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.540> make

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
bigger turbo fan engine so when I make

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.800 
bigger turbo fan engine so when I make
the<00:02:25.989> md-90<00:02:26.500> version<00:02:27.070> of<00:02:27.190> this<00:02:27.310> md80<00:02:27.820> kit<00:02:28.209> you

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
the md-90 version of this md80 kit you

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.760 
the md-90 version of this md80 kit you
can<00:02:28.840> stick<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.280> 90<00:02:30.280> millimeter<00:02:30.640> ducted<00:02:31.030> pen

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
can stick a 90 millimeter ducted pen

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.979 
can stick a 90 millimeter ducted pen
instead<00:02:32.770> of<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:33.270> Justice<00:02:34.270> 70<00:02:34.630> because<00:02:34.810> that's

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
instead of a Justice 70 because that's

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.400 
instead of a Justice 70 because that's
all<00:02:35.260> this<00:02:35.620> nacelle<00:02:36.130> concurrently<00:02:36.760> deal<00:02:37.030> with

all this nacelle concurrently deal with

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.040 
all this nacelle concurrently deal with
is<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.530> 70<00:02:39.070> millimeter<00:02:39.520> ducted<00:02:40.300> fan<00:02:40.510> it's<00:02:40.720> just

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
is a 70 millimeter ducted fan it's just

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.940 
is a 70 millimeter ducted fan it's just
wide<00:02:41.260> enough<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:42.150> deal<00:02:43.150> with<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.420> 70mm<00:02:44.410> even

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
wide enough to deal with a 70mm even

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.210 
wide enough to deal with a 70mm even
though<00:02:45.100> it's<00:02:45.250> this<00:02:45.519> big<00:02:46.230> it's<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:48.070> know<00:02:48.190> I
