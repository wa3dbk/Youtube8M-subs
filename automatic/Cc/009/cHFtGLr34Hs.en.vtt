00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.770
 welcome dear audience my 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.720
 name is niclas schmidt and i greet 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.130
 you to another new series of 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.320
 me and this series is called let's lightning 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.059
 and as the name already reveals I will 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.580
 play chess flashing online 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.109
 And I want my parts 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.789
 maybe this could comment 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.519
 formally already on jazz 24 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.019
 it is also the talk but I have 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.519
 now here a new name taken 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.670
 is who is not confused 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:34.230
 well then I go to the play 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.329
 Son of jazz 24 and give me up 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.700
 looking for an opponent we 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.239
 Play three minutes now too 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.649
 already found one and play against 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:51.120
 world of warcraft then go 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:53.129
 I start many with this by 453 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.600
 everything is possible 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.430
 I like the last time here 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.770
 Italian lot just fine because you 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.329
 often can put pressure on early 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.229
 and there are a few tricky cries 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.290
 jump ii 4 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.520
 the main focus d5 good that I had 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.030
 actually only recently in one 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.189
 Tournament game when be corrected 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.009
 So 2 seems to be smart here 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.110
 for him to drive away 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.700
 and now I can farm anyone with that 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.810
 which once could regain it 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.490
 jump six blankets 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.950
 but he does nothing, she is always 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.170
 still exactly the same part as at 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.930
 Scientology against Thomas Kahlert 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.430
 I played at that time and black one 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.299
 a little bit of problems to get out of here and 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.850
 its figures the six men partie 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:44.939
 which i had followed d5 but it stays that way 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:47.310
 but now here black does not come like that 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:51.570
 right out and the pressure is always 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.280
 a little bit more like now 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.390
 Black could be at the same time as deep 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.790
 continue 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.270
 I find that a bit annoying me 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.920
 believe plays first hits the 6 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:09.179
 right now i'm running 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:11.390
 here are his farm's small advantage 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.920
 weakened on the other side he wants 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.790
 he has his options well me 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.540
 develop me now first continue tomi 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.010
 I would have made eight good games 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.200
 We'll go to the harbor again and I should 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.769
 now a bit quicker 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.150
 play 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:34.349
 i develop my runner and do it 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:40.110
 Here was the point d6 clarity looks 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:42.780
 the lady away now the runner hangs me 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.730
 Hit the 6 once and he is now 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.500
 So here I can learn from you 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.360
 maybe that's me too 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.650
 drive the springer here and then 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.880
 Maybe I can continue printing here 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.709
 make or maybe even jumps 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.420
 four games is also a possibility 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.560
 his 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.190
 Of course, all springer wanted a lot 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.730
 After that, 1 runs in the b72 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:07.680
 tied up he will support the 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:09.600
 and now and now what am I doing b50 now 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.579
 me here very interesting idea if he 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.769
 beats then he strikes at 5 and beats 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.569
 then the tower is on the other side 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.130
 page is actually not structurally 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.590
 what I really want maybe 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.750
 it works well here now 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.450
 the lov always tied it up too because of it 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.829
 math but he beats with the ladies and 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.769
 I actually wanted to run fast 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:32.639
 depends on the springer on c3 that's now 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.590
 really unfavorable and that means me 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:38.750
 I have to be content with that here now 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.010
 I did not really think that was my idea 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.889
 this is no longer an advantage here 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.970
 but not for me either 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.980
 worse, unfortunately, is at 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.169
 time clearly strikes from there must 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:54.690
 I'll cut in a bit here 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:56.819
 that I do not lose time there 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.769
 zack zack zack now has a bit 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.139
 Tomi four go fast now I have 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.609
 tricked him that's good because here 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.190
 pulls it out again much better for 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:05.320
 me 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:10.810
 Of course he can tower here too 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:14.770
 Stop is nothing more plays 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.100
 now even further but clearly this is 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.690
 completely hopeless 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.790
 I must see that I do not 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.210
 somehow still as a bother now one 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:30.100
 minute that there is more than enough time around 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.240
 to drive this home and you 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.530
 just have to look that fast enough 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.880
 games and then this will work here 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.100
 and now, too 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.250
 All clear so that was mine 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.360
 first video on this new format and 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.880
 I would appreciate your feedback 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.560
 how do you like and then we'll see each other 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.560
 probably good again at night
