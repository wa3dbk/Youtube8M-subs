00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.620
 we will take the metro for afp 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.350
 thomas langmann 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.429
 who is the 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.409
 the 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:11.919
 screenwriter 

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:14.309
 * 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.309
 the diesel that has just come out of men 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:20.730
 a scene from the movie 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.630
 he goes out on pc if 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.630
 and surprises too 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.800
 What does that mean 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.030
 of course it actually gives me energy 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.520
 their youth unemployment rate 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.750
 according to the new york times she is original 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.260
 at the same time in front of the stage 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.400
 the young Belgian echo 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.400
 measuring 1,600 still surprises me 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.960
 I had to have 12 4% to 15 6% of its online sales according to a source 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.960
 judicial 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.880
 the bad news as in Lausanne 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.160
 a deadly attack on sg cib 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.940
 already it's mission 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.940
 and if in addition his audience 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.530
 I am well placed under the sign together and then we try to find 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.530
 a solution 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.360
 the team second a little 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.150
 indeed the project in this case 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.490
 the eyes of the blow 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.140
 the next weeks 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.630
 of the massive studio and more specifically stopped finding the elite is the most 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.990
 high 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.430
 it's more than ever 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.630
 we will play like that I thought 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.480
 this one names 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.970
 the power of 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.740
 that's it's really nice to see them if he was killed next 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.300
 in fact we are told the below 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.140
 we are very original 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.929
 according to the opposition website kaleme com 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.929
 why concert 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.499
 otherwise you 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.689
 always smiling as a whole 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.049
 so much more 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.049
 good continuation pleasure 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.439
 but then it is true that it's not it's not the same thing the year 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.109
 we still try to have a thomas langmann we will try to 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:28.309
 make 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:30.049
 do it tomorrow or the day after tomorrow 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.149
 find a moment for them 

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:35.519
 and still interesting 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.439
 when we talk because there it is quarter past 16 and it often takes 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:39.829
 director 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:41.419
