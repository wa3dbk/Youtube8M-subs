greens<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.210> lot<00:00:39.480> different<00:00:39.660> from<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
greens this is a lot different from the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.450 
greens this is a lot different from the
typical<00:00:40.379> offering<00:00:40.920> gadget<00:00:41.219> I've<00:00:41.309> been

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
typical offering gadget I've been

typical offering gadget I've been
playing<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.910> past<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.960> main<00:00:43.200> reason<00:00:43.469> for

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
playing in the past the main reason for

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.100 
playing in the past the main reason for
the<00:00:44.100> change<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.640> because<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.600> format<00:00:45.930> has

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
the change is because the format has

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.670 
the change is because the format has
slowed<00:00:46.379> down<00:00:46.559> drastically<00:00:48.110> not<00:00:49.110> really<00:00:49.440> sure

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
slowed down drastically not really sure
