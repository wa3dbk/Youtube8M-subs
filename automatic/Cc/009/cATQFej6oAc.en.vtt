00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
into Pro erythro blast and then early

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.369 
into Pro erythro blast and then early
erythro<00:01:01.739> blast<00:01:02.120> in<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.660> early<00:01:04.019> era<00:01:04.170> through

erythro blast in the early era through

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.640 
erythro blast in the early era through
blast<00:01:04.680> age<00:01:05.010> we<00:01:05.610> see<00:01:05.909> ribosomes<00:01:06.750> synthesis<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
blast age we see ribosomes synthesis and

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.850 
blast age we see ribosomes synthesis and
this<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.580> important<00:01:09.119> because<00:01:09.330> once<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.140> early

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
this is important because once the early

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.950 
this is important because once the early
era<00:01:11.040> through<00:01:11.250> blast<00:01:11.549> becomes<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.240> late<00:01:12.450> erythro

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
era through blast becomes a late erythro

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.370 
era through blast becomes a late erythro
blast<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.920> ribosomes<00:01:14.549> are<00:01:15.110> synthesizing<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
blast the ribosomes are synthesizing a

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.300 
blast the ribosomes are synthesizing a
lot<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:17.360> hemoglobins<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:18.990> have

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
lot of hemoglobins and so we have

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.520 
lot of hemoglobins and so we have
hemoglobin<00:01:20.310> accumulation<00:01:21.380> hemoglobin<00:01:22.380> is

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
hemoglobin accumulation hemoglobin is

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.410 
hemoglobin accumulation hemoglobin is
the<00:01:22.680> molecule<00:01:23.189> with<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.640> red<00:01:24.210> blood<00:01:24.360> cells

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the molecule with in red blood cells

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.340 
the molecule with in red blood cells
that<00:01:24.750> actually<00:01:25.200> carry<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.950> oxygen<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:28.140> this

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
that actually carry the oxygen so this

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.440 
that actually carry the oxygen so this
late-era<00:01:28.860> throw<00:01:29.159> bus<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.670> then<00:01:29.880> develop<00:01:30.299> into

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
late-era throw bus can then develop into

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.480 
late-era throw bus can then develop into
a<00:01:30.600> normal<00:01:30.960> blast<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.560> normal<00:01:31.860> blast<00:01:32.070> already

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
removed red blood cell removal occurs in

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.930 
removed red blood cell removal occurs in
three<00:02:33.570> main<00:02:33.990> organs<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.830> spleen<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.700> liver

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
three main organs the spleen the liver

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.230 
three main organs the spleen the liver
and<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.900> bone<00:02:37.050> marrow<00:02:37.610> so<00:02:38.610> here<00:02:38.910> I'm<00:02:39.060> drawing

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
and the bone marrow so here I'm drawing

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.800 
and the bone marrow so here I'm drawing
a<00:02:39.540> few<00:02:40.170> old<00:02:40.440> red<00:02:40.800> blood<00:02:40.980> cells<00:02:41.570> that<00:02:42.570> need<00:02:42.720> to

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
a few old red blood cells that need to

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.050 
a few old red blood cells that need to
be<00:02:42.840> cleared<00:02:43.200> out<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.590> here<00:02:44.490> I'm<00:02:44.610> drawing<00:02:44.790> the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
be cleared out and here I'm drawing the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.510 
be cleared out and here I'm drawing the
spleen<00:02:45.710> within<00:02:46.710> a<00:02:46.770> spleen<00:02:47.130> we<00:02:47.340> have

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
spleen within a spleen we have

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.020 
spleen within a spleen we have
macrophages<00:02:48.210> and<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.040> these<00:02:50.250> macrophages

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
macrophages and it is these macrophages

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.390 
macrophages and it is these macrophages
that<00:02:51.450> will<00:02:51.570> actually<00:02:51.810> engulf<00:02:52.650> these<00:02:53.070> old

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
that will actually engulf these old

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.560 
that will actually engulf these old
erythrocytes<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.500> break<00:02:55.500> them<00:02:55.710> down<00:02:55.740> and<00:02:56.570> so

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
erythrocytes and break them down and so

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.940 
erythrocytes and break them down and so
when<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.990> old<00:02:58.170> red<00:02:58.380> blood<00:02:58.560> cells<00:02:58.740> are<00:02:58.830> broken

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
when the old red blood cells are broken

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.300 
when the old red blood cells are broken
down<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.630> end<00:03:00.630> up<00:03:00.990> with<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.170> lot<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.590> hemoglobin

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
down you end up with a lot of hemoglobin

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.280 
down you end up with a lot of hemoglobin
the<00:03:02.850> hemoglobin<00:03:03.150> can<00:03:03.630> then<00:03:03.780> be<00:03:03.870> broken<00:03:04.020> down

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
the hemoglobin can then be broken down

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.140 
the hemoglobin can then be broken down
further<00:03:04.560> into<00:03:04.920> globin<00:03:05.520> and<00:03:05.730> it's<00:03:05.910> heme

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
further into globin and it's heme

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.650 
further into globin and it's heme
component<00:03:07.220> globin<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.400> then<00:03:08.880> broken<00:03:09.150> down<00:03:09.330> to

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
component globin is then broken down to

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.440 
component globin is then broken down to
amino<00:03:09.990> acids<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:11.430> heme<00:03:11.730> is<00:03:11.970> broken<00:03:12.360> down

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
amino acids and the heme is broken down

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.900 
amino acids and the heme is broken down
to<00:03:12.600> two<00:03:12.900> main<00:03:13.230> products<00:03:13.910> bilirubin

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
to two main products bilirubin

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.580 
to two main products bilirubin
essentially<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.750> iron<00:03:18.170> these<00:03:19.170> macrophages

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.500 
essentially and iron these macrophages
are<00:03:20.100> not<00:03:20.280> only<00:03:20.550> found<00:03:20.700> displayed<00:03:21.240> as<00:03:21.420> I

are not only found displayed as I

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.330 
are not only found displayed as I
mentioned<00:03:21.990> but<00:03:22.410> they're<00:03:22.620> also<00:03:22.770> found<00:03:23.070> in<00:03:23.250> the

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
mentioned but they're also found in the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.000 
mentioned but they're also found in the
liver<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:23.850> bone<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.750> they<00:03:25.320> do<00:03:25.380> exactly<00:03:25.890> the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
liver and bone and they do exactly the

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.620 
liver and bone and they do exactly the
same<00:03:26.220> thing<00:03:28.280> most<00:03:29.280> of<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.550> breakdown<00:03:30.090> product

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
same thing most of the breakdown product

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.370 
same thing most of the breakdown product
of<00:03:30.920> red<00:03:31.920> blood<00:03:32.160> cells<00:03:32.460> are<00:03:32.670> recycled<00:03:33.420> so<00:03:34.200> for

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
of red blood cells are recycled so for

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.010 
of red blood cells are recycled so for
example<00:03:34.860> here<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.610> amino<00:03:35.820> acids<00:03:36.360> will<00:03:36.600> enters

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
example here the amino acids will enters

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.500 
example here the amino acids will enters
back<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.440> circulation<00:03:38.070> and<00:03:38.250> then<00:03:38.970> will<00:03:39.210> travel

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
back to circulation and then will travel

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.810 
back to circulation and then will travel
to<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.870> bone<00:03:40.140> marrow<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:41.100> be<00:03:41.250> used<00:03:41.580> in

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
to the bone marrow to be used in

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.970 
to the bone marrow to be used in
erythropoiesis<00:03:42.600> again<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.380> production<00:03:43.860> of

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
erythropoiesis again the production of

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.270 
erythropoiesis again the production of
red<00:03:44.130> blood<00:03:44.160> cells<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:45.470> iron<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.740> bilirubin

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
red blood cells the iron and bilirubin

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.640 
red blood cells the iron and bilirubin
also<00:03:47.550> have<00:03:47.700> similar<00:03:48.030> fates<00:03:48.300> so<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:49.050> iron<00:03:49.260> it

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
also have similar fates so the iron it

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.170 
also have similar fates so the iron it
can't<00:03:49.860> actually<00:03:50.100> travel<00:03:50.460> in<00:03:50.580> the<00:03:50.670> blood<00:03:50.880> just

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
can't actually travel in the blood just

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.070 
can't actually travel in the blood just
like<00:03:51.330> that<00:03:51.600> it<00:03:51.930> has<00:03:52.080> to<00:03:52.110> be<00:03:53.810> attached<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:54.960> a

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
like that it has to be attached to a

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.370 
like that it has to be attached to a
transporter<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.160> so<00:03:56.760> iron<00:03:56.970> obtains<00:03:57.540> a<00:03:57.780> iron

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
transporter and so iron obtains a iron

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.990 
transporter and so iron obtains a iron
transporter<00:03:59.160> from<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.370> liver<00:03:59.580> known<00:03:59.850> as

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
transporter from the liver known as

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.690 
transporter from the liver known as
transferrin<00:04:00.570> and<00:04:00.930> it's<00:04:01.260> this<00:04:01.950> way<00:04:02.220> how<00:04:02.430> iron

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
transferrin and it's this way how iron

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.340 
transferrin and it's this way how iron
makes<00:04:03.120> its<00:04:03.300> way<00:04:03.360> back<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.900> bone<00:04:04.080> marrow

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
makes its way back to the bone marrow

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.160 
makes its way back to the bone marrow
for<00:04:05.330> erythropoiesis<00:04:07.970> bilirubin<00:04:08.970> um<00:04:09.270> goes

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
for erythropoiesis bilirubin um goes

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.790 
for erythropoiesis bilirubin um goes
back<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.770> liver<00:04:11.450> either<00:04:12.450> through<00:04:12.959> albumin

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
back to the liver either through albumin

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.310 
back to the liver either through albumin
transporter<00:04:14.400> or<00:04:14.700> whatnot<00:04:14.940> but<00:04:15.330> essentially

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
transporter or whatnot but essentially

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.440 
transporter or whatnot but essentially
bilirubin<00:04:16.950> ends<00:04:17.190> up<00:04:17.280> in<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.549> liver<00:04:17.850> now

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
bilirubin ends up in the liver now

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.979 
bilirubin ends up in the liver now
bilirubin<00:04:19.049> has<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:19.530> few<00:04:20.280> fates<00:04:20.750> most<00:04:21.750> of<00:04:21.900> the

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
bilirubin has a few fates most of the

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.560 
bilirubin has a few fates most of the
time<00:04:22.229> bilirubin<00:04:22.800> is<00:04:22.919> actually<00:04:23.419> secreted<00:04:24.419> or

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
time bilirubin is actually secreted or

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.080 
time bilirubin is actually secreted or
excreted<00:04:25.350> through<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.710> bile<00:04:26.070> system<00:04:26.520> so

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
excreted through the bile system so

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.040 
excreted through the bile system so
bilirubin<00:04:27.720> will

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
bilirubin will

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.730 
bilirubin will
enter<00:04:28.409> the<00:04:28.530> bile<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.099> then<00:04:29.639> will<00:04:29.759> be<00:04:29.879> secreted

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
enter the bile and then will be secreted

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.279 
enter the bile and then will be secreted
into<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:32.099> duodenum<00:04:32.789> of<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.210> small<00:04:33.419> intestine

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
into the duodenum of the small intestine

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.260 
into the duodenum of the small intestine
and<00:04:34.789> this<00:04:35.789> is<00:04:35.909> through<00:04:36.180> the<00:04:36.300> bile<00:04:36.539> duct

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
and this is through the bile duct

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.839 
and this is through the bile duct
so<00:04:39.270> bilirubin<00:04:39.900> is<00:04:40.020> excreted<00:04:40.470> in<00:04:40.740> feces<00:04:41.009> or<00:04:41.430> it

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:41.849 
so bilirubin is excreted in feces or it

intestine<00:04:51.060> it's<00:04:51.780> important<00:04:52.229> to<00:04:52.289> note<00:04:52.500> that

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
intestine it's important to note that

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.890 
intestine it's important to note that
when<00:04:53.220> we<00:04:53.250> eat<00:04:53.490> nutrients<00:04:54.180> some<00:04:54.690> of<00:04:54.780> these

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
when we eat nutrients some of these

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.110 
when we eat nutrients some of these
nutrients<00:04:55.379> are<00:04:55.470> important<00:04:55.949> in<00:04:56.129> red<00:04:56.940> blood

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120

cell production they are absorbed this

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.480 
cell production they are absorbed this
one<00:04:59.520> intestine<00:05:00.199> so<00:05:01.199> nutrients<00:05:01.949> absorbed<00:05:02.310> for

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
one intestine so nutrients absorbed for

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.050 
one intestine so nutrients absorbed for
erythropoiesis<00:05:03.060> include<00:05:03.840> amino<00:05:04.169> acids

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
erythropoiesis include amino acids

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.290 
erythropoiesis include amino acids

acid and iron and all these are used in

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.320 
acid and iron and all these are used in
erythropoiesis<00:05:13.440> because<00:05:14.430> we<00:05:14.639> need<00:05:14.849> these<00:05:15.060> to

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
erythropoiesis because we need these to

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.659 
erythropoiesis because we need these to
make<00:05:15.509> red<00:05:15.719> blood<00:05:15.960> cells<00:05:16.699> and<00:05:19.099> as<00:05:20.099> I<00:05:20.219> mentioned

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
make red blood cells and as I mentioned

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:21.980 
make red blood cells and as I mentioned
the<00:05:20.759> main<00:05:20.879> function<00:05:21.330> of<00:05:21.419> red<00:05:21.569> blood<00:05:21.719> cell<00:05:21.960> is

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
the main function of red blood cell is

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.330 
the main function of red blood cell is
to<00:05:22.199> transport<00:05:22.770> oxygen<00:05:23.120> to<00:05:24.120> tissues<00:05:25.190> so<00:05:26.190> now

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
to transport oxygen to tissues so now

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.270 
to transport oxygen to tissues so now
let's<00:05:26.610> look<00:05:26.669> at<00:05:26.909> one<00:05:27.629> important<00:05:28.500> hormone<00:05:29.069> or

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
let's look at one important hormone or

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.589 
let's look at one important hormone or
factor<00:05:29.759> that<00:05:29.940> influences<00:05:30.240> erythropoiesis<00:05:31.199> in

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
factor that influences erythropoiesis in

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.200 
factor that influences erythropoiesis in
times<00:05:33.599> of<00:05:33.719> hypoxia<00:05:34.139> which<00:05:34.979> where<00:05:35.610> is<00:05:35.909> where

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
times of hypoxia which where is where

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.390 
times of hypoxia which where is where
when<00:05:36.599> we<00:05:36.750> have<00:05:36.930> a<00:05:37.110> decrease<00:05:37.529> in<00:05:37.560> oxygen<00:05:37.949> levels

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
when we have a decrease in oxygen levels

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.570 
when we have a decrease in oxygen levels
this<00:05:39.360> will<00:05:39.539> stimulate<00:05:39.810> the<00:05:40.500> kidneys<00:05:40.949> to

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
this will stimulate the kidneys to

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.330 
this will stimulate the kidneys to
produce<00:05:42.270> an<00:05:42.389> important<00:05:43.080> hormone<00:05:43.440> called

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
produce an important hormone called

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.120 
produce an important hormone called
erythropoietin<00:05:44.759> and<00:05:45.750> erythropoietin<00:05:46.620> is

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
erythropoietin and erythropoietin is

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.700 
erythropoietin and erythropoietin is
such<00:05:47.400> an<00:05:47.550> important<00:05:48.120> hormone<00:05:48.240> in

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
such an important hormone in

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.689 
such an important hormone in
erythropoiesis<00:05:49.710> because<00:05:50.279> it<00:05:50.400> stimulates

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
erythropoiesis because it stimulates

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.240 
erythropoiesis because it stimulates
erythropoiesis<00:05:51.659> and<00:05:52.169> so<00:05:52.860> when<00:05:53.009> you<00:05:53.130> have

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
erythropoiesis and so when you have

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.170 
erythropoiesis and so when you have
kidney<00:05:53.759> failure<00:05:53.789> for<00:05:54.300> example<00:05:55.879> your<00:05:56.879> kidneys

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
kidney failure for example your kidneys

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:58.430 
kidney failure for example your kidneys
are<00:05:57.300> not<00:05:57.389> able<00:05:57.629> to<00:05:57.779> produce<00:05:57.990> your<00:05:58.259> ether

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
are not able to produce your ether

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.249 
are not able to produce your ether
poison<00:05:58.889> so<00:05:59.069> you<00:05:59.129> you<00:05:59.819> usually<00:06:00.360> develop<00:06:00.900> anemia

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
poison so you you usually develop anemia

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:06.200 
poison so you you usually develop anemia
I<00:06:02.300> hope<00:06:03.300> you<00:06:03.419> enjoyed<00:06:03.659> this<00:06:03.750> a<00:06:03.930> brief<00:06:04.789> video<00:06:05.789> on

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
I hope you enjoyed this a brief video on

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.550 
I hope you enjoyed this a brief video on
red<00:06:07.110> blood<00:06:07.440> cell<00:06:07.620> lifecycle<00:06:08.129> thank<00:06:08.460> you
