00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.420
 a joint operation that took place 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.430
 developed thanks to an exchange of 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.900
 information and joint services that 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.370

 these days then 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.150
 I think the most important aspect 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.490

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.620
 a great gratification one 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.960
 gratification because in short it is a 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.620
 signal that is given to the citizenship that 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.050
 it is given to those who saw this phenomenon as 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.100
 a phenomenon in fact growing and 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.540
 especially difficult to stem 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.260
 we hope the answer was 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.490
