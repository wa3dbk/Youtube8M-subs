00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
that I feel that the video proved me

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.130 
that I feel that the video proved me
wrong<00:00:37.620> was<00:00:38.280> done<00:00:38.420> premeditated<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.989> the

wrong was done premeditated to the

wrong was done premeditated to the
research<00:00:40.559> involving<00:00:41.039> the<00:00:41.160> mathematician

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
research involving the mathematician

research involving the mathematician
tsunamis<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.510> NASA<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:43.050> feel<00:00:43.500> like<00:00:43.739> he<00:00:44.340> had<00:00:44.609> a

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
tsunamis and NASA I feel like he had a

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.540 
tsunamis and NASA I feel like he had a
video<00:00:45.000> response<00:00:45.420> made<00:00:46.410> based<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.429> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
video response made based on the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.650 
video response made based on the
assumption<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.089> how<00:00:48.239> he<00:00:48.300> thought<00:00:48.629> people

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
assumption of how he thought people

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.200 
assumption of how he thought people
would<00:00:49.050> respond<00:00:49.589> and<00:00:50.129> when<00:00:50.339> those<00:00:50.519> responses

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
would respond and when those responses

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.139 
would respond and when those responses
came<00:00:51.480> back<00:00:51.839> in<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.530> football<00:00:52.980> sense<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:54.120> know

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
came back in a football sense you know

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.389 
came back in a football sense you know
his<00:00:54.449> videos<00:00:54.899> became<00:00:55.379> very<00:00:55.620> disjointed<00:00:55.920> and

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
his videos became very disjointed and

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.310 
his videos became very disjointed and
off-topic<00:00:56.789> but<00:00:57.030> because<00:00:57.449> that's<00:00:57.660> all<00:00:57.870> he<00:00:58.050> had

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
off-topic but because that's all he had

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.319 
off-topic but because that's all he had
he<00:00:58.499> had<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.739> post<00:00:58.980> them<00:00:59.159> anyway<00:00:59.460> which<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.179> why

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
he had to post them anyway which is why

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.810 
he had to post them anyway which is why
multiple<00:01:00.989> people<00:01:01.320> requested<00:01:01.920> he<00:01:02.249> formulate

the fan

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.100 
the fan
that<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.460> game<00:02:14.640> only<00:02:14.820> simulates<00:02:15.390> one<00:02:15.630> season

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
have the ability does not say the player

will<00:02:22.920> get<00:02:23.040> better<00:02:23.250> into<00:02:23.610> his<00:02:23.760> career<00:02:24.240> or

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
will get better into his career or

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.450 
will get better into his career or
better<00:02:24.690> into<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.110> season<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.650> says<00:02:26.160> he<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.430> a

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
better into the season it says he is a

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.600 
better into the season it says he is a
workhorse<00:02:26.790> he<00:02:27.360> gets<00:02:27.540> better<00:02:27.780> into<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.230> game

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
workhorse he gets better into the game

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.280 
workhorse he gets better into the game
therefore<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.700> say<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.360> Earl<00:02:30.510> Campbell<00:02:30.900> year

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
therefore to say that Earl Campbell year

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.230 
therefore to say that Earl Campbell year
one<00:02:31.650> would<00:02:32.010> be<00:02:32.130> significantly<00:02:32.760> worse<00:02:33.000> than

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
one would be significantly worse than

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.300 
one would be significantly worse than
Earl<00:02:33.390> Campbell<00:02:33.720> year<00:02:34.050> 75<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.860> ludicrous

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
Earl Campbell year 75 is ludicrous

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.950 
Earl Campbell year 75 is ludicrous
because<00:02:35.490> you<00:02:35.790> have<00:02:35.970> nothing<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.510> back<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.900> up

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
because you have nothing to back that up

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.290 
because you have nothing to back that up
so<00:02:37.800> certainly<00:02:38.130> your<00:02:38.370> response<00:02:38.790> has<00:02:39.030> always

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
so certainly your response has always

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.870 
so certainly your response has always
been<00:02:39.510> everybody<00:02:40.380> but<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:40.860> ignorant<00:02:41.220> but

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
been everybody but you is ignorant but

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.150 
been everybody but you is ignorant but
then<00:02:42.000> I<00:02:42.120> would<00:02:42.300> say<00:02:42.540> why<00:02:43.200> would<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.470> have<00:02:43.860> to

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
then I would say why would you have to

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.210 
then I would say why would you have to
mediate<00:02:44.940> your<00:02:45.240> responses<00:02:46.230> by<00:02:46.410> blocking<00:02:46.860> them

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
mediate your responses by blocking them

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.860 
mediate your responses by blocking them
or<00:02:47.370> have<00:02:47.490> them<00:02:47.550> pending<00:02:48.000> approval<00:02:48.540> why<00:02:48.660> would

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
or have them pending approval why would

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.020 
or have them pending approval why would
you<00:02:48.959> have<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.170> turn<00:02:49.560> off<00:02:49.620> video<00:02:50.490> ratings

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
you have to turn off video ratings

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.610 
you have to turn off video ratings
because<00:02:51.240> you<00:02:51.570> already<00:02:51.780> knew<00:02:52.170> ahead<00:02:52.320> of<00:02:52.500> time

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
because you already knew ahead of time

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.800 
because you already knew ahead of time
that<00:02:52.800> your<00:02:53.430> video<00:02:53.580> responses<00:02:54.360> didn't<00:02:54.690> make

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
that your video responses didn't make

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.570 
that your video responses didn't make
any<00:02:54.990> sense<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.590> had<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.920> do<00:02:56.070> something<00:02:56.459> to

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
any sense and you had to do something to

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.920 
any sense and you had to do something to
limit<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.000> impact<00:02:57.120> they<00:02:57.480> were<00:02:57.570> going<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.780> have

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
limit the impact they were going to have

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.020 
limit the impact they were going to have
on<00:02:58.110> your<00:02:58.140> credibility<00:02:58.560> which<00:02:59.190> by<00:02:59.490> the<00:02:59.550> way<00:02:59.700> is

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
on your credibility which by the way is

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.780 
on your credibility which by the way is
already<00:03:01.050> because<00:03:01.740> you<00:03:02.190> come<00:03:02.430> out<00:03:02.580> with

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
already because you come out with

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.880 
already because you come out with
this<00:03:02.970> proof<00:03:03.330> versus<00:03:03.720> persuasion<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.530> your

this proof versus persuasion and your

this proof versus persuasion and your

proof has nothing to do with the

proof has nothing to do with the

relevant topics and as I've proven in

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.010 
relevant topics and as I've proven in
the<00:03:08.490> video<00:03:08.790> you<00:03:08.850> had<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.330> have<00:03:09.510> taken<00:03:09.690> down

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
the video you had to have taken down

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.600 
the video you had to have taken down
even<00:03:10.560> when<00:03:10.680> you<00:03:10.830> come<00:03:11.070> out<00:03:11.220> with<00:03:11.250> false

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
even when you come out with false

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.310 
even when you come out with false
information<00:03:11.940> like<00:03:12.840> when<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.140> said

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
information like when you said

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.260 
information like when you said
backbreaker<00:03:13.920> would<00:03:14.190> be<00:03:14.310> rendered<00:03:14.730> moot

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
backbreaker would be rendered moot

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.570 
backbreaker would be rendered moot
because<00:03:15.870> all<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.470> players<00:03:16.709> but<00:03:17.010> have<00:03:17.130> static

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
because all the players but have static

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.770 
because all the players but have static
height<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:17.910> weight<00:03:18.060> thus<00:03:18.330> they<00:03:18.510> would<00:03:18.660> all

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
height and weight thus they would all

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.810 
height and weight thus they would all
tackle<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.320> same<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.950> never<00:03:20.160> came<00:03:20.430> out<00:03:20.489> and

tackle the same you never came out and

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.060 
tackle the same you never came out and
