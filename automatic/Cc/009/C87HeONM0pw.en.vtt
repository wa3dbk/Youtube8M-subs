in<00:01:53.799> quarters<00:01:54.280> for<00:01:54.549> you<00:01:54.729> so<00:01:54.969> that<00:01:55.119> you<00:01:55.179> can

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
in quarters for you so that you can

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.990 
in quarters for you so that you can
print<00:01:55.539> it<00:01:55.570> out<00:01:55.689> of<00:01:55.990> four<00:01:56.259> sheets<00:01:56.729> a4<00:01:57.729> paper

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
print it out of four sheets a4 paper

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.450 
print it out of four sheets a4 paper
which<00:01:58.299> what<00:01:58.630> we've<00:01:58.840> actually<00:01:59.110> done<00:01:59.319> here<00:01:59.740> so

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
which what we've actually done here so

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.029 
which what we've actually done here so
we've<00:02:00.610> got<00:02:00.759> four<00:02:01.060> different<00:02:01.259> a4<00:02:02.259> sheets<00:02:02.590> and

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
we've got four different a4 sheets and

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.459 
we've got four different a4 sheets and
we<00:02:03.490> just<00:02:03.670> stack<00:02:03.880> them<00:02:04.060> together<00:02:04.289> if<00:02:05.289> you're

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
we just stack them together if you're

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.169 
we just stack them together if you're
fortunate<00:02:05.710> enough<00:02:06.039> to<00:02:06.250> have<00:02:06.429> a<00:02:06.610> beta<00:02:06.880> 3

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
fortunate enough to have a beta 3

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.419 
fortunate enough to have a beta 3
printer<00:02:07.539> and<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.470> can<00:02:08.500> print<00:02:08.619> it<00:02:08.890> out<00:02:09.009> in<00:02:09.220> two

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
printer and you can print it out in two

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.240 
printer and you can print it out in two
halves<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:11.319> that's<00:02:11.440> quite<00:02:11.680> simple<00:02:11.980> to

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
halves so that's quite simple to

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.289 
halves so that's quite simple to
actually<00:02:12.519> put<00:02:12.849> them<00:02:13.000> together<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:16.090> way<00:02:16.120> that

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
actually put them together the way that

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.170 
actually put them together the way that
we<00:02:16.599> play<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.870> game<00:02:17.230> at<00:02:17.440> our<00:02:17.620> school<00:02:18.180> there's

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
we play the game at our school there's

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.789 
we play the game at our school there's
obviously<00:02:19.569> lots<00:02:20.049> of<00:02:20.260> different<00:02:20.650> ways<00:02:20.769> that

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
obviously lots of different ways that

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.220 
obviously lots of different ways that
you<00:02:21.069> can<00:02:21.310> play<00:02:21.459> a<00:02:21.880> single<00:02:22.329> board<00:02:22.660> game<00:02:22.959> like

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
you can play a single board game like

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
you can play a single board game like
this<00:02:24.420> just<00:02:25.420> one<00:02:25.750> basic<00:02:26.500> straightforward<00:02:26.769> way

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
this just one basic straightforward way

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.460 
this just one basic straightforward way
that<00:02:27.489> I'd<00:02:27.579> like<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.760> show<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.090> so<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.470> have

bat is so you have the students and they
all<00:02:34.510> obviously<00:02:34.989> have<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.260> piece<00:02:35.769> and<00:02:36.130> use<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.730> die

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
all obviously have a piece and use a die

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.979 
all obviously have a piece and use a die
as<00:02:37.299> well<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:38.370> on<00:02:39.370> this<00:02:39.579> game<00:02:39.849> is<00:02:40.090> boy<00:02:40.450> boy<00:02:40.690> boy

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
as well and on this game is boy boy boy

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
well so on the game board you'll see we

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.949 
well so on the game board you'll see we
have<00:03:15.609> a<00:03:15.639> lot<00:03:15.880> of<00:03:15.910> different<00:03:16.359> words<00:03:16.600> written

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
have a lot of different words written

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.259 
have a lot of different words written
here<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:17.620> they're<00:03:18.190> all<00:03:18.220> colored<00:03:19.120> in<00:03:19.209> green

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
here and they're all colored in green

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.910 
here and they're all colored in green
red<00:03:20.019> orange<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:21.280> blue<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.620> as<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:23.769> can<00:03:23.859> see

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
red orange and blue and as you can see

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.849 
red orange and blue and as you can see
with<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.430> the

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
with the the

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.199 
with the the
targets<00:03:26.859> on<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.160> board<00:03:27.400> they're<00:03:28.030> all

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
targets on the board they're all

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.199 
targets on the board they're all
color-coded<00:03:28.630> so<00:03:29.260> blue<00:03:30.060> corresponds<00:03:31.060> with

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
color-coded so blue corresponds with

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.550 
color-coded so blue corresponds with
blue<00:03:31.840> so<00:03:32.170> blue<00:03:32.380> is<00:03:32.680> or<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.370> all<00:03:33.819> the<00:03:33.910> blue

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
blue so blue is or and all the blue

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.729 
blue so blue is or and all the blue
have<00:03:34.800> the<00:03:35.239> target<00:03:36.239> contained<00:03:36.690> within<00:03:36.959> them<00:03:37.200> so

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
have the target contained within them so

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.250 
have the target contained within them so
in<00:03:37.950> this<00:03:38.069> case<00:03:38.340> I'm<00:03:38.640> stopping<00:03:39.150> on<00:03:39.330> her<00:03:39.660> as<00:03:40.020> an

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
in this case I'm stopping on her as an

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.280 
in this case I'm stopping on her as an
arrow<00:03:40.500> girl<00:03:41.010> it's<00:03:41.580> green<00:03:42.090> so<00:03:42.420> I<00:03:42.450> can<00:03:42.750> read<00:03:42.959> any

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
of the words color-coded green and I'll

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.530 
of the words color-coded green and I'll
be<00:03:46.319> practicing<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:47.340> funny<00:03:47.730> with<00:03:47.940> my<00:03:48.150> reading

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
be practicing that funny with my reading

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.350 
be practicing that funny with my reading
so<00:03:50.870> first<00:03:51.870> for<00:03:52.650> example<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.760> that's

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
so first for example and that's

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.610 
so first for example and that's
basically<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.930> way<00:03:54.989> that<00:03:55.110> we<00:03:55.349> play<00:03:55.590> the

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
basically the way that we play the

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.710 
basically the way that we play the
considered<00:03:56.220> game<00:03:56.400> was<00:03:56.640> have<00:03:56.819> got<00:03:57.000> some<00:03:57.239> things

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
considered game was have got some things

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.530 
considered game was have got some things
in<00:03:57.930> them<00:03:58.140> like<00:03:58.349> missile<00:03:59.160> roll<00:03:59.370> here<00:03:59.880> or<00:04:00.239> go

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
in them like missile roll here or go

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.009 
in them like missile roll here or go
forward<00:04:00.959> five<00:04:01.440> here<00:04:02.450> swapped<00:04:03.450> with<00:04:03.660> last

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
forward five here swapped with last

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.920 
forward five here swapped with last
place<00:04:04.530> here<00:04:05.099> so<00:04:05.459> we've<00:04:06.120> got<00:04:06.300> some<00:04:06.450> things<00:04:06.690> like
