that<00:05:55.990> often<00:05:56.170> because<00:05:56.740> I<00:05:56.920> commute<00:05:57.430> into<00:05:57.670> the

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:57.790 
that often because I commute into the

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:00.360 
that often because I commute into the
city<00:05:57.910> for<00:05:58.360> work<00:05:58.390> and<00:05:58.840> we<00:05:59.440> always<00:05:59.620> wear<00:05:59.860> flats

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
city for work and we always wear flats

city for work and we always wear flats
you<00:06:00.670> know<00:06:00.760> what<00:06:00.910> already<00:06:01.180> heels<00:06:01.420> on<00:06:01.540> the<00:06:01.630> train

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
you know what already heels on the train

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.050 
you know what already heels on the train
because<00:06:02.110> then<00:06:02.380> you<00:06:02.500> can't<00:06:02.740> balance<00:06:03.030> for<00:06:04.030> that

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
because then you can't balance for that

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.480 
because then you can't balance for that
reason<00:06:04.510> pans<00:06:05.260> are<00:06:05.500> less<00:06:05.740> practical<00:06:06.250> because

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
reason pans are less practical because

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.100 
reason pans are less practical because
with<00:06:06.820> slacks<00:06:07.120> they're<00:06:07.330> just<00:06:07.480> gonna<00:06:07.600> drag<00:06:07.930> on
