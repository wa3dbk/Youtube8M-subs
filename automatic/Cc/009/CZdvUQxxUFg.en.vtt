we're<00:00:50.700> gonna<00:00:50.789> call<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.300> my<00:00:51.989> other<00:00:52.170> video<00:00:53.539> so

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
we're gonna call it my other video so

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:01.580 
we're gonna call it my other video so
that's<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.110> pretty<00:00:55.350> cool<00:00:55.980> looking

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.719 

launched<00:01:02.520> an<00:01:02.640> iceberg

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.480 

and<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.390> volcanoes<00:01:07.930> will<00:01:08.320> change<00:01:09.220> its

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
and the volcanoes will change its

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:31.340 
and the volcanoes will change its
direction

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.240 

there<00:01:31.920> go

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
there go

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.190 
there go
so<00:01:33.850> that<00:01:34.240> might<00:01:34.480> not<00:01:34.690> be<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:34.960> best<00:01:37.200> that's

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
so that might not be the best that's

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:51.899 
so that might not be the best that's
kind<00:01:39.160> of<00:01:39.250> bad<00:01:39.640> score<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:45.510> return

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.050 

and<00:01:52.909> there<00:01:53.479> we<00:01:53.600> go<00:01:53.630> that's<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.289> first<00:01:55.060> golden

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
and there we go that's the first golden

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.789 
and there we go that's the first golden
egg<00:01:56.329> story<00:01:56.630> of<00:01:57.219> the<00:01:58.219> right<00:01:58.399> planet<00:01:59.500> and<00:02:00.500> you

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
egg story of the right planet and you

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.209 
egg story of the right planet and you
can<00:02:00.829> always<00:02:01.100> go<00:02:01.460> back<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:02.619> here<00:02:03.619> so<00:02:03.920> there's

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
can always go back to here so there's

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.410 
can always go back to here so there's
three<00:02:04.960> three<00:02:05.960> space<00:02:06.560> machines<00:02:07.549> whatever<00:02:07.969> I

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
three three space machines whatever I

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.270 
three three space machines whatever I
don't<00:02:08.810> know<00:02:08.869> them<00:02:09.049> but<00:02:09.729> that<00:02:10.729> was<00:02:10.849> one<00:02:12.280> so

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
don't know them but that was one so

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.339 
don't know them but that was one so
apparently<00:02:14.030> they<00:02:14.209> teamed<00:02:14.450> up<00:02:14.569> with<00:02:14.690> NASA<00:02:15.019> so

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
apparently they teamed up with NASA so

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:21.369 
apparently they teamed up with NASA so
they<00:02:15.440> can<00:02:15.620> learn<00:02:15.709> more<00:02:16.040> about<00:02:16.160> bees<00:02:20.110> so<00:02:21.110> I<00:02:21.140> hope

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
they can learn more about bees so I hope

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.519 
they can learn more about bees so I hope
you<00:02:21.530> enjoy<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:21.980> subscribe<00:02:22.099> for<00:02:22.340> more
