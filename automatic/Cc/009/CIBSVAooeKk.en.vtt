00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
these batteries are running at true 100

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.280 
these batteries are running at true 100
C<00:02:31.570> which<00:02:32.320> is<00:02:32.530> incredibly<00:02:33.160> fast<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:33.990> I<00:02:34.990> called

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
C which is incredibly fast and I called

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.440 
C which is incredibly fast and I called
max<00:02:35.530> amps<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:36.100> they<00:02:36.220> said<00:02:36.490> it<00:02:36.610> should<00:02:36.790> be<00:02:36.910> fine

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
max amps and they said it should be fine

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.000 
max amps and they said it should be fine
this<00:02:37.870> means<00:02:38.080> I'll<00:02:38.260> have<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.410> lot<00:02:38.620> faster

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
this means I'll have a lot faster

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.340 
this means I'll have a lot faster
acceleration<00:02:41.220> so<00:02:42.220> uh<00:02:42.250> yeah<00:02:42.990> these<00:02:43.990> batteries

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
acceleration so uh yeah these batteries
