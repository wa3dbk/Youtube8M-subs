00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 and 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.940
 welcome to another music you 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.580
 let's show another amplifier 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.310
 this new company of national liquors 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.990
 Argentines we did this is the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.029
 second of the combos that have 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.839
 sent to call music is here to try 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:28.189
 are world premieres we could say 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:33.450
 world premieres gentlemen the luthier 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:35.090
 overdrive many names but hey it's 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.680
 all right 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:45.900
 carlitos good the ams tuba truth is a 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.460
 combo 60 watts 100% valve is has 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.160
 a speaker of two plays selection 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.730
 has built-in reverby has master 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.820
 has a switch of three positions of 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.250
 brightness 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.350
 has a is a monkey channel this 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.760
 businessman is a mono channel but where 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.200
 there's the trick and the effect look back 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.310
 and has a switch to change 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.530
 rectification by diodes or rectification 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.020
 with a valve simulator that makes 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.870
 the team has more blood that is towards 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.270
 a fluffy problem 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.100
 It's a big combo but you go and 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.340
 then there is the trick of this head 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.930
 good this head gentlemen includes is a 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.140
 Mule channel but has an uncle screamer 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.630
 inside that if we promote local 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.680
 with all the flat controls and here 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.950
 above you have drayton level which are the 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.950
 controls 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.670
 which serves to prepare basically if 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.800
 you play blues with this convict and a 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.190
 food switch I am already happy because you have 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.280
 the broad and you have the a rever peter is the 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.900
 Uncle writes what's inside you look 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.300
 defect if you want to put things in the 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.880
 effects the idea is good and more in a 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.460
 team like this one that is aimed at 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.460
 laburante of the guy who plays a lot outside 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.150
 because it's a big one, it's not small, it's not 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.820
 is a convict is a power amp and it sounds 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.860
 loud let's hear what we finish 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.930
 psychiatrist recorded directly to pro 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.390
 tools as our new way of 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.459
 test amplifiers and pedals 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.129
 questions have the sharpest definition 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.900
 possible of the audio of this new look and 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.239
 you overdrive 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.500
 we came out good let's try our 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.470
 luthier ams 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.330
 drive like a bitch that studio like 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.580
 it said directly recorded to pro tools 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:44.080
 without any qualification or anything 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:44.080
 let's start with the channel off 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.610
 i 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.319
 visual 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.200
 ah 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.120
 let's give it a little bit to shine in 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.120
 position 1 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.660
 position 2 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.709
 all right 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.709
 ah 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.340
 with this guitar 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.350
 the equalization is quite enough 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.350
 active 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.530
 ah 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.900
 and 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.439
 ok let's see what happens if we turn on the 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.439
 discrimination 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.050
 First 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.050
 to 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:37.110
 m 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:37.110
 i 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.960
 i 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.400
 Y 

00:05:06.359 --> 00:05:09.359
 or 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:20.650
 let's see if we give gas to the channel 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:23.449
 let's say the volume so we make break a 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:27.279
 little the channel 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.279
 is breaking the broad 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:30.649
 and 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.530
 ah 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.919
 all right 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.410
 the 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:28.720
 when I went up he lowered the guitar volume 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:31.020
 7th distortion change to clean with the 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.020
 volume 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.520
 and added liu screamer and everything 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.470
 well basically we can say that he 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:00.150
 they looked 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.910
 the 60-watt combo is important 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:05.250
 value 1 by 12 is a broad and very 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.750
 versatile is a mono channel but that 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.780
 you can do krantzer because he has 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.760
 master and at the same time he has an uncle 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.650
 estimated within having rivero and everything 

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.020
 the footsie char catches and pays for 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:19.170
 you can also change the rectification 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:22.980
 of valvular simile is not valve 

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:24.780
 simulated pressure to diodes as always 

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:27.210
 we tell you in the music after trying it 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.310
 for you we show you the options 

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:32.220
 for you to say that the company 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.720
 let's say luthier a new company enters 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.640
 in the market of valve topics 

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.980
 national regos have more to choose from 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:41.750
 I hope you liked this test 

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.750
 been another test of the musical
