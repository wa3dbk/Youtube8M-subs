00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.160
 very good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.470
 new unboxing tv video today plays 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.970
 techno news and we will talk about the sacred 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.000
 xenon 70 and 101 new events 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.650
 members within your xenon family 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.050
 the numbers indicate the size of the 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.150
 screen of the devices and both 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.050
 new ones are above and below 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:39.110
 of the existing ones to gross 101 100 11 and 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.570
 70 will be the most striking of both 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.510
 devices we have it in the 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.550
 3g connectivity competition as standard and 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.550
 unlocked to accept cards 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.409
 any operator a known one is not 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.269
 only for data we can perform 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.519
 phone calls or sending messages 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.920
 with them using headphones with 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.989
 microphone logically we also have 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.680
 wifi and bluetooth in addition to the typical 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:07.970
 Motion sensors and gps example 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:10.780
 only in the case topics in 101 do we have 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.840
 micro hdmi output 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.260
 let's know them better separately and 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.840
 we started with the macros 70 weeks with 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.290
 the smallest model 7 inches we 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.620
 we found an affordable tablet 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.990
 sold at 140 euros in the store 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:32.410
 the company for the price we can not 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.270
 expect infarct specifications like this 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.050
 that we have a dual-core chipset 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:43.450
 give the best test to 7 working at 1.2 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:45.580
 gigahertz the gpu is a bad rm and 400 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.680
 if the screen has standard resolution 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:53.110
 and according to its size 1024 x 600 pixels 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.520
 made with an ips panel as is 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.179
 usual in the gala firm 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:03.469
 it seems to us that in memory it goes a little 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:05.659
 cuts 512 mb of ram and 4 gb for 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.629
 storage that we can expand 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.170
 using microsd cards either 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:16.700
 we can expect too much from the 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.099
 first but there they are with 2 and 0.3 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.879
 Megapixels and full dimensions 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:25.900
 in the afternoon they are 192 percent 10 x 10 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:30.900
 as 2 millimeters and weigh 360 degrees 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.390
 now we go with the across 101 xenon 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.470
 of size and price going on time as 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.150
 escaped 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:42.760
 at 250 euros to move a screen with 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.330
 1,280 x 800 pixels was another hardware 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.960
 powerful 4 cores like the other are 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:53.310
 yesterday I cut to 7 that work at 1.2 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:58.150
 gigahertz and the army is a power 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.850
 vrs gel x 544 the internal memory of the 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.630
 production of euros in on is 8 out of 8 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:08.110
 expandable gb with micro sd and the ram goes up 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.959
 to mujica cameras are the same 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.150
 than in the small model with 2 and 0.3 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:17.800
 megapixels and full dimensions 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.880
 they are 246 270 x 10 millimeters and weigh 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.970
 630 grams 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.320
 now let's see the price and 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:31.740
 availability of seventy and one hundred 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.870
 appeared initially in Germany but 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.540
 we can see on the Spanish website here 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.760
 is so visual and bless the price or if what 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.080
 we have anticipated 140 euros for the 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.780
 model 7 inches and 250 euros for the 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.060
 10.1 inches both move in prices 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.610
 who ask us for other proposals 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.590
 affordable but here the interesting thing is 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:58.260
 in which 3g connectivity we are 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.500
 really before a phone and it's 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.980
 built-in standard reset 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:09.150
 they also share the system version 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:12.330
 operative android 4.7 bit with a minimum 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.010
 personalization with regard to 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.470
 design is characterized by 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.260
 introduction of a silver frame on 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.290
 white to some they will remember some 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:26.190
 samsung models and in model 101 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:29.400
 we have the aluminum housing that you 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.240
 I leave here in an image so that later 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.240
 The reflections 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.440
 you can put our opinion in the 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.880
 comments and this has been all for today 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.090
 vision has liked this video you give 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:48.520
 to the parity hand 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:51.480
 subscribed and see you in the 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.480
 next video
