00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.400

which<00:00:41.550> failed<00:00:41.820> horribly<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.450> then<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.050> tried

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
which failed horribly and then I tried

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.670 
which failed horribly and then I tried
to<00:00:43.500> some<00:00:43.710> 2v<00:00:43.890> two<00:00:44.040> synoptic<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.180> then<00:00:45.680> yeah

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
to some 2v two synoptic and then yeah

superior line this is where I thought

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.770 
superior line this is where I thought
the<00:03:23.920> weakness<00:03:24.400> was<00:03:24.670> on<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:26.110> Emerson<00:03:26.530> go<00:03:27.490> away

dad shut up and yeah that was where I

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.460 
dad shut up and yeah that was where I
would<00:03:32.440> I<00:03:32.560> thought<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.130> weakness<00:03:33.490> was<00:03:33.760> on<00:03:34.470> his

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
would I thought the weakness was on his

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.970 
would I thought the weakness was on his
line<00:03:36.600> so<00:03:37.600> I<00:03:37.840> wouldn't<00:03:38.320> have<00:03:38.350> attacked<00:03:38.560> the

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
line so I wouldn't have attacked the

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.280 
line so I wouldn't have attacked the
center<00:03:39.459> until<00:03:39.730> I<00:03:39.790> exploited<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.780> weakness<00:03:41.140> on

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
center until I exploited the weakness on

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.940 
center until I exploited the weakness on
the<00:03:41.410> right<00:03:41.620> so<00:03:42.630> yeah<00:03:43.630> so<00:03:44.230> on<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.620> right<00:03:44.770> which

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.020 
the right so yeah so on the right which
is<00:03:45.070> where<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.250> weakness<00:03:45.550> was<00:03:45.700> I<00:03:45.850> would<00:03:46.000> have

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
is where the weakness was I would have

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.220 
is where the weakness was I would have
probably<00:03:46.209> poured<00:03:46.600> all<00:03:46.750> my<00:03:46.780> efforts<00:03:47.140> into

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
probably poured all my efforts into

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.260 
probably poured all my efforts into
attacking<00:03:47.620> nax<00:03:47.950> blow<00:03:48.459> at<00:03:48.580> the<00:03:48.610> gap<00:03:48.880> and<00:03:49.090> then

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
attacking nax blow at the gap and then

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.910 
attacking nax blow at the gap and then
got<00:03:49.450> through<00:03:49.720> and<00:03:49.840> round<00:03:50.080> and<00:03:50.230> flanked<00:03:50.739> like

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
got through and round and flanked like

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.620 
got through and round and flanked like
that<00:03:51.040> instead<00:03:51.250> of<00:03:51.310> engaging<00:03:51.489> him<00:03:52.000> head-on<00:03:52.239> and

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
that instead of engaging him head-on and

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.750 
that instead of engaging him head-on and
engaging<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.230> weak<00:03:53.380> spot<00:03:53.680> all<00:03:53.860> at<00:03:54.010> once<00:03:54.220> means

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
engaging the weak spot all at once means

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.140 
engaging the weak spot all at once means
you<00:03:54.940> lose<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:56.260> main<00:03:56.470> fight<00:03:56.830> and<00:03:57.070> then<00:03:57.400> you<00:03:57.670> win

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
you lose the main fight and then you win

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.630 
you lose the main fight and then you win
where<00:03:58.570> his<00:03:58.810> weakness<00:03:59.260> was<00:03:59.530> was<00:03:59.920> of<00:04:00.459> course

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
where his weakness was was of course

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.009 
where his weakness was was of course
you've<00:04:00.820> lost<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.090> main<00:04:01.239> final<00:04:01.660> he<00:04:01.720> doesn't

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
you've lost the main final he doesn't

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.840 
you've lost the main final he doesn't

left<00:04:13.690> flank<00:04:13.930> starts<00:04:14.230> to<00:04:14.350> collapse<00:04:14.620> as<00:04:14.890> the

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
left flank starts to collapse as the

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.180 
left flank starts to collapse as the
Ferguson's<00:04:16.330> take<00:04:16.959> their<00:04:17.169> toll<00:04:17.410> no<00:04:17.950> it's<00:04:18.100> the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
Ferguson's take their toll no it's the

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.890 
Ferguson's take their toll no it's the
distance<00:04:18.609> between<00:04:18.850> his<00:04:19.239> skirmish<00:04:19.630> line<00:04:19.750> on

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
distance between his skirmish line on

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.010 
distance between his skirmish line on
this<00:04:20.169> line<00:04:20.410> and<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:21.070> same<00:04:21.310> with<00:04:21.489> me<00:04:22.020> we're

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
this line and the same with me we're

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.500 
this line and the same with me we're
keeping<00:04:23.350> her<00:04:23.470> or<00:04:24.130> me<00:04:24.280> our<00:04:24.669> skirmishers<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:25.240> long

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
keeping her or me our skirmishers a long

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.840 
keeping her or me our skirmishers a long
way<00:04:25.720> but<00:04:26.440> in<00:04:26.770> front<00:04:27.040> of<00:04:27.130> our<00:04:27.250> lines<00:04:27.460> so<00:04:27.700> our

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
way but in front of our lines so our

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.790 
way but in front of our lines so our
line<00:04:28.060> doesn't<00:04:28.270> take<00:04:28.419> unnecessary<00:04:28.720> losses<00:04:29.320> and

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
line doesn't take unnecessary losses and

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.520 
line doesn't take unnecessary losses and
so<00:04:29.950> think<00:04:30.130> Rosen<00:04:30.490> did<00:04:30.700> not<00:04:30.910> due<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:32.440> the

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
so think Rosen did not due to the

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.830 
so think Rosen did not due to the
fortunately<00:04:33.040> he<00:04:33.490> had<00:04:33.970> his<00:04:34.150> skirmisher<00:04:34.660> line

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
fortunately he had his skirmisher line

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.800 
fortunately he had his skirmisher line
too<00:04:35.080> close<00:04:35.410> to<00:04:35.770> his<00:04:36.040> line<00:04:36.729> and<00:04:37.030> his<00:04:37.330> line<00:04:37.570> got

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
too close to his line and his line got

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.500 
too close to his line and his line got
blasted<00:04:38.200> as<00:04:38.710> well<00:04:38.890> as<00:04:39.010> his<00:04:39.160> skirmishers<00:04:39.729> so

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
blasted as well as his skirmishers so

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.890 
blasted as well as his skirmishers so
that<00:04:40.780> didn't<00:04:41.050> do<00:04:41.140> too<00:04:41.350> much

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
that didn't do too much

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.740 
that didn't do too much
good<00:04:42.229> for<00:04:42.410> him<00:04:42.470> okay<00:04:43.160> he's<00:04:43.759> still<00:04:44.240> battling

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
good for him okay he's still battling

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.110 
good for him okay he's still battling
away<00:04:45.139> on<00:04:45.470> the<00:04:45.710> right<00:04:45.889> side<00:04:46.190> but<00:04:46.490> as<00:04:46.699> he's

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
away on the right side but as he's

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.879 
away on the right side but as he's
losing<00:04:47.509> in<00:04:47.600> the<00:04:47.690> center<00:04:48.139> it's<00:04:48.350> only<00:04:48.710> a<00:04:48.740> matter

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
losing in the center it's only a matter

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.100 
losing in the center it's only a matter
of<00:04:49.070> time<00:04:49.160> until<00:04:49.400> the<00:04:49.910> Swede<00:04:50.210> wraps<00:04:50.539> around<00:04:50.780> his

of time until the Swede wraps around his
flank<00:04:51.410> but<00:04:52.310> he<00:04:52.400> does<00:04:52.550> a<00:04:52.580> good<00:04:52.729> job<00:04:52.789> of<00:04:53.090> keeping

part actually I didn't realize that was
going<00:05:12.289> to<00:05:12.320> happen<00:05:12.440> so<00:05:12.740> quickly<00:05:13.009> because<00:05:13.220> I

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
there is he just clicked an attack order

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.879 
there is he just clicked an attack order
on<00:05:49.460> the<00:05:49.669> Toretto<00:05:50.660> unit<00:05:51.080> which<00:05:51.229> had<00:05:51.380> routed<00:05:51.590> and

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889 
on the Toretto unit which had routed and

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:53.350 
on the Toretto unit which had routed and

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
then forgotten to cancel the attack

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.240 
then forgotten to cancel the attack
order<00:05:53.720> because<00:05:54.199> he<00:05:54.260> does<00:05:54.470> something<00:05:54.979> similar

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
order because he does something similar

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.050 
of his 2nd Ferguson unit which is a hell

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.260 
of his 2nd Ferguson unit which is a hell
of<00:05:57.080> a<00:05:57.199> waste<00:05:57.409> of<00:05:57.530> his<00:05:57.650> best<00:05:57.889> units<00:05:58.310> room<00:05:58.490> okay

advantage<00:06:54.229> because<00:06:54.979> the<00:06:55.370> Swede<00:06:55.669> is<00:06:55.999> going<00:06:56.240> to

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300 
advantage because the Swede is going to

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.749 
advantage because the Swede is going to
start<00:06:56.479> wrapping<00:06:56.870> up<00:06:56.990> on<00:06:57.139> his<00:06:57.289> white<00:06:57.620> very<00:06:58.309> soon
