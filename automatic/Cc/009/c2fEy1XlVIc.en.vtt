listen<00:00:00.329> to<00:00:00.599> my<00:00:00.780> heavyweight<00:00:01.380> sumo<00:00:01.770> that<00:00:02.040> I'm

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
listen to my heavyweight sumo that I'm

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.800 
listen to my heavyweight sumo that I'm
making<00:00:02.550> for<00:00:02.760> the<00:00:02.820> National<00:00:03.270> Box<00:00:03.480> challenge

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
making for the National Box challenge

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.200 
making for the National Box challenge
I'm<00:00:04.230> going<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.620> be<00:00:04.710> building<00:00:04.890> two<00:00:05.430> mini<00:00:05.730> sumos

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
I'm going to be building two mini sumos

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.990 
I'm going to be building two mini sumos
and<00:00:06.620> so<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:07.649> took<00:00:07.740> out<00:00:07.980> some<00:00:08.280> foam<00:00:08.519> board<00:00:08.790> and

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
and so I took out some foam board and

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.209 
and so I took out some foam board and
paper<00:00:09.210> and<00:00:09.360> have<00:00:09.690> been<00:00:09.840> mocking<00:00:10.080> up<00:00:10.380> different

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
paper and have been mocking up different

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.089 
paper and have been mocking up different
design<00:00:11.550> ideas<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.360> may<00:00:12.540> try<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.809> build<00:00:13.099> so

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
design ideas that I may try to build so

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.860 
design ideas that I may try to build so
this<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:15.000> prototype<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.750> have

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
this is the prototype that I have

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.740 
this is the prototype that I have
stumbled<00:00:16.170> on<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.880> as<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:18.090> can<00:00:18.240> see<00:00:18.270> is

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
stumbled on and as you can see is

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.859 
stumbled on and as you can see is
basically<00:00:19.529> just<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.859> box<00:00:20.100> but<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.119> has<00:00:21.330> two

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
basically just a box but it has two

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.769 
basically just a box but it has two
wheels<00:00:22.140> one<00:00:22.560> on<00:00:22.710> each<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.779> pushing

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
wheels one on each of the I pushing

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.560 
wheels one on each of the I pushing
surfaces<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.970> these<00:00:26.970> wheels<00:00:27.269> will<00:00:27.420> be

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
surfaces and these wheels will be

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.630 
surfaces and these wheels will be
rotating<00:00:27.750> upward<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.800> hopefully<00:00:29.519> make

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
rotating upward and hopefully make

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.999 
rotating upward and hopefully make
contact<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.359> an<00:00:30.449> opponent<00:00:30.869> robot<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.710> lift

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
contact with an opponent robot to lift

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.620 
contact with an opponent robot to lift
them<00:00:32.219> up<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.460> help<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.850> push<00:00:33.059> them<00:00:33.270> out<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
them up and help to push them out of the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.260 
them up and help to push them out of the
ring<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.649> lot<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.309> opponent<00:00:35.700> robots<00:00:36.030> from

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
ring a lot of the opponent robots from

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.330 
ring a lot of the opponent robots from
last<00:00:36.540> year<00:00:36.780> did<00:00:36.960> not<00:00:37.140> use<00:00:37.410> steeply<00:00:37.920> angled

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
last year did not use steeply angled

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.720 
last year did not use steeply angled
wedges<00:00:38.760> they<00:00:39.270> use<00:00:39.510> just<00:00:39.930> vertical<00:00:40.730> pushing

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
wedges they use just vertical pushing

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.900 
wedges they use just vertical pushing
faces<00:00:42.090> or<00:00:42.210> slightly<00:00:42.629> angled<00:00:42.899> scoops<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.910> I

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
faces or slightly angled scoops and I

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.790 
faces or slightly angled scoops and I
think<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.390> these<00:00:45.989> wheels<00:00:46.260> will<00:00:46.469> make<00:00:46.620> good

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
think that these wheels will make good

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.970 
think that these wheels will make good
contact<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.399> they're<00:00:47.579> very<00:00:47.789> gripping<00:00:48.149> on<00:00:48.980> the

opponent robots use right now i'm still
experimenting<00:02:13.770> but<00:02:14.160> i'm<00:02:14.430> looking<00:02:14.819> at<00:02:14.970> some

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
experimenting but i'm looking at some

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.220 
experimenting but i'm looking at some
dark<00:02:15.750> or<00:02:16.310> very<00:02:17.310> black<00:02:17.700> foam<00:02:18.330> materials<00:02:18.989> that

dark or very black foam materials that
will<00:02:19.380> absorb<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.860> lot<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.130> sound<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.640> also<00:02:21.390> not

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
will absorb a lot of sound and also not

will absorb a lot of sound and also not
reflect<00:02:21.989> much<00:02:22.260> light<00:02:22.670> hopefully<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.819> will

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
reflect much light hopefully that will

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.780 
reflect much light hopefully that will
make<00:02:24.090> my<00:02:24.239> robot<00:02:24.599> hard<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.989> detect<00:02:25.520> and<00:02:26.520> then<00:02:26.670> on

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
make my robot hard to detect and then on

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.030 
make my robot hard to detect and then on
the<00:02:26.880> bottom<00:02:27.060> I've<00:02:27.420> got<00:02:27.840> my<00:02:28.260> battery<00:02:28.830> mounted

right below my drive motors and this is

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.910 
right below my drive motors and this is
an<00:02:32.580> attempt<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.940> keep<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.630> center<00:02:34.319> of<00:02:34.440> gravity

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
an attempt to keep the center of gravity

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.890 
an attempt to keep the center of gravity
low<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.489> also<00:02:35.819> right<00:02:36.120> in<00:02:36.300> line<00:02:36.599> with<00:02:36.630> the

drive wheels because I'll probably end
up<00:02:38.970> having<00:02:39.269> cast<00:02:39.510> your<00:02:39.720> wheels<00:02:39.900> on<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.230> front

and back and any weight that's over
those<00:02:43.380> wheels<00:02:43.709> is<00:02:43.980> pretty<00:02:44.190> much<00:02:44.340> wasted<00:02:44.610> wait
