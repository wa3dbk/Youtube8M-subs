through it okay cut that off anyway um
it<00:01:42.250> holds<00:01:42.759> the<00:01:42.820> curl<00:01:43.119> very<00:01:43.600> long<00:01:43.930> and<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:45.520> I

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
it holds the curl very long and it's I

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.240 
it holds the curl very long and it's I
mean<00:01:46.329> it<00:01:46.539> doesn't<00:01:47.229> it<00:01:47.740> but<00:01:48.159> it

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
mean it doesn't it but it

mean it doesn't it but it
isn't<00:01:48.640> as<00:01:48.759> much<00:01:48.969> as<00:01:49.149> to<00:01:49.299> say<00:01:49.329> that<00:01:49.659> I

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
isn't as much as to say that I

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:53.459 
isn't as much as to say that I
actually<00:01:50.460> cook<00:01:51.460> the<00:01:51.820> web<00:01:52.210> it<00:01:52.689> should<00:01:53.439> be

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
actually cook the web it should be

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.420 
actually cook the web it should be
shedding<00:01:54.100> more<00:01:54.310> but<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:54.700> actually<00:01:54.939> isn't<00:01:55.479> um

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
shedding more but it actually isn't um
