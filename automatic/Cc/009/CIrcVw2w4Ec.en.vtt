00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
you switch on the best from the exs so

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.229 
you switch on the best from the exs so
we're<00:02:14.819> going<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.060> change<00:02:15.420> color<00:02:15.950> again<00:02:17.239> we're

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
we're going to change color again we're

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.740 
we're going to change color again we're
gonna<00:02:18.360> put<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.599> row<00:02:18.780> counter<00:02:19.170> on<00:02:19.349> zero<00:02:20.750> back

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
gonna put the row counter on zero back

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.650 
gonna put the row counter on zero back
lock<00:02:21.989> is<00:02:22.140> going<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.410> be<00:02:22.530> e<00:02:22.709> X<00:02:23.299> so<00:02:24.299> we<00:02:24.450> want<00:02:24.599> to

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
lock is going to be e X so we want to

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.080 
lock is going to be e X so we want to
put<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.900> on<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:26.099> then<00:02:26.280> move<00:02:26.519> it<00:02:26.700> over<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:27.030> E

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
put it on in and then move it over to E

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.140 
put it on in and then move it over to E
and<00:02:27.510> then<00:02:27.569> back<00:02:27.900> on<00:02:28.080> X<00:02:28.549> from<00:02:29.549> bet<00:02:29.819> it's<00:02:30.000> gonna

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
and then back on X from bet it's gonna

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.610 
and then back on X from bet it's gonna
start<00:02:30.630> on<00:02:31.260> N<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.330> we're<00:02:33.330> going<00:02:33.599> to<00:02:33.660> knit<00:02:33.840> 40

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
give the yarn a little tension when I

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.349 
give the yarn a little tension when I
spill<00:03:25.049> it<00:03:25.079> hit<00:03:25.410> then<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.739> release<00:03:25.940> that<00:03:26.940> helps

on this on the right side of your

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.009 
on this on the right side of your
machine<00:03:34.769> but<00:03:35.459> not<00:03:35.579> always<00:03:36.299> so<00:03:36.510> much<00:03:36.660> on<00:03:36.900> the

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
machine but not always so much on the

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.259 
machine but not always so much on the
left<00:03:37.260> side<00:03:37.470> so<00:03:38.190> over<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.609> years<00:03:38.639> I<00:03:39.239> just

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
left side so over the years I just

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.020 
left side so over the years I just
developed<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.230> habit<00:03:40.680> of<00:03:40.859> just<00:03:41.459> grabbing<00:03:41.700> the

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
developed the habit of just grabbing the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.559 
developed the habit of just grabbing the
yarn<00:03:42.410> giving<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.650> little<00:03:43.889> tension<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:45.239> once

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
yarn giving it a little tension and once

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.690 
yarn giving it a little tension and once
I<00:03:46.519> grabbed<00:03:47.519> and<00:03:48.450> I<00:03:48.480> released<00:03:48.840> it

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
I grabbed and I released it

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.059 
I grabbed and I released it
so<00:03:50.660> we're<00:03:50.840> going<00:03:50.959> to<00:03:51.020> move<00:03:51.200> to<00:03:51.260> row<00:03:51.740> count

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
so we're going to move to row count

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.490 
so we're going to move to row count
eighty<00:03:52.430> to<00:03:53.180> finish<00:03:53.510> this<00:03:53.690> have<00:03:53.930> to<00:03:54.170> come<00:03:54.380> in

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
eighty to finish this have to come in

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.559 
eighty to finish this have to come in
with<00:03:54.530> this<00:03:54.920> way<00:03:57.550> now<00:03:58.550> we're<00:03:58.819> ready<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.150> do<00:03:59.420> the

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
last part which is H which is just

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.699 
last part which is H which is just
knitting<00:04:02.480> it<00:04:02.690> the<00:04:02.870> same<00:04:03.080> as<00:04:03.200> we<00:04:03.349> did<00:04:03.380> at<00:04:03.590> the

12 o'clock position that's straight up

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.070 
12 o'clock position that's straight up
so<00:05:56.280> that<00:05:56.430> my<00:05:56.610> needles<00:05:56.970> are<00:05:57.210> butt<00:05:57.450> to<00:05:57.630> butt<00:05:57.810> and

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
so that my needles are butt to butt and

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.590 
so that my needles are butt to butt and
that<00:05:58.290> will<00:05:58.470> make<00:05:58.650> it<00:05:58.710> easier<00:05:59.610> the<00:06:00.210> better<00:06:00.420> the

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.080 
that will make it easier the better the
needles<00:06:00.930> will<00:06:01.080> be<00:06:01.230> head<00:06:01.560> to<00:06:01.710> head<00:06:01.860> and<00:06:02.850> that

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
needles will be head to head and that

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.830 
needles will be head to head and that
will<00:06:03.270> make<00:06:03.450> it<00:06:03.600> easier<00:06:04.170> to<00:06:04.490> transfer<00:06:05.490> over<00:06:05.840> so

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.130 
one thing I like about using the cast on
cones<00:06:28.150> is<00:06:28.390> that<00:06:28.540> weight

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
cones is that weight

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.200 
cones is that weight
for<00:06:29.590> some<00:06:29.830> reason<00:06:30.250> if<00:06:30.370> you<00:06:30.490> got<00:06:30.730> weight<00:06:31.030> on

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
for some reason if you got weight on

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.940 
for some reason if you got weight on
this<00:06:31.360> yarn<00:06:31.660> and<00:06:32.170> you<00:06:32.290> drop<00:06:32.530> a<00:06:32.560> stitch<00:06:32.920> that

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:32.950 
this yarn and you drop a stitch that

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.460 
this yarn and you drop a stitch that
stitch<00:06:33.460> stays<00:06:33.760> right<00:06:34.150> there<00:06:34.210> for<00:06:34.810> you<00:06:34.990> it

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
stitch stays right there for you it

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.730
