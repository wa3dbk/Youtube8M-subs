00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:09.930
 how about everyone today is March 2 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:13.450
 and as we can see, he has finished cycling 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.070
 my fish tank already has one more day or 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.390
 unless I've been detecting these 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.390
 nitrite and nitrate levels 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.849
 as yet detected 5 days ago in 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.490
 high nitrites but I started to see that 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:30.910
 went down did not start measuring daily and 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:33.010
 they were reducing little by little and already today 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.260
 from yesterday and today has been marking 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.699
 consistently 0 ramÃ³n already also 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.230
 I am being for now I did not want it anymore 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:45.220
 redial to take the nitrates 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.530
 they are approximately as in about 5 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.780
 then that is also good but not 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.460
 I plan to put any coral right now 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.980
 and that's what my pc looks like now 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.329
 the water is very clear I keep 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.629
 having a little bit of trouble here in 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.690
 this part with the sand but I'm going to 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.650
 get the controller and the cables to 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.979
 can configure the pumps that I have to 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.350
 the sides I wanted to show you nothing else 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.100
 here in this part if you can see there 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.619
 a piece of slats on the stone looks 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.940
 as coffee as if it were rusty 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.630
 that is normal 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.010
 and in fact that means that the cycle 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.430
 it was a two or three cycle is about 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.570
 to finish or that the cycle is over 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.010
 here you can not distinguish very well 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.070
 but there are also some pieces in this 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.110
 part that looks like it has rusted 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.900
 the stone then when they start 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.610
 see that means that your cycle is already 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.200
 ending and already 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.250
 can continue with the rest of the 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.380
 fishbowl 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.300
 I still recommend that when 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.030
 has finished the cycle that does not put 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.840
 many fish at the same time in fact for this 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.570
 size of fish tank that are 125 gallons 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.150
 I plan to put two at the beginning and continue 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.740
 measuring ammonium nitrite levels 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.720
 and nitrates to see that I do not shoot 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.910
 because what happens later when 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.000
 get one of the first fish is that it 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.650
 they generate as a mini cycle 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.600
 and again a little generated 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.270
 ammonium nitrites and nitrates it is not 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.890
 as big as the first then that 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.570
 be more attentive to that because if 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.250
 much they must raise levels 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.500
 be making water changes as of 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.500
 a 25 30 percent every week 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.239
 for the moment it would be all 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.239
 I will keep up thanks
