00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
holds full color and what i've done is

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.410 
holds full color and what i've done is
basically<00:00:18.150> select<00:00:19.789> certain<00:00:20.789> areas<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
image to basically keep their color or

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.470 
image to basically keep their color or
retain<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.320> color<00:00:25.910> whilst<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.150> rest<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.420> it

is removed such as this and there you

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.410 
is removed such as this and there you
are<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.410> effect<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:31.769> also<00:00:31.980> be<00:00:32.250> used<00:00:32.420> on

you may have may have taken which can
add<00:00:40.950> quite<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.219> dynamic<00:00:41.730> effect<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.149> them<00:00:42.440> so

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
add quite a dynamic effect to them so

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.900 
add quite a dynamic effect to them so
how<00:00:43.620> did<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.800> go<00:00:43.920> about<00:00:43.950> doing<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.610> now

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
how did you go about doing this now

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.600 
how did you go about doing this now
there<00:00:45.090> are<00:00:45.180> lots<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.420> ways<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.750> doing<00:00:46.050> this

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
there are lots of ways of doing this

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.430 
there are lots of ways of doing this
I've<00:00:47.610> come<00:00:48.059> across<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.390> way<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.989> doing<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.379> which

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
I've come across a way of doing it which

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.220 
I've come across a way of doing it which
is<00:00:49.649> fairly<00:00:49.860> simple<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.899> to<00:00:51.899> be<00:00:52.020> honest

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
is fairly simple and to be honest

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.139 
is fairly simple and to be honest
doesn't<00:00:52.500> take<00:00:52.620> up<00:00:52.710> too<00:00:52.770> much<00:00:52.920> time<00:00:53.100> I'd<00:00:53.640> done

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
doesn't take up too much time I'd done

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.979 
doesn't take up too much time I'd done
this<00:00:54.300> image<00:00:54.629> took<00:00:55.320> me<00:00:55.440> about<00:00:55.469> 15<00:00:56.129> minutes<00:00:56.989> and

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
this image took me about 15 minutes and

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.810 
this image took me about 15 minutes and
that's<00:00:58.680> something<00:00:58.859> because<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.520> know<00:00:59.609> there

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
that's something because you know there

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.430 
that's something because you know there
are<00:00:59.850> lots<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.149> edges<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.570> go<00:01:00.719> around<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.199> eaten

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
are lots of edges to go around and eaten

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.319 
are lots of edges to go around and eaten
up<00:01:01.530> at<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.739> end<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.879> what<00:01:02.969> we're<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.239> do

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
up at the end so what we're going to do

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.359 
up at the end so what we're going to do
is<00:01:03.390> I'm<00:01:03.629> going<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.960> remove<00:01:04.949> all<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> color

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
is I'm going to remove all the color

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.980 
is I'm going to remove all the color
from<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.939> basically<00:01:06.090> leave<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.750> color

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
from this and basically leave the color

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.730 
from this and basically leave the color
on<00:01:08.150> the<00:01:09.150> gloves<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.619> probably<00:01:10.619> put<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:11.540> this

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
on the gloves and probably put in this

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:20.090 
on the gloves and probably put in this
the<00:01:13.740> band<00:01:15.500> going<00:01:16.500> around<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:19.229> gown<00:01:19.799> there

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the band going around the the gown there

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.490 
the band going around the the gown there
and<00:01:20.340> probably<00:01:21.330> keep<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.659> red<00:01:21.900> stripes<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.409> the

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
and probably keep the red stripes on the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.929 
and probably keep the red stripes on the
short<00:01:22.770> maybe<00:01:23.340> maybe<00:01:24.030> at<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> blue<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.750> as<00:01:25.200> well

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
short maybe maybe at the blue on as well

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.640 
short maybe maybe at the blue on as well
so<00:01:26.939> basically<00:01:27.509> we<00:01:27.630> need<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> do<00:01:27.930> first<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.320> will

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
so basically we need to do first is will

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.710 
so basically we need to do first is will
unlock<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.220> background<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.570> we're

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
unlock the background and then we're

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.859 
unlock the background and then we're
going<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.930> add<00:01:31.400> from<00:01:32.400> down<00:01:32.610> here<00:01:32.850> go<00:01:33.689> down<00:01:33.840> to

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
going to add from down here go down to

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.130 
going to add from down here go down to
here<00:01:34.310> we're<00:01:35.310> going<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.549> add<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.939> hue<00:01:36.900> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
here we're going to add a hue and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.580 
here we're going to add a hue and
saturation<00:01:38.780> adjustments<00:01:39.780> layer<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.439> then

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
saturation adjustments layer and then

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.319 
saturation adjustments layer and then
what<00:01:40.740> we're<00:01:40.860> going<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.070> do<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.189> simply<00:01:41.579> drop

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
what we're going to do is simply drop

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.010 
what we're going to do is simply drop
the<00:01:42.420> saturation<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.439> negative<00:01:44.280> 100<00:01:45.090> all<00:01:45.899> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
the saturation to negative 100 all the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.749 
the saturation to negative 100 all the
way<00:01:46.110> down<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.409> left<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.369> basically

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
way down to the left and that basically

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.249 
way down to the left and that basically
removes<00:01:48.180> all<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.329> color<00:01:48.630> from<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.840> picture

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
removes all the color from the picture

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.230 
removes all the color from the picture
we're<00:01:50.159> going<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.340> do<00:01:50.490> then<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.880> we're<00:01:51.090> going<00:01:51.180> to

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
we're going to do then is we're going to

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
selectively change the coloring so

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.070 
selectively change the coloring so
basically<00:05:23.760> doing<00:05:24.120> that<00:05:24.360> you<00:05:24.600> can<00:05:24.750> literally

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.450 
basically doing that you can literally
just<00:05:25.200> see<00:05:25.470> that<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:25.770> only<00:05:25.800> coloring<00:05:26.340> we've

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
just see that the only coloring we've
