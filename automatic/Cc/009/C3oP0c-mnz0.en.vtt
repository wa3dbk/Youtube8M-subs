stainless<00:00:42.360> steel<00:00:42.870> here<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.550> basically<00:00:44.550> that

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
stainless steel here and basically that

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.819 
stainless steel here and basically that
just<00:00:44.940> pulls<00:00:45.360> out<00:00:45.739> goes<00:00:46.739> back<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:48.440> this<00:00:49.440> syringe

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
just pulls out goes back in this syringe

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.119 
just pulls out goes back in this syringe
if<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.250> can<00:00:50.430> kind<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.820> zoom<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.629> there<00:00:52.070> this<00:00:53.070> is

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
if you can kind of zoom in there this is

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.049 
if you can kind of zoom in there this is
what<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:54.059> used<00:00:54.539> for<00:00:55.399> your<00:00:56.399> different

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
what is used for your different

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.729 
what is used for your different
marinades<00:00:57.360> like<00:00:57.809> I've<00:00:57.989> got<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.590> we're

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
marinades like I've got here that we're

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.470 
marinades like I've got here that we're
going<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.890> use<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.430> second<00:00:59.820> but<00:00:59.969> if<00:01:00.359> you

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
going to use in just a second but if you

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.130 
going to use in just a second but if you
can<00:01:00.629> see<00:01:00.840> there's<00:01:01.079> three<00:01:01.379> different<00:01:01.620> holes

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
can see there's three different holes

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.719 
can see there's three different holes
going<00:01:04.140> down<00:01:04.350> each<00:01:04.619> side<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.640> you

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
going down each side and so you

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.910 
going down each side and so you
basically<00:01:05.909> just<00:01:06.180> put<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.409> push<00:01:07.710> in

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
basically just put that in and push in

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.620 
basically just put that in and push in
and<00:01:08.159> it's<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:08.549> kind<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.909> squirting<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.360> out

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
and it's just kind of squirting that out

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.250 
and it's just kind of squirting that out
like<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.409> those<00:01:10.530> different<00:01:10.799> directions

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
like in those different directions

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.960 
like in those different directions
this<00:01:13.260> one<00:01:13.530> right<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:13.740> doesn't<00:01:14.549> have<00:01:14.670> those

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
this one right here doesn't have those

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.690 
this one right here doesn't have those
holes<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.780> has<00:01:15.930> like<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.200> thicker<00:01:16.700> opening

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
holes it just has like a thicker opening

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.219 
holes it just has like a thicker opening
on<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.909> end<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.390> that's<00:01:18.540> if<00:01:18.780> you're<00:01:18.990> using

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
on the end and that's if you're using

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.359 
on the end and that's if you're using
like<00:01:19.500> minced<00:01:20.040> garlic<00:01:20.280> or<00:01:20.759> onion<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.360> like

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
like minced garlic or onion have like

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.670 
like minced garlic or onion have like
thicker<00:01:23.369> chunks<00:01:24.409> and<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:27.110> in<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> recipe<00:01:28.650> you

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
thicker chunks and the in the recipe you

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.270 
thicker chunks and the in the recipe you
made<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:30.320> you've<00:01:31.320> basically<00:01:31.530> got<00:01:31.890> both

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
made so you've basically got both

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.010 
made so you've basically got both
options<00:01:32.880> depending<00:01:33.329> on<00:01:33.450> what<00:01:33.720> you're<00:01:33.840> trying

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020

to inject into so this is literally just

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.940 
to inject into so this is literally just
took<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.720> out<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.049> package<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.829> is

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950
