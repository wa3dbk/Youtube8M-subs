and then I'm going to tell you about the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:08.810 
and then I'm going to tell you about the
routing<00:00:59.750> to<00:01:04.700> so<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.880> cables<00:01:07.549> initially<00:01:08.549> come

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
routing to so the cables initially come

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.630 
routing to so the cables initially come
up<00:01:08.970> great<00:01:09.560> hook<00:01:10.560> through<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> center<00:01:11.220> like

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
up great hook through the center like

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.840 
up great hook through the center like
that<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:12.270> between<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.049> two<00:01:13.400> so<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.549> one<00:01:14.729> will

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
that in between the two so that one will

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.749 
that in between the two so that one will
go<00:01:15.000> around<00:01:15.210> there<00:01:15.979> and<00:01:16.979> then<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.310> one<00:01:17.490> round

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
go around there and then that one round

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.429 
go around there and then that one round
there<00:01:18.830> we'll<00:01:19.830> put<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.189> one<00:01:20.250> back<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:21.439> then

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
there we'll put that one back in then

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.660 
there we'll put that one back in then
the<00:01:22.619> third<00:01:22.860> wall<00:01:24.560> between<00:01:25.560> them<00:01:25.979> between<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
the third wall between them between the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.380 
the third wall between them between the
middle<00:01:27.500> like<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:29.930> flip<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:33.090> fourth

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
middle like so flip it in the fourth

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.880 
middle like so flip it in the fourth
wall<00:01:34.250> again<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.549> between<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.150> middle<00:01:36.710> flip<00:01:37.710> it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
wall again in between the middle flip it

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.420 
wall again in between the middle flip it
in<00:01:38.900> this<00:01:39.900> one<00:01:40.460> in<00:01:41.460> between<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.119> middle

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
in this one in between the middle

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.929 
in this one in between the middle
cluster<00:01:44.430> there<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.810> last<00:01:46.020> Romanian<00:01:46.649> one

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
cluster there and the last Romanian one

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.610 
cluster there and the last Romanian one
is<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.210> large<00:01:48.659> black<00:01:48.990> log

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.240 

that<00:01:52.620> one<00:01:52.800> there<00:01:53.780> so<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:54.990> back<00:01:55.230> on<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.070> back

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
that one there so on back on on the back

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.980 
that one there so on back on on the back
here<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.790> will<00:01:56.910> see<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.270> clips<00:01:57.540> these<00:01:57.780> are

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
here you will see the clips these are

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.070 
here you will see the clips these are
routing<00:01:58.590> clips<00:01:59.300> that<00:02:00.300> we're<00:02:00.450> going<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.660> use<00:02:00.810> to

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
routing clips that we're going to use to

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.370 
routing clips that we're going to use to
tie<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.350> leading<00:02:01.800> cables<00:02:02.280> up<00:02:02.930> but<00:02:03.930> before<00:02:04.050> we

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
tie the leading cables up but before we

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.280 
tie the leading cables up but before we
actually<00:02:04.530> close<00:02:05.010> this<00:02:05.430> lid<00:02:06.360> here<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:07.050> bits

clip<00:02:16.470> here<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.830> will<00:02:16.980> see<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.220> small<00:02:17.610> reset

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
clip here you will see a small reset

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.320 
clip here you will see a small reset
it's<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.290> tiny<00:02:19.500> little<00:02:19.710> u-shape<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.760> this

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
it's a tiny little u-shape in it this

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.870 
it's a tiny little u-shape in it this
should<00:02:21.570> be<00:02:21.810> where<00:02:22.140> your<00:02:22.320> tube<00:02:22.560> comes<00:02:22.920> out<00:02:23.220> if

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
should be where your tube comes out if

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.510 
should be where your tube comes out if
you<00:02:24.000> don't<00:02:24.180> have<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.540> coming<00:02:24.750> out<00:02:25.250> I'll<00:02:26.250> see<00:02:26.459> if

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
you don't have it coming out I'll see if

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.390 
you don't have it coming out I'll see if
I<00:02:26.640> can<00:02:26.820> get<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.000> shot<00:02:27.300> there<00:02:27.840> we<00:02:27.930> are<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:29.220> can

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
I can get a shot there we are you can

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.790 
I can get a shot there we are you can
see<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.790> on<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:29.970> camera<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:31.320> if<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.590> don't

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
see that on the camera so if you don't

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.980 
see that on the camera so if you don't
have<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.130> being<00:02:32.880> blind<00:02:33.209> coming<00:02:33.540> out<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.720> bit

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
have it being blind coming out a bit

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.770 
have it being blind coming out a bit
there<00:02:34.200> it's<00:02:34.560> possible<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:35.280> crush<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.730> tube<00:02:36.000> so

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
there it's possible to crush the tube so

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.920 
there it's possible to crush the tube so
I'm<00:02:36.840> now<00:02:36.990> going<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.290> install<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.890> one<00:02:38.930> and

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
I'm now going to install this one and

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.040 
I'm now going to install this one and
it's<00:02:40.110> all<00:02:40.260> detailed<00:02:40.770> in<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.010> manual<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.930> then

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
it's all detailed in the manual and then

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.330 
it's all detailed in the manual and then
we're<00:02:43.140> going<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.350> close<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:44.000> like<00:02:45.000> so<00:02:46.340> again

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
we're going to close it like so again

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.699 
we're going to close it like so again
this<00:02:47.700> one<00:02:47.970> here<00:02:48.270> just<00:02:48.750> making<00:02:49.140> sure<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:49.500> can

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
this one here just making sure you can

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.180 
this one here just making sure you can
see<00:02:49.980> from<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.370> side<00:02:50.870> but<00:02:51.870> actually<00:02:52.350> it's<00:02:52.890> in

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
see from the side but actually it's in

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:08.690 
see from the side but actually it's in
the<00:02:53.340> right<00:02:53.490> area<00:02:58.550> pray

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.000 

five<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:10.810> once<00:03:11.020> we've<00:03:11.200> clicked<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.590> black<00:03:11.800> one

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
five so once we've clicked the black one

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.160 
five so once we've clicked the black one
in<00:03:12.190> place<00:03:12.430> you<00:03:12.700> do<00:03:12.850> have<00:03:13.090> to<00:03:13.240> unclip<00:03:13.690> it<00:03:13.720> and

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
in place you do have to unclip it and

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.550 
in place you do have to unclip it and
just<00:03:14.980> double-check<00:03:15.580> that<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.570> cart<00:03:16.930> is<00:03:17.200> just

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
just double-check that the cart is just

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.550 
just double-check that the cart is just
the<00:03:17.650> black<00:03:17.860> one<00:03:18.070> have<00:03:18.340> actually<00:03:18.790> been<00:03:18.940> pious

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
the black one have actually been pious

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.310 
the black one have actually been pious
so<00:03:20.560> they<00:03:20.620> pull<00:03:20.860> it<00:03:20.980> out<00:03:21.190> and<00:03:22.090> have<00:03:22.300> a<00:03:22.330> lock<00:03:22.600> and

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
so they pull it out and have a lock and

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.140 
so they pull it out and have a lock and
just<00:03:23.380> check<00:03:23.980> there<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.459> make<00:03:24.640> sure<00:03:24.820> that<00:03:25.000> it

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
just check there to make sure that it

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.820 
just check there to make sure that it
has<00:03:25.270> actually<00:03:25.540> been<00:03:25.930> pierced<00:03:26.260> if<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:26.620> hasn't

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
has actually been pierced if it hasn't

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.220 
has actually been pierced if it hasn't
put<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.400> back<00:03:27.550> in<00:03:27.790> again<00:03:27.910> and<00:03:28.360> repeat<00:03:29.080> the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
put it back in again and repeat the

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.600 
put it back in again and repeat the
process<00:03:30.060> there<00:03:31.060> clip<00:03:31.330> it<00:03:31.480> back<00:03:31.660> in<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:33.489> then

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
process there clip it back in and then

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.380 
process there clip it back in and then
close<00:03:33.940> it<00:03:33.970> like<00:03:35.910> so<00:03:36.910> we're<00:03:37.030> going<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.180> remove

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
close it like so we're going to remove

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.530 
close it like so we're going to remove
the<00:03:37.720> backing<00:03:37.930> tape<00:03:38.970> on<00:03:39.970> the<00:03:40.090> top<00:03:40.239> of<00:03:40.450> the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
the backing tape on the top of the

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.920 
the backing tape on the top of the
clamps<00:03:41.610> you<00:03:42.610> can<00:03:42.790> either<00:03:42.940> use<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:43.450> tweezers

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
clamps you can either use the tweezers

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.050 
clamps you can either use the tweezers
in<00:03:44.320> the<00:03:44.350> back<00:03:44.620> or<00:03:44.860> your<00:03:44.980> thumbs<00:03:45.250> fingers

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
in the back or your thumbs fingers

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.780 
in the back or your thumbs fingers
doesn't<00:03:46.480> really<00:03:46.630> max<00:03:46.900> up<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:48.190> then<00:03:48.400> push<00:03:48.610> that

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
doesn't really max up and then push that

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.839 
doesn't really max up and then push that
down<00:03:49.030> there<00:03:49.330> like<00:03:49.510> that

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.440 

unlike<00:03:55.849> my<00:03:56.180> larvae<00:03:57.459> so<00:03:58.459> for<00:03:58.670> this<00:03:58.760> model<00:03:59.090> here

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
unlike my larvae so for this model here

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.660 
unlike my larvae so for this model here
it<00:03:59.840> does<00:04:00.049> vary<00:04:00.349> on<00:04:00.620> some<00:04:00.859> of<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.040> models<00:04:01.159> but

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
it does vary on some of the models but

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.000 
it does vary on some of the models but
it's<00:04:02.120> always<00:04:02.659> around<00:04:02.810> this<00:04:03.230> position<00:04:03.769> here

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
it's always around this position here

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.589 
it's always around this position here
sometimes<00:04:04.579> it's<00:04:04.819> here<00:04:05.060> on<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.269> front

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
sometimes it's here on the front

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.250 
sometimes it's here on the front
sometimes<00:04:06.290> it's<00:04:06.920> on<00:04:07.159> top<00:04:07.569> but<00:04:08.569> we<00:04:08.870> need<00:04:09.049> to

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
sometimes it's on top but we need to

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.599 
sometimes it's on top but we need to
bypass<00:04:09.739> the<00:04:10.250> printer<00:04:10.819> with<00:04:11.120> sensor<00:04:12.400> so<00:04:13.400> for

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
bypass the printer with sensor so for

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.439 
bypass the printer with sensor so for
this<00:04:13.670> particular<00:04:14.120> machine<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:14.900> 33<00:04:15.560> tab<00:04:16.269> it<00:04:17.269> is

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
this particular machine the 33 tab it is

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.770 
this particular machine the 33 tab it is
actually<00:04:17.989> here<00:04:18.769> when<00:04:19.310> you<00:04:19.400> press<00:04:19.669> this<00:04:19.940> the

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
actually here when you press this the

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.080 
actually here when you press this the
printer<00:04:21.109> will<00:04:21.259> think<00:04:21.560> press<00:04:22.400> this<00:04:22.550> down<00:04:22.789> it

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
printer will think press this down it

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.540 
printer will think press this down it
will<00:04:23.210> take<00:04:23.389> the<00:04:23.539> ladies<00:04:23.870> shot<00:04:24.169> so<00:04:24.770> on<00:04:25.039> someone

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
will take the ladies shot so on someone

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.180 
will take the ladies shot so on someone
to<00:04:25.910> his<00:04:26.060> here<00:04:26.389> and<00:04:27.080> some<00:04:27.289> models<00:04:27.500> it<00:04:27.770> up<00:04:27.979> outs

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
to his here and some models it up outs

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.580 
to his here and some models it up outs
on<00:04:28.430> here<00:04:28.729> so<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.389> indication<00:04:29.780> you<00:04:30.139> need<00:04:30.289> to<00:04:30.440> be

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
on here so the indication you need to be

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.620 
on here so the indication you need to be
looking<00:04:30.710> at<00:04:31.009> the<00:04:31.160> lid<00:04:31.340> normally<00:04:32.330> there's<00:04:32.539> a

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
looking at the lid normally there's a

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.779 
looking at the lid normally there's a
little<00:04:32.930> recessed<00:04:33.500> thing<00:04:33.800> and<00:04:34.370> as<00:04:34.520> it<00:04:34.639> comes

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
little recessed thing and as it comes

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.300 
little recessed thing and as it comes
down<00:04:35.090> it<00:04:35.449> presses<00:04:35.870> like<00:04:36.050> that<00:04:36.349> so<00:04:36.979> that<00:04:37.099> will

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
down it presses like that so that will

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.839 
down it presses like that so that will
be<00:04:37.550> one<00:04:37.789> of<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:37.970> last<00:04:38.090> things<00:04:38.449> that<00:04:38.570> I<00:04:38.750> do<00:04:39.849> so

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849 
be one of the last things that I do so

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:42.580 
be one of the last things that I do so
for<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.120> continuous<00:04:41.660> thing<00:04:41.780> system<00:04:42.229> itself

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
for the continuous thing system itself

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.320 
for the continuous thing system itself
we<00:04:42.830> need<00:04:42.979> to<00:04:43.099> install<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.580> air<00:04:43.820> filters

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
we need to install the air filters

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.779 
we need to install the air filters
before<00:04:44.479> we<00:04:44.780> can<00:04:44.960> proceed<00:04:45.490> so<00:04:46.490> within<00:04:46.669> your

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
before we can proceed so within your

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:51.240 
before we can proceed so within your
accessory<00:04:47.509> bar<00:04:48.610> take<00:04:49.610> care<00:04:49.849> of<00:04:49.940> 6<00:04:50.240> air<00:04:50.479> filters

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
accessory bar take care of 6 air filters

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.409 
accessory bar take care of 6 air filters
anything<00:04:52.250> else<00:04:52.430> that's<00:04:52.669> left<00:04:52.970> in<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:53.240> back

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
anything else that's left in the back

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.310 
anything else that's left in the back
are<00:04:53.720> spared<00:04:55.419> so<00:04:56.419> the<00:04:56.570> air<00:04:56.690> filters<00:04:57.110> themselves

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
are spared so the air filters themselves

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.250 
are spared so the air filters themselves
they<00:04:57.919> have<00:04:58.099> a<00:04:58.130> narrow<00:04:58.940> pointed<00:04:59.539> end<00:04:59.780> and<00:05:00.050> then

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
they have a narrow pointed end and then

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.500

it shouldn't be moved if you raise in

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.110 
it shouldn't be moved if you raise in
the<00:05:47.419> air<00:05:47.740> gravity<00:05:48.740> will<00:05:49.130> take<00:05:49.400> place<00:05:49.669> and<00:05:50.030> it

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
the air gravity will take place and it

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.779 
the air gravity will take place and it
will<00:05:50.300> flood<00:05:50.599> your<00:05:50.840> printer<00:05:51.349> so<00:05:52.190> they<00:05:52.370> must<00:05:52.580> be

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
will flood your printer so they must be

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:54.640 
will flood your printer so they must be
installed<00:05:53.300> level<00:05:53.900> with<00:05:54.020> the<00:05:54.110> base<00:05:54.289> of<00:05:54.530> the

out<00:06:01.580> and<00:06:02.240> when<00:06:02.659> the<00:06:02.719> ladies<00:06:03.020> short<00:06:03.229> on<00:06:03.440> it<00:06:03.560> it

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
out and when the ladies short on it it

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.760 
out and when the ladies short on it it
won't<00:06:03.889> trap<00:06:04.250> it<00:06:04.520> so<00:06:05.450> with<00:06:05.630> HP<00:06:06.080> systems<00:06:06.529> it<00:06:06.680> is

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
won't trap it so with HP systems it is

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.270 
won't trap it so with HP systems it is
quite

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
quite

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
then bypass the lid sensor so what I'm

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.340 
then bypass the lid sensor so what I'm
going<00:06:22.880> to<00:06:22.940> do<00:06:23.120> with<00:06:23.270> this<00:06:23.389> small<00:06:23.720> plug<00:06:24.110> here

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.350 
going to do with this small plug here

that hole and you will see you will see
that<00:06:31.639> the<00:06:32.530> printer<00:06:33.530> now<00:06:33.680> thinks<00:06:34.070> that<00:06:34.280> it's

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 
that the printer now thinks that it's

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:38.620 
that the printer now thinks that it's
closed<00:06:35.240> so<00:06:35.660> we<00:06:36.500> can<00:06:36.650> then<00:06:36.830> close<00:06:37.130> this<00:06:37.630> printer

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630
