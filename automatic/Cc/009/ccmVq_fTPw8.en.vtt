hey<00:00:00.539> guys<00:00:00.719> welcome<00:00:01.050> to<00:00:01.319> today's<00:00:01.500> episode<00:00:02.010> of

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
hey guys welcome to today's episode of

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.760 
hey guys welcome to today's episode of
blender<00:00:02.730> explained<00:00:03.149> in<00:00:03.840> today's<00:00:04.200> episode<00:00:04.410> I'm

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
blender explained in today's episode I'm

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.710 
blender explained in today's episode I'm
going<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.920> be<00:00:05.069> explaining<00:00:05.549> how<00:00:05.670> vertex<00:00:06.359> groups

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
going to be explaining how vertex groups

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.410 
going to be explaining how vertex groups
and<00:00:06.990> white<00:00:07.230> painting<00:00:07.589> works<00:00:07.790> so<00:00:08.790> basically

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
and white painting works so basically

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.249 
and white painting works so basically
what<00:00:09.780> vertex<00:00:10.230> groups<00:00:10.530> are<00:00:11.690> are<00:00:12.690> basically<00:00:12.900> a

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
what vertex groups are are basically a

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.910 
what vertex groups are are basically a
way<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.769> assign<00:00:14.610> as<00:00:14.910> group<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.389> vertices<00:00:15.719> in<00:00:16.260> a

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
way to assign as group of vertices in a

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.410 
way to assign as group of vertices in a
match<00:00:17.220> on<00:00:17.779> to<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.810> bone<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:20.310> if<00:00:20.699> this<00:00:20.910> was<00:00:21.119> our

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
match on to a bone so if this was our

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.599 
match on to a bone so if this was our
group<00:00:21.750> vertices<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.830> was<00:00:23.010> our<00:00:23.160> met<00:00:23.400> our

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
group vertices and this was our met our

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.439 
group vertices and this was our met our
bone<00:00:23.970> then<00:00:24.660> basically<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.980> would<00:00:26.310> move<00:00:27.119> along

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
bone then basically it would move along

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.000 
bone then basically it would move along
with<00:00:27.960> it

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
with it

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.220 
with it
now<00:00:29.279> wait<00:00:29.550> painting<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.179> basically<00:00:30.720> an<00:00:30.929> easy

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
now wait painting is basically an easy

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.270 
now wait painting is basically an easy
way<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.560> assign<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.669> certain<00:00:33.950> amount<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.010> weight

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
way to assign a certain amount of weight

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.990 
way to assign a certain amount of weight
to<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:36.090> group<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.510> vertices<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.399> show<00:00:38.940> you

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
to a group of vertices so to show you

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.030 
to a group of vertices so to show you
how<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.360> works<00:00:39.629> I'm<00:00:40.379> going<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.620> do<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.860> go

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
how this works I'm going to do is go

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.709 
how this works I'm going to do is go
over<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.430> plane<00:00:41.670> I've<00:00:41.850> got<00:00:42.000> here<00:00:42.270> which

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
over to this plane I've got here which

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.660 
over to this plane I've got here which
is<00:00:42.989> basically<00:00:43.440> subdivided<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.190> bunch<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.460> times

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
is basically subdivided a bunch of times

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.500 
is basically subdivided a bunch of times
and<00:00:44.879> I'm<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.960> add<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:47.149> armature<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.180> a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
and I'm going to add a armature and a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.090 
and I'm going to add a armature and a
single<00:00:48.840> bone<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.219> then<00:00:50.219> I'm<00:00:50.489> going<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:52.100> move

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
single bone and then I'm going to move

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.950 
single bone and then I'm going to move
this<00:00:53.340> over<00:00:53.460> here<00:00:53.640> um<00:00:54.350> so<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.770> along<00:00:56.309> this

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
this over here um so that is along this

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.080 
this over here um so that is along this
right<00:00:57.960> half<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.010> plane<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.430> then<00:01:00.030> I'm

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
right half of the plane and then I'm

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.670 
right half of the plane and then I'm
gonna<00:01:00.180> select<00:01:00.329> my<00:01:00.480> plane<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.020> then<00:01:01.289> my<00:01:01.440> bone

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
gonna select my plane and then my bone

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.990 
gonna select my plane and then my bone
and<00:01:02.270> then<00:01:03.270> ctrl<00:01:03.930> P<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.979> basically<00:01:05.729> it'll

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
and then ctrl P and basically it'll

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.359 
and then ctrl P and basically it'll
bring<00:01:06.119> up<00:01:06.299> these<00:01:06.450> options<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.290> what<00:01:08.280> we're

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
bring up these options and what we're

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.050 
bring up these options and what we're
going<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.549> do<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.060> I'm<00:01:09.510> going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.640> select<00:01:11.640> with

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
going to do is I'm going to select with

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.910 
going to do is I'm going to select with
automatic<00:01:12.510> weights<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.260> what<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.619> will<00:01:13.770> do

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
automatic weights and what that will do

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.999 
automatic weights and what that will do
is<00:01:14.130> for<00:01:14.490> every<00:01:14.640> bone<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.150> my<00:01:15.509> armature<00:01:16.200> that'll

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
is for every bone in my armature that'll

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.580 
is for every bone in my armature that'll
create<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.490> vertex<00:01:17.970> group<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:19.200> since<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.500> only

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
create a vertex group so since I only

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.590 
create a vertex group so since I only
have<00:01:19.710> one<00:01:19.890> bone<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.369> just<00:01:20.549> creates<00:01:20.850> one<00:01:21.090> vertex

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
have one bone it just creates one vertex

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.749 
have one bone it just creates one vertex
group<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> calls<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.439> bone<00:01:22.680> which<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
group and it calls it bone which is the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.380 
group and it calls it bone which is the
name<00:01:23.909> of<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.210> bone<00:01:25.159> so<00:01:26.159> if<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.729> go<00:01:26.909> into<00:01:27.150> pose

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
name of this bone so if I go into pose

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.350 
name of this bone so if I go into pose
mode<00:01:27.420> by<00:01:27.920> selecting<00:01:28.920> my<00:01:29.430> bone<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.939> pressing

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
mode by selecting my bone and pressing

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.679 
mode by selecting my bone and pressing
ctrl<00:01:30.720> tab<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:32.220> moving<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.670> as<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.060> see<00:01:33.119> is

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
ctrl tab and moving it as you can see is

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.060 
ctrl tab and moving it as you can see is
created<00:01:34.409> these<00:01:34.500> automatic<00:01:36.049> weight<00:01:37.070> assigned

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
created these automatic weight assigned

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.240 
created these automatic weight assigned
to<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.700> vertices<00:01:38.970> um<00:01:39.590> that<00:01:40.590> are<00:01:40.829> around<00:01:41.070> this

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
to the vertices um that are around this

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.310 
to the vertices um that are around this
bone<00:01:41.549> now<00:01:41.880> as<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.240> see<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.659> did<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> pretty

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
bone now as you can see it did a pretty

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.929 
bone now as you can see it did a pretty
good<00:01:43.710> job<00:01:43.770> except<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:44.610> not<00:01:44.880> exactly

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
good job except it's not exactly

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.810 
good job except it's not exactly
accurate<00:01:45.630> so<00:01:46.380> we're<00:01:46.590> going<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.740> do<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.220> go<00:01:47.549> into

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
accurate so we're going to do is go into

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.410 
accurate so we're going to do is go into
our<00:01:49.729> plane<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.030> press<00:01:51.450> ctrl<00:01:51.810> tab<00:01:51.990> go<00:01:52.320> into

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
our plane and press ctrl tab go into

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.120 
our plane and press ctrl tab go into
weight<00:01:54.420> paint<00:01:54.720> mode<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.170> we're<00:01:55.799> going<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.009> do

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
weight paint mode and we're going to do

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.359 
weight paint mode and we're going to do
is<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:57.450> erase<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.259> red<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.950> red<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.130> basically

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
is to erase the red the red is basically

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.749 
is to erase the red the red is basically
a<00:01:59.729> hundred<00:01:59.939> percent<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.840> blue<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.259> zero

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
a hundred percent and the blue is zero

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.330 
a hundred percent and the blue is zero
so<00:02:02.810> I'm<00:02:03.810> going<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:03.990> go<00:02:04.229> down<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.799> make<00:02:05.130> my

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
so I'm going to go down and make my

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.940 
so I'm going to go down and make my
weight<00:02:05.579> zero<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.600> I'm<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:06.990> going<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.560> erase

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
weight zero and I'm just going to erase

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.919 
weight zero and I'm just going to erase
this<00:02:08.129> all<00:02:08.459> make<00:02:09.119> my<00:02:09.300> strength<00:02:09.569> all<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.840> way

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
this all make my strength all the way

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.550 
this all make my strength all the way
here<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.349> then<00:02:11.129> I'm<00:02:11.430> going<00:02:11.849> to

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
here and then I'm going to

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.370 
here and then I'm going to
go<00:02:13.069> and<00:02:13.340> make<00:02:13.520> my<00:02:13.760> weight<00:02:14.060> 100<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.050> strength

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
go and make my weight 100 and strength

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.650 
go and make my weight 100 and strength
100<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:16.000> basically<00:02:17.050> paint<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.200> all<00:02:19.180> red<00:02:20.180> where

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
100 and basically paint it all red where

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.180 
100 and basically paint it all red where
our<00:02:20.870> bone<00:02:21.080> is<00:02:21.290> so<00:02:22.069> now<00:02:22.569> if<00:02:23.569> I<00:02:23.840> just<00:02:23.900> go<00:02:24.290> here<00:02:24.950> and

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
our bone is so now if I just go here and

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.330 
our bone is so now if I just go here and
make<00:02:25.790> sure<00:02:25.819> this<00:02:26.209> is<00:02:26.420> all<00:02:26.540> blue<00:02:26.810> go<00:02:27.680> back<00:02:27.950> and

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
make sure this is all blue go back and

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.970 
make sure this is all blue go back and
select<00:02:29.150> our<00:02:29.300> belly<00:02:29.540> in<00:02:29.660> pose<00:02:29.840> mode<00:02:29.959> as<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.349> can

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
select our belly in pose mode as you can

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.839 
select our belly in pose mode as you can
see<00:02:31.280> on<00:02:32.500> these<00:02:33.500> vertices<00:02:34.010> have<00:02:34.370> been<00:02:34.519> assigned

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
see on these vertices have been assigned

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.259 
see on these vertices have been assigned
to<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:36.709> bone<00:02:36.920> um<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.670> as<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:37.940> can<00:02:38.090> see

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
to the bone um and as you can see

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.650 
to the bone um and as you can see
there's<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.140> slight<00:02:39.410> slight<00:02:40.510> probably<00:02:41.510> just

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
there's a slight slight probably just

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.699 
there's a slight slight probably just
very<00:02:41.870> light<00:02:42.319> blue<00:02:42.620> here<00:02:43.069> um<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.870> these

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
very light blue here um and these

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.559 
very light blue here um and these
vertices<00:02:46.100> just<00:02:46.400> barely<00:02:46.790> been<00:02:46.940> assigned<00:02:47.239> to<00:02:47.420> it

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
vertices just barely been assigned to it

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.180 
vertices just barely been assigned to it
yeah<00:02:48.410> so<00:02:48.799> as<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:49.549> can<00:02:49.700> see<00:02:49.940> um<00:02:50.980> that's<00:02:51.980> been

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
yeah so as you can see um that's been

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.420 
yeah so as you can see um that's been
assigned<00:02:52.519> to<00:02:52.730> it<00:02:52.880> and<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:54.620> is<00:02:54.860> moving<00:02:55.220> along

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
assigned to it and it is moving along

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.199 
assigned to it and it is moving along
with<00:02:55.610> it<00:02:55.940> so<00:02:57.099> that's<00:02:58.099> basically<00:02:58.610> what<00:02:58.970> a

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
with it so that's basically what a

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.170 
with it so that's basically what a
vertex<00:02:59.720> groups<00:03:00.080> are<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.590> weight<00:03:01.310> painting<00:03:01.549> so

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
vertex groups are and weight painting so

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.150 
vertex groups are and weight painting so
thanks<00:03:02.870> for<00:03:02.989> watching<00:03:03.049> and<00:03:03.650> see<00:03:04.040> you<00:03:04.099> next

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
thanks for watching and see you next

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.340
