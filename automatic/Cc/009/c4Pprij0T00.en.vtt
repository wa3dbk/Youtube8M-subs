00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.409
 description 1 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.260

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.000

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.310

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.969
 Attraction you can sometimes go there 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.460

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:29.460
 yes I have it all here, get a 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.270
 short trial ride the part is 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.170
 because it's so blatant 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.520
 Compared to my old one we still 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.909
 a bit of gas there is that 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.200
 already directly up front so the dealer 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.109
 has already said here please bring 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.680
 not about it and that is a pure one 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:51.759
 racing machine that is really the best 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.799
 Quarters in things offroad there is nothing 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.509
 it's clear 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.810
 and yes I'll do it again 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:02.670
 Review about it may still take the 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.670
 gopro and driver with a bit of rum 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.719
 automatic 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.800
 and yes, I'm looking forward to a first 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.840
 little child with first the 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.690
 license plates assemble pre-friends 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.160
 License plates are on it now 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.370
 can not wait to get there first 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:29.640
 test drive or the first 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:34.110
 By the way, we have the right drive here 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:39.060
 also a ktm 500 ha also a nice one 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:55.230
 The machine also goes down properly in the 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:57.739
 terrain looks like it's cute here 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.739
 small here 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:23.819
 markus just cleaning here or 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:28.110
 nano polish later still from my car 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:30.230
 my audi I'm curious how 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.230
 it outside 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.320
 let's go on a tour 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.350
 By the way my audi has one last 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.280
 let label 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.280
 later make time nice and clean 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.310
 oh how lethargic that always works 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.700
 with pleasure 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:17.180
 So we have nice LED bulbs here and 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.380
 also down here 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.380
 everything is completely lit. 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.760
 stripes as I said in the maxis 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.510
 the maxis mature the things are very 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.510
 good for the street but also very good 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:38.560
 for the terrain sees itself here 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.990
 profile company firat switchable I have 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:46.290
 Here I can just the button 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:49.870
 virtually all-wheel or rear-wheel drive select 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.850
 otherwise trailer hitches would 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.660
 I probably turn it off because that 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:58.060
 Ding is actually allowed as 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:06.340
 tractor so that the full power 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:07.710
 So has put open performance and 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:15.310
 first turn a round 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:18.340
 later , parcours make cool videos so 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.870
 People first father through me 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:26.010
 honestly I flashed I am thrilled 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:28.840
 The thing has so much power in the suit 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.180
 that takes off every porsche at the traffic light 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.310
 no porsche can really keep up with that 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:37.960
 no matter what a car the thing is direct 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:40.710
 away that's so toxic in the suit and there 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.710
 do you get scared
