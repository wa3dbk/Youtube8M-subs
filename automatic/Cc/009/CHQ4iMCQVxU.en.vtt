hey guys richer here bringing you my
first<00:00:02.610> ever<00:00:02.879> loot<00:00:03.179> video<00:00:03.480> I<00:00:03.720> have

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
first ever loot video I have

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.140 
first ever loot video I have
successfully<00:00:04.770> killed<00:00:05.009> 10,000<00:00:05.730> water<00:00:05.879> feels

so<00:00:06.240> I<00:00:06.359> thought<00:00:06.569> it<00:00:06.720> would<00:00:06.810> make<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:06.990> video<00:00:07.319> out

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.799 
so I thought it would make a video out
of<00:00:07.680> it<00:00:07.859> informing<00:00:08.490> you<00:00:08.580> guys<00:00:08.790> what<00:00:09.510> you<00:00:09.660> might

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809

how<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.450> counted<00:00:12.960> them<00:00:13.019> was<00:00:13.290> they<00:00:13.380> took<00:00:13.410> the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
how I counted them was they took the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.740 
how I counted them was they took the
total<00:00:14.130> amount<00:00:14.250> of<00:00:14.460> XP<00:00:14.849> per<00:00:15.089> kill<00:00:15.120> which<00:00:15.599> was

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
total amount of XP per kill which was

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.340 
total amount of XP per kill which was
around<00:00:16.789> 934<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.090> multiplied<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:18.900> by<00:00:18.960> ten

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
around 934 and multiplied that by ten

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.080 
around 934 and multiplied that by ten
thousand<00:00:19.920> which<00:00:20.100> gave<00:00:20.310> me<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> number<00:00:20.820> around

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
thousand which gave me a number around

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.050 
thousand which gave me a number around
nine<00:00:21.359> point<00:00:21.660> three<00:00:21.720> four<00:00:22.230> million<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.890> am<00:00:23.760> aware

I got this from one single drop and it's
crazy<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.060> sounds<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:25.080> true<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.740> get

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
crazy that sounds it is true you can get

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.690 
crazy that sounds it is true you can get
one<00:01:26.220> from<00:01:26.430> 7,000<00:01:27.680> you<00:01:28.680> logs<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.250> one<00:01:29.430> single

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
one from 7,000 you logs in one single

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.749 
one from 7,000 you logs in one single
drop<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.479> was<00:01:30.600> pretty<00:01:30.750> crazy<00:01:31.310> 366<00:01:32.310> k<00:01:32.520> from

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
drop so that was pretty crazy 366 k from

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.060 
drop so that was pretty crazy 366 k from
one<00:01:32.970> single<00:01:33.240> drop<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.500> there's<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.770> total

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
one single drop so there's a total

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.819 
one single drop so there's a total
amount<00:01:35.369> 21<00:01:35.880> million<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:37.409> got<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.740> from

amount 21 million and I got that from

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.090 
amount 21 million and I got that from
10,000<00:01:38.670> kills<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.479> that's<00:01:39.600> around<00:01:39.780> 2.1<00:01:40.560> k<00:01:40.770> /

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
10,000 kills so that's around 2.1 k /
