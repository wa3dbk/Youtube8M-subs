00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
kicks in and then because it negates

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.909 
kicks in and then because it negates
armor<00:04:48.570> on<00:04:48.660> metals<00:04:48.930> they<00:04:49.050> actually<00:04:49.380> do<00:04:49.530> like<00:04:49.740> a

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
armor on metals they actually do like a

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.730 
armor on metals they actually do like a
couple<00:04:50.220> hundred<00:04:50.280> damage<00:04:50.729> each<00:04:50.910> hit<00:04:51.530> it<00:04:52.530> cannot

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
couple hundred damage each hit it cannot

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.490 
couple hundred damage each hit it cannot
take<00:04:52.979> effect<00:04:53.340> mid-battle<00:04:53.900> but<00:04:54.900> it<00:04:54.990> has<00:04:55.260> to<00:04:55.290> be

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
take effect mid-battle but it has to be

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.350 
take effect mid-battle but it has to be
propped<00:04:55.919> it<00:04:56.130> has<00:04:56.430> to<00:04:56.610> be<00:04:56.700> showing<00:04:57.090> before

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
propped it has to be showing before

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.920 
propped it has to be showing before
it'll<00:04:57.720> actually<00:04:57.840> count<00:04:58.260> the<00:04:58.320> damage<00:04:58.740> so<00:04:59.930> it

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
it'll actually count the damage so it

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.440 
it'll actually count the damage so it
definitely<00:05:01.200> works<00:05:01.590> that<00:05:01.860> way<00:05:02.120> if<00:05:03.120> you<00:05:03.300> guys

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
definitely works that way if you guys

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.270 
definitely works that way if you guys
want<00:05:03.660> further<00:05:03.840> proof<00:05:04.139> i<00:05:04.290> can<00:05:04.470> i'll<00:05:04.889> try<00:05:05.070> to<00:05:05.130> do

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
want further proof i can i'll try to do

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.770 
want further proof i can i'll try to do
a<00:05:05.310> medal<00:05:05.669> parade<00:05:05.880> next<00:05:06.120> time<00:05:06.419> and<00:05:06.690> i'll<00:05:06.750> show

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
a medal parade next time and i'll show

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.360 
a medal parade next time and i'll show
you<00:05:06.990> guys<00:05:07.139> how<00:05:07.200> that<00:05:07.590> what<00:05:07.860> exactly<00:05:08.280> i<00:05:08.310> mean

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
you guys how that what exactly i mean

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.300 
you guys how that what exactly i mean
how<00:05:08.669> it<00:05:08.760> works<00:05:09.440> so<00:05:10.440> is<00:05:10.620> I've<00:05:10.800> definitely<00:05:11.039> as

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
how it works so is I've definitely as

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.020 
how it works so is I've definitely as
long<00:05:11.340> as<00:05:11.580> it<00:05:12.289> shows<00:05:13.289> up<00:05:13.500> here<00:05:13.890> it'll<00:05:14.400> count<00:05:14.700> but

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
long as it shows up here it'll count but

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.150 
long as it shows up here it'll count but
like<00:05:15.150> say<00:05:15.539> I<00:05:15.570> do<00:05:15.780> a<00:05:16.020> TRO<00:05:16.380> then<00:05:16.590> I<00:05:16.680> do<00:05:16.740> this<00:05:17.010> this

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
like say I do a TRO then I do this this

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.440 
like say I do a TRO then I do this this
is<00:05:17.220> this<00:05:17.640> I<00:05:17.820> do<00:05:17.970> them<00:05:18.060> all<00:05:18.120> back<00:05:18.270> to<00:05:18.419> back

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
is this I do them all back to back

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.890 
is this I do them all back to back
before<00:05:18.960> he<00:05:18.990> even<00:05:19.289> attacks<00:05:20.220> then<00:05:20.910> no<00:05:21.150> it<00:05:21.660> won't

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
before he even attacks then no it won't

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.930 
before he even attacks then no it won't
count<00:05:22.140> or<00:05:22.470> mike<00:05:22.800> count<00:05:23.010> midway<00:05:23.490> through<00:05:23.850> it

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
count or mike count midway through it

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.340 
count or mike count midway through it
but<00:05:24.090> the<00:05:24.240> first<00:05:24.390> couple<00:05:24.600> hits<00:05:24.870> wouldn't<00:05:25.140> count

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
but the first couple hits wouldn't count

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.460 
but the first couple hits wouldn't count
it<00:05:26.220> does<00:05:26.370> take<00:05:26.550> a<00:05:26.580> second<00:05:27.000> till<00:05:27.210> the<00:05:27.570> total

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
it does take a second till the total

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.670 
it does take a second till the total
kicks<00:05:28.650> in<00:05:28.800> there<00:05:30.500> probably<00:05:31.500> should<00:05:31.620> have

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
kicks in there probably should have

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.760 
kicks in there probably should have
waited<00:05:31.890> on<00:05:32.100> the

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
waited on the

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.589 
waited on the
I'm<00:05:33.430> wait<00:05:33.610> until<00:05:33.789> the<00:05:33.879> Phoenix<00:05:34.270> roughly

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
I'm wait until the Phoenix roughly

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.860 
I'm wait until the Phoenix roughly
halfway<00:05:34.900> because<00:05:35.440> it<00:05:36.419> she's<00:05:37.419> a<00:05:37.449> pain<00:05:37.720> in<00:05:37.840> the

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
halfway because it she's a pain in the

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.230 
halfway because it she's a pain in the
butt<00:05:38.110> once<00:05:38.979> halfway<00:05:39.400> comes<00:05:39.639> all<00:05:39.910> the<00:05:39.940> more
