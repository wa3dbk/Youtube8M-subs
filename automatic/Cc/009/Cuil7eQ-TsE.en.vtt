okay<00:00:02.040> our<00:00:02.909> lumber<00:00:03.270> is<00:00:03.389> landed<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:04.819> we're

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
okay our lumber is landed and we're

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.629 
okay our lumber is landed and we're
ready<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.210> start<00:00:06.690> on<00:00:06.990> this<00:00:07.200> house<00:00:07.440> here<00:00:07.740> the

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
ready to start on this house here the

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:09.500 
ready to start on this house here the
next<00:00:08.880> thing<00:00:09.000> that's<00:00:09.059> going<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.389> happen

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
next thing that's going to happen

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.049 
next thing that's going to happen
actually<00:00:09.929> is<00:00:10.290> we're<00:00:11.160> going<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.730> can<00:00:11.880> see

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
actually is we're going to you can see

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.140 
actually is we're going to you can see
that<00:00:12.300> all<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.630> tops<00:00:12.870> of<00:00:13.049> our<00:00:14.030> foundations<00:00:15.030> are

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
that all the tops of our foundations are

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.960 
that all the tops of our foundations are
nice<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.630> clean<00:00:15.900> that's<00:00:16.170> because<00:00:16.850> what<00:00:17.850> we've

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
nice and clean that's because what we've

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.910 
nice and clean that's because what we've
done<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.300> swept<00:00:18.660> everything<00:00:19.109> off<00:00:19.260> there's<00:00:19.830> a

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
done is swept everything off there's a

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.650 
done is swept everything off there's a
reason<00:00:20.279> for<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.580> when<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.330> talk<00:00:21.510> about

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
reason for that when I talk about

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.320 
reason for that when I talk about
snapping<00:00:22.080> lines<00:00:22.500> we<00:00:23.460> have<00:00:23.609> all<00:00:23.760> these<00:00:23.910> bolts

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
snapping lines we have all these bolts

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.790 
snapping lines we have all these bolts
to<00:00:24.480> hold<00:00:24.510> down<00:00:24.810> our<00:00:25.019> house<00:00:25.170> but<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.529> need<00:00:25.680> to

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
to hold down our house but we need to

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.740 
to hold down our house but we need to
know<00:00:25.830> exactly<00:00:26.099> where<00:00:26.699> on<00:00:27.090> these<00:00:27.960> forms<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:29.750> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
know exactly where on these forms to the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.870 
know exactly where on these forms to the
you<00:00:31.439> know<00:00:31.560> quarter<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.009> an<00:00:32.099> inch<00:00:32.189> or<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.759> the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
you know quarter of an inch or to the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.720 
you know quarter of an inch or to the
eighth<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.239> an<00:00:33.329> inch<00:00:33.420> where<00:00:33.750> these<00:00:34.489> plates<00:00:35.489> are

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
eighth of an inch where these plates are

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.910 
eighth of an inch where these plates are
going<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.910> sit<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:37.079> we<00:00:37.230> need<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.469> actually<00:00:37.620> take

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
going to sit so we need to actually take

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.690 
going to sit so we need to actually take
a<00:00:37.950> chalk<00:00:38.250> line<00:00:38.899> string<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.020> out

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
a chalk line string it out

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.700 
a chalk line string it out
snap<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:42.000> straight<00:00:42.300> line<00:00:42.570> all<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.590> way<00:00:43.620> down

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
snap a straight line all the way down

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.940 
snap a straight line all the way down
these<00:00:44.129> footings<00:00:44.610> here<00:00:44.969> all<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.469> way<00:00:46.590> around

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
these footings here all the way around

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.920 
these footings here all the way around
so<00:00:47.219> we<00:00:47.640> need<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.879> what<00:00:48.059> do<00:00:48.270> what's<00:00:48.450> called<00:00:48.600> snap

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
so we need to what do what's called snap

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.810 
so we need to what do what's called snap
in<00:00:49.110> line<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.620> we're<00:00:49.829> going<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.010> snap<00:00:50.190> lines<00:00:50.520> and

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
in line so we're going to snap lines and

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.610 
in line so we're going to snap lines and
we'll<00:00:50.910> measure<00:00:51.390> from<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.809> back<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
we'll measure from the back to the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.680 
we'll measure from the back to the
middle<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.039> we'll<00:00:53.910> measure<00:00:54.090> from<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.449> side

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
middle and we'll measure from the side

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.150 
middle and we'll measure from the side
to<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> side<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.530> we'll<00:00:55.620> figure<00:00:55.800> out<00:00:55.920> exactly

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
to the side and we'll figure out exactly

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.770 
to the side and we'll figure out exactly
where<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> footprint<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.329> house<00:00:57.539> is

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
where the footprint of this house is

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.130 
where the footprint of this house is
right<00:00:59.210> exactly<00:01:00.210> where<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.750> house<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.020> going

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
right exactly where the house is going

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.900 
right exactly where the house is going
to<00:01:01.199> sit<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.680> then<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.430> next<00:01:02.670> thing<00:01:02.789> that

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
to sit and then the next thing that

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.490 
to sit and then the next thing that
we'll<00:01:03.000> do<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.210> we'll<00:01:03.329> take<00:01:03.539> some<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.199> long

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
we'll do is we'll take some of that long

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.960 
we'll do is we'll take some of that long
lineal<00:01:05.010> lumber<00:01:05.280> over<00:01:05.309> there<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.760> start

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
lineal lumber over there and start

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.490 
lineal lumber over there and start
cutting<00:01:06.150> what<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.420> call<00:01:06.600> plates<00:01:06.960> which<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
cutting what we call plates which is the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.390 
cutting what we call plates which is the
very<00:01:07.680> bottom<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.400> our<00:01:08.610> wall<00:01:10.040> so<00:01:11.040> that's<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
very bottom of our wall so that's the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.010 
very bottom of our wall so that's the
next<00:01:11.549> step<00:01:11.820> here<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.390> we've<00:01:12.600> got<00:01:12.780> everything

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
next step here so we've got everything

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.140 
next step here so we've got everything
ready<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.500> go<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:13.650> framing<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.670> first<00:01:14.939> step

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
ready to go for framing the first step

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.910 
ready to go for framing the first step
of<00:01:15.180> framing<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.810> snapping<00:01:16.200> lines<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.680> cutting

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
of framing is snapping lines and cutting

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.359 
of framing is snapping lines and cutting
plates<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.580> that'll<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.060> happening<00:01:18.210> next<00:01:19.369> get

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
plates so that'll be happening next get

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.590 
plates so that'll be happening next get
you<00:01:20.490> some<00:01:20.640> video<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:20.909> once<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.390> gets<00:01:21.420> going

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
you some video that once it gets going

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.539 
you some video that once it gets going
another<00:01:22.560> thing<00:01:22.860> I'm<00:01:22.979> going<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.130> tell<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.460> is

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
another thing I'm going to tell you is

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.880 
another thing I'm going to tell you is
when<00:01:24.330> our<00:01:24.509> framers<00:01:24.960> frame<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.320> walls<00:01:25.590> once

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
when our framers frame up walls once

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.770 
when our framers frame up walls once
we've<00:01:26.009> got<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.310> plates<00:01:26.580> cut<00:01:26.909> instead<00:01:27.540> of

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
we've got this plates cut instead of

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.539 
we've got this plates cut instead of
framing<00:01:28.080> along<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> ground<00:01:28.650> which<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.070> always

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
framing along the ground which is always

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.800 
framing along the ground which is always
kind<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.850> bumpy<00:01:30.150> although<00:01:30.360> we're<00:01:30.540> nice<00:01:30.780> and

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
kind of bumpy although we're nice and

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.760 
kind of bumpy although we're nice and
flat<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:33.049> one<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.200> things<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.619> do

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
flat here one of the things that we do

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.410 
flat here one of the things that we do
now<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.520> actually<00:01:35.820> use<00:01:35.939> what's<00:01:36.150> called<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
now is we actually use what's called a

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.330 
now is we actually use what's called a
framing<00:01:36.659> table<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.320> we'll<00:01:37.439> set<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.680> sawhorses

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
framing table so we'll set up sawhorses

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.249 
framing table so we'll set up sawhorses
here<00:01:38.790> here<00:01:39.060> here<00:01:39.360> here<00:01:39.570> all<00:01:39.689> four<00:01:39.960> corners

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
here here here here all four corners

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.370 
here here here here all four corners
will<00:01:41.189> lay<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.520> plates<00:01:41.729> across<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.570> frame<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
will lay the plates across and frame the

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.920 
will lay the plates across and frame the
walls<00:01:43.590> up<00:01:43.920> I'll<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.270> ground<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.810> it's

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
walls up I'll the ground so it's

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.840 
walls up I'll the ground so it's
actually<00:01:46.110> easier<00:01:46.590> on<00:01:46.740> our<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.520> easier<00:01:47.790> on

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
actually easier on our it's easier on

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.539 
actually easier on our it's easier on
our<00:01:48.060> framers<00:01:48.329> backs<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:49.680> walls<00:01:49.950> are<00:01:50.220> flat

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
our framers backs the walls are flat

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.020 
our framers backs the walls are flat
square<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.710> it's<00:01:52.710> easier<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.040> once<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.850> walls

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
square and it's easier to once the walls

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.670 
square and it's easier to once the walls
are<00:01:54.210> built<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:54.840> pick<00:01:55.020> them<00:01:55.170> up<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.500> walk

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
are built to just pick them up and walk

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.139 
are built to just pick them up and walk
them<00:01:55.829> over<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.100> where<00:01:56.250> they<00:01:56.369> go<00:01:56.549> put<00:01:56.969> them<00:01:57.030> in

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
them over to where they go put them in

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.710 
them over to where they go put them in
place<00:01:57.390> and

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
place and

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.410 
place and
nail<00:01:59.320> them<00:01:59.470> together<00:01:59.590> so<00:02:00.460> that's<00:02:01.000> what<00:02:01.210> we<00:02:01.300> do

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
nail them together so that's what we do

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.180 
nail them together so that's what we do
here<00:02:01.690> it<00:02:01.840> makes<00:02:02.410> things<00:02:02.560> run<00:02:02.770> really<00:02:03.010> nicely

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
here it makes things run really nicely

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.430 
here it makes things run really nicely
and<00:02:03.400> efficiently<00:02:03.790> and<00:02:04.030> it's<00:02:04.840> kind<00:02:05.080> of<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.230> great

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
and efficiently and it's kind of a great

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.780 
and efficiently and it's kind of a great
way<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.620> do<00:02:05.800> it<00:02:05.890> as<00:02:05.980> far<00:02:06.130> as<00:02:06.160> I'm<00:02:06.310> concerned<00:02:06.700> so

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
way to do it as far as I'm concerned so

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.389 
way to do it as far as I'm concerned so

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
to framing that'll be our you learn

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.120 
to framing that'll be our you learn
quick

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
I talked earlier about snapping lines so

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.640 
I talked earlier about snapping lines so
we're<00:02:35.360> here<00:02:35.510> snapping<00:02:35.930> lines<00:02:36.079> now<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.500> can

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650

we're here snapping lines now you can
see<00:02:37.689> now<00:02:38.689> we've<00:02:39.620> got<00:02:39.829> straight<00:02:40.250> lines<00:02:40.489> that

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
see now we've got straight lines that

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:48.729 
see now we've got straight lines that
run<00:02:40.970> all<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.510> way<00:02:41.540> down<00:02:42.459> these<00:02:43.510> footings<00:02:47.739> each

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
run all the way down these footings each

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.979 
run all the way down these footings each
wall<00:02:49.540> now<00:02:50.540> has<00:02:50.840> a<00:02:50.870> straight<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:53.450> string<00:02:53.780> never

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989

going to line back up again there's a 1

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.399 
going to line back up again there's a 1
foot<00:03:04.940> difference<00:03:05.150> in<00:03:05.450> between<00:03:05.599> they're<00:03:05.959> there
