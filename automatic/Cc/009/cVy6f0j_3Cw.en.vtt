00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
in the comments below and I'll be

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.380 
in the comments below and I'll be
getting<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.160> done<00:00:29.340> ASAP<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:30.000> starting<00:00:30.359> up

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
getting that done ASAP so starting up

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.339 
getting that done ASAP so starting up
with<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.570> Hanlon<00:00:30.810> between<00:00:31.019> these<00:00:31.170> two

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
with the Hanlon between these two

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.420 
with the Hanlon between these two
they're<00:00:31.500> complete<00:00:31.920> different<00:00:32.219> driving

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
they're complete different driving

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.430 
they're complete different driving
styles<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.239> jester<00:00:33.750> tends<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.170> understeer

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
styles the jester tends to understeer

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.590 
styles the jester tends to understeer
lot<00:00:34.800> more<00:00:35.040> as<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.399> Fetzer<00:00:35.700> once<00:00:36.450> they

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
lot more as the Fetzer once they

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.569 
lot more as the Fetzer once they
oversteer<00:00:37.260> with<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.860> being<00:00:38.040> said<00:00:38.160> that

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
oversteer with that being said that

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.040 
oversteer with that being said that
justice<00:00:38.910> got<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> bit<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> turning<00:00:39.570> circle<00:00:39.600> and

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
justice got a bit a turning circle and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.110 
justice got a bit a turning circle and
also<00:00:40.230> better<00:00:40.350> response<00:00:40.920> time<00:00:41.219> at<00:00:41.550> high<00:00:41.730> speeds

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
also better response time at high speeds

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.760 
also better response time at high speeds
so<00:00:42.600> I'm<00:00:42.750> taking<00:00:42.870> sharp<00:00:43.230> corners<00:00:43.590> at<00:00:43.680> high

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
so I'm taking sharp corners at high

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.650 
so I'm taking sharp corners at high
speeds<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.190> do<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.550> without<00:00:45.030> making

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
speeds you can do that without making

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.060 
speeds you can do that without making
any<00:00:45.809> sort<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.110> error<00:00:46.260> as<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.440> mistake<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:46.950> then

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
any sort of error as a mistake but then

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.560 
any sort of error as a mistake but then
again<00:00:47.190> if<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.670> want<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.850> carry<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.149> speed

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
again if you want to carry that speed

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.479 
again if you want to carry that speed
you<00:00:49.079> have<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.320> expect<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> understeer<00:00:50.309> well

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
you have to expect the understeer well

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.590 
you have to expect the understeer well
it's<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.670> felt<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.120> another<00:00:51.329> hands

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
it's the felt so another hands

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.060 
it's the felt so another hands
completely<00:00:51.960> opposite<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.260> course<00:00:52.500> if<00:00:52.980> you

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
completely opposite of course if you

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.170 
completely opposite of course if you
want<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.309> push<00:00:53.460> around<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.789> corners<00:00:54.090> you're

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
want to push around the corners you're

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.029 
want to push around the corners you're
gonna<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.629> expect<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.079> oversteer<00:00:55.469> Sun

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
gonna have to expect to oversteer Sun

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.150 
gonna have to expect to oversteer Sun
level<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.489> unpredictability<00:00:56.910> there<00:00:57.629> as<00:00:57.780> well

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
level of unpredictability there as well

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.610 
level of unpredictability there as well
at<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.340> same<00:00:59.699> time<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.870> doesn't<00:01:01.170> have<00:01:01.320> that

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
at the same time it doesn't have that

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.680 
at the same time it doesn't have that
much<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.640> guess<00:01:02.940> great<00:01:03.359> traction

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
much of a I guess great traction

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.750 
much of a I guess great traction
compared<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> gesture<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.159> deficiencies

all<00:01:05.909> over<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> jesters<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.869> certainly<00:01:07.260> just

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
all over the jesters it certainly just

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.219 
all over the jesters it certainly just
will<00:01:08.250> take<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.850> for<00:01:09.270> handling<00:01:09.510> between<00:01:09.960> these

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
will take it for handling between these

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.310 
will take it for handling between these
two<00:01:10.470> 0<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.369> 60<00:01:11.790> we<00:01:11.970> know<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.540> gesture<00:01:12.960> here<00:01:13.200> you

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
two 0 to 60 we know the gesture here you

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.810 
two 0 to 60 we know the gesture here you
can<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.799> gets<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.700> 3.17<00:01:15.689> seconds<00:01:16.320> with<00:01:17.100> GTA

it<00:01:22.890> takes<00:01:23.220> about<00:01:24.560> 0.10<00:01:25.560> second<00:01:26.220> so

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
it takes about 0.10 second so

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.179 
it takes about 0.10 second so

shoots off even the normal version if

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.350 
shoots off even the normal version if
you<00:01:33.869> remember<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.229> covered<00:01:34.530> ages<00:01:34.920> ago<00:01:35.180> does<00:01:36.180> do

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
you remember we covered ages ago does do

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.670 
you remember we covered ages ago does do
have<00:01:36.509> better<00:01:36.720> acceleration<00:01:36.960> over<00:01:37.470> them

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
have better acceleration over them

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.700 
have better acceleration over them
feltzer<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:39.180> then<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.689> felt<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.170> slowly<00:01:40.500> does

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
feltzer but then I felt so slowly does

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.160 
feltzer but then I felt so slowly does
creep<00:01:41.070> up<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.640> eventually<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.509> overtakes<00:01:42.899> and

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
creep up and eventually it overtakes and

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.649 
creep up and eventually it overtakes and
we<00:01:43.770> know<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.130> got<00:01:44.369> superior<00:01:44.850> top<00:01:45.180> speed<00:01:45.450> over

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
we know it's got superior top speed over

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.819 
we know it's got superior top speed over
the<00:01:46.700> gesture<00:01:47.990> regardless<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.020> all<00:01:49.560> we<00:01:49.680> know

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
the gesture regardless so all we know

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:50.270 
the gesture regardless so all we know
obviously

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
obviously

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.100 
obviously
race<00:01:50.790> car<00:01:51.000> version<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.329> jess<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.689> going<00:01:51.840> prove

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
race car version of jess is going prove

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.840 
race car version of jess is going prove
acceleration<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:52.950> does<00:01:53.100> take<00:01:53.310> quite<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.579> bit

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
acceleration so it does take quite a bit

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.959 
acceleration so it does take quite a bit
for<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> feltzer<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.960> overtake<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.820> is

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
for the feltzer to overtake so this is

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.370 
for the feltzer to overtake so this is
gonna<00:01:57.149> be<00:01:57.270> interesting<00:01:57.540> for<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:57.990> lap<00:01:58.110> time

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
gonna be interesting for the lap time

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.560 
gonna be interesting for the lap time
test<00:01:58.710> because<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.880> know<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.390> does

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
test because you know this does

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.330 
test because you know this does
obviously<00:02:00.810> make<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> difference<00:02:01.590> depending<00:02:02.219> on

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
obviously make a difference depending on

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.120 
obviously make a difference depending on
the<00:02:02.430> track<00:02:02.759> how<00:02:03.180> many<00:02:03.240> corners<00:02:03.659> there<00:02:03.869> are

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
the track how many corners there are

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.069 
the track how many corners there are

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
course which does make it more

my<00:02:13.480> efficiency<00:02:13.900> certainly<00:02:14.680> there<00:02:14.890> for<00:02:15.070> the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
my efficiency certainly there for the

about<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.350> breaking<00:02:17.800> points<00:02:18.190> but<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.370> have

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
about the breaking points but you have

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.340 
about the breaking points but you have
to<00:02:18.700> expect<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.120> understeer<00:02:19.660> because<00:02:20.140> it's

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
to expect the understeer because it's

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.810 
to expect the understeer because it's
one<00:02:20.950> of<00:02:21.040> those<00:02:21.130> things<00:02:21.460> if<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.640> get<00:02:21.760> the

one of those things if you get the

there<00:03:15.220> in<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.400> first<00:03:15.640> place<00:03:16.020> so<00:03:17.020> yeah<00:03:17.170> 25

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
there in the first place so yeah 25

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.770 
there in the first place so yeah 25
another<00:03:17.860> hand<00:03:18.070> for<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.280> gesture<00:03:18.490> here<00:03:18.780> sort

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
another hand for the gesture here sort

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.000 
another hand for the gesture here sort
of<00:03:19.810> just<00:03:20.050> dominating<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:20.530> scene<00:03:20.710> with<00:03:20.860> the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
of just dominating the scene with the

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.040 
of just dominating the scene with the
variation<00:03:21.880> given<00:03:22.180> there<00:03:22.330> but<00:03:22.570> here's<00:03:22.870> the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
variation given there but here's the

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.280 
variation given there but here's the
thing

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
thing

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.750 
thing
with<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.710> lap<00:03:23.860> time<00:03:24.100> test<00:03:24.430> which<00:03:24.610> is

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
with the lap time test which is

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.850 
with the lap time test which is
absolutely<00:03:25.240> interesting<00:03:25.750> right<00:03:25.900> now<00:03:26.680> between

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
absolutely interesting right now between

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.850 
absolutely interesting right now between
the<00:03:27.070> two<00:03:27.690> weights<00:03:28.690> pay<00:03:29.350> attention<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:29.770> the

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
the two weights pay attention to the

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.830 
the two weights pay attention to the
laps<00:03:30.070> here<00:03:30.280> right<00:03:30.490> so<00:03:30.520> let<00:03:31.240> me<00:03:31.330> explain<00:03:31.540> so

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
laps here right so let me explain so

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.740 
laps here right so let me explain so
with<00:03:31.960> the<00:03:32.020> feltzer<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:32.800> managed<00:03:33.490> to<00:03:33.610> get<00:03:33.850> the

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
with the feltzer I managed to get the

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.480 
with the feltzer I managed to get the
lap<00:03:34.930> time<00:03:35.200> then<00:03:35.500> I<00:03:35.530> got<00:03:35.740> a<00:03:35.770> hair<00:03:36.010> which<00:03:36.220> I<00:03:36.370> was

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:36.490 
lap time then I got a hair which I was

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.580 
lap time then I got a hair which I was
not<00:03:36.610> able<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:36.850> be<00:03:37.000> afterwards<00:03:37.330> in<00:03:37.750> three<00:03:38.380> laps

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
not able to be afterwards in three laps

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.710 
not able to be afterwards in three laps
right<00:03:38.920> in<00:03:39.520> three<00:03:39.850> laps<00:03:40.060> whereas<00:03:40.390> with<00:03:40.630> the

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
right in three laps whereas with the

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.420 
right in three laps whereas with the
gesture<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.440> be<00:03:41.530> able<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.740> pull<00:03:41.950> off<00:03:41.980> this<00:03:42.190> time

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
gesture to be able to pull off this time

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.220 
gesture to be able to pull off this time
you'll<00:03:42.610> see<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:42.850> here<00:03:43.060> on<00:03:43.240> this<00:03:43.480> video<00:03:43.840> it

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
you'll see you here on this video it

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.949 
you'll see you here on this video it
took<00:03:44.560> me<00:03:44.740> 40<00:03:45.040> laps<00:03:45.220> on<00:03:45.459> this<00:03:46.030> track<00:03:46.420> on<00:03:46.630> this

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
took me 40 laps on this track on this

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.140 
took me 40 laps on this track on this
track<00:03:47.260> I<00:03:47.500> don't<00:03:47.950> know<00:03:48.010> what<00:03:48.130> it<00:03:48.220> is<00:03:48.340> it<00:03:48.970> may<00:03:49.120> be

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
track I don't know what it is it may be

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.400 
track I don't know what it is it may be
used<00:03:49.300> to<00:03:49.390> do<00:03:49.510> with<00:03:49.660> my<00:03:49.690> driving<00:03:50.020> style<00:03:50.170> I

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
used to do with my driving style I

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.770 
used to do with my driving style I
prefer<00:03:50.680> preference<00:03:51.330> but<00:03:52.330> I<00:03:52.360> certainly<00:03:52.570> do

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
prefer preference but I certainly do

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.630 
prefer preference but I certainly do
prefer<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.140> over<00:03:53.830> steering<00:03:54.010> Carver<00:03:54.550> the

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
prefer the over steering Carver the

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.800 
prefer the over steering Carver the
under<00:03:54.850> steering<00:03:55.060> car<00:03:55.300> which<00:03:55.420> obviously<00:03:55.630> is

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
under steering car which obviously is

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.410 
under steering car which obviously is
the<00:03:55.900> feltzer<00:03:56.290> but<00:03:57.010> uh<00:03:57.060> with<00:03:58.060> that<00:03:58.180> being<00:03:58.300> said

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
the feltzer but uh with that being said

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.150 
the feltzer but uh with that being said
you<00:03:58.720> know<00:03:58.840> it's<00:03:59.020> kind<00:03:59.170> of<00:03:59.200> crazy<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.770> think<00:03:59.950> how

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
you know it's kind of crazy to think how

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.010 
you know it's kind of crazy to think how
close<00:04:00.790> these<00:04:01.150> lap<00:04:01.360> times<00:04:01.720> where<00:04:01.930> this

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
close these lap times where this

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.900 
close these lap times where this
extremely<00:04:02.620> extremely<00:04:02.890> close<00:04:03.160> or<00:04:03.730> on<00:04:03.820> this

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
extremely extremely close or on this

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.490 
extremely extremely close or on this
particular<00:04:04.330> track<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.780> can<00:04:05.140> try<00:04:05.260> it<00:04:05.320> off<00:04:05.380> on

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
particular track you can try it off on

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.230 
particular track you can try it off on
yourself<00:04:05.560> like<00:04:05.950> in<00:04:06.040> description<00:04:06.430> below<00:04:06.610> the

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
yourself like in description below the

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.240 
yourself like in description below the
thoughts<00:04:07.510> are<00:04:07.750> certainly<00:04:08.230> seems<00:04:08.860> to<00:04:08.980> be

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
thoughts are certainly seems to be

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.310 
thoughts are certainly seems to be
taking<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.060> upper<00:04:10.240> hand<00:04:10.390> here<00:04:10.510> but<00:04:10.720> it's

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
taking the upper hand here but it's

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.640 
taking the upper hand here but it's
extremely<00:04:11.920> extremely<00:04:12.340> close<00:04:12.930> no<00:04:13.930> reason<00:04:14.560> why

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
extremely extremely close no reason why

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.140 
extremely extremely close no reason why
the<00:04:14.709> forces<00:04:15.190> got<00:04:15.340> a<00:04:15.370> slightly<00:04:15.640> upper<00:04:15.940> hand

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
the forces got a slightly upper hand

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.000 
the forces got a slightly upper hand
here<00:04:16.209> it's<00:04:16.930> because<00:04:17.049> it's<00:04:17.380> carrying<00:04:17.830> that

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
here it's because it's carrying that

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.010 
here it's because it's carrying that
extra<00:04:18.549> speed<00:04:18.850> generated<00:04:19.510> through<00:04:19.690> its<00:04:19.810> top

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.020 
extra speed generated through its top

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.340 
extra speed generated through its top
speed<00:04:20.400> so<00:04:21.400> around<00:04:21.640> these<00:04:21.760> corners<00:04:22.030> if<00:04:22.930> you<00:04:23.169> do

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
speed so around these corners if you do

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.510 
speed so around these corners if you do
get<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:23.620> breaking<00:04:23.919> point<00:04:24.100> right<00:04:24.250> and<00:04:24.340> really

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
get the breaking point right and really

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.280 
get the breaking point right and really
get<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:24.880> floor<00:04:25.120> control<00:04:25.479> um

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
get the floor control um

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.440 
get the floor control um
with<00:04:26.650> feltzer<00:04:27.220> you'll<00:04:27.790> be<00:04:27.880> able<00:04:28.000> to<00:04:28.150> carry<00:04:28.330> the

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
with feltzer you'll be able to carry the

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.180 
with feltzer you'll be able to carry the
extra<00:04:28.540> speed<00:04:28.840> but<00:04:29.200> here's<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.680> thing<00:04:29.710> though

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
extra speed but here's the thing though

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.280 
extra speed but here's the thing though
you<00:04:30.430> have<00:04:31.270> a<00:04:31.300> lot<00:04:31.510> more<00:04:31.690> available<00:04:31.870> with<00:04:32.200> the

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
you have a lot more available with the

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:33.390 
you have a lot more available with the
thoughts<00:04:32.500> of<00:04:32.650> when<00:04:32.770> taking<00:04:33.040> the<00:04:33.130> corner

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
thoughts of when taking the corner

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.730 
thoughts of when taking the corner
carrying<00:04:33.730> that<00:04:33.910> extra<00:04:34.300> speed<00:04:34.690> whereas<00:04:35.500> with

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
carrying that extra speed whereas with

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.740 
carrying that extra speed whereas with
the<00:04:35.920> gesture<00:04:36.430> you<00:04:36.700> do<00:04:37.030> generate<00:04:37.390> the<00:04:37.510> speed

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
the gesture you do generate the speed

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.570 
the gesture you do generate the speed
for<00:04:37.960> acceleration<00:04:38.500> however<00:04:38.980> when<00:04:39.160> taking<00:04:39.490> a

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
for acceleration however when taking a

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.330 
for acceleration however when taking a
corner<00:04:39.790> of<00:04:39.910> duties<00:04:40.270> on<00:04:40.480> the<00:04:40.750> steering<00:04:41.340> you

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
corner of duties on the steering you

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.010 
corner of duties on the steering you
have<00:04:42.460> to<00:04:42.580> sacrifice<00:04:42.760> a<00:04:43.000> lot<00:04:43.180> of<00:04:43.300> speed<00:04:43.570> in

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
have to sacrifice a lot of speed in

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.450 
have to sacrifice a lot of speed in
order<00:04:44.200> to<00:04:44.290> take<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:44.680> corn<00:04:44.950> efficiently

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
order to take the corn efficiently

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.740 
order to take the corn efficiently
however<00:04:45.760> you<00:04:45.850> do<00:04:45.970> have<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.210> traction<00:04:46.450> there

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
however you do have the traction there

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.500 
however you do have the traction there

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
and felt it did manage to get this lap

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.150

time<00:04:52.030> within<00:04:52.810> three<00:04:53.200> laps<00:04:53.410> and<00:04:53.620> you<00:04:53.740> see<00:04:53.950> that

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
time within three laps and you see that

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.980 
time within three laps and you see that
one<00:04:54.580> two<00:04:54.730> five<00:04:54.970> eight<00:04:55.180> or<00:04:55.330> seven<00:04:55.510> for<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:55.810> felt

one two five eight or seven for the felt
I<00:04:56.110> won<00:04:56.310> 2584<00:04:57.370> for<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:57.940> gesture<00:04:58.210> but<00:04:59.020> that<00:04:59.260> time

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
I won 2584 for the gesture but that time

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.530 
I won 2584 for the gesture but that time
for<00:04:59.800> the<00:04:59.860> gesture<00:05:00.070> took<00:05:00.370> ages<00:05:00.760> to<00:05:00.910> get<00:05:01.060> and<00:05:01.300> to

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
for the gesture took ages to get and to

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.270 
for the gesture took ages to get and to
break<00:05:01.720> that<00:05:01.900> one<00:05:02.020> twenty<00:05:02.290> five<00:05:02.440> was<00:05:02.680> extremely

break that one twenty five was extremely

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.070 
break that one twenty five was extremely

extremely difficult with the jest on

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.350 
extremely difficult with the jest on
that<00:05:05.260> particular<00:05:05.470> track<00:05:05.890> anyway<00:05:06.400> it's

that particular track anyway it's

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.210 
that particular track anyway it's
interesting<00:05:07.690> because<00:05:07.990> that<00:05:08.170> first<00:05:08.680> track<00:05:09.010> we

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
interesting because that first track we

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.900 
interesting because that first track we
just<00:05:09.430> saw<00:05:09.610> Galileo<00:05:10.180> ring<00:05:10.510> that<00:05:11.050> was<00:05:11.910> consisted

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
just saw Galileo ring that was consisted

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.180 
just saw Galileo ring that was consisted
of<00:05:13.000> Kirby<00:05:13.450> Kirby<00:05:14.020> corners<00:05:14.440> right<00:05:14.710> could<00:05:15.010> carry

of Kirby Kirby corners right could carry

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.740 
of Kirby Kirby corners right could carry
a<00:05:15.250> lot<00:05:15.340> of<00:05:15.370> speed<00:05:15.520> and<00:05:15.670> that's<00:05:15.970> why<00:05:16.090> it<00:05:16.150> felt<00:05:16.600> to

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
a lot of speed and that's why it felt to

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.380 
a lot of speed and that's why it felt to
sort<00:05:16.990> of<00:05:17.080> did<00:05:17.800> get<00:05:17.980> quick<00:05:18.190> a<00:05:18.220> lap<00:05:18.460> time<00:05:18.730> it

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
sort of did get quick a lap time it

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.890 
sort of did get quick a lap time it
wasn't<00:05:19.540> that<00:05:19.720> many<00:05:20.050> sort<00:05:20.350> of<00:05:20.440> stop<00:05:20.860> start<00:05:21.900> to

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
generate acceleration is more just

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.130 
generate acceleration is more just
carrying<00:05:25.030> that<00:05:25.330> speed<00:05:25.720> that<00:05:25.900> you<00:05:25.990> already

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
carrying that speed that you already

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
on this track is more soft stop at start

all these corners to sort of you know

as<00:05:58.360> often<00:05:58.750> as<00:05:58.930> the<00:05:59.050> other<00:05:59.170> cars<00:05:59.560> within<00:05:59.860> this

00:05:59.910 --> 00:05:59.920

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.890 
as often as the other cars within this
category<00:06:00.460> so<00:06:00.610> it<00:06:00.730> the<00:06:00.820> felt<00:06:01.060> itself<00:06:01.300> example

category so it the felt itself example

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.690 
category so it the felt itself example
it<00:06:02.620> definitely<00:06:03.070> doesn't<00:06:03.190> respond<00:06:03.610> to

it definitely doesn't respond to

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.120 
it definitely doesn't respond to
potholes<00:06:04.210> so<00:06:04.750> you<00:06:04.810> can<00:06:05.080> easily<00:06:05.320> overstay<00:06:06.070> if

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.990 
that's the sort of lap times you saw
there<00:06:26.080> felt<00:06:26.650> so<00:06:26.830> a<00:06:26.860> certain<00:06:27.340> is<00:06:27.460> slower<00:06:27.760> by

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
there felt so a certain is slower by

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.320 
there felt so a certain is slower by
quite<00:06:28.390> a<00:06:28.420> bit<00:06:28.860> 0.6<00:06:29.860> seconds<00:06:30.280> on<00:06:30.490> city<00:06:30.790> roads<00:06:31.030> on

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
quite a bit 0.6 seconds on city roads on

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.870 
quite a bit 0.6 seconds on city roads on
that<00:06:31.720> particular<00:06:32.020> track<00:06:32.470> so<00:06:32.740> it's<00:06:33.160> very<00:06:33.370> very

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
that particular track so it's very very

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.790 
that particular track so it's very very
track<00:06:34.270> dependent<00:06:34.750> between<00:06:35.080> the<00:06:35.230> two<00:06:35.440> but<00:06:35.620> what

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
track dependent between the two but what

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.430 
track dependent between the two but what
we<00:06:35.980> have<00:06:36.130> found<00:06:36.460> out<00:06:36.760> today<00:06:37.000> is<00:06:37.480> that<00:06:38.080> they<00:06:38.320> are

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
we have found out today is that they are

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:39.660 
we have found out today is that they are
extremely<00:06:38.800> competitive

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
extremely competitive

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.670 
extremely competitive
in<00:06:39.880> each<00:06:40.030> other<00:06:40.300> and<00:06:40.600> they<00:06:41.140> do<00:06:41.200> have<00:06:41.650> different

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
in each other and they do have different

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.520 
in each other and they do have different
driving<00:06:42.400> style<00:06:42.550> and<00:06:43.090> they're<00:06:43.660> both<00:06:43.900> certainly

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
driving style and they're both certainly

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.580 
driving style and they're both certainly
competitive<00:06:45.430> and<00:06:45.940> the<00:06:46.270> viable<00:06:46.780> you<00:06:47.500> know

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
competitive and the viable you know

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.530 
competitive and the viable you know
certainly<00:06:47.980> the<00:06:48.100> fella<00:06:48.280> is<00:06:48.580> viable<00:06:48.880> against

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
certainly the fella is viable against

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.420 
certainly the fella is viable against
the<00:06:49.630> Chester<00:06:50.020> race<00:06:50.200> car<00:06:50.470> but<00:06:50.680> it<00:06:50.800> depends<00:06:51.310> on

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
the Chester race car but it depends on

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.220 
the Chester race car but it depends on
the<00:06:51.580> driver<00:06:51.790> depends<00:06:52.450> and<00:06:52.570> the<00:06:52.630> preference<00:06:53.140> of

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:53.230 
the driver depends and the preference of

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.510 
the driver depends and the preference of
the<00:06:53.380> driving<00:06:53.620> style<00:06:53.830> as<00:06:54.100> well<00:06:54.280> so<00:06:54.430> hopefully
