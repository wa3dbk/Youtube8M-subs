to<00:00:49.200> go<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.800> drive<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.129> into<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.430> ground

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129

on once the posts are in place you will

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.020 
on once the posts are in place you will
need<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.830> drill<00:01:25.979> some<00:01:26.340> poles<00:01:26.580> for<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
poles try to make sure that the holes

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.789 
poles try to make sure that the holes
are<00:01:34.259> even<00:01:34.619> with<00:01:34.799> each<00:01:34.920> other<00:01:36.530> then<00:01:37.530> all<00:01:37.680> you

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
are even with each other then all you

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.289 
are even with each other then all you
need<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.979> do<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.369> push<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.790> electrical

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
need to do is push the electrical

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.960 
need to do is push the electrical
conduit<00:01:39.689> through<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.140> holes<00:01:40.350> if<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.670> did<00:01:41.850> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
conduit through the holes if you did the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.480 
conduit through the holes if you did the
holes<00:01:42.150> evenly<00:01:42.630> then<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.530> poles<00:01:43.799> will<00:01:44.100> slide

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
holes evenly then the poles will slide

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.330 
holes evenly then the poles will slide
right<00:01:44.880> through<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.479> not<00:01:46.259> then<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.770> may<00:01:47.009> want

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
right through if not then you may want

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.039 
right through if not then you may want
to<00:01:47.490> get<00:01:47.670> something<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.240> beat<00:01:48.450> on<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.840> end<00:01:48.960> of

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
to get something to beat on the end of

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.710 
to get something to beat on the end of
the<00:01:49.110> conduit<00:01:49.530> until<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.950> goes<00:01:50.100> through

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.030 

next<00:01:55.720> you<00:01:55.810> need<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:55.990> take<00:01:56.290> steps<00:01:56.620> to<00:01:56.800> make<00:01:56.979> sure

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
next you need to take steps to make sure
