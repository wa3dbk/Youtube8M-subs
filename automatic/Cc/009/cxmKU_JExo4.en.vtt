00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
to start adding the numbers work right

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.200 
to start adding the numbers work right
your<00:00:52.770> next<00:00:52.950> step<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.370> now<00:00:53.550> it's<00:00:53.700> an<00:00:53.790> easy<00:00:53.970> fix

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
your next step is now it's an easy fix

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.450 
your next step is now it's an easy fix
and<00:00:54.690> add<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.410> with<00:00:55.560> the<00:00:55.710> next<00:00:55.950> number<00:00:56.070> little

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
and add it with the next number little

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.940 
and add it with the next number little
wit<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.820> number<00:00:57.090> three<00:01:00.530> hundred<00:01:01.530> folks<00:01:01.680> are

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
wit the number three hundred folks are

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.189 
wit the number three hundred folks are
underway<00:01:02.370> then<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.420> use<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.750> number<00:01:03.870> nine

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
underway then you use the number nine

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.440 
underway then you use the number nine
and<00:01:04.470> that's<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.009> number<00:01:05.339> below<00:01:05.450> what

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
and that's to the number below what

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.050 
and that's to the number below what
would<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:07.340> right<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.580> number<00:01:08.850> eight

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
would that be right the number eight

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.130 
would that be right the number eight
nine<00:01:09.930> plus<00:01:10.259> 8<00:01:10.710> equals<00:01:11.130> 17<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.869> where<00:01:13.050> we

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
nine plus 8 equals 17 this is where we

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.070 
nine plus 8 equals 17 this is where we
gonna<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.500> some<00:01:13.680> tricky<00:01:13.920> thing<00:01:14.660> you<00:01:15.660> notice<00:01:15.990> a

the<00:02:25.610> answer<00:02:25.940> on<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:27.080> 10<00:02:27.320> side<00:02:27.650> we<00:02:28.070> begin<00:02:28.459> by

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
the answer on the 10 side we begin by

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.680 
the answer on the 10 side we begin by
adding<00:02:28.940> 2<00:02:30.040> plus<00:02:31.040> 1<00:02:32.170> which<00:02:33.170> equals<00:02:33.380> 3<00:02:34.570> next<00:02:35.570> we

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
adding 2 plus 1 which equals 3 next we

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.890 
adding 2 plus 1 which equals 3 next we
use<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:36.019> three<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:36.590> add<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.790> number<00:02:37.970> 2

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
use the three and add it to the number 2

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.500 
use the three and add it to the number 2
3<00:02:39.830> plus<00:02:40.280> 2<00:02:40.489> plus<00:02:41.390> 5<00:02:42.190> we<00:02:43.190> then<00:02:43.400> use<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.239> 5<00:02:44.480> and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
3 plus 2 plus 5 we then use the 5 and

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.720 
3 plus 2 plus 5 we then use the 5 and
add<00:02:45.080> it<00:02:45.260> to<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.590> number<00:02:46.090> 4<00:02:47.350> 5<00:02:48.350> plus<00:02:49.100> 4<00:02:49.489> equals<00:02:49.790> 9

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
add it to the number 4 5 plus 4 equals 9

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.610 
add it to the number 4 5 plus 4 equals 9
we<00:02:52.730> then<00:02:52.940> use<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.330> nine<00:02:53.570> and<00:02:53.900> add<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.380> the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
we then use the nine and add it to the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.900 
we then use the nine and add it to the
number<00:02:54.799> below<00:02:55.150> what<00:02:56.150> number<00:02:56.480> is<00:02:56.630> that<00:02:56.660> 6<00:02:57.910> right

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
number below what number is that 6 right

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.440 
number below what number is that 6 right
on<00:02:59.120> 9<00:03:00.110> plus<00:03:00.560> 6<00:03:00.860> equals<00:03:01.549> 15<00:03:02.530> right<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:05.030> remember

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
on 9 plus 6 equals 15 right you remember

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.440 
on 9 plus 6 equals 15 right you remember
what<00:03:05.600> we<00:03:05.720> do<00:03:05.870> next<00:03:09.040> we<00:03:10.040> scratch<00:03:10.610> the<00:03:10.880> six<00:03:11.209> and

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
what we do next we scratch the six and

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.640 
what we do next we scratch the six and
place<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.470> five<00:03:12.680> beside<00:03:13.190> it<00:03:13.989> each<00:03:14.989> scratch<00:03:15.380> on

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
place the five beside it each scratch on

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.910 
place the five beside it each scratch on
the<00:03:15.829> tens<00:03:16.130> place<00:03:16.310> side<00:03:17.209> now<00:03:17.750> we<00:03:17.860> represent<00:03:19.000> 100

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
the tens place side now we represent 100

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:28.120 
the tens place side now we represent 100
lastly<00:03:21.920> we<00:03:22.549> use<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:22.940> 5<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:23.890> add<00:03:24.890> it<00:03:25.100> to<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:27.130> 55

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
lastly we use the 5 and add it to the 55

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.979 
lastly we use the 5 and add it to the 55
plus<00:03:28.610> 5<00:03:28.880> equals<00:03:29.269> 10<00:03:31.150> again<00:03:32.150> we<00:03:32.360> scratch<00:03:32.720> the

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
plus 5 equals 10 again we scratch the

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.600 
plus 5 equals 10 again we scratch the
five<00:03:33.230> and<00:03:33.560> put<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.160> zero<00:03:34.519> beside<00:03:35.000> it<00:03:35.799> blow<00:03:36.799> under

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
five and put a zero beside it blow under

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.030 
five and put a zero beside it blow under
the<00:03:37.730> equation<00:03:38.329> we<00:03:38.959> again<00:03:39.290> place<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.620> last

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
the equation we again place the last

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.360 
the equation we again place the last
digit<00:03:40.400> of<00:03:40.760> our<00:03:41.299> previous<00:03:41.799> equation

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
digit of our previous equation

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.059 
digit of our previous equation
now<00:03:43.459> on<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:43.940> the<00:03:43.970> tens<00:03:44.360> column<00:03:44.480> this<00:03:45.409> is<00:03:45.799> the

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
now on to the tens column this is the

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.180 
now on to the tens column this is the
number<00:03:46.400> zero<00:03:47.080> now<00:03:48.080> we<00:03:48.140> count<00:03:48.530> all<00:03:48.739> of<00:03:49.040> our

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
number zero now we count all of our

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.360 
number zero now we count all of our
scratches<00:03:49.879> which<00:03:50.599> on<00:03:50.810> this<00:03:51.019> side<00:03:51.260> represent<00:03:52.159> a

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
scratches which on this side represent a

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.270 
scratches which on this side represent a
hundred<00:03:53.349> which<00:03:54.349> we<00:03:54.530> will<00:03:54.650> place<00:03:54.890> into<00:03:55.250> the

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
hundred which we will place into the

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.520 
hundred which we will place into the
hundreds<00:03:55.700> column<00:03:55.790> how<00:03:56.540> many<00:03:56.750> scratches<00:03:57.080> do<00:03:57.440> we

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
hundreds column how many scratches do we

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.920 
hundreds column how many scratches do we
have<00:03:57.909> do<00:04:00.129> we<00:04:01.129> then<00:04:01.280> place<00:04:01.519> the<00:04:01.760> two<00:04:01.790> into<00:04:02.780> our

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
have do we then place the two into our

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.710 
have do we then place the two into our
hundreds<00:04:03.470> column<00:04:03.650> in<00:04:04.010> our<00:04:04.220> some<00:04:04.519> what<00:04:05.360> is<00:04:05.540> the
