00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
anyway it's funny actually they didn't

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.390 
anyway it's funny actually they didn't
build<00:01:24.960> close<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.710> because<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.220> could

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
build close to that because it could

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.100 
build close to that because it could
