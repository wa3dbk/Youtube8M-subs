around the stadium but they're also

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.100

on<00:01:31.140> each<00:01:31.470> one<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.890> those<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.400> we're<00:01:32.700> having<00:01:33.270> a

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
on each one of those and we're having a

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.609 
on each one of those and we're having a
distributed<00:01:34.610> sound<00:01:35.610> system<00:01:36.270> so

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
distributed sound system so

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.899 
distributed sound system so
theoretically<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.189> stadium<00:01:38.670> whether

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
theoretically in the stadium whether

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.880 
theoretically in the stadium whether
you're<00:01:39.090> in<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.210> endzone<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:40.350> sidelines

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
you're in the endzone the sidelines

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.999 
you're in the endzone the sidelines
upper<00:01:41.790> deck<00:01:42.000> lower<00:01:42.450> deck<00:01:42.810> everybody<00:01:43.770> will

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
upper deck lower deck everybody will

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.590 
upper deck lower deck everybody will
hear<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.399> same<00:01:44.640> volume<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> think<00:01:45.479> it's

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
hear the same volume and I think it's

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.270 
hear the same volume and I think it's
gonna<00:01:45.750> make<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.930> tremendous<00:01:46.229> difference<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.159> we

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
gonna make a tremendous difference so we

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.999 
gonna make a tremendous difference so we
have<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.640> domes<00:01:47.939> on<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.390> outside<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
have the domes on the outside and the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.580 
have the domes on the outside and the
domes<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.579> outside<00:01:51.180> actually<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.930> LED

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
domes on the outside actually have LED

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.850 
domes on the outside actually have LED
now<00:01:52.860> because<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.490> got<00:01:53.520> much<00:01:53.880> different

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
now because we got much different

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.709 
now because we got much different
technology<00:01:55.860> than<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.130> was<00:01:56.310> available<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.969> 96

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
technology than it was available in 96

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.109 
technology than it was available in 96
so<00:01:58.170> we'll<00:01:58.320> be<00:01:58.439> able<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.740> change<00:01:59.070> colors<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.850> the

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
so we'll be able to change colors of the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.139 
so we'll be able to change colors of the
domes<00:02:00.509> just<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.490> Duke<00:02:02.729> Energy
