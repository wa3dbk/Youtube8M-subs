00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
thought about it people were bringing up

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.610 
thought about it people were bringing up
the<00:00:33.660> fact<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.960> there<00:00:34.140> might<00:00:34.290> be<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.469> little

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
the fact that there might be a little

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.040 
the fact that there might be a little
racial<00:00:35.160> tension<00:00:35.670> going<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.480> then<00:00:36.870> maybe

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
racial tension going on and then maybe

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.110 
racial tension going on and then maybe
this<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.410> little<00:00:37.500> out<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.890> line<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.940> don't

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
this is a little out of line and I don't

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.299

actually giving Virgil all his money for
safekeeping<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.010> I<00:02:34.400> think<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.760> pretty<00:02:34.940> much

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
safekeeping and I think that pretty much

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.870 
safekeeping and I think that pretty much
negates<00:02:35.570> the<00:02:35.750> whole<00:02:35.870> fact<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.770> think

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
negates the whole fact and I think

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.610 
negates the whole fact and I think
screaming<00:02:37.880> racism<00:02:38.450> is<00:02:38.540> out<00:02:38.630> of<00:02:38.660> line<00:02:38.840> no<00:02:39.380> one

Virgil and his relationship with the Ted
DiBiase<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:47.410> they<00:02:48.410> just<00:02:48.860> made<00:02:49.010> me<00:02:49.130> think<00:02:49.160> I

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
DiBiase and they just made me think I

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.280

you<00:02:52.010> know<00:02:52.070> I<00:02:52.160> came<00:02:52.459> to<00:02:52.580> this<00:02:52.700> conclusion<00:02:52.880> but

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
you know I came to this conclusion but

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.200 
you know I came to this conclusion but
you<00:02:53.570> know<00:02:53.810> whatever
