continents eruption of blasted apart

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.990 
continents eruption of blasted apart
they<00:00:55.140> acquired<00:00:55.530> new<00:00:55.770> powers<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.640> became<00:00:56.940> the

they acquired new powers and became the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.240 
they acquired new powers and became the
swap<00:00:57.480> force<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.379> they<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.770> ability<00:00:59.219> to

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
swap force so they have the ability to

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.479 
swap force so they have the ability to
swap<00:00:59.879> their<00:01:00.239> paths<00:01:00.890> top-half<00:01:01.890> determines<00:01:02.370> how

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
swap their paths top-half determines how

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.249 
swap their paths top-half determines how
they<00:01:02.640> fight<00:01:02.910> bottom<00:01:03.420> half<00:01:03.600> determines<00:01:04.170> how

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
they fight bottom half determines how

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.400 
they fight bottom half determines how
they<00:01:04.410> move<00:01:04.649> and<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.309> swap<00:01:05.729> forests<00:01:06.240> are<00:01:06.390> 16<00:01:07.050> new

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.410 
they move and so swap forests are 16 new

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.499 
they move and so swap forests are 16 new
Skylanders<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.430> players<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:08.970> mix<00:01:09.360> and
