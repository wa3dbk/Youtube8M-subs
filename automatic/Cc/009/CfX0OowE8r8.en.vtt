once<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.420> beam<00:02:37.600> is<00:02:37.810> at<00:02:37.959> full<00:02:38.110> strength

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
once the beam is at full strength

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.050 
once the beam is at full strength
nothing<00:02:39.160> can<00:02:39.370> stop<00:02:39.610> it

anything could they break that machine

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.490 
anything could they break that machine
like<00:02:51.310> you<00:02:51.340> broke<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.970> glass<00:02:52.000> if<00:02:52.959> we<00:02:53.320> could

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
like you broke the glass if we could

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.130 
like you broke the glass if we could
find<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.950> right<00:02:54.130> note<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:54.820> if<00:02:55.420> we<00:02:55.690> weren't<00:02:55.900> so

find the right note and if we weren't so
far<00:02:56.380> away<00:02:58.019> that<00:02:59.019> machine<00:02:59.440> we<00:02:59.950> could<00:03:00.130> use<00:03:00.370> it<00:03:00.579> as

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
far away that machine we could use it as

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.940 
far away that machine we could use it as
an<00:03:00.910> amplifier<00:03:01.299> yes<00:03:02.140> we<00:03:02.380> could<00:03:02.590> make<00:03:02.799> my

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
an amplifier yes we could make my

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.940 
an amplifier yes we could make my
harpist<00:03:03.430> wow<00:03:03.640> it<00:03:03.820> is<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:03.940> thunderclap<00:03:04.950> would

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
shatter that Eclipse beam device yes but

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.979 
shatter that Eclipse beam device yes but
it<00:03:08.980> would<00:03:09.130> take<00:03:09.160> time<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:09.880> time<00:03:10.360> is<00:03:10.690> what<00:03:10.720> we

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
it would take time and time is what we

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.289 
it would take time and time is what we
don't<00:03:11.230> have<00:03:11.470> that<00:03:12.040> eclipse<00:03:12.430> is<00:03:12.579> almost<00:03:12.940> full

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299
