starting to kind of take a look peak at
independence<00:00:13.459> now<00:00:13.700> what<00:00:13.910> is<00:00:14.030> independence<00:00:14.570> in

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.410 
independence now what is independence in

independence now what is independence in
in<00:00:15.650> in<00:00:16.190> reference<00:00:16.640> to<00:00:16.700> two<00:00:16.940> am<00:00:17.060> tapping

independence<00:00:18.050> is<00:00:18.170> having<00:00:18.440> the<00:00:18.530> one<00:00:18.710> hand<00:00:18.980> do

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
independence is having the one hand do

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.320 
independence is having the one hand do
something<00:00:19.550> and<00:00:19.699> the<00:00:19.789> other<00:00:19.939> hand<00:00:20.210> do

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
something and the other hand do

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.849 
something and the other hand do
something<00:00:20.599> a<00:00:20.630> little<00:00:20.779> different<00:00:21.230> or<00:00:21.560> in<00:00:21.710> some

intuitive at first and it's not easy but
if<00:00:26.300> you're<00:00:26.420> patient<00:00:26.660> you<00:00:26.929> can<00:00:27.109> develop<00:00:27.470> it<00:00:27.560> but

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
if you're patient you can develop it but

if you're patient you can develop it but
I<00:00:28.070> wanted<00:00:28.369> to<00:00:28.429> get<00:00:28.609> some<00:00:29.269> kind<00:00:29.449> of<00:00:29.480> pattern

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
I wanted to get some kind of pattern

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
D and the g string so it's for a friend

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.020

friend back to the 12th fret now what

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.600 
friend back to the 12th fret now what
makes<00:01:28.970> this<00:01:29.150> independent<00:01:30.079> well<00:01:30.829> and<00:01:31.130> and

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
makes this independent well and and

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.429 
makes this independent well and and
believe<00:01:31.970> me<00:01:32.180> this<00:01:32.299> is<00:01:32.479> just<00:01:32.659> a<00:01:32.750> little<00:01:32.960> bit<00:01:33.350> of

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
believe me this is just a little bit of

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.109 
believe me this is just a little bit of
independency<00:01:34.040> need<00:01:34.220> because<00:01:34.490> in<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:34.939> right

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
independency need because in the right

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.999 
independency need because in the right
hand<00:01:35.450> you're<00:01:35.899> doing<00:01:36.140> kind<00:01:36.350> of<00:01:36.439> a<00:01:36.500> three<00:01:36.770> thing

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
hand you're doing kind of a three thing

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.850 
hand you're doing kind of a three thing
you're<00:01:37.159> playing<00:01:41.049> three<00:01:42.049> different<00:01:42.409> positions

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
you're playing three different positions

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.010 
you're playing three different positions
here<00:01:43.399> you're<00:01:43.670> just<00:01:43.850> doing<00:01:46.299> hold<00:01:47.299> two<00:01:47.509> segments

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
here you're just doing hold two segments

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.810 
here you're just doing hold two segments
so<00:01:48.110> you're<00:01:48.409> matching<00:01:48.590> two<00:01:48.950> segments<00:01:49.460> to<00:01:49.610> three

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
so you're matching two segments to three

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.700 
so you're matching two segments to three
segments<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:50.390> sometimes<00:01:51.140> that<00:01:51.290> can<00:01:51.439> kind<00:01:51.649> of

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
segments and sometimes that can kind of

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.530 
segments and sometimes that can kind of
mess<00:01:51.860> with<00:01:51.920> your<00:01:52.189> head<00:01:52.310> a<00:01:52.340> little<00:01:52.460> bit<00:01:52.610> as

always<00:01:53.960> slow<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.040> key<00:01:55.219> so<00:01:55.790> let's<00:01:56.000> look<00:01:56.090> at

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
always slow is the key so let's look at

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.170 
always slow is the key so let's look at
beat<00:01:56.420> one<00:01:56.860> it's<00:01:57.860> gonna<00:01:57.979> sound<00:01:58.189> like<00:01:58.310> this<00:01:58.579> four

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
beat one it's gonna sound like this four

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.709 
beat one it's gonna sound like this four
five<00:01:59.539> seven<00:02:00.219> fourteen<00:02:01.219> then<00:02:01.969> you<00:02:02.149> go<00:02:02.329> to<00:02:02.390> be

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
five seven fourteen then you go to be

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.380 
five seven fourteen then you go to be
two<00:02:02.990> it's<00:02:03.350> four<00:02:03.710> five<00:02:04.219> seven<00:02:04.729> this<00:02:05.030> time<00:02:05.240> on

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
two it's four five seven this time on

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.920 
two it's four five seven this time on
the<00:02:05.479> E<00:02:05.509> string

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
the E string

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.330 
the E string
and<00:02:07.500> four<00:02:07.980> five<00:02:08.490> seven<00:02:08.970> eleven<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:10.770> then<00:02:11.100> four

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
and four five seven eleven and then four

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.740 
and four five seven eleven and then four
five<00:02:11.760> seven<00:02:12.830> so<00:02:13.830> it's<00:02:14.190> kind<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.460> neat<00:02:14.670> how<00:02:14.750> it

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750
