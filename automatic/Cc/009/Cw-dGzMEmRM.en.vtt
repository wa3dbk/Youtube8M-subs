00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.510
 the girl is what I show today is 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.150
 a video that you requested me that is 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.800
 the sugar effect 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.720
 when we talk about sugar effect o 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.060
 sugar effect 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.830
 let's talk about the glitter that comes 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:39.470
 positioned above the nail and do not come 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.150
 he practically sealed then 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.930
 however the effect of the glow of the 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.270
 glitter is in fact given because 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.530
 just remains a bit in the relief and the 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.000
 facet is really more beautiful as 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.760
 you can see why the brilliance of the 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.710
 drittel remains now my fingernail is 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.340
 also done badly if there is little 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.780
 because I really have to do them again and there 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.720
 let's see how it's done then 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.850
 first of all you will need a sealed e 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.399
 without dispersion it is not possible 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.340
 do this with the sealant 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:16.859
 with dispersion because it comes to 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.840
 give a surface of minor adhesion 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:22.859
 so anyway you can do it but it will have 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.600
 a duration slightly less than 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:27.840
 unlike going to do it with a 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.000
 sealer instead with without la 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.520
 dispersion just as I told you before 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.619
 we will need some glitter in ours 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.659
 favorite color I recommend that they be 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.959
 very fine because the effect will be more 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.909
 nice and or point sealant and without 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.250
 then dispersion once created 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.500
 our nail structure will not have to 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.720
 do nothing but go and spread the sit 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.819
 in front and without dispersion over all 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.819
 the nail surface for good 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.670
 check that it is perfectly in 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.830
 all the nail because so lives anyway 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:13.160
 thieves have it perfectly in all 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:13.160
 surface July ok 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.040
 then take the glitter on 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.710
 advice to put under a factor 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.840
 this way the glitter that will fall on it 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.440
 you can also reuse them by replacing them 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.480
 there in the jar and you do it 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.360
 fall in a lot of rain 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.960
 abundant because we want one anyway 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.940
 beautiful covered surface 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.640
 don't worry you have been boarded because 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.400
 anyway then we'll go clean 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.930
 I also recommend it well in its corners 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.500
 otherwise when we see the nail 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.390
 by the end it will be ugly to see why 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.860
 will not be perfectly covered with 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.780
 glitter 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.910
 well even in the point after which yes 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.680
 just go for a pose depending on the 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.050
 request of our seals others without 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.180
 dispersion that can go from the two 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.440
 in short, minutes to four minutes depends 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.440
 from the brand you use 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.910
 our lance time ended 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.310
 will stay with the other brush to do 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:23.840
 that go to the various access criteria 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:26.830
 in the round cuticles obviously is also 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.830
 on the nail 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.890
 as I told you before the leak remains 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.709
 relief therefore it is not one 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.730
 decoration for all tastes because 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:43.040
 some can't stand this thing has 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.709
 certainly with a little longer duration 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.590
 limited will not last you anyway 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.989
 month is however also the whole 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.610
 subjective because it also depends on how much 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.870
 you want to use the sleeves like it 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.340
 used 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.079
 it is however a very decoration 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:02.360
 pretty to the sugar effect is really 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:05.090
 very nice and if it happens that in short yes 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.160
 ruin and repeat the bill you'll have to either 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.670
 however, park the surface 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.489
 go and already existing glitter you will put back 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.840
 refer to the gel without dispersion e 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:18.260
 you will still have yours, however 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.620
 decoration in shape I hope the videos 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:25.360
 it was helpful if you enjoyed it 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.360
 I am sending a big leap badged
