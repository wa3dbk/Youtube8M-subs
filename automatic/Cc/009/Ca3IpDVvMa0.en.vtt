00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello youtube people how are all 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.340
 hehe good bad more or less I hope that 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.030
 are well today I will talk about a boat 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.670
 alive hehe good let's go the maximum was 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.850
 a steam ship of 1,300 tons that 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.550
 he had vancouver based excellent ship 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.439
 it was clad in steel precisely 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.369
 to face without problems the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.580
 navigation through the Arctic zones on 1 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.430
 October 1931 got caught in the 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.980
 ice at the height of wayne dicten alaska 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.309
 carrying a valuable cargo of skins 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.379
 in your hold if the ice masses 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.050
 they continued to exert maximum pressure 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.629
 it ran the risk of being destroyed so 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.239
 which the captain decided to camp 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.640
 on land and wait for the desert the ship 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.270
 began to have a life of its own on day 2 of 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.489
 November 1931 when a sudden 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.649
 storm caused the elevation of the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.800
 temperature and released to the maximum of 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.290
 skies or at least that's what it 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.120
 presumed the blizzard lasted three days 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.580
 during which 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.880
 who was camping on land had zero 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.130
 visibility and after those 72 hours 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.980
 they discovered that the maximum was no longer 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.260
 where they had left the next thing that 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.630
 it was known it was information coming from 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.360
 an Eskimo hunter who claimed to have 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.390
 seen the boat almost 50 miles to 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.910
 south of its initial position in view of 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.920
 the crew was present at 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.680
 the place and with the help of a gang 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.290
 Eskimo managed to recover much 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.750
 of the load but when returning from one of the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.750
 download trips were found with 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.090
 that the maximum had disappeared five 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.730
 months later he was seen again 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.170
 this time in the vicinity of the island 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:54.150
 h for the summer of 1932 was approached 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.890
 by a group of gambusinos who 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.040
 reported that the ship was in 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.050
 perfect state however a few 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.200
 days was no longer in the position 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.630
 informed because I did not approach it and take it 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.550
 to port that is what must be 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.819
 thought the Eskimos who saw it 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.790
 pass in front of point way 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.830
 1933 30 people came in boats 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.350
 small and managed to reach the vice 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.450
 Chinese but apparently the ship no longer 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.750
 I wanted to be governed by a crew 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.390
 human just put and concealed a 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.270
 tremendous blizzard broke out and remained 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.300
 for about 10 days preventing any 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.920
 ship control maneuver 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.700
 finally the Eskimos surrendered 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.600
 after losing three men by freezing 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.390
 landed on an iceberg and 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:47.070
 they abandoned the maximum to their fate almost 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.200
 immediately the blizzard ceased in 1934 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.510
 was approached by the crew of the 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.340
 schooner bring that he was limited to verify 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.440
 that the ship was in good 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.840
 conditions and then left it as 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.330
 was when an airplane tried to 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.880
 locate it in the position reported by 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.209
 the schooner the maximum had already fled the 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.030
 area from there in more would be seen year after 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.300
 year by Eskimo whalers and ships 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:16.200
 merchant the last documented approach 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.250
 was made in 1939 when another 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.020
 vessel approached him 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.780
 his crew managed to set foot in 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.240
 cover as it could not be otherwise 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.630
 way a tempest that cut 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.070
 your intentions to tow it agreement 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.950
 They then returned to their ship and 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.900
 they checked out the time passed and the reports 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.690
 of sightings of the maximum 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.650
 they multiplied the last of them dating from 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.870
 March 1956 when it was the footwear 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.750
 sailing north in the sea of 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.910
 Beaufort with direction so firm that 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.980
 lookout that saw him he thought he was 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.010
 manned until he verified with 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.440
 binoculars that nobody was on board 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.930
 by that date I had been almost 25 years 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.300
 sailing unmanned and he watching 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.480
 firmly all attempt to be taken to 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.060
 port hehe I would say that is the boat 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.040
