numbers<00:04:06.879> you<00:04:07.879> will<00:04:07.969> add<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.450> numbers<00:04:08.780> in<00:04:08.930> the

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
numbers you will add the numbers in the

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.770 
numbers you will add the numbers in the
diagonal<00:04:09.980> columns<00:04:10.670> putting<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.239> answer<00:04:11.599> at

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
diagonal columns putting the answer at

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:28.379 
diagonal columns putting the answer at

your<00:04:28.990> answer<00:04:29.469> is<00:04:34.199> 3420<00:04:35.229> I<00:04:35.409> will<00:04:36.159> repeat<00:04:36.490> the

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
your answer is 3420 I will repeat the

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.519 
your answer is 3420 I will repeat the
problem<00:04:36.969> one<00:04:37.120> more<00:04:37.150> time<00:04:37.539> so<00:04:37.930> you<00:04:37.960> can<00:04:38.259> see<00:04:38.409> the

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:38.529 
problem one more time so you can see the

00:04:38.529 --> 00:05:00.220 
problem one more time so you can see the
process<00:04:38.770> again
