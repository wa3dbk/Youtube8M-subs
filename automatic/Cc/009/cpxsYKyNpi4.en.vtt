00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:14.919
 I cash and I am very happy I 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.109
 dance we go to 15 miles so 30 bb 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:18.550
 well it's a little bit better but hey 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.929
 remaining stocks with which we can 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.400
 absolutely not afford for example 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:23.589
 decided to raise all hands 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.400
 even less tables that 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:31.169
 competent as this one is in to a 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.370
 player he limped ut I have more a 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.500
 so I took seven dwarves actually I 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.420
 have I have another occurrence whose 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.100
 in this tournament where there is a player who 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.199
 lime like his hut and g1 is on the button 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.360
 I fold juan of suite and while 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.980
 I would have had to isolate it and I 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.059
 taken this occurrence there to show 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.379
 that this time I do them I have 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.399
 thought good there anyway this because 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.500
 I have to say to myself so I know that my 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.000
 attention has been to let's say 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.550
 particularly captivated by this 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.309
 beautiful hand but it's for you 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.750
 to say that you really have to really keep 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.429
 keep an eye on all votes so that's it 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.420
 it's going to be questions disposition I 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:02.649
 think I 'll make a point on the 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.770
 table layouts during the 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.900
 sessions for the mtt in another 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.939
 video but you have to be able to 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.500
 spot in the eye in a second if a 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.290
 cuddly player peace and if you have a 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.229
 hand for the for the iso why am I saying 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.960
 that because clearly the small stoma 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.159
 here when he guesses who sends us 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.409
 really a kind of triple a fake 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.060
 good already he's out of position against 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.110
 we are at the first raid button game 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.579
 we are going to have broken we will be able 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.590
 use our position to win 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.939
 horses second thing he imsa 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.770
 prove it's a rather weak player 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.090
 clearly there are no our players 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.369
 who did not know part of the lines 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.659
 winners is passivity to his 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.430
 more pure form 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.920
 it's through passivity that makes 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.500
 progress or win poker chips 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.210
 of tournament clearly so we know 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.399
 second info we have obviously a student 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.270
 on this player is a passive player so 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.100
 we will be able to use it 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.759
 on the post flop also for 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.920
 grab a few chips 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.289
 additional and finally the fact that it 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.090
 book it's not necessary to get up the 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.689
 the vast majority of the time it is 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.909
 has a trash 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.850
 at best he has a little coquette and 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.930
 obviously there are some obscure 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.479
 occurrence where he will take us out the aces 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.590
 or a first but two strong but the 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.849
 mostly game 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.819
 you have no illusions they have 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.230
 just a good a good little merguez 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.610
 in hand and they do not know how the 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.440
 play then suddenly they hymn with 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.700
 for crazy lyme plan where what is 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.459
 not bad also lyme school will try 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.239
 to hit a flop or abandon it here 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.980
 we still do a third 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.269
 reason to isolate if he has a weak hand 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.650
 we know we will be able to do it 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.930
 give up at least two-thirds of the 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.799
 time on the flop and in addition to that recover 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.750
 the preflop blow 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.400
 so brief all these reasons to say 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.410
 that the poor where there are limpers these 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.239
 despots one must systematically see 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.220
 is systematically thinking do I 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.959
 iso here because it's the spots that 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.209
 represents a very important lift 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.680
 for the player there are more in a v 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.000
 spot like that only in a blind flight 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.110
 simple and you know that the theft of 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.630
 blinds that's one of the things the 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.760
 more important who are really like 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.769
 like the other oxygen to survive what 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.450
 in a tournament that lasts a long time 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.040
 a spot that will isolate a spot you 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.840
 can iso a player do the cuma 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.209
 weak in being in position this is 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.980
 clearly to a printing machine 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.230
 tickets just waiting for you for 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.319
 press the button so here I take 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.549
 the spot of gizo a good amount here I 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.319
 am on the button with a good hand so 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.760
 I really allow myself to make a 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.139
 not very expensive amount because limit 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.450
 here it does not bother me to leave him a 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.489
 let the end made me become 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.590
 russia is to improve on the flop since 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.720
 in fact if he puts the 1300 he goes already m 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.790
 taxes there's going to be a pot for three 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.200
 thousand ha he will have five thousand left and 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.970
 a few so short i'm not going to have 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.549
 too much trouble to take him a lot 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.549
 tokens or just to see him photo
