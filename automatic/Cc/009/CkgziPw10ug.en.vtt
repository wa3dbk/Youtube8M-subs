00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.990
 january dear angel friends hello from one 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.639
 a few of them are paying tribute today 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:15.120
 tell a little about vegetables 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:17.039
 although they all need me and I start 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:24.900
 here with a few things 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:28.849
 We were here to handle 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:35.329
 pedal wing normal time 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:38.670
 and then proved the consort of many 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.710
 Of course, she also uses essential oils 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:49.399
 super herbert at the feed and one 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:52.710
 freshly ground and I unfortunately 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:56.640
 harmless the bag from the mutated 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.670
 angel lending and that is 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.250
 Of course, stronger than the normal anise 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.350
 which many know 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.270
 the manufacturer was already the name 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.070
 is usually pretty much raised 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.430
 is large as from many make such a 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.850
 a bit bony to paint 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.979
 and they are very good for example 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.509
 The winter food so I want there too 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.540
 do not give up and tell because 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.869
 the other things we have and 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.880
 Although in film specialty shops you can 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.229
 buy both once ground and 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.329
 immensely to the times of the safe 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.670
 want to save the painting but who one 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.240
 more intensive bruchhagen wants the power 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.299
 are 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.310
 coriander or fennel or others 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.560
 things themselves because that's a lot 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.700
 intensive 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.740
 Furthermore, you can also mixes 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.610
 make from fennel anise coriander 72 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.799
 hear grad 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.500
 shake the three parts in a box 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.520
 and has a good channel locker for 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.320
 over stones 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:09.690
 you can also do it with us 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:12.239
 you have to try it and then you can 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.500
 a very good spice mix a lot and 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:19.760
 I also have a lot of success with that 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.870
 it is also of companies ready-made 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.530
 buy assorted spice mix 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.220
 for red eyes for bream but 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.760
 mainly with it and acts 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.160
 and you must then try the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.280
 further you can, for example, feed the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.140
 spices are still in intensive or 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.620
 be another odor by 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.290
 small amounts of food over it 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.450
 argues and brings into the water 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.920
 That's for sure poplar came 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.840
 there is not much left in it 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.129
 Germany needs that very much or 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.519
 physically everything like a spice mixture 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:02.069
 it is said is sharp but it is 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.650
 actually not that which can already 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.870
 a lot of times and also around 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.360
 had success 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.290
 there are also all these spices in it 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.870
 only that means corrie of the other gives 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:20.010
 It also never strengthens that under 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:23.010
 The dummy also makes a very good profit 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.110
 Add or stop turmeric that is called 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.230
 for coloring food and is very 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.290
 intense like 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.819
 you have to try it 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.000
 just right that just like that 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.640
 not just so deep feed something 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.400
 to refine if it can be done by 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.760
 the under prince but many spices 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.680
 are also good for the stomach 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.019
 Pinky, for example, in a plant high to 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.090
 give and above all things is so 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.750
 if you maybe at the top 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.670
 has watched many, for example, their feed 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.739
 have done touched with sewage 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.739
 then take on the slope fed the lay 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:05.040
 one knows the wiesbadener feed and in the 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:07.440
 Demand and ppv are running around with things 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.750
 suppose so and so can exactly 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.150
 you can make this beautiful for example 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.340
 Example grief if you have the zbm day 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.900
 before that you have to pack the then 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.519
 not only you but other odor 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.560
 just another driver 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.970
 this should be many already known 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.979
 that's exactly how it is here 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.360
 if, for example, the private me 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.430
 as for example like to make a 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.610
 Teaspoon bold with admits for is one 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.010
 other high and you take too 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.300
 Very good and the fish like that in the 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.850
 winter before all things we bring 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.880
 one or two fish texters 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:41.340
 just as little as coriander 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.310
 or anise or here for example what is 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.090
 already someone good film kelz lining 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.010
 do it yourself 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.020
 I have talked to me about it but 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.590
 my spice mix special 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.539
 holiday year to the 4000 here 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.990
 listed with cinnamon coriander fennel 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:00.360
 and at the sternanis and there we have 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.680
 of course just as good because I am now 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.200
 for example, not so bad of 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.810
 continue from fanta a pile of course 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.580
 no bag the goods special 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.190
 the men of plastics box 4 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.650
 liter age, there is the only way you can 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.750
 spices or attractants good process 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.490
 is also good if you caster 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.700
 for example, over several weeks 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.650
 We hold a fridge 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.630
 Make is ideal too 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.880
 That's why I'm like that now 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.280
 changed a bit to these courses 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.750
 here because besides spices the man 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.520
 even makes a longer time 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:35.090
 hold and the raw material not so 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.099
 lost quickly 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:41.430
 yes I have those cans but also in 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:44.740
 smaller from 55 millimeters and there you have 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.550
 always this 50 milliliters 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.020
 additional taxes so that the world 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.640
 together to sprinkle over the fodder 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.960
 yes, in any case, still can 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.340
 many more educated 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.080
 but I have somehow too 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.900
 environment is limited because it is for me 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.630
 I have to get along here there is 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.900
 certainly many many things that 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.910
 we can still use and I have 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.850
 also tried a lot for many things but 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.900
 then you have read a report though 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.790
 we really only need a few 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.720
 That's why I think everyone has to go there 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.240
 know yourself 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.610
 100 boxes of various sizes in the cabinet 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.440
 has or maybe the five to ten 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.290
 which should actually be sufficient 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.500
 and then let's say it to us 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:32.120
 have a new topic here something 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:35.830
 tell about sweeteners then we say 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.830
 I'll see you later
