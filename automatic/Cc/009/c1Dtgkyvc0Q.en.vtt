00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 hey people today i show you as we do 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:10.849
 the gas is attached to the engine so 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.849
 you have to go here 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.550
 here's the two opening not 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.380
 it with the white lever on it but the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.760
 black with the black rubber 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:27.449
 then you just take the rubber off then 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.300
 Write the whole time so then 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.070
 is you this mistake 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.739
 then you stand just once all out 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:40.559
 what's in there then we have here 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:43.410
 These two parts share this needle and these 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.370
 in the days and then with me it works 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.680
 now out 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.910
 nevertheless such a black part and that 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.020
 I now hold just to the 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.020
 armor out 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:13.930
 so here that is a bit ready so 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:16.750
 then there's the little and 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.520
 you have to take the big ones there 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.660
 now everything is in the row 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.460
 after again trÃ¼ber first here the 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.890
 comets then here are actually 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:37.470
 two parts 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:37.470
 he is that here then this is the pen 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:02:01.210
 and then you have again 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:02.619
 this little part in and wait now 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.990
 I'll do this for the first time 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:20.230
 then just stuck from below like this 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:23.430
 that's right and that's the best thing to do 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.430
 the washer is clean 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:48.630
 then it was all about that 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:48.630
 is just like that 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:06.120
 here will neither screwdrivers 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:07.819
 key but with the hand through 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.659
 has to moor again afterwards 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.659
 yes then that's clear 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:27.230
 so finished the rubber and if you 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.030
 then after or later that time 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:35.750
 operator then you have to do that 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:37.720
 here comes on it tram train and then there 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.010

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.010
