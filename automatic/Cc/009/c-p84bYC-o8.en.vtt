job<00:01:29.640> now<00:01:29.909> let's<00:01:30.090> switch<00:01:30.299> sides<00:01:30.329> because<00:01:30.780> we

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
job now let's switch sides because we

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.539 
job now let's switch sides because we
want<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.170> balance<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.560> out<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.250> know<00:01:32.340> most

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
want to balance it out so I know most

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.130 
want to balance it out so I know most
people<00:01:32.909> right<00:01:33.090> handed<00:01:33.570> they're<00:01:33.869> going<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.049> be

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
people right handed they're going to be

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.870 
people right handed they're going to be
better<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.560> right<00:01:34.710> side<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.460> we<00:01:35.610> really

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
better on the right side so we really

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.550 
better on the right side so we really
have<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.240> do<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.659> left<00:01:36.869> side<00:01:37.049> because<00:01:37.290> we<00:01:37.409> want

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
have to do the left side because we want

have to do the left side because we want
to<00:01:37.619> create<00:01:37.740> some<00:01:38.100> balance<00:01:38.520> because<00:01:39.150> it's

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
to create some balance because it's

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.120 
to create some balance because it's
really<00:01:39.450> going<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.720> help<00:01:39.840> your<00:01:40.020> stride<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.950> keep

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
balance left and right so right leg

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.340 
balance left and right so right leg
steps<00:01:44.250> forward<00:01:44.820> throws<00:01:45.509> with<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.780> left<00:01:46.079> side

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
steps forward throws with the left side

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.920 
steps forward throws with the left side
follow<00:01:47.159> through<00:01:47.549> excellent<00:01:48.450> good<00:01:48.570> job<00:01:48.780> let's

good<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.810> you're<00:01:51.960> getting<00:01:52.079> good<00:01:52.320> power<00:01:52.619> you're

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
good so you're getting good power you're

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.160 
good so you're getting good power you're
learning<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.789> how<00:01:54.210> far<00:01:54.539> you<00:01:54.719> throw<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.079> how

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
learning that how far you throw in how

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.990 
learning that how far you throw in how
hard<00:01:55.439> do<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.680> throw<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.100> lot<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.610> times<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:56.969> a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
hard do you throw a lot of times is a

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.460 
hard do you throw a lot of times is a
product<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.420> what's<00:01:57.659> going<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.229> legs

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
product of what's going on with the legs

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.039 
product of what's going on with the legs
so<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.130> whole<00:01:59.280> long<00:01:59.579> anatomy<00:02:00.180> chain<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.689> that

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
so the whole long anatomy chain of that

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.139 
so the whole long anatomy chain of that
left<00:02:01.350> leg<00:02:01.560> into<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:02.039> right<00:02:02.220> arm<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.909> pretty

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
left leg into that right arm it's pretty

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.669 
left leg into that right arm it's pretty
much<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.390> exact<00:02:03.810> same<00:02:04.020> thing<00:02:04.259> that's<00:02:04.380> what's

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
much the exact same thing that's what's

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:06.620 
much the exact same thing that's what's
going<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.070> when<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.369> run<00:02:05.610> because<00:02:06.329> what<00:02:06.539> our

going on when you run because what our

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.779 
going on when you run because what our
left<00:02:06.869> leg<00:02:06.960> does<00:02:07.350> our<00:02:07.829> right<00:02:08.130> arm<00:02:08.160> does<00:02:08.550> and

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
left leg does our right arm does and

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.160 
left leg does our right arm does and
vice<00:02:08.970> versa<00:02:09.269> makes<00:02:09.660> for<00:02:09.810> every<00:02:09.959> sense

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
vice versa makes for every sense

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.720 
vice versa makes for every sense
excellent<00:02:10.709> all<00:02:10.830> right<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.310> now<00:02:11.459> we're<00:02:11.640> going
