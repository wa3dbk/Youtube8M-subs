00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 jo info here at the start and I will be you 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.930
 explain a little secret today where you are 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.790
 we could drive the best today 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.290
 with a small group on the way and 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.300
 we just looked at where 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.130
 best hatcheries are at the start or where 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.379
 you can walk just the best and we 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.090
 are on the bottom line 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.630
 he just came that best 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.369
 for this 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.740
 We were on moon and on the venus 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.920
 have both looked at us where we am 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.300
 Top notes could could go as 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.070
 But then they are really on the back 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.610
 earth come back to the well-known 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.840
 Loaded space behind the plane goes yard 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.219
 whatever you want to call it 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.530
 behind the witch by the building through 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.239
 there are simply the best places or 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.640
 In our opinion, this is the best 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.760
 Driver's place is simply unbeatable 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.440
 at top spot much faster than at 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.539
 others like moon can 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.670
 to do that with a contested version 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.860
 but you have to stop 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.800
 let then re-tension the 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.840
 In the frame are then but it was 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.780
 but quite difficult to clarify something 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.189
 on the earth it is also like that 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.170
 in between times crass events so the 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.689
 actually only has to turn around and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.979
 in the event of masses thereby you have 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.780
 Of course, such a bonus again 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.810
 there, of course, the event with get 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.880
 and by the way also in the world am 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.840
 let start 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.580
 Of course you have to pay attention to that 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.380
 she does not stand too close to the hurdle 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.060
 if you are a few meters behind 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.250
 come instead of eight opponents just times 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.820
 three opponents from the damned cattle 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.799
 I kind of like me exactly 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.240
 and that would of course be allowed to speak 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.189
 or shoot the players when they are 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.860
 standing too close to the stage that they hold 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.540
 she comes back to you 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.380
 make it easy for them to do it with 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.549
 to tighten and 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.710
 Of course you can also do yours 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.289
 armor parts or weapons there extreme 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.360
 you should level well as well 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.670
 Note that the mobs are fresh when they are 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.560
 At the spot all exceptions are killed 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.320
 have been of you so that they still 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.369
 all in the cave should still spur 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.840
 you if you play with others 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.090
 together plays the gamblers out 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.520
 Pay attention that no one on the cover or in 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.590
 the cover is or is then 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.090
 no pugs are spurred that is 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.950
 also with this distance of course 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.929
 the helaba 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.989
 My conclusion of the day was then I have 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.560
 Two levels packed had close to 15 blue ones 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.269
 diagrams but also three legendary ones 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.640
 it's fun but it's just 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.890
 quite time consuming and then you have 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.870
 of course, no desire to be honest 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.060
 what would be different to play so 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.099
 it is recommended no idea you are 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.989
 a quarter of an hour ran bauer then goes 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.599
 your back played online game so 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.400
 play pvp or dect travel or play 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.140
 strike to balance that bit 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.530
 but you can not be extreme either 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.910
 level well and have fun there then it was 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.440
 that again on my part I hope so 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.829
 you liked and you could 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.870
 little bit of what the video starts with 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.700
 the video if it helped you further 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.620
 has and weight comment if you still 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.100
 Suggestions have what you naturally better 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.160
 do 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.940
 so or for example your things you 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.870
