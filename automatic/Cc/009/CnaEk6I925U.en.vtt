00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
when we practice without really getting

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.889 
when we practice without really getting
very<00:00:56.219> much<00:00:56.399> done<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.149> without<00:00:57.329> really

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
very much done and without really

to achieve in our practice time then we

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.140 
to achieve in our practice time then we
can<00:01:07.140> make<00:01:07.320> sure<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.650> AB<00:01:07.770> practice<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.490> really

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
can make sure that AB practice is really

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.910 
can make sure that AB practice is really
going<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.330> have<00:01:09.510> an<00:01:09.630> impact<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.350> us<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.890> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
going to have an impact on us as a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.679 
going to have an impact on us as a
player<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.700> not<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:11.909> about<00:01:12.240> how<00:01:12.479> much

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
player so it's not just about how much

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.020 
player so it's not just about how much
you<00:01:12.930> practice<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.560> more<00:01:14.100> about<00:01:14.340> how<00:01:14.549> smart

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
you practice it's more about how smart

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.760 
you practice it's more about how smart
you<00:01:15.240> practice<00:01:15.659> let's<00:01:16.140> have<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> look<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:16.650> how

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
you practice let's have a look at how

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.890 
you practice let's have a look at how
you<00:01:16.830> can<00:01:17.280> make<00:01:17.460> your<00:01:17.880> practice<00:01:18.090> time<00:01:18.509> really

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
you can make your practice time really

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.790 
you can make your practice time really
can

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
can

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.890 
can
the<00:01:21.800> first<00:01:22.100> step<00:01:22.400> is<00:01:22.700> to<00:01:23.030> imagine<00:01:23.450> that<00:01:23.600> you

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
the first step is to imagine that you

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.420 
the first step is to imagine that you
are<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.080> guitar<00:01:24.500> player<00:01:24.800> of<00:01:24.950> your<00:01:25.100> dreams

what would you do how would you play

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.610 
what would you do how would you play
what<00:01:28.880> would<00:01:29.030> be<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.330> core<00:01:29.810> elements<00:01:30.440> that

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
what would be the core elements that

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.030 
what would be the core elements that
made<00:01:31.100> up<00:01:31.280> 75<00:01:32.240> to<00:01:32.570> 80<00:01:32.780> percent<00:01:32.990> of<00:01:33.530> your

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
made up 75 to 80 percent of your
