good<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.670> minecrafter<00:00:06.270> than<00:00:06.390> here<00:00:06.569> you<00:00:06.660> go<00:00:06.779> on

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
good a minecrafter than here you go on

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.049 
good a minecrafter than here you go on
steve-o<00:00:07.319> here<00:00:07.590> with<00:00:07.740> another<00:00:07.920> video<00:00:08.100> today<00:00:08.910> I

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
steve-o here with another video today I

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.940 
steve-o here with another video today I
want<00:00:09.270> to<00:00:09.389> talk<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.290> little<00:00:10.410> bit<00:00:10.620> about<00:00:10.710> the

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
want to talk a little bit about the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.879 
want to talk a little bit about the
signs<00:00:11.190> of<00:00:11.490> Minecraft<00:00:12.230> mostly<00:00:13.230> focusing<00:00:13.770> on

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
signs of Minecraft mostly focusing on

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.540 
signs of Minecraft mostly focusing on
gravity<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:15.080> so<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.110> was<00:00:16.230> wondering<00:00:16.550> because

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
gravity and so I was wondering because

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.130 
gravity and so I was wondering because
playing<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.000> little<00:00:18.150> bit<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.420> TNTs<00:00:18.840> you<00:00:19.020> can

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
playing a little bit of TNTs you can

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.310 
playing a little bit of TNTs you can
probably<00:00:19.289> tell<00:00:19.410> from<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:20.300> larger<00:00:21.320> upsetting

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
probably tell from the larger upsetting

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.259 
probably tell from the larger upsetting
fortress<00:00:23.279> I've<00:00:23.429> built<00:00:23.609> myself<00:00:23.789> I'm<00:00:24.179> not

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
fortress I've built myself I'm not

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.009 
fortress I've built myself I'm not
really<00:00:24.419> a<00:00:24.539> fortress<00:00:24.990> but<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.289> am<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.919> playground

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:27.019 
really a fortress but I am a playground

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.739 
really a fortress but I am a playground
and<00:00:28.640> so<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.669> wanted<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.119> talk<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.419> little<00:00:30.539> bit

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:30.749 
and so I wanted to talk a little bit

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.290 
and so I wanted to talk a little bit
about<00:00:31.009> gravity<00:00:32.009> nagger<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.700> not<00:00:33.090> just

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
about gravity nagger this is not just

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.480 
about gravity nagger this is not just
gravity<00:00:33.660> 14<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.320> T<00:00:34.500> because<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:35.310> i<00:00:35.340> was

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:35.490 
gravity 14 and T because it's what i was

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.580 
gravity 14 and T because it's what i was
thinking<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:35.790> originally<00:00:36.329> but<00:00:36.930> gravity<00:00:37.320> for

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
thinking of originally but gravity for

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.709 
thinking of originally but gravity for
players<00:00:38.309> like<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.879> speed<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.180> gravity<00:00:39.539> sort

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
players like the speed of gravity sort

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.810 
players like the speed of gravity sort
of<00:00:39.780> thing<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.230> also<00:00:40.680> for<00:00:41.039> items<00:00:41.489> when<00:00:41.699> you

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
of thing and also for items when you

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
of thing and also for items when you
throw<00:00:42.059> them<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.420> like<00:00:42.600> if<00:00:42.719> i<00:00:42.809> was<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:42.989> throw<00:00:43.890> my

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
throw them so like if i was to throw my

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.500 
throw them so like if i was to throw my
furnace<00:00:45.980> how<00:00:46.980> long<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.309> would<00:00:47.820> take<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.090> for

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
furnace how long it would take to for

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.420 
furnace how long it would take to for
things<00:00:48.930> like<00:00:49.019> that<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.980> first<00:00:50.219> thing<00:00:50.370> i

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
things like that so first thing i

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.189 
things like that so first thing i
measured<00:00:50.789> was<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.269> player<00:00:51.510> falling<00:00:51.960> speed

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
measured was the player falling speed

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.220 
measured was the player falling speed
now<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.340> my<00:00:53.579> i<00:00:54.329> use<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.840> for<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.079> lot<00:00:55.170> of

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
now this is my i use this for a lot of

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.130 
now this is my i use this for a lot of
my<00:00:55.379> testing<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.609> my<00:00:56.850> my<00:00:57.239> tower<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.750> sorts

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
my testing this is my my tower of sorts

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.750 
my testing this is my my tower of sorts
and<00:00:59.629> from<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.050> tested<00:01:01.440> my<00:01:01.710> tnt<00:01:01.920> mostly<00:01:02.519> but

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
and from this I tested my tnt mostly but

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.880 
and from this I tested my tnt mostly but
I<00:01:02.969> also<00:01:03.269> jumped<00:01:03.780> off<00:01:03.899> at<00:01:04.110> various<00:01:04.500> points<00:01:04.680> i

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
I also jumped off at various points i

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.280 
I also jumped off at various points i
jumped<00:01:05.190> off<00:01:05.280> from<00:01:05.640> up<00:01:06.060> here<00:01:06.360> which<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.690> a<00:01:06.720> 90

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
jumped off from up here which is a 90

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.640 
jumped off from up here which is a 90
meter<00:01:08.070> mark<00:01:08.480> there's<00:01:09.480> 90<00:01:09.810> meter<00:01:09.990> mark<00:01:10.260> here

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
meter mark there's 90 meter mark here

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.280 
meter mark there's 90 meter mark here
which<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.550> 90<00:01:11.850> blocks<00:01:12.120> for<00:01:12.960> those<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.200> you

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
which is 90 blocks for those of you

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.740 
which is 90 blocks for those of you
weren't<00:01:13.590> aware<00:01:13.830> one<00:01:14.820> block<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.360> about<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
weren't aware one block is about the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.690 
weren't aware one block is about the
equivalent<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.260> one<00:01:16.440> meter<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:17.240> Minecraft<00:01:18.590> or

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
equivalent to one meter in Minecraft or

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.950 
equivalent to one meter in Minecraft or
it<00:01:20.700> was<00:01:20.760> at<00:01:21.290> 1.09<00:01:22.290> yards<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.400> think<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.700> is

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
it was at 1.09 yards I think it is

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.390 
it was at 1.09 yards I think it is
something<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.680> wrote<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.220> down<00:01:26.250> in

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
something like that I wrote it down in

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.560 
something like that I wrote it down in
there<00:01:26.700> i<00:01:26.760> forgot<00:01:27.450> now<00:01:27.690> though<00:01:27.870> but<00:01:28.290> um

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
there i forgot now though but um

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.730 
there i forgot now though but um
essentially<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:30.660> a<00:01:30.750> player<00:01:30.990> was<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.350> jump<00:01:31.590> off

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
essentially if a player was to jump off

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.720 
essentially if a player was to jump off
of<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:33.500> he<00:01:34.500> would<00:01:34.620> fall<00:01:34.950> with<00:01:35.550> an

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
of here he would fall with an

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.510 
of here he would fall with an
acceleration<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.510> 13<00:01:37.470> blocks<00:01:37.800> per<00:01:38.070> second

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
acceleration of 13 blocks per second

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.300 
acceleration of 13 blocks per second
that's<00:01:39.360> um<00:01:39.600> based<00:01:40.050> on<00:01:40.260> a<00:01:40.290> lot<00:01:40.440> of<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.590> number<00:01:41.220> of

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
that's um based on a lot of a number of

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.310 
that's um based on a lot of a number of
calculations<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:42.060> are<00:01:42.210> made<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:43.020> players

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
calculations that are made so players

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.770 
calculations that are made so players
full<00:01:43.620> at<00:01:43.770> 13<00:01:44.250> blocks<00:01:44.430> per<00:01:44.670> second<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.540> for

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
full at 13 blocks per second so for

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.590 
full at 13 blocks per second so for
example<00:01:45.810> if<00:01:46.410> I<00:01:46.710> was<00:01:46.920> not<00:01:47.310> for<00:01:47.520> example<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.120> if

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
example if I was not for example but if

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.170 
example if I was not for example but if
I<00:01:48.840> was<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.230> jump<00:01:49.710> off<00:01:49.890> here<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.730> side<00:01:50.940> life

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
I was to jump off here the side life

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.850 
I was to jump off here the side life
wasn't<00:01:51.420> lit<00:01:51.660> worth<00:01:51.810> living<00:01:52.170> anymore<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.620> diet

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
wasn't lit worth living anymore and diet

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.980 
wasn't lit worth living anymore and diet
twenty<00:01:53.730> four<00:01:53.940> blocks<00:01:54.240> because<00:01:54.510> twenty<00:01:54.840> four

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
twenty four blocks because twenty four

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.330 
twenty four blocks because twenty four
blocks<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.320> obviously<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.650> maximum<00:01:56.160> for<00:01:56.280> a

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
blocks is obviously the maximum for a

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.180 
blocks is obviously the maximum for a
player<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.550> jump<00:01:56.850> off<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.750> if<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.930> was<00:01:58.190> anything

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
player to jump off but if I was anything

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.950 
player to jump off but if I was anything
above<00:01:59.580> twenty<00:01:59.880> four<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.210> can<00:02:00.360> you<00:02:00.540> jump<00:02:00.810> off

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
above twenty four you can you jump off

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.130 
above twenty four you can you jump off
and<00:02:01.110> die<00:02:01.290> sort<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.620> things<00:02:01.770> sorry<00:02:02.690> 24<00:02:03.690> kill<00:02:04.020> you

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
and die sort of things sorry 24 kill you

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.410 
and die sort of things sorry 24 kill you
but<00:02:04.950> if<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.190> was<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.430> jump<00:02:05.640> off<00:02:05.820> at<00:02:06.000> twenty<00:02:06.240> four

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
but if I was to jump off at twenty four

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.800 
but if I was to jump off at twenty four
blocks<00:02:06.750> when<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.590> hit<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:07.860> ground<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.340> died<00:02:08.810> I

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
blocks when I hit the ground and died I

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.860 
blocks when I hit the ground and died I
would<00:02:10.259> have<00:02:10.349> hit<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.619> ground<00:02:10.830> at<00:02:11.870> an

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
would have hit the ground at an

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.289 
would have hit the ground at an
acceleration<00:02:13.379> of<00:02:13.609> 22.4<00:02:14.609> eight<00:02:14.819> blocks<00:02:15.060> per

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
acceleration of 22.4 eight blocks per

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.930 
acceleration of 22.4 eight blocks per
second<00:02:15.780> with<00:02:16.349> the<00:02:16.439> velocity<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:16.920> 21.8

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
second with the velocity of 21.8

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.210 
second with the velocity of 21.8
lakhs<00:02:18.060> per<00:02:18.240> second<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:19.500> I'm<00:02:19.560> using<00:02:19.770> blocks<00:02:20.100> per

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
lakhs per second so I'm using blocks per

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.830 
lakhs per second so I'm using blocks per
second<00:02:20.520> is<00:02:20.580> my<00:02:20.700> main<00:02:20.910> measurement<00:02:21.420> because

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
second is my main measurement because

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.870 
second is my main measurement because
it's<00:02:22.080> fairly<00:02:22.530> Universal<00:02:23.190> we<00:02:23.400> all<00:02:23.550> know<00:02:23.700> what

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
it's fairly Universal we all know what

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.750 
it's fairly Universal we all know what
blocks<00:02:24.120> are<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:25.190> basically<00:02:26.190> when<00:02:26.460> you<00:02:26.550> fall

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
blocks are and basically when you fall

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.340 
blocks are and basically when you fall
down<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:27.000> block<00:02:27.300> it<00:02:27.480> kind<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.930> makes<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.200> lot<00:02:28.320> more

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
down a block it kind of makes a lot more

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.130 
down a block it kind of makes a lot more
sense<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.920> in<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.640> sense<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:29.940> Minecraft<00:02:30.360> so

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
sense the in the sense of Minecraft so

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.410 
sense the in the sense of Minecraft so
that's<00:02:31.590> some<00:02:31.890> one<00:02:32.340> aspect<00:02:32.760> so<00:02:33.120> that's<00:02:33.240> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
that's some one aspect so that's the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.510 
that's some one aspect so that's the
player<00:02:33.630> I'll<00:02:34.110> leave<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.380> full<00:02:34.800> write-up<00:02:35.250> in<00:02:35.430> the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
write-up on my findings and such so you

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.680 
write-up on my findings and such so you
can<00:02:43.410> check<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.220> information<00:02:44.910> yourself<00:02:45.360> if

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
can check the information yourself if

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.320 
can check the information yourself if
you'd<00:02:45.840> like<00:02:45.990> anyway<00:02:46.860> next<00:02:47.220> let's<00:02:47.610> move<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.910> TNT

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
you'd like anyway next let's move to TNT

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.030 
you'd like anyway next let's move to TNT
now<00:02:49.080> as<00:02:49.230> we<00:02:49.380> know<00:02:49.500> TNT<00:02:50.010> has<00:02:50.360> four<00:02:51.360> seconds<00:02:52.110> four

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
now as we know TNT has four seconds four

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.940 
now as we know TNT has four seconds four
seconds<00:02:53.370> before<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:53.970> blows<00:02:54.120> up<00:02:54.180> so<00:02:55.170> that's<00:02:55.560> 40

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
seconds before it blows up so that's 40

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.730 
seconds before it blows up so that's 40
ticks<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:57.630> I've<00:02:57.720> got<00:02:57.930> here<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:58.320> rigged<00:02:58.560> up

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
ticks and so I've got here it rigged up

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.490 
ticks and so I've got here it rigged up
this<00:02:59.220> will<00:02:59.400> light<00:02:59.580> up<00:02:59.700> exactly<00:03:00.270> as<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:01.350> blows

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
this will light up exactly as it blows

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.150 
this will light up exactly as it blows
up<00:03:01.770> as<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.310> can<00:03:02.400> see<00:03:02.630> so<00:03:03.630> but<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.680> falling

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
up as you can see so but the falling

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.060 
up as you can see so but the falling
distance<00:03:05.580> for<00:03:05.790> TNT<00:03:06.240> on<00:03:06.900> with<00:03:07.590> those<00:03:07.770> four

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
distance for TNT on with those four

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.190 
distance for TNT on with those four
seconds<00:03:08.580> was<00:03:09.240> something<00:03:09.600> that<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.840> wondered

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
seconds was something that I wondered

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.980 
seconds was something that I wondered
about<00:03:10.580> so<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:11.640> place<00:03:11.880> tnt<00:03:12.300> at<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.450> very<00:03:12.630> top<00:03:12.780> and

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
about so I place tnt at the very top and

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.210 
about so I place tnt at the very top and
you<00:03:13.080> can<00:03:13.110> probably<00:03:13.350> guess<00:03:13.500> from<00:03:13.710> the<00:03:13.920> red

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
you can probably guess from the red

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.010 
you can probably guess from the red
where<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.970> explosion<00:03:15.450> was<00:03:15.660> but<00:03:15.810> i'll<00:03:15.870> show

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
where the explosion was but i'll show

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.500 
where the explosion was but i'll show
you<00:03:16.080> again<00:03:16.350> anyway<00:03:16.710> because<00:03:17.010> it's<00:03:17.190> cool<00:03:17.580> then

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
you again anyway because it's cool then

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.500 
you again anyway because it's cool then
TNT's<00:03:18.990> fun<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.350> blow<00:03:19.500> up<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:20.340> that<00:03:21.120> red<00:03:21.330> mark

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
TNT's fun to blow up so that red mark

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.360 
TNT's fun to blow up so that red mark
right<00:03:21.870> in<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.050> very<00:03:22.170> middle<00:03:22.440> is<00:03:22.650> where<00:03:22.709> team

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
right in the very middle is where team

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.010 
right in the very middle is where team
the<00:03:23.610> TNT<00:03:23.970> went<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.890> before<00:03:25.890> it<00:03:27.020> completely

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
the TNT went to before it completely

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.140 
the TNT went to before it completely
exploded<00:03:29.750> as<00:03:30.830> you<00:03:31.830> can<00:03:31.920> see<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:32.280> engulfed<00:03:32.970> the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
exploded as you can see it engulfed the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.130 
exploded as you can see it engulfed the
red<00:03:33.300> completely<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:35.250> red<00:03:35.520> was<00:03:36.120> right<00:03:36.989> on<00:03:37.110> the

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
red completely the red was right on the

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.729 
red completely the red was right on the
money<00:03:37.320> and<00:03:37.670> so<00:03:38.670> this<00:03:39.450> is<00:03:39.720> just<00:03:39.959> my<00:03:40.110> gauge<00:03:40.410> to

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
money and so this is just my gauge to

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.990 
money and so this is just my gauge to
see<00:03:40.920> where<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.640> explosion<00:03:41.910> for<00:03:43.610> TNT<00:03:44.610> was<00:03:44.760> that

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
see where the explosion for TNT was that

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.440 
see where the explosion for TNT was that
which<00:03:45.989> was<00:03:46.250> 73<00:03:47.250> blocks<00:03:47.580> like<00:03:47.880> I<00:03:47.970> think<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.269> said

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
which was 73 blocks like I think I said

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.370 
which was 73 blocks like I think I said
a<00:03:48.480> minute<00:03:48.720> ago<00:03:48.840> now<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:50.720> acceleration<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.870> TNT

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
a minute ago now the acceleration of TNT

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.560 
a minute ago now the acceleration of TNT
falling<00:03:52.860> is<00:03:54.920> 4.5<00:03:55.920> six<00:03:56.280> blocks<00:03:56.670> per<00:03:56.850> second<00:03:57.269> so

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
falling is 4.5 six blocks per second so

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.449 
falling is 4.5 six blocks per second so
it<00:03:57.840> falls<00:03:58.050> down<00:03:58.230> at<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.739> rate<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:58.950> four<00:03:59.250> point

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
it falls down at a rate of four point

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.390 
it falls down at a rate of four point
five<00:03:59.670> six<00:03:59.940> blocks<00:04:00.180> per<00:04:00.360> second<00:04:00.750> and<00:04:01.220> so<00:04:02.220> when

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
five six blocks per second and so when

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.240 
five six blocks per second and so when
it<00:04:02.519> reached<00:04:02.910> its<00:04:03.120> final<00:04:03.560> velocity<00:04:04.560> here<00:04:04.980> when

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
it reached its final velocity here when

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.600 
it reached its final velocity here when
it<00:04:05.400> exploded<00:04:05.820> and<00:04:06.239> it<00:04:06.810> was<00:04:06.959> moving<00:04:07.320> at<00:04:07.610> 18.25

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
it exploded and it was moving at 18.25

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.680 
it exploded and it was moving at 18.25
blocks<00:04:09.300> for<00:04:09.480> a<00:04:09.510> second<00:04:11.090> so<00:04:12.090> that's<00:04:12.480> pretty

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
blocks for a second so that's pretty

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.140 
blocks for a second so that's pretty
cool<00:04:13.519> probably<00:04:14.519> useless<00:04:14.850> piece<00:04:15.120> of

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
cool probably useless piece of

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.610 
cool probably useless piece of
information<00:04:15.420> but<00:04:15.870> it's<00:04:15.989> pretty<00:04:16.140> pretty<00:04:16.440> cool

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
information but it's pretty pretty cool

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.000 
information but it's pretty pretty cool
nonetheless<00:04:16.830> and<00:04:17.750> so<00:04:18.750> here's<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:19.049> basic<00:04:19.440> tnt

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
nonetheless and so here's a basic tnt

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.520 
nonetheless and so here's a basic tnt
cannon<00:04:20.040> now<00:04:21.000> we<00:04:21.060> can<00:04:21.359> use<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:22.200> falling

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
cannon now we can use the falling

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.260 
cannon now we can use the falling
business<00:04:22.800> obviously<00:04:22.919> whatever<00:04:23.310> knowing

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
business obviously whatever knowing

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.719 
business obviously whatever knowing
physics<00:04:24.780> can<00:04:24.990> help<00:04:25.169> us<00:04:25.320> obviously<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:26.100> one

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
physics can help us obviously the one

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.580 
physics can help us obviously the one
aspect<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.240> physics<00:04:27.570> is<00:04:27.690> it's<00:04:28.020> fused<00:04:28.380> time

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
aspect of physics is it's fused time

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.710 
aspect of physics is it's fused time
it's<00:04:28.770> four<00:04:29.010> seconds<00:04:29.460> so<00:04:30.120> we<00:04:30.210> can<00:04:30.300> use<00:04:30.360> it<00:04:30.510> not

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
it's four seconds so we can use it not

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.790 
it's four seconds so we can use it not
only<00:04:30.840> for<00:04:31.140> falling

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
only for falling

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.230 
only for falling
but<00:04:32.280> for<00:04:33.139> maximizing<00:04:34.139> at<00:04:34.259> our<00:04:34.620> TNT<00:04:35.009> fuse<00:04:35.460> so

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
but for maximizing at our TNT fuse so

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.059 
but for maximizing at our TNT fuse so
what<00:04:36.629> i've<00:04:36.720> done<00:04:36.870> here<00:04:36.930> is<00:04:37.199> i've<00:04:37.379> added<00:04:37.560> the

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
what i've done here is i've added the

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.369 
what i've done here is i've added the
fuse<00:04:38.310> 239<00:04:39.060> I<00:04:39.270> could<00:04:39.479> have<00:04:39.539> done<00:04:39.690> 39<00:04:40.169> in<00:04:40.319> the

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:40.379 
fuse 239 I could have done 39 in the

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.710 
fuse 239 I could have done 39 in the
hospital<00:04:40.889> ER<00:04:40.979> with<00:04:41.099> a<00:04:41.190> piston<00:04:41.580> but<00:04:42.270> it's<00:04:42.479> at

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
hospital ER with a piston but it's at

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.379 
hospital ER with a piston but it's at
the<00:04:42.840> moment<00:04:43.080> it's<00:04:43.169> only<00:04:43.319> 39<00:04:43.770> tick<00:04:44.599> go<00:04:45.599> i<00:04:47.389> fuse

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
the moment it's only 39 tick go i fuse

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.879 
the moment it's only 39 tick go i fuse
at<00:04:49.169> which<00:04:49.409> point<00:04:49.440> it<00:04:49.830> will<00:04:49.889> explode<00:04:50.370> and<00:04:50.909> fire

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
at which point it will explode and fire

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.899 
at which point it will explode and fire
and<00:04:52.889> hit<00:04:53.069> them<00:04:53.220> all<00:04:54.560> good<00:04:55.560> old<00:04:55.710> 10<00:04:56.250> t<00:04:56.460> ken<00:04:56.669> and<00:04:56.819> i

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:56.909 
and hit them all good old 10 t ken and i

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:59.899 
and hit them all good old 10 t ken and i
love<00:04:57.090> them<00:04:57.240> so<00:04:58.020> that<00:04:58.199> was<00:04:58.349> a<00:04:58.379> tnt<00:04:59.220> so<00:04:59.460> I<00:04:59.490> tested

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
love them so that was a tnt so I tested

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:03.619 
love them so that was a tnt so I tested
tnt<00:05:00.360> quite<00:05:00.569> a<00:05:00.599> bit<00:05:00.840> because<00:05:01.349> it's<00:05:01.620> fun<00:05:01.740> and<00:05:02.629> I

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:03.629 
tnt quite a bit because it's fun and I

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:05.600 
tnt quite a bit because it's fun and I
lost<00:05:03.840> a<00:05:03.990> lot<00:05:04.169> then<00:05:04.949> I<00:05:04.979> was<00:05:05.159> wondering<00:05:05.550> about

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
lost a lot then I was wondering about

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.740 
lost a lot then I was wondering about
items<00:05:06.150> and<00:05:06.560> amended<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.620> items<00:05:07.979> dropped<00:05:08.750> and

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
items and amended the items dropped and

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.540 
items and amended the items dropped and
so<00:05:09.870> I<00:05:09.900> did<00:05:10.080> my<00:05:10.349> first<00:05:10.530> test<00:05:10.830> was<00:05:11.039> to<00:05:11.190> see<00:05:11.219> which

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
so I did my first test was to see which

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.839 
so I did my first test was to see which
dropped<00:05:11.909> faster<00:05:13.069> items<00:05:14.069> in<00:05:14.280> this<00:05:14.400> chest<00:05:14.699> I've

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
dropped faster items in this chest I've

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.939 
dropped faster items in this chest I've
got<00:05:15.030> four<00:05:15.569> wall<00:05:15.780> and<00:05:16.879> I<00:05:17.879> noticed<00:05:18.270> i<00:05:18.949> forgotten

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
got four wall and I noticed i forgotten

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.999 
got four wall and I noticed i forgotten
block<00:05:20.219> drops<00:05:20.789> off<00:05:20.969> that<00:05:21.900> but<00:05:22.349> I<00:05:22.409> did<00:05:22.800> notice

00:05:22.999 --> 00:05:23.009 
block drops off that but I did notice

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:25.790 
block drops off that but I did notice
that<00:05:23.190> draw<00:05:23.669> our<00:05:23.879> items<00:05:24.419> dropped<00:05:25.020> a<00:05:25.139> lot<00:05:25.319> faster

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
that draw our items dropped a lot faster

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.550 
that draw our items dropped a lot faster
and<00:05:26.009> so<00:05:26.729> then<00:05:26.909> I<00:05:26.940> was<00:05:27.150> curious<00:05:27.449> how<00:05:27.750> fast<00:05:28.050> items

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
and so then I was curious how fast items

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.559 
and so then I was curious how fast items
did<00:05:28.830> drop<00:05:29.069> so<00:05:29.610> in<00:05:29.729> order<00:05:29.819> to<00:05:29.909> that<00:05:30.150> I<00:05:30.180> put<00:05:30.539> a

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:30.569 
did drop so in order to that I put a

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:32.450 
did drop so in order to that I put a
block<00:05:30.810> in<00:05:30.960> front<00:05:30.990> of<00:05:31.229> here<00:05:31.440> so<00:05:31.740> the<00:05:32.159> item<00:05:32.370> would

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
block in front of here so the item would

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.610 
block in front of here so the item would
go<00:05:32.610> straight<00:05:32.669> down<00:05:32.909> and<00:05:33.389> likewise<00:05:34.259> with<00:05:34.469> these

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
go straight down and likewise with these

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.749 
go straight down and likewise with these
ones<00:05:34.860> and<00:05:35.129> found<00:05:36.090> out<00:05:36.330> that<00:05:36.990> items<00:05:37.490> based<00:05:38.490> on<00:05:38.729> a

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 
ones and found out that items based on a

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:42.430 
ones and found out that items based on a
number<00:05:39.120> of<00:05:39.300> headache<00:05:40.229> like<00:05:40.650> calculations

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
number of headache like calculations

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.059 
number of headache like calculations
turned<00:05:43.440> out<00:05:43.770> to<00:05:44.310> be<00:05:44.900> worth<00:05:45.900> it<00:05:46.169> eight<00:05:46.770> point

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:47.069 
turned out to be worth it eight point

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:49.730 
turned out to be worth it eight point
five<00:05:47.310> blocks<00:05:47.669> four<00:05:47.909> seconds<00:05:48.270> acceleration<00:05:48.930> so

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
five blocks four seconds acceleration so

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.540 
five blocks four seconds acceleration so
um<00:05:50.360> yeah<00:05:51.360> I<00:05:51.539> didn't<00:05:51.750> bother<00:05:52.349> with<00:05:52.620> the<00:05:52.830> put<00:05:53.460> the

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
um yeah I didn't bother with the put the

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.740 
um yeah I didn't bother with the put the
velocities<00:05:53.969> and<00:05:54.150> stuff<00:05:54.330> i'll<00:05:54.509> put<00:05:54.630> all<00:05:54.719> my

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
velocities and stuff i'll put all my

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.920 
velocities and stuff i'll put all my
findings<00:05:55.319> in<00:05:55.590> the<00:05:55.770> document<00:05:56.419> and<00:05:57.419> you<00:05:57.779> can

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
findings in the document and you can

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.019 
findings in the document and you can
check<00:05:58.110> that<00:05:58.169> out<00:05:58.349> if<00:05:58.529> you're<00:05:58.979> curious<00:05:59.610> about

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:00.029 
check that out if you're curious about

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:02.689 
check that out if you're curious about
the<00:06:00.599> velocity<00:06:01.199> and<00:06:01.379> such<00:06:01.620> like<00:06:01.650> that<00:06:02.009> but<00:06:02.580> yeah

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
the velocity and such like that but yeah

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:05.149 
the velocity and such like that but yeah
eight<00:06:03.599> point<00:06:03.900> five<00:06:04.139> blocks<00:06:04.469> per<00:06:04.620> second<00:06:05.009> so<00:06:05.099> to

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
eight point five blocks per second so to

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:07.879 
eight point five blocks per second so to
recap<00:06:05.449> players<00:06:06.449> full<00:06:06.870> a<00:06:06.900> 13<00:06:07.440> blocks<00:06:07.650> per

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
recap players full a 13 blocks per

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:13.909 
recap players full a 13 blocks per
