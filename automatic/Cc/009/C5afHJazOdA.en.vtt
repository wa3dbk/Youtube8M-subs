that's the way I see it but no on his
team<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:38.340> shedinja<00:00:38.790> does<00:00:39.360> actually<00:00:39.629> look<00:00:40.110> a

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
team that shedinja does actually look a

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.920 
team that shedinja does actually look a
bit<00:00:40.559> threatening<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.640> his<00:00:42.450> team<00:00:42.750> in

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
bit threatening and just his team in

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.930 
bit threatening and just his team in
hole<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.379> gonna<00:00:43.620> be<00:00:43.829> pretty<00:00:44.670> annoying

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
hole is gonna be pretty annoying

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.729 
hole is gonna be pretty annoying
cuz<00:00:45.239> he<00:00:45.329> does<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.629> decent<00:00:45.960> synergy<00:00:46.410> together

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
cuz he does have decent synergy together

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.860 
cuz he does have decent synergy together
and<00:00:47.039> he<00:00:47.670> plays<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.059> right<00:00:48.270> he<00:00:48.570> can<00:00:48.719> go<00:00:48.840> off

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
and he plays it right he can go off

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.750 
and he plays it right he can go off
amazingly<00:00:49.530> he<00:00:49.739> does<00:00:49.890> have<00:00:50.039> no<00:00:50.190> spinner<00:00:50.550> though

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
amazingly he does have no spinner though

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.069 
amazingly he does have no spinner though
but<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:50.940> guess<00:00:51.090> he<00:00:51.210> has<00:00:51.300> ought<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.840> make<00:00:51.960> up

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
but I guess he has ought to to make up

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.830 
but I guess he has ought to to make up
for<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.410> but<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.860> mean<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.059> main<00:00:54.210> thing<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.480> do<00:00:54.660> is

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
for it but I mean the main thing I do is

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.750 
for it but I mean the main thing I do is
give<00:00:54.989> her<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.230> Zhou<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.710> ASAP<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.610> then

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
give her that Zhou to ASAP and then

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.700 
give her that Zhou to ASAP and then
focus<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.270> shedinja<00:00:57.510> because<00:00:58.079> if<00:00:58.469> he

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
focus on that shedinja because if he

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.110 
focus on that shedinja because if he
takes<00:00:58.859> down<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.250> right<00:00:59.399> amount<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.760> Pokemon

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
takes down the right amount of Pokemon

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.209 
takes down the right amount of Pokemon
at<00:01:00.210> my<00:01:00.329> end<00:01:00.570> I'm<00:01:01.559> just<00:01:01.800> gonna<00:01:01.920> get<00:01:02.070> destroyed

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
at my end I'm just gonna get destroyed

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.460 
at my end I'm just gonna get destroyed
so<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.359> make<00:01:03.600> sure<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.780> watch<00:01:04.140> what<00:01:04.350> he<00:01:04.439> does

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
so I just make sure I watch what he does

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.050 
so I just make sure I watch what he does
properly<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:05.460> shouldn't<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:05.850> too<00:01:06.030> much

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
properly and I shouldn't have too much

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.990 
properly and I shouldn't have too much
trouble<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.689> general<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:08.460> know<00:01:08.909> can

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
trouble in general but you know can

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.910 
trouble in general but you know can
always<00:01:09.060> happen<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.689> leaves<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.110> his<00:01:10.140> end<00:01:10.560> I

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
always happen but leaves on his end I

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.010
