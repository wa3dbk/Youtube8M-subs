00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.289
 is hidden in the middle of nowhere and it 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.130
 a dream between homes 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.130

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.250
 the dry channel 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.570

 Andalusian dog ' 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.110

 and its drums and drums that are like 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.420
 I have said before the soul and the heart of 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.750
 this town 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.720
 I propose that they sound and resolve with all 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.170
 its strength so that that spirit and those 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.420
 beats reach the confines of the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.320
 universe 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.980
 where they say that the call broke 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.300
 big band 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:30.210
 that they say was the beginning of everything 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.510
 but scientists are wrong because 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.970
 the real big-bang 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.600
 an authentic explosion that originated the 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.830
 universe 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.070
 is here in calanda 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.590
 in the gigantic explosion of all 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.930
 drums and all the drums together 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:54.790
 this is an explosion 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.020
 that they learn from the balls if what 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.450
 I feel right now is not the 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.250
 happiness is a lot like that and if 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.560
