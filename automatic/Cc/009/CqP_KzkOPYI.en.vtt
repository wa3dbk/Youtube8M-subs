people<00:00:17.770> are<00:00:18.220> smarter<00:00:18.820> than<00:00:18.850> the<00:00:19.330> British

because the British people no matter how

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
dark it is no matter how rainy it gets

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.460 
dark it is no matter how rainy it gets
they<00:00:25.720> don't<00:00:25.900> do<00:00:25.990> in<00:00:26.110> the<00:00:26.200> headlights<00:00:26.500> on<00:00:28.470> which

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
they don't do in the headlights on which

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.410 
they don't do in the headlights on which
is<00:00:29.620> beyond<00:00:30.010> me<00:00:30.220> I<00:00:30.370> honestly<00:00:30.730> thought<00:00:31.090> that<00:00:31.150> was

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
is beyond me I honestly thought that was

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.400 
is beyond me I honestly thought that was
something<00:00:31.570> that<00:00:31.720> was<00:00:31.930> like<00:00:32.290> not<00:00:32.800> done<00:00:33.160> in

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
something that was like not done in

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.660 
something that was like not done in
advanced<00:00:35.410> Caucasian<00:00:36.040> countries<00:00:36.430> you<00:00:36.640> know

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
advanced Caucasian countries you know

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.220 
advanced Caucasian countries you know
driving<00:00:37.090> in<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:37.390> dark<00:00:37.570> rain<00:00:37.930> with<00:00:38.110> their

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
driving in the dark rain with their

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.270 
driving in the dark rain with their
headlights<00:00:38.530> off<00:00:38.770> I<00:00:38.920> thought<00:00:39.070> that<00:00:39.190> was

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
headlights off I thought that was

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.830 
headlights off I thought that was
something<00:00:39.370> that<00:00:39.520> only<00:00:39.790> like<00:00:40.210> places<00:00:40.809> like

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
something that only like places like

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.470 
something that only like places like
Vietnam<00:00:41.340> did<00:00:42.449> but<00:00:43.449> no

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.770 

oh<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:24.580> for<00:01:24.880> those<00:01:24.970> of<00:01:25.150> you<00:01:25.270> they<00:01:25.390> don't<00:01:25.420> know

I don't for those of you they don't know

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.800 
I don't for those of you they don't know
this<00:01:28.780> is<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.530> worst<00:01:30.210> weather<00:01:31.210> to<00:01:31.390> be<00:01:31.420> riding

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
this is the worst weather to be riding

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.130 
this is the worst weather to be riding
in<00:01:31.930> for<00:01:32.170> not<00:01:32.470> only<00:01:32.650> because<00:01:33.010> of<00:01:33.250> visibility

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
in for not only because of visibility

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.820 
in for not only because of visibility
but<00:01:35.140> because<00:01:35.470> of<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:36.369> light<00:01:37.330> light<00:01:37.780> rain<00:01:38.140> is<00:01:38.410> the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
but because of a light light rain is the

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.310 
but because of a light light rain is the
slipperiest<00:01:39.310> so<00:01:40.119> you<00:01:40.180> have<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:41.020> greatest

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
slipperiest so you have the the greatest

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
slipperiest so you have the the greatest
chance<00:01:41.740> of<00:01:42.690> losing<00:01:43.690> traction<00:01:44.110> in<00:01:44.380> like<00:01:44.619> wiping

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
chance of losing traction in like wiping

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.340 
chance of losing traction in like wiping
out<00:01:45.520> or<00:01:45.820> braking<00:01:46.300> hard<00:01:46.330> and<00:01:46.780> losing<00:01:47.140> traction

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
out or braking hard and losing traction

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.530 
out or braking hard and losing traction
with<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:47.830> going<00:01:48.070> down<00:01:48.280> in<00:01:48.490> this<00:01:48.970> kind<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:49.330> rain

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
with and going down in this kind of rain

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.350 
with and going down in this kind of rain
in<00:01:49.780> pouring<00:01:50.770> rain<00:01:50.800> you're<00:01:51.580> you<00:01:52.000> actually<00:01:52.270> have

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
in pouring rain you're you actually have

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.020 
in pouring rain you're you actually have
much<00:01:53.229> more<00:01:53.470> traction<00:01:53.800> than<00:01:53.979> you<00:01:54.190> do<00:01:54.340> in<00:01:54.520> a<00:01:54.550> very

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
much more traction than you do in a very

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.710 
much more traction than you do in a very
light<00:01:55.479> misty<00:01:56.320> type<00:01:56.560> rain<00:01:56.830> and<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:59.170> guess

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
light misty type rain and you guess

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.390 
light misty type rain and you guess
the<00:02:01.500> reason<00:02:01.860> being<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.430> that<00:02:03.860> with<00:02:04.860> with<00:02:05.130> just

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
the reason being is that with with just

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.130 
the reason being is that with with just
a<00:02:05.460> little<00:02:05.610> bit<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.970> rain<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.600> kind<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.020> goes

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
a little bit of rain it kind of goes

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.440 
a little bit of rain it kind of goes
into<00:02:07.440> the<00:02:07.560> road<00:02:08.070> and<00:02:08.100> then<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.820> brings<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.149> oil

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
into the road and then it brings the oil

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.980 
into the road and then it brings the oil
like<00:02:09.840> like<00:02:10.320> car<00:02:10.649> oils<00:02:11.160> up<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.730> surface

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
like like car oils up to the surface

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.840 
like like car oils up to the surface
because<00:02:12.990> there's<00:02:13.200> like<00:02:13.680> oil<00:02:14.070> from<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.430> car<00:02:14.700> is

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
because there's like oil from the car is

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.910 
because there's like oil from the car is
it<00:02:15.000> seeps<00:02:15.570> into<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.870> road<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.650> when<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:16.800> get

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
it seeps into the road and when you get

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.290 
it seeps into the road and when you get
a<00:02:16.950> light<00:02:17.190> rain<00:02:17.460> it<00:02:17.670> kind<00:02:17.850> of<00:02:17.880> goes<00:02:17.970> into<00:02:18.210> the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
a light rain it kind of goes into the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.210 
a light rain it kind of goes into the
rain<00:02:18.540> goes<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.170> water<00:02:19.440> goes<00:02:19.680> down<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:20.160> it

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
rain goes the water goes down and it

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.540 
rain goes the water goes down and it
pushes<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.640> oils<00:02:20.970> up<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:22.310> she<00:02:23.310> had<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.430> nice

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
pushes the oils up and she had a nice

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.290 
pushes the oils up and she had a nice
butt<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.600> but<00:02:25.200> with<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:26.010> heavy<00:02:26.340> rain<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:27.090> does

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
butt and but with a heavy rain it does

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.700 
butt and but with a heavy rain it does
the<00:02:27.450> same<00:02:27.660> thing<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:28.050> brings<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.290> oils<00:02:28.560> out

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
the same thing it brings the oils out

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.260 
the same thing it brings the oils out
but<00:02:28.950> hopefully<00:02:29.520> if<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.670> rains<00:02:29.820> heavy<00:02:30.030> enough

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
but hopefully if the rains heavy enough

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.510 
but hopefully if the rains heavy enough
it'll<00:02:30.540> just<00:02:30.840> wash<00:02:31.140> them<00:02:31.350> off<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.710> side<00:02:31.950> so

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
it'll just wash them off to the side so

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.720 
it'll just wash them off to the side so
you<00:02:32.550> fur<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:34.230> even<00:02:34.890> with<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> heavy<00:02:35.250> rain<00:02:35.490> for

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
you fur so even with a heavy rain for

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.860 
you fur so even with a heavy rain for
the<00:02:35.760> first<00:02:35.820> couple<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.390> minutes<00:02:36.660> that<00:02:36.720> it

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
the first couple of minutes that it

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.930 
the first couple of minutes that it
starts<00:02:37.110> raining<00:02:37.290> then<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.459> road<00:02:38.670> becomes

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
starts raining then the road becomes

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.030 
starts raining then the road becomes
much<00:02:39.540> more<00:02:39.780> slippery<00:02:40.110> but<00:02:40.680> then<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.830> few

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
much more slippery but then a few

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.460 
much more slippery but then a few
minutes<00:02:41.220> later<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:42.180> those<00:02:42.840> oils<00:02:43.140> get<00:02:43.260> washed

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
minutes later that those oils get washed

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.720 
minutes later that those oils get washed
to<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.709> side<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.100> road<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.550> then<00:02:44.640> it

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
to the side of the road and then it

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.449 
to the side of the road and then it
becomes<00:02:44.940> less<00:02:45.180> slippery<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:46.280> but<00:02:47.280> when<00:02:47.400> you

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
becomes less slippery so but when you

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.730 
becomes less slippery so but when you
got<00:02:47.550> like<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.790> fine<00:02:48.090> mist<00:02:48.360> like<00:02:48.630> this<00:02:48.840> it's<00:02:49.470> not

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
got like a fine mist like this it's not

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.500 
got like a fine mist like this it's not
ever<00:02:50.070> going<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.430> be<00:02:50.520> enough<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.970> like<00:02:51.120> wash

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
ever going to be enough to like wash

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.150 
ever going to be enough to like wash
anything<00:02:51.870> off<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.350> road<00:02:52.560> it's<00:02:52.770> just<00:02:52.950> going<00:02:53.130> to

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
anything off the road it's just going to

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.000 
anything off the road it's just going to
make<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:54.240> road<00:02:54.420> stamp<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.020> that's<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.560> which
