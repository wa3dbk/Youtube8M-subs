at all so it's kind of interesting I
just<00:02:02.359> want<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:02.570> make<00:02:02.689> this<00:02:02.869> point<00:02:03.170> of<00:02:03.469> a<00:02:03.859> lot<00:02:04.399> of

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
just want to make this point of a lot of

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.039 
just want to make this point of a lot of
times<00:02:04.700> people<00:02:04.939> will<00:02:05.119> send<00:02:05.450> me<00:02:05.539> a<00:02:05.570> video<00:02:05.750> and

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
times people will send me a video and

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.680 
times people will send me a video and
they'll<00:02:06.170> be<00:02:06.289> like<00:02:06.320> I'm<00:02:06.649> so<00:02:07.189> stuck<00:02:07.909> I<00:02:08.119> cannot

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
they'll be like I'm so stuck I cannot

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.059 
they'll be like I'm so stuck I cannot
180<00:02:09.229> no<00:02:09.590> matter<00:02:10.009> what<00:02:10.399> it<00:02:10.789> is<00:02:11.300> so<00:02:11.569> hard<00:02:12.080> nuttin

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
180 no matter what it is so hard nuttin

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.199 
180 no matter what it is so hard nuttin
not<00:02:13.219> saying<00:02:13.400> that's<00:02:13.609> what<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.849> were<00:02:13.939> saying

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
not saying that's what you were saying

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.199 
not saying that's what you were saying
because<00:02:14.359> you<00:02:14.540> weren't<00:02:14.719> but<00:02:15.349> um<00:02:15.760> yeah<00:02:16.760> I<00:02:17.060> just

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
because you weren't but um yeah I just

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.839 
because you weren't but um yeah I just
think<00:02:17.599> it's<00:02:17.749> interesting<00:02:17.930> because<00:02:18.489> it's<00:02:19.489> not

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
think it's interesting because it's not

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.849 
think it's interesting because it's not
actually<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.659> trick<00:02:20.989> they<00:02:21.200> think<00:02:21.620> they're

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:21.859 
actually the trick they think they're

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:24.280 
actually the trick they think they're
stuck<00:02:22.189> on<00:02:22.459> that<00:02:22.790> they're<00:02:22.999> stuck<00:02:23.299> on<00:02:23.510> but<00:02:24.139> it's

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
stuck on that they're stuck on but it's

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.679 
stuck on that they're stuck on but it's
actually<00:02:24.439> an<00:02:24.739> earlier<00:02:25.219> trick<00:02:25.760> like<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:26.599> was

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 
actually an earlier trick like I was

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.660 
actually an earlier trick like I was
saying<00:02:26.780> if<00:02:27.079> you<00:02:27.200> had<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.409> better<00:02:27.799> Ali's<00:02:28.400> and

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
saying if you had the better Ali's and

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.429 
saying if you had the better Ali's and
you<00:02:28.760> could<00:02:28.909> pop<00:02:29.150> up<00:02:29.180> drag<00:02:29.780> your<00:02:29.930> foot<00:02:30.109> up<00:02:30.290> and

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:30.439 
you could pop up drag your foot up and

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.129 
you could pop up drag your foot up and
level<00:02:31.129> you're<00:02:31.340> bored<00:02:31.639> out<00:02:31.819> in<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.120> air<00:02:32.299> then

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:33.139 
level you're bored out in the air then

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:36.280 
level you're bored out in the air then
you're<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:34.250> much<00:02:34.730> more<00:02:35.209> likely<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.659> be<00:02:35.930> able<00:02:36.019> to

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
you're so much more likely to be able to

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.179 
you're so much more likely to be able to
do<00:02:36.409> the<00:02:36.560> 180<00:02:36.950> that<00:02:37.250> it's<00:02:37.400> not<00:02:37.549> even<00:02:37.879> funny<00:02:38.180> so

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:39.189 
do the 180 that it's not even funny so

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:41.860 
do the 180 that it's not even funny so
yeah<00:02:40.189> just<00:02:40.549> want<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.090> make<00:02:41.180> that<00:02:41.359> totally

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
yeah just want to make that totally

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.360 
yeah just want to make that totally
clear<00:02:42.139> so<00:02:42.319> your<00:02:42.439> first<00:02:42.650> step<00:02:42.799> is<00:02:43.099> to<00:02:43.129> actually

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
clear so your first step is to actually

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.270 
clear so your first step is to actually

ride to the skate park ride to your
school<00:03:00.889> wherever<00:03:01.329> cool<00:03:02.329> so<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.900> next<00:03:03.049> thing

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:03.169 
school wherever cool so the next thing

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:05.559 
school wherever cool so the next thing
is<00:03:03.319> it<00:03:03.829> is<00:03:03.949> the<00:03:04.099> 180<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:04.639> is<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.879> frontside<00:03:05.269> 180

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
is it is the 180 it is the frontside 180

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:06.909 
is it is the 180 it is the frontside 180
so<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:05.959> difference<00:03:06.109> between<00:03:06.260> frontside<00:03:06.769> and

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:06.919 
so the difference between frontside and

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:10.209 
so the difference between frontside and
backside<00:03:06.980> is<00:03:07.519> back<00:03:08.000> side<00:03:08.269> you<00:03:08.900> see<00:03:09.199> it's<00:03:10.010> like

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:10.219 
backside is back side you see it's like

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.179 
backside is back side you see it's like
when<00:03:10.459> I<00:03:10.489> am<00:03:10.909> midway<00:03:11.540> through<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:11.930> 180<00:03:12.290> at<00:03:12.590> a<00:03:12.650> 90

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189 
when I am midway through the 180 at a 90

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.449 
when I am midway through the 180 at a 90
degree<00:03:13.219> rotation<00:03:13.519> about<00:03:14.239> right<00:03:14.659> there<00:03:15.109> then<00:03:16.069> I

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
degree rotation about right there then I

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.030 
degree rotation about right there then I
can't<00:03:16.730> see<00:03:16.909> where<00:03:17.090> I'm<00:03:17.120> going<00:03:17.540> my<00:03:18.079> back<00:03:19.009> is

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
can't see where I'm going my back is

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.949 
can't see where I'm going my back is
facing<00:03:19.549> the<00:03:19.849> direction<00:03:20.030> I'm<00:03:20.389> going<00:03:20.419> and<00:03:20.840> that

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
facing the direction I'm going and that

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.619 
facing the direction I'm going and that
is<00:03:21.109> back<00:03:21.349> side<00:03:21.620> front<00:03:22.489> side<00:03:22.669> my<00:03:23.060> front<00:03:23.419> would

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
is back side front side my front would

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.270 
is back side front side my front would
be<00:03:23.780> facing<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.290> direction<00:03:24.409> I'm<00:03:24.769> going<00:03:24.829> and

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
be facing the direction I'm going and

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.330 
be facing the direction I'm going and
for<00:03:26.150> that<00:03:26.269> exact<00:03:26.870> reason<00:03:27.019> right<00:03:27.530> there<00:03:27.560> I<00:03:27.979> feel

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
for that exact reason right there I feel

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.939 
for that exact reason right there I feel
like<00:03:28.459> front<00:03:28.819> side<00:03:29.030> is<00:03:29.299> easier<00:03:29.870> it<00:03:30.139> is<00:03:30.560> an

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:30.949 
like front side is easier it is an

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:33.369 
like front side is easier it is an
easier<00:03:31.370> direction<00:03:32.090> because<00:03:32.389> you<00:03:32.659> can<00:03:32.840> see

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
easier direction because you can see

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.080 
easier direction because you can see
where<00:03:33.620> you're<00:03:33.739> going<00:03:33.769> you<00:03:34.340> can<00:03:34.519> watch<00:03:34.759> things

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
where you're going you can watch things

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.759 
where you're going you can watch things
and<00:03:35.599> it<00:03:35.689> just<00:03:35.959> to<00:03:36.919> me<00:03:37.069> learning<00:03:37.939> that<00:03:38.689> way<00:03:39.349> just

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
and it just to me learning that way just

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.689 
and it just to me learning that way just
seems<00:03:40.099> a<00:03:40.370> bit<00:03:40.549> less<00:03:40.939> complex<00:03:41.479> so<00:03:42.349> yeah<00:03:42.949> it's<00:03:43.639> a

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
seems a bit less complex so yeah it's a

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:46.509 
seems a bit less complex so yeah it's a
lot<00:03:43.849> easier<00:03:44.379> so<00:03:45.379> definitely<00:03:45.739> let's<00:03:45.979> learn<00:03:46.340> it

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
lot easier so definitely let's learn it

going<00:03:58.069> to<00:03:58.159> learn<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.549> frontside<00:03:58.939> 180<00:03:59.269> so<00:03:59.509> it

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
going to learn the frontside 180 so it

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:01.959 
going to learn the frontside 180 so it
is<00:03:59.750> it<00:03:59.900> pop<00:04:00.169> and<00:04:00.500> then<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.459> turn<00:04:01.639> your<00:04:01.849> head

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:01.969 
is it pop and then you turn your head

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:04.539 
is it pop and then you turn your head
and<00:04:02.120> shoulders<00:04:02.299> and<00:04:02.840> then<00:04:03.019> your<00:04:03.259> legs<00:04:03.530> turn<00:04:03.859> so

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
and shoulders and then your legs turn so

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.399 
and shoulders and then your legs turn so
it's<00:04:04.909> the<00:04:04.939> same<00:04:05.209> with<00:04:05.329> the<00:04:05.479> backside<00:04:05.900> 180<00:04:06.199> it's

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:06.409 
it's the same with the backside 180 it's

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:09.459 
it's the same with the backside 180 it's
just<00:04:06.590> in<00:04:06.739> a<00:04:06.829> different<00:04:07.040> direction<00:04:07.459> so<00:04:08.289> you<00:04:09.289> got

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:09.469 
just in a different direction so you got

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:11.830 
just in a different direction so you got
to<00:04:09.590> think<00:04:09.769> with<00:04:09.979> it<00:04:10.129> like<00:04:10.310> an<00:04:10.489> ollie<00:04:10.759> and<00:04:11.239> then

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
to think with it like an ollie and then

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.289 
to think with it like an ollie and then
a<00:04:11.870> 180<00:04:12.379> and<00:04:12.650> the<00:04:12.979> trick<00:04:13.219> here<00:04:13.519> is<00:04:13.699> that<00:04:14.000> you<00:04:14.150> got

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
a 180 and the trick here is that you got

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.270 
a 180 and the trick here is that you got
to<00:04:14.329> be<00:04:14.509> simultaneously<00:04:15.500> turning<00:04:15.979> your<00:04:16.099> head

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
to be simultaneously turning your head

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.670 
to be simultaneously turning your head
and<00:04:16.459> shoulders<00:04:16.699> as<00:04:17.120> you<00:04:17.840> pop<00:04:18.079> your<00:04:18.259> board<00:04:18.440> up

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
and shoulders as you pop your board up

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.189 
and shoulders as you pop your board up
into<00:04:18.949> the<00:04:19.070> air<00:04:19.099> so<00:04:19.940> your<00:04:20.209> upper<00:04:20.690> body<00:04:20.900> is

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
into the air so your upper body is

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.769
