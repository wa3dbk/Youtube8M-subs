00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.349
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.990
 more of what I am like 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.059
 nexus and make an exotic again 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.529
 helming gram opening because I need 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.600
 still in bright for a very short time I need 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.109
 the helmet for the walk again 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.630
 helmet 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.859
 I'm still 20 and I thought so 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.769
 I'll do a good job right away 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.420
 Opening and hope that I get the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.950
 we have enough of a message particle 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.300
 not at the latest after exchange 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.270
 There are still many unbelievable 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.090
 would need that from me when I had enough 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.620
 we will see how many close 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:53.000
 have to open well, see if raúl 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.000
 my soul is gracious 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.870
 I forget to give that up in part 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.190
 because I'm so rarely a gram 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.899
 open up because I just do not have space 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.449
 have and most in gram anyway 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.860
 again the legendary people do that 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.049
 I do not get up now I'll do it 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:13.040
 legendary opening still very briefly the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.040
 blue on 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.340
 OK 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:34.490
 now I have bought way too much 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:36.680
 and that will be extremely short as well as good 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.490
 we polen around I make the rest there 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.549
 then, and then I did not 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.119
 hangs a legendary in cham opening the 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:50.979
 share in all cases because now 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:55.250
 I'm really beautiful 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:59.149
 at the third so that was there I had 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.170
 I just do not know what I say 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.179
 I'm a bit overwhelmed 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.159
 we simply make the legendary on 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.159
 Well let's see what comes out there 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:17.170
 funny, too, and I already have 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:20.170
 I do not need what is that 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.170
 rochester 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.170
 peacemaker well i do them 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.830
 a few holes in short everything and get new ones 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.240
 legendary entrance until right back 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.820
 with new objects 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.160
 because I have to swap all the time because 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.960
 I have so little space well with others 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.150
 the blue light look I hoped 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.010
 So the actual quit must be light 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.740
 Particles exactly that I need around 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.120
 strange coins of his light 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.240
 Delay in there because I have something else 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.180
 Upload'm then is my 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.250
 not a little bit they realize that 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.110
 I used to clique it a bit earlier though 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.790
 will be displayed later now 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.970
 I'm really unlucky that's not 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.970
 Well 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.709
 lena yes I used up my luck 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:13.860
 already at the beginning as it looks 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:19.069
 yes definitely oh come on light 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:22.620
 please do not be serious 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.370
 just do not see anything 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.370
 because the breast is there 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:30.950
 the helmet and 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:42.120
 Now I'm curious so how 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:42.120
 armor parts what does he look like 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:49.689
 not bad 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.689
 it brings me little rapt discipline 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:57.480
 Well you have weapons what we had 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.480
 last rest 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.269
 I always compare them for a very short time 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:08.989
 the matador to forget about the whole 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.989
 reach 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.220
 and that we chose her , yes, too 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.299
 not the absolute hit what should I 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.430
 I'll see if I can do it a bit 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:23.150
 a drama from the others chance 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.530
 rüberschieben it came right way and at 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.020
 I have a short end too 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.750
 changed her because I do not have no 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:33.800
 Do something about pushing so do 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.780
 I really hope for that 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.600
 safes will be enlarged because of me 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.949
 At that time I have problems only a light 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.949
 I have received very nice particles 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.039
 I'm not really from the moment 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:53.419
 luck keeps track of what the light particles are 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:55.870
 concerns as well as the 1 humane and is 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.870
 that 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:09.070
 would like to compare briefly with donna summer 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:13.270
 but not after increased ammunition in it 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:16.600
 no , of course it could be allowed to but 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.520
 i do not like the principles i like it 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:24.220
 lower with high impact force 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:31.330
 Fire rate is not that well or one 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:33.100
 nice explosions well I'll do it again 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.370
 in short, I have one more 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.350
 few items until just fine 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.610
 the last bit and then I want 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.890
 still included 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:46.590
 it is not much anymore but that me 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:49.150
 everything through but what the good change 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:53.700
 So then last round with the titan 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.700
 here again typically worse 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.890
 and then I just saw me 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.500
 I found some legendary ones there 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.470
 Of course, we will do that at the end of the day 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:13.320
 to homespun tension a bit high 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:13.320
 light particle month so i like that 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:21.240
 no, now this is surprised again 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.240
 not me 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:29.600
 a coin that was much better 

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.550
 that was much better 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:37.160
 somehow not at the moment 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.160
 Well, let's have a look at a program 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:47.880
 We'll look at each other later, of course 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.470
 again the weird pumpgun part that 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.370
 You can not need the reach 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:56.030
 is good for an ass with it off 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.030
 So what do we have here 

00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:04.569
 yes sexy witch aware harnisch and at the 

00:07:02.299 --> 00:07:04.569
 location 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:14.389
 Well, which as technically synonymous not so 

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:16.069
 the hit though both scrapped well 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:20.169
 at the end of a video I would like 

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:23.089
 put a few and that to you 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:26.089
 I've said well here someday 

00:07:23.089 --> 00:07:28.219
 I save the daily bonuses and times 

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:31.849
 I have the packages at the morlock and 

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:33.769
 at the year also much and have 

00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:36.319
 thought if you will then never see 

00:07:33.769 --> 00:07:36.759
 then make the bonuses and packages 

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:39.709
 I the 

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:41.929
 but that depends on you writing 

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:43.519
 in the comments if you as well as well 

00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:47.139
 just like in a grand opening easy for 

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:50.089
 be want to see the packages writes 

00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:51.499
 always curious what he means thank you 

00:07:50.089 --> 00:07:53.089
 for watching i hope that again 

00:07:51.499 --> 00:07:54.649
 if he likes it 

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:56.449
 This was not yesterday as well 

00:07:54.649 --> 00:08:00.069
 thank you very much for that 

00:07:56.449 --> 00:08:00.069
 watch until the next video
