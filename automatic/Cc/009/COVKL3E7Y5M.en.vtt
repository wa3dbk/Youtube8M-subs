00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
 today it was seen that was the last chapter of the story memo eight 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:06.880
 america fulham 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.839
 there may be others but today the player speaks 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:14.949
 Pablo the manager and I talk the coach then we start by 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.459
 chronologically with what said eight kings 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.859
 good are two facets the correspondence medical exams that was 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.249
 expected since he came to power 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:29.199
 if I arrive at 7 so it arrived very early but around the towel and 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:29.830
 is 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.770
 they were in their charge part this said 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.970
 not to say something that the foundation museum that moved 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.780
 delighted to always play in Europe 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.690
 it's something I'm going to keep in mind we do not remove the finger from the line not by 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.560
 this one for this little the teacher 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.330
 I should not continue working to keep looking for opportunities to 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.680
 according to the minutes 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.200
 they are details we would not like to deepen their cost what good that 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.130
 and I will analyze in private 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.360
 we stay together with the board and no view was given and 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.030
 let's not talk 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.960
 that's how it's about football and of course it's going to keep insisting 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.160
 you never know how it can happen today you can spend the next week 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.380
 in six months 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.470
 you do not know when they arrive 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.920
 those opportunities 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.840
 simply be presented 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.830
 whenever you like the product is important it is not always flattering that 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.040
 your jobs are left 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.010
 the one that look at in one 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.370
 i 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.579
 In emotional, we manage to keep doing it well 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.180
 in that way so that annunciation is filled 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.180
 not for nothing no no no finally nothing of the lush theme 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.600
 or something well done 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.630
 acceptable 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.630
 i turn rock everything was done 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.420
 as usual, we feel dismayed 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.630
 in fact he has spoken for the first time a little bit more thoroughly or accepting 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.030
 there questions from reporters 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.810
 Talking about the subject
