00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
system and that that impulse trigger

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.260 
system and that that impulse trigger
design<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.500> controller<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.399> goes<00:00:59.940> hand

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
design in that controller this goes hand

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.180 
design in that controller this goes hand
in<00:01:00.480> hand<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.109> I'm<00:01:01.649> going<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> talk<00:01:01.949> about<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.640 
in hand so I'm going to talk about the
game<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.489> little<00:01:02.699> bit<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.180> then<00:01:04.049> let<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.500> know

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
game a little bit and then let you know

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.469 
game a little bit and then let you know
what<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.799> thought<00:01:05.070> overall<00:01:05.280> about<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
what I thought overall about it so the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.789 
what I thought overall about it so the
first<00:01:06.630> thing<00:01:06.750> you'll<00:01:06.960> obviously<00:01:07.049> notice<00:01:07.650> when

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
first thing you'll obviously notice when

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.500 
first thing you'll obviously notice when
you<00:01:07.890> turn<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.220> demo<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.180> cars

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
you turn on the demo is that the cars

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.109 
you turn on the demo is that the cars
all<00:01:10.320> over<00:01:10.350> all<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.860> graphics<00:01:11.100> look<00:01:11.549> stunning

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
all over all the graphics look stunning

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.230 
all over all the graphics look stunning
not<00:01:12.689> only<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.950> gameplay<00:01:14.580> does<00:01:14.939> feel

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
not only that the gameplay does feel

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.730 
not only that the gameplay does feel
like<00:01:15.420> they<00:01:15.540> fine-tuned<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.530> I'm<00:01:16.710> very

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
like they fine-tuned it and I'm very

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.039 
like they fine-tuned it and I'm very
excited<00:01:17.460> about<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.360> doesn't<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:18.689> feel

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
excited about that it doesn't just feel

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.649 
excited about that it doesn't just feel
like<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.650> driving<00:01:20.280> game<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:21.210> we've<00:01:21.360> played

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
like a driving game that we've played

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.899 
like a driving game that we've played
before<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:22.650> feels<00:01:22.950> like<00:01:23.159> there's<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.580> little

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
before it feels like there's a little

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.910 
before it feels like there's a little
bit<00:01:24.150> more<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:25.049> there's<00:01:25.290> some<00:01:25.530> things

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
bit more to it that there's some things

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.910 
bit more to it that there's some things
that<00:01:26.040> we<00:01:26.310> need<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.700> get<00:01:27.360> used<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.900> again<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
that we need to get used to again in a

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.249 
that we need to get used to again in a
racing<00:01:29.369> game<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.180> don't<00:01:30.420> feel<00:01:30.840> unless

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
racing game that we we don't feel unless

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.920 
racing game that we we don't feel unless
we<00:01:31.500> really<00:01:31.740> go<00:01:32.009> outside<00:01:32.400> into<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.820> car<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.420> that

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
we really go outside into a car and that

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.780 
we really go outside into a car and that
was<00:01:34.049> exciting<00:01:34.530> for<00:01:34.560> me<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.040> actually<00:01:35.430> pick<00:01:35.729> up

was<00:02:03.180> playing<00:02:03.450> probably<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.960> 32<00:02:04.469> inch<00:02:04.590> screen

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
was playing probably on a 32 inch screen

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
so anything bigger than that I think is

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:07.820 
so anything bigger than that I think is
going<00:02:07.469> to

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
going to

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.190

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.820 
and the power behind it when you crash
into<00:03:42.150> other<00:03:42.269> cars<00:03:42.570> in<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.080> controller<00:03:43.530> and

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
into other cars in the controller and

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.310 
into other cars in the controller and
the<00:03:44.100> sound<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:44.880> visuals<00:03:45.360> are<00:03:45.750> just

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
the sound and the visuals are just

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.650 
the sound and the visuals are just
creating<00:03:46.530> something<00:03:47.100> that<00:03:47.130> is<00:03:47.670> truly<00:03:48.180> next

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
creating something that is truly next

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.479 
creating something that is truly next
generation<00:03:49.230> so<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.680> think<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.220> lot<00:03:50.250> of<00:03:50.400> people

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
generation so I think a lot of people

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.940 
generation so I think a lot of people
were<00:03:50.790> worried<00:03:51.090> that<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.540> racing<00:03:52.320> car<00:03:52.350> game<00:03:52.530> you

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
since gran turismo on the PS 1 i've been

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.800 
since gran turismo on the PS 1 i've been
a<00:04:35.280> huge<00:04:35.550> supporter<00:04:36.030> of<00:04:36.090> it<00:04:36.210> and<00:04:36.420> i<00:04:36.480> felt<00:04:36.750> that
