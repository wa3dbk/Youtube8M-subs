00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.349
 flexible to jump run play ball 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.240
 ride a bike 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.860
 so he says that doctor sports 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.650
 arriving and wonder 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.840
 Let's teach you the three rules of 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.119
 gold to keep our body in 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.500
 and in good health 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:29.760
 the first one is good, the second one is good 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.550
 and the third power exercises 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.730
 hygiene is very important because of this 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.980
 we must always be clean and fragrant 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.559
 anyway anyone who likes to stay near 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.510
 someone with a bad smell and dirty clothes and 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.660
 lioness 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.180
 nobody is not even beyond dirt 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.550
 can bring many diseases because in it 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.980
 there are millions of little critters 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.520
 little ones called germs and bacteria 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.100
 and that make us very bad 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.560
 but do not be scared personal to give a 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.590
 In order to them we counted on two friends 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.950
 water that soap and also people 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.530
 rain on them but after a hot shower 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.750
 do not forget to play well for 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.450
 to avoid a skin disease called 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.450
 a little girl, a rose, we should not 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.510
 forget to clean your ears your nose and 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.470
 the eyes brush their teeth three times 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.990
 day 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.880
 Another important thing is to wash the 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.340
 hands before meals 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.890
 and talking about my friend's meal 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.790
 Lilly and the nutritionist taught that a 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.390
 Good nutrition is also fundamental not 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.340
 It's really getting there, after all, someone has seen 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.720
 a car ride without fuel as 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.700
 alcohol or gasoline and not one or me with 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.680
 our body is the same 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.860
 we need energy to keep it alive 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.100
 and our fuel are 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.280
 the nutrients that are the vitamins as 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.459
 proteins to water the fat 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.940
 carbohydrates and minerals and know where 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:08.410
 we find all this in food 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.720
 foods that are energetic 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.260
 that is are responsible for the production 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.410
 heat and energy and movement as the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.280
 potato a pasta the rice and cereals 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.470
 the flours the sweet the sugars the oil 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.540
 olive oil and butter 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.490
 but it is not just energy that our 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.670
 need body we also need 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.459
 build and strengthen bones tissues 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.099
 nerves and muscles are not for it 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.940
 needed food monster pain 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.230
 which are the fish and the chicken the games 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.000
 The milk 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.190
 Bean Meat and Soy Pea Energy 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.340
 But now you must be horny. 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.340
 heads fruits the vegetables that all 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.489
 world says it is so healthy for them to 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.430
 vegetables and fruits are well served 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.920
 also goals are regulating foods 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.870
 that is, they help transform 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.720
 food we eat into matter 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.390
 our body like blood and bone muscles 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.349
 therefore they are fundamental for the 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.660
 Cheers 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.730
 So people have already noticed that 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.379
 It is important to eat several types of 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.019
 food for our body 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.849
 It works fine, is not it? 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.060
 this is what we call diet 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.810
 balanced but remember to choose the 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.299
 what to eat 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.569
 It is also important to know how to eat 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.609
 always chewing very slowly grinding 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.940
 and swallowing food with 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:39.190
 Tranquility, very good friends, you already 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.200
 understand what they need both cleaning 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.989
 how much good food to have 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.209
 but there is still a rule of 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:48.459
 gold the exercises 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.630
 after all our body was not made for 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.239
 stand still 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.220
 are the physical activities that make us 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.099
 strong and flexible 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.919
 If we stand still, we'll end up being 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:02.079
 used as a forgotten bike in the 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:03.190
 backyard as well as doing well for 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.380
 our health 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.150
 the exercises also help us to 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.829
 to relate to others because we 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.260
 taught to work in groups and 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:14.290
 develop important skills such as 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.510
 try to persist make decisions 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.400
 exercises are so important that 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.410
 accompanies humanity from pre 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.110
 history as shown in the 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.630
 walls of the chapels and all the peoples and 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.510
 all parts of the planet have developed 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.190
 different ways of exercising that 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.530
 have evolved over time 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.110
 but do not think that to do exercises 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.240
 It takes an official block on the sidewalk. 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.240
 in the square or in the yard we can 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.190
 improvise several fun games 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.949
 You saw friends how easy it is. 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.120
 tasty and fun to keep a good 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.330
 Cheers 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:53.259
 just obey the three golden rules and 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:56.020
 good hygiene and exercise if 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:58.630
 we did everything right our short 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.300

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:05.229
 because you can enjoy all the sounds 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.319
 smells tastes talks and colors that life 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.319
 offers 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.290
 op
