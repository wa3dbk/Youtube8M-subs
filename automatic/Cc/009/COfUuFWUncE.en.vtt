00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:15.250
 very good look 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.020
 there were many people of you and also 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.190
 many people around me people very 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.220
 close that tells me that after having 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.450
 seen the course that says about 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.110
 flamenco guitar and others 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.530
 well, I still saw it very complicated 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:36.690
 that the level was very high and that maybe 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.990
 I should explain it in a more 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.030
 simple and simpler 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:45.500
 total that concludes that 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:48.790
 I'm going to do a course a course that goes to 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.720
 be for beginners 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.000
 that I think it's going to be interesting that what 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.490
 see because surely go to 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.970
 discover things that he has not said in the 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:05.530
 previous course and it's going to be a much 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:09.970
 more simpler more simplified we do not go 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.150
 to start at the beginning of the beginning 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.780
 tell you that 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.010
 the classes are not going to be as extensive as 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.400
 long 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.950
 and let's get used to the idea that 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.760
 we are going to an academy or a 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:30.100
 tutor and what 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.080
 we learn what we learn in a 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.710
 class because you have a whole week of a 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.409
 week because the videos will go up 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.340
 going up 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:49.289
 one per week is worth this way 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:53.209
 You will have a whole week to acquire 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:58.300
 that knowledge because one thing is 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:02:01.180
 learn something learn something because it is very 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.490
 it's very easy, it means very little time 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.940
 that what it takes time is to master 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.720
 that therefore we are going to do 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:14.860
 somewhat shorter classes and you're going to have 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.410
 a week to assimilate all that 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.640
 content is valid and then from there 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.940
 Well a little more and I assure you 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.410
 I really assure you that if you do not pay attention 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.390
 and not relax and you are studying 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.730
 you play the guitar of course 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.600
 that I will play jce I know that each of 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.460
 you always believe that 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.260
 because to me this about the guitar is not 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.700
 It's good because I'm very clumsy 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.080
 people who are much better look at me what 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.980
 yes I have for the experience that 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.230
 I know that anyone who wants 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.860
 learn and be organized and that 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.540
 work 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:02.300
 always ends up touching life always 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.450
 therefore encourage and tell you that 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.820
 take away from our heads what we do not 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.610
 you are capable of you to the best 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:14.420
 you are not prepared and you do not have that 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.540
 ease because nobody is born taught and 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.450
 everyone learns it's worth there are people 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.760
 who learns a higher rhythm then yes 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.860
 it is also true which does not want 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.480
 those same people say that sometimes 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.280
 relax 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.180
 and do not value some things that 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.810
 learn therefore what is required in 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:39.290
 the guitar is constancy and above all 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.079
 regularity if you can 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:45.170
 if it's a quarter of an hour if it's half an hour 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.780
 If it's an hour everyday because it 's better 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.599
 Well that's what we have to do 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.019
 in a regular way and practicing 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:56.239
 that and especially not drunk of 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.090
 much knowledge because there are many 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:03.049
 youtube things there are many things many 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.250
 they are very good others not so much but what 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.470
 what you can not do 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.100
 click here to qualify from there 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:14.510
 because then at the end one becomes a 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:18.070
 little good in this course for example 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:21.550
 let's start talking about 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.940
 of what the frets are of how 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:29.110
 call each rope to the what is called in 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:32.860
 each one of the strings that you notice 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.630
 receives each of them the air will touch 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.980
 in the air 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:43.110
 how to tune how to change a rope 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:46.230
 good how to make a first melody 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.950
 how to learn a chord wheel and in 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.890
 I have prepared a lot of material that 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:56.850
 I will be dropping little by little so that 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:59.910
 deceive yourself and tell you also that 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.680
 margin of this course then I will continue 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.170
 doing what he was doing until 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.180
 Now I 'll be putting flamenco stuff 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:12.129
 falsetas some new touch some beat 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.679
 I want to say that one thing 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:16.510
 it will not take away from me doing the other 

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:18.760
 You understand 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.770
 this does come to the conclusion that 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.610
 I have to do it because of course when 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:27.940
 me someone tells me what I've 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.040
 I've been doing, I'm supposed to be 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.410
 effort because I do not have much 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.090
 time but good this I like me 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.220
 I feel rewarded with your 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.800
 follow up and with your thanks 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.870
 so what I want to say is that I 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.820
 It worries that there are people who tell me that 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.020
 It had to have been much easier 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:49.650
 everything that 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.139
 that I did what I wanted to teach so 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.990
 I've been thinking so much and I'm going to do 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:57.290
 this applies 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.090
 well this video was only 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:03.199
 informative 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:07.419
 so you know what the proposal is 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:10.550
 is what I think and from here on 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:12.330
 I'm going to prepare the first classes 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.310
 OK 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.650
 see you and see if it is true that 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:19.349
 I take advantage I assure you as I said 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.129
 before and I repeat that if you pay attention to me 

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:24.339
 Y 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:28.050
 you are rehearsing what I say and in the end 

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:28.050
 I will play and enjoy 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.160
 until now
