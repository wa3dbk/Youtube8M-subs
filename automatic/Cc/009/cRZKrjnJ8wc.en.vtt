large<00:00:02.580> project<00:00:03.300> that<00:00:03.360> we've<00:00:03.600> been<00:00:03.629> working<00:00:03.810> on

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
large project that we've been working on

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.920 
large project that we've been working on
in<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.529> Yakima<00:00:05.009> River<00:00:05.250> the<00:00:06.180> last<00:00:06.420> few<00:00:06.750> months

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
in the Yakima River the last few months

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.290 
in the Yakima River the last few months
and<00:00:07.319> what<00:00:08.010> we've<00:00:08.189> done<00:00:08.400> is<00:00:08.580> we've<00:00:08.790> redesigned

the<00:00:09.809> entire<00:00:10.610> Yakima<00:00:11.610> River<00:00:11.880> network<00:00:12.450> all<00:00:12.719> the

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
the entire Yakima River network all the

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.770 
the entire Yakima River network all the
way<00:00:12.990> from<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.380> upper<00:00:13.769> river<00:00:13.950> down<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.570> low

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
way from the upper river down to the low

way from the upper river down to the low
Roza<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:17.119> we've<00:00:18.119> come<00:00:18.330> up<00:00:18.359> with<00:00:18.539> some

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
Roza and we've come up with some

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.019 
Roza and we've come up with some
floaters<00:00:19.230> maps<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.920> series<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.460> three<00:00:20.760> maps

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
floaters maps a series of three maps

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.990 
floaters maps a series of three maps
that<00:00:21.420> cover<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:22.050> lot<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.769> boat<00:00:23.130> accesses

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
that cover a lot of the boat accesses

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.750 
that cover a lot of the boat accesses
and<00:00:24.320> waiting<00:00:25.320> access<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:25.980> all<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.279> way<00:00:26.430> from

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
and waiting access is all the way from

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.599 
and waiting access is all the way from
the<00:00:26.939> ensign<00:00:27.480> ranch<00:00:27.779> down<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.609> Harlan's

below Rosa that not many people floating

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.440 
below Rosa that not many people floating
we've<00:00:34.800> split<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.280> into<00:00:35.430> three<00:00:35.760> sections<00:00:36.030> and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
we've split it into three sections and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.930 
we've split it into three sections and
what<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.200> two<00:00:37.380> page<00:00:37.680> series<00:00:38.190> the

what it is it's a two page series the
first<00:00:39.270> page<00:00:39.540> gives<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.020> little<00:00:40.170> bit<00:00:40.379> of

Canyon<00:00:45.270> we've<00:00:46.260> identified<00:00:46.469> all<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.219> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
Canyon we've identified all of the

Canyon we've identified all of the
launches<00:00:48.059> we've<00:00:48.960> made<00:00:49.170> some<00:00:49.410> notes<00:00:49.590> about

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
launches we've made some notes about

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.459 
launches we've made some notes about
putting<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.629> taking<00:00:51.989> out<00:00:52.140> at<00:00:52.289> those

launches<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.390> also<00:00:54.390> one<00:00:54.660> confusing<00:00:55.320> thing

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
launches and also one confusing thing

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.529 
launches and also one confusing thing
that<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.860> answer<00:00:56.309> questions<00:00:56.789> about<00:00:56.910> every

two<00:01:10.950> what<00:01:11.820> we've<00:01:11.939> done<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.299> we've<00:01:12.450> actually

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
two what we've done is we've actually

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.320 
two what we've done is we've actually
gone<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.619> identified<00:01:14.340> these<00:01:14.549> map<00:01:14.880> these

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
gone in and identified these map these

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.140 
gone in and identified these map these
accesses<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.619> map<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.100> taken<00:01:17.909> pictures

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
accesses on the map and taken pictures

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.899 
accesses on the map and taken pictures
of<00:01:18.720> each<00:01:18.990> individual<00:01:19.680> access<00:01:20.159> -<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.640> know

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
of each individual access - so you know

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.060 
of each individual access - so you know
exactly<00:01:21.119> where<00:01:21.600> you're<00:01:21.780> at<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.590> can<00:01:22.619> look<00:01:22.950> at

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
exactly where you're at you can look at

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.980 
exactly where you're at you can look at
the<00:01:23.189> picture<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.880> see<00:01:23.909> where<00:01:24.270> it's<00:01:24.420> where

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the picture you can see where it's where

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.990 
the picture you can see where it's where
you're<00:01:25.200> you're<00:01:25.890> going<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.189> be<00:01:26.310> putting<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.790> and

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
you're you're going to be putting in and

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.670 
you're you're going to be putting in and
when<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.240> get<00:01:27.420> there<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:27.869> identify<00:01:28.140> if

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
when you get there you can identify if

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.620 
when you get there you can identify if
you're<00:01:28.829> at<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.040> right<00:01:29.070> place<00:01:29.220> or<00:01:29.670> not<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:30.420> is

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
you're at the right place or not this is

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.719 
you're at the right place or not this is
all<00:01:30.720> printed<00:01:31.170> on<00:01:31.290> waterproof<00:01:31.890> paper<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.490> put<00:01:32.700> a

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
all printed on waterproof paper we put a

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.539 
all printed on waterproof paper we put a
drama<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> upper<00:01:34.009> corner<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.400> if<00:01:35.460> you

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
drama in the upper corner so that if you

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.249 
drama in the upper corner so that if you
want<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.909> stick<00:01:36.150> them<00:01:36.299> all<00:01:36.390> together<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.869> can

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
want to stick them all together you can

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.399 
want to stick them all together you can
so<00:01:38.009> that's<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.430> canyon<00:01:38.700> one<00:01:39.200> here's<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
so that's the canyon one here's the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.670 
so that's the canyon one here's the
farmlands<00:01:40.920> one<00:01:41.310> moving<00:01:41.579> up<00:01:41.880> same<00:01:42.780> thing<00:01:42.810> notes

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
farmlands one moving up same thing notes

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.510 
farmlands one moving up same thing notes
about<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.220> accesses<00:01:44.970> all<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.520> interstate

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
about the accesses all of the interstate

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.069 
about the accesses all of the interstate
exits<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.299> would<00:01:48.450> take<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.840> get<00:01:49.020> to

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
exits that you would take to get to

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.319 
exits that you would take to get to
those<00:01:49.530> accesses<00:01:50.100> are<00:01:50.369> identified<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.210> then

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
those accesses are identified and then

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.770 
those accesses are identified and then
