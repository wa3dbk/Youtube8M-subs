00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.700
 Welcome to a new shader preview 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.180
 this one increased by a shader 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.570
 you have a running shader again 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.829
 adds for bad pcs and from 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.029
 so I just put it back 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.320
 because we say we create 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.730
 bad before even if it is not easy 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.750
 I have to find such again 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.820
 found out 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.050
 which is for bad even if he means 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.640
 style is not really fulfilled for that 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.650
 you would have a partial view of some light 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.870
 mistakes as intended or if that is with 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.339
 intention so is otherwise quite 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.960
 normal shadows that last a bit 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:43.699
 are faded as we will come back 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.340
 a neat vettels texture pack 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:48.340
 go in well what someone beautiful 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:58.219
 128 28 stage 512 512 and then I can 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.690
 the weather present here so that so 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.280
 the whole thing is already out I have 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.230
 clearly more pictures than usual 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.580
 I just noticed and 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.170
 otherwise it is not really that way 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.970
 exaggeratedly bright as if I am now 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.590
 For example, here we say the silver 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.200
 you can see it completely 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.119
 different quality scheme than if you 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.340
 then here this pixel works rheinpark 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.140
 well that 's just for again 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.240
 Worse pcs thought and therefore 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.580
 maybe better for you too 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.619
 So a recommendation for you I can 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.209
 myself not so glock I use because it 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.830
 But I'm too bored for the people 

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:29.599
 the maybe real pc and just times 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.640
 Of course you want to test again 

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:34.009
 little eye-catcher the water is in 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.700
 Chains still remained normal 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:40.190
 back to the water of tecdax 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.899
 just like all the textures grasses and 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.819
 it was not all skin but not so 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.739
 extreme 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.390
 and yes, as I said a bit lighter 

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:48.739
 everything a bit bleached here 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.700
 for example, there is a mistake 

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:54.050
 here still and well I've got times 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.640
 Forgot identify the steam again 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.050
 somebody has steam world 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.770
 Of course, everyone can do it 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.580
 gone online and yes you have 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.489
 just seen 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.890
 down here in our secret base the 

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:09.110
 no one will recognize what we have down here 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.629
 No one knows where it is 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.520
 secretly places nobody knows except 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.170
 you know exactly how the world is called 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.760
 so I would say it was already 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.590
 from this little shader preview the 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.420
 Constance even more, watch the water 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.960
 is just completely normal moves completely 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.620
 normal 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.750
 he has the normal pictures pay 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.280
 stay more easily with yours 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.610
 performance I think when it comes to media 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.630
 pc from that would still run normally 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.880
 as soon as that happens he will 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.230
 In hpc I would do this start-up 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.080
 do not recommend hedging white 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.610
 really not that good is good that is 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.890
 actually the light conditions 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.500
 quite acceptable here are these shadows 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.210
 errors are then not so horny 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.550
 and yes , I would say what it is about me 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.490
 I give the jet pack 3 vision points 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.380
 and of course just because he lau for laptops 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.610
 is that something of mine you can give me one 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.230
 Comments are what you write about these 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.670
 I'm still wondering about the shader model 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.590
 Still on feedback for the new ones 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.880
 touch on with cs martin 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.370
 past will certainly be pleased about 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.350
 We'll see you in the next video if it's you 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.350
 please give a like and bye
