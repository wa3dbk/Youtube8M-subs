00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.370
 let's analyze the convergence of the series 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.530
 of complex numbers sum of this 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.129
 in n equal to 1 this infinity of n 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.370
 factorial party of iu by n elevated to 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.860
 n 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.930
 good 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.240
 here we could try to calculate the 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.110
 real part and imaginary part 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.960
 but 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.810
 observe that we have a quotient not 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.090
 appear sums or subtractions will be very 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.430
 simple to calculate the module 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.910
 of the succession that we have inside 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.910
 of the series 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.280
 because the module behaves very well 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.280
 how much the division 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.860
 the product and the powers 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.670
 this would be module of the above 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.609
 work module match 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:05.480
 work and for n high n we can 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:07.460
 put as and raised n by nn 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.790
 In factory, your modules are numbers 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.860
 real n factorial is also positive and 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:19.420
 now here we will have a module of iu 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.420
 elevated per module of high an 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.340
 factorial 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.030
 exponent this can come out of the 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.030
 module 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.580
 in the duck n 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:37.570
 a real number plus positive module is the 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.380
 same and the iu module 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.380
 it is one 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.140
 this would be an elevated one even in 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.520
 high 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.520
 is one for n 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.310
 Thus 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.840
 if we consider absolute convergence 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.100
 of the initial series and if it were 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.380
 absolutely convergent 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.540
 it is automatically convergent because the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.750
 series that we have to analyze is to be 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.750
 here 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.650
 where we have got rid of that and we have 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.100
 a series of real numbers then 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.900
 let's analyze the convergence of this series 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.900
 and here as we have 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.540
 factorials and powers then we are going to 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.540
 apply the quotient criterion 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:41.190
 it's a series of positive terms 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.690
 then quotient criterion then 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.450
 What is done is to calculate the limit when 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.840
 n tends to infinity if this is in turn 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.610
 in factory split in high in the sub 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.280
 n 1 sub n match if this is left for you 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.560
 greater than 1 are people if they are younger 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.180
 that convergent and is equal to 1 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.390
 Well, we should look for an alternative to 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.130
 this criterion by north would serve 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.420
 then this would be the limit when not 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.230
 it has finite 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:13.800
 in turn we substitute the n for n 1 n 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.450
 plus 1 factorial party of n plus one 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.450
 elevated n 1 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:25.180
 at the same time that it would be split in n 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.150
 so now we write this as a 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:33.240
 division and multiply in cross n 1 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:38.350
 factorial party n 1 ^ n 1 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:40.210
 / / n factorial in l when n 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.860
 and this would stay nourish when n 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:47.640
 tends to infinity 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:53.900
 We multiply cross in a factory 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:57.590
 by in high n and in down n 1 high n 1 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.590
 by factorial 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:02.260
 and what things can we do here 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:10.110
 so that this is 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:12.740
 well and do not leave us loose things 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.740
 look 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.989
 we can achieve here that there is a 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:22.070
 exponent n 1 for this we have to 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.070
 multiply by n 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.720
 then we would have exponents n 1 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.790
 and here we will multiply by n 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.830
 then we have 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:45.949
 this with this elevated in 1 I guess of 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.830
 some other alternative then in 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:52.430
 elevated n 1 match of n 1 paid n 1 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:55.260
 we can put it as n match n 1 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.920
 elevated an 1 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.920
 that to begin with 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.850
 well we could also have written in 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.190
 one elevated n 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:14.330
 but good also this function 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:16.729
 now the n 1 factorial is n 1 per n 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:21.370
 factor are already in factor already with this one in 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.370
 factorial goes by what we would have left 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.590
 above 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.100
 n 1 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.530
 and down a n 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.260
 to see what it looks to see if I leave something 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.210
 simplified factorials if he is one 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.660
 what remains for me here 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:43.050
 this this this and I stayed in this 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:48.360
 to be here I know how well this tends 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:49.880
 to 1 and this limit this type 1 high 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.689
 infinite 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:56.360
 a high infinity 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:58.370
 and this I have done it apart to do 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.680
 and this has stayed with me if I have not 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.139
 wrong I have raised at least one 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.530
 then limit a product product of the 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:11.400
 Items left 1 match for 1 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:14.200
 party for him is like and is bigger 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.210
 that one this is less than 1 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.640
 as you have less than 1 this implies 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.430
 that this series is convergent by applying 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.610
 the quotient criterion is here 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:27.449
 who watches the series whose succession 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.430
 interior is the absolute value 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:33.080
 for the absolute of this we have 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:37.199
 here therefore this series here is 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:40.639
 absolutely convergent and therefore 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.639
 it is convergent
