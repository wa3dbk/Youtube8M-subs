00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 this is the new are and rx have husbands 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.549
 Today in our region behind mÃ¡rquez 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.620
 let's talk about this small compact 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.570
 that is revolutionizing the market but 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.759
 what is interesting about this compact 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.170
 because so much success well there is a 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.000
 main reason and this without a doubt the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.980
 size of your sensor the area of cristian 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.390
 Mar 2 incorporates a much more sensor 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.939
 big than other compact ones and for 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.650
 Of course any smartphone the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.840
 This camera's sensor is one inch 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.640
 much larger than other models and from what 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.439
 this serves us well simply against 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.929
 larger to the sensor more information 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.969
 can catch we will find more details 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.620
 in those of the photographs the colors 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.030
 the contrasts and ultimately the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.250
 quality of the photo will always be seen 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.990
 benefited by this detail 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.080
 but this is the only reason for 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.370
 buy it rx100 + 2 and much less another 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.380
 very interesting aspect is the 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.210
 1.8 luminosity that has this wonder 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.850
 which means well that can help me 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.530
 this 1.8 well this numbering of the 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.540
 we speak is now opening its 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.190
 diaphragm in other words is the 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.570
 ability of the camera to leave 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.830
 pass light in conditions that 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.850
 require and the ability to achieve 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.619
 interesting blurs 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.170
 another of the aspects that have made 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.070
 this camera a success is your screen 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.190
 apart from having exceptional quality 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.950
 allows us to take it out and put it 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.659
 completely horizontal this is ideal 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.790
 to achieve good frames as per 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.260
 example to take pictures from 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.030
 above 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.250
 or from the ground 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.049
 now let's talk about the rx video has 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.940
 Mar 2 from my point of view this is 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.530
 a very positive surprise and it is that this 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.509
 small camera allows you to focus and 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.159
 blur manually while recording 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.780
 this allows us to achieve results 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.759
 professionals as we could do 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.790
 with a reflex camera but with a 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.649
 advantage we will leave you a free hand 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.040
 I leave with a controlled with a rxt 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.040
 embargos 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.909
 Now let's see what's in the box 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.730
 or the first thing we find are the 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:39.819
 manuals in my various languages 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:44.370
 once accessing the compartment 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.370
 Inside we find the camera 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.560
 we can also find inside 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.300
 power adapters of course the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.100
 cable 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.560
 another cable to connect the camera 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.819
 usb computer 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.569
 we also have a strap 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.569
 the battery 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.970
 and finally the straps more than 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.980
 security 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.510
 is to say that this camera is today in 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.460
 around 500 euros but also 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.820
 there is an optional cheaper 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.770
 rx100 that is around 350 lamar 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.130
 2 that we have here the advantage is its 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.020
 predecessor in the following the shoe in 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.870
 which we could place a flash micro 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.840
 etcetera the nfc wifi and some other 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.490
 good details without further hope that you 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.020
 have liked this review and help you 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.080
 understand a little more about this very 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.440
 interesting saunier kristian brown 2 a 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.440
 greeting
