00:00:18.854 --> 00:00:20.562
Look forward!

00:00:28.438 --> 00:00:29.478
Goodsoon!

00:00:29.687 --> 00:00:31.478
Goodsoon…

00:00:32.896 --> 00:00:33.937
Goodsoon!

00:00:35.478 --> 00:00:36.478
Are you ok?

00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:37.645
Let me see.

00:00:39.478 --> 00:00:40.478
Her bones weren’t broken.

00:00:40.478 --> 00:00:41.896
Get on my back.

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:43.062
Why?

00:00:43.062 --> 00:00:44.520
You have to see the doctor.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.478
It’s not that serious.

00:00:45.478 --> 00:00:46.645
Even so!

00:00:47.478 --> 00:00:49.478
Darn, that bastard.

00:00:49.937 --> 00:00:52.062
It’s female.

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.438
Didn’t she look nice in her new look?

00:00:58.438 --> 00:00:59.770
She didn’t wear what you bought her.

00:01:00.478 --> 00:01:01.478
Why?

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:04.645
Because it does not go well with her 
quilt jacket.

00:01:05.478 --> 00:01:08.478
The suit will match with a half-coat. 
Don’t you think so?

00:01:08.478 --> 00:01:10.478
Does that mean I have to buy her a coat as well?

00:01:10.478 --> 00:01:12.478
Ruby will do.

00:01:12.478 --> 00:01:14.645
Ms. Boss must have been very stylish, huh?

00:01:15.478 --> 00:01:18.478
Yes. Her air of the rich and the refined…

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:21.478
Nevertheless, 
Ruby said she dressed in modesty today.

00:01:21.478 --> 00:01:24.021
How was the communication?

00:01:24.021 --> 00:01:28.146
Perfect. Everybody cried.

00:01:28.146 --> 00:01:29.354
Why?

00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:32.812
Her face completely changed at the sight of Myongja.

00:01:32.812 --> 00:01:34.021
Really?

00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:41.396
Yes. So I thought she must have felt offended by the shabby look of Myongja.

00:01:41.396 --> 00:01:44.478
We put an order, 
and she took a swallow of water.

00:01:44.478 --> 00:01:47.604
Then all of sudden, she burst into tears.

00:01:48.478 --> 00:01:49.478
Oh…

00:01:56.687 --> 00:01:57.604
&lt;Is that Goodsoon?&gt;

00:01:58.478 --> 00:01:59.645
Yes.

00:02:05.438 --> 00:02:07.520
Are you sure you don’t need to see 
the doctor?

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:10.478
I’ll wait till tomorrow.

00:02:10.478 --> 00:02:12.896
If you feel any other pain, 
call me immediately.

00:02:12.896 --> 00:02:13.562
Ok.

00:02:14.478 --> 00:02:15.478
See you tomorrow.

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:18.478
Wait.

00:02:20.271 --> 00:02:21.478
Come here.

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:30.645
Propose me right after 
you become a college student.

00:02:33.478 --> 00:02:35.478
I’m serious.

00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:36.896
Why?

00:02:37.478 --> 00:02:39.478
I’m afraid a wretch might 
snatch you away.

00:02:40.478 --> 00:02:41.812
Don’t be foul-mouthed.

00:02:41.854 --> 00:02:43.687
This is how I relieve my stress.

00:02:43.687 --> 00:02:46.478
Stress? In this nice environment?

00:02:47.478 --> 00:02:52.104
Your reaction was so touching 
when I fell off.

00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:55.478
I felt as if my heart stopped.

00:02:56.478 --> 00:02:57.854
Really?

00:02:57.854 --> 00:03:01.478
Let’s stop going a horse riding. 
I’m worried you might get injured.

00:03:02.188 --> 00:03:04.478
That’s in the process of riding lessons.

00:03:06.478 --> 00:03:07.478
Are you really ok?

00:03:11.478 --> 00:03:15.104
Maintain your body well and marry me.

00:03:15.604 --> 00:03:17.478
If you’re nice to me.

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:19.478
Don’t play hard to get.

00:03:35.478 --> 00:03:36.478
Where’s Jade?

00:03:36.478 --> 00:03:37.604
She’s packing for a ski trip.

00:03:37.604 --> 00:03:38.478
Ski?

00:03:38.478 --> 00:03:39.479
Yes.

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:46.354
Are you bored?

00:03:46.354 --> 00:03:46.896
No.

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.604
It’s almost done.

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:52.478
Oh, it’s cold.

00:03:52.478 --> 00:03:53.478
Hi mom.

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:54.562
Hi.

00:03:56.645 --> 00:03:58.478
How do you do?

00:04:00.478 --> 00:04:02.478
Su-og!

00:04:02.812 --> 00:04:04.770
Who is Su-og, mother?

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:07.479
My friend.

00:04:10.478 --> 00:04:16.520
I am not Su-og. I’m Heja, Heja Pi.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.478
She’s my mother.

00:04:21.604 --> 00:04:23.604
&lt;She is serious. &gt;

00:04:26.438 --> 00:04:27.604
So are you going to ski?

00:04:27.604 --> 00:04:28.687
Yes.

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.478
How many people are going?

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:31.479
Three.

00:04:32.478 --> 00:04:33.770
She, my friend, and me.

00:04:33.812 --> 00:04:38.478
You don’t have to take the cross. 
What could you have possibly owed her?

00:04:40.478 --> 00:04:41.478
Fold these please.

00:04:41.478 --> 00:04:42.478
Ok.

00:04:42.478 --> 00:04:44.478
She was very nice to me.

00:04:44.687 --> 00:04:46.604
When will you return?

00:04:46.604 --> 00:04:49.478
Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. We’ll see.

00:04:49.478 --> 00:04:53.021
Just have fun and leave her to your friend.

00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:53.854
Ok.

00:04:55.478 --> 00:04:59.478
I am Heja Pi.

00:05:07.478 --> 00:05:09.313
Is it her coat?

00:05:09.313 --> 00:05:10.104
Yes.

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.520
May I try it on?

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.729
Yes.

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.188
Mom…

00:05:16.188 --> 00:05:19.478
What? I’m just trying.

00:05:21.062 --> 00:05:22.687
Oh, I love this.

00:05:29.354 --> 00:05:30.478
Have it.

00:05:32.313 --> 00:05:33.479
Take it off.

00:05:35.396 --> 00:05:37.478
It doesn’t wear out for trying.

00:05:42.478 --> 00:05:44.562
Do you have a husband?

00:05:44.562 --> 00:05:45.520
Yes.

00:05:46.645 --> 00:05:48.271
Is he nice to you?

00:05:48.271 --> 00:05:48.937
No.

00:05:52.478 --> 00:05:54.478
Must be at strife with him, huh?

00:05:54.478 --> 00:05:55.478
No.

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.604
Who is she?

00:05:59.604 --> 00:06:01.313
Bracelet.

00:06:02.478 --> 00:06:05.604
She’s Jade, not Bracelet.

00:06:05.604 --> 00:06:07.478
Don’t laugh.

00:06:11.687 --> 00:06:14.478
Did Woobin come to see you yesterday?

00:06:14.478 --> 00:06:15.478
Yes.

00:06:16.478 --> 00:06:18.478
He’s into you, isn’t he?

00:06:19.562 --> 00:06:23.354
Actors like to play around. 
I shouldn’t get involved.

00:06:23.354 --> 00:06:24.687
Not every actor.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.479
He is a nice guy. Looked sincere.

00:06:29.478 --> 00:06:31.478
So?

00:06:31.478 --> 00:06:35.520
Don’t kick away good fortune. 
An actor is not bad as a husband.

00:06:36.478 --> 00:06:39.479
Please Mom. I can take care of myself.

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:41.478
Oh you can?

00:06:41.478 --> 00:06:46.478
So did you fall in love with Jedoug, 
who took a night flee?

00:06:46.478 --> 00:06:47.313
Leave.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.313
Go home!

00:06:51.478 --> 00:06:53.645
This is my home.

00:06:56.146 --> 00:06:57.604
You don’t study hard these days?

00:06:57.604 --> 00:07:00.729
I do. I can focus better after an exercise.

00:07:02.478 --> 00:07:03.812
What is it? Are you going to go on a trip?

00:07:03.812 --> 00:07:07.021
Yes. She goes to ski.

00:07:07.021 --> 00:07:08.354
Wow!

00:07:08.354 --> 00:07:10.021
Come with us.

00:07:10.478 --> 00:07:11.478
Me?
