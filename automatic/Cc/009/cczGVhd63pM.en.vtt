length and I could keep on like this but
the<00:03:12.660> public<00:03:13.049> debate<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.799> very<00:03:14.400> much<00:03:14.610> focused

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
the public debate is very much focused

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.500 
the public debate is very much focused
on<00:03:15.690> cancer<00:03:16.260> which<00:03:16.830> is<00:03:16.860> of<00:03:17.160> course<00:03:17.610> very

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
on cancer which is of course very

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.710 
on cancer which is of course very
important<00:03:19.319> but<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:20.549> other<00:03:20.760> effects<00:03:21.390> that<00:03:21.450> are

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
important but the other effects that are

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.470 
important but the other effects that are
reported<00:03:22.290> in<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.560> scientific<00:03:22.799> literature

may<00:03:24.480> be<00:03:24.540> much<00:03:25.049> more<00:03:25.500> striking<00:03:26.370> much<00:03:27.209> more

may be much more striking much more

from that point of view maybe a society

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.280 
from that point of view maybe a society
if<00:04:05.160> you're<00:04:05.400> a<00:04:05.639> little<00:04:05.970> bit<00:04:06.180> cynical<00:04:06.750> it<00:04:07.049> could

if you're a little bit cynical it could

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.550 
if you're a little bit cynical it could
sort<00:04:07.500> of<00:04:07.530> live<00:04:07.920> with<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.609> certain<00:04:09.329> number<00:04:09.569> very

for instance Danish school kids get the

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.119 
literature is really very high time to
put<00:04:44.939> the<00:04:45.389> foot<00:04:45.719> on<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.990> brake<00:04:46.379> I<00:04:46.409> would<00:04:46.830> say

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:47.129 
put the foot on the brake I would say

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:49.879 
put the foot on the brake I would say
because<00:04:48.090> some<00:04:48.419> of<00:04:48.599> these<00:04:48.750> effects<00:04:49.530> are<00:04:49.770> not

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
because some of these effects are not

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.059

generations<00:04:53.069> have<00:04:53.610> been<00:04:53.639> psyche<00:04:54.210> maybe<00:04:54.750> you

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
generations have been psyche maybe you

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.290 
generations have been psyche maybe you
can<00:04:55.169> see<00:04:55.349> any<00:04:55.560> effect<00:04:55.979> like<00:04:56.550> in<00:04:56.789> the<00:04:56.969> fifth

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
can see any effect like in the fifth

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.740 
can see any effect like in the fifth
generation<00:04:58.259> in<00:04:58.949> the<00:04:59.250> future<00:04:59.460> when<00:05:00.120> it's<00:05:00.270> very

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
generation in the future when it's very

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.559 
generation in the future when it's very
too<00:05:01.289> late<00:05:01.530> to<00:05:01.830> say<00:05:02.129> that<00:05:02.400> hey<00:05:02.639> we<00:05:02.909> have<00:05:03.060> to<00:05:03.090> stop

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
too late to say that hey we have to stop

too late to say that hey we have to stop
this<00:05:03.840> exposure<00:05:04.289> and<00:05:05.360> therefore<00:05:06.360> I'm<00:05:06.509> as<00:05:06.840> a

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
this exposure and therefore I'm as a

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.559 
this exposure and therefore I'm as a
scientist<00:05:07.500> I'm<00:05:07.710> a<00:05:07.740> little<00:05:08.069> bit<00:05:08.189> them

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:08.569

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.559 
scientist I'm a little bit them
surprised<00:05:09.569> that<00:05:10.460> politicians<00:05:11.460> they<00:05:12.240> take

the<00:05:52.259> former<00:05:52.800> Swedish<00:05:53.360> government<00:05:54.360> I<00:05:54.659> have

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
the former Swedish government I have

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.290 
the former Swedish government I have
said<00:05:55.469> to<00:05:55.680> them<00:05:55.889> that<00:05:55.949> since<00:05:56.520> they<00:05:56.729> have

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
said to them that since they have

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.159 
said to them that since they have
allowed<00:05:57.539> public<00:05:58.259> exposure<00:05:58.949> all<00:05:59.490> Swedes<00:06:00.180> they

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
allowed public exposure all Swedes they

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.320 
allowed public exposure all Swedes they
must<00:06:01.560> know<00:06:01.979> from<00:06:02.490> a<00:06:02.580> scientific<00:06:03.000> point<00:06:03.240> of

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
must know from a scientific point of

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.719 
must know from a scientific point of
view<00:06:03.389> that<00:06:03.689> this<00:06:03.839> is<00:06:03.900> safe<00:06:04.319> so<00:06:05.069> I<00:06:05.099> asked<00:06:05.610> them

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:05.729 
view that this is safe so I asked them

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:08.959 
view that this is safe so I asked them
to<00:06:05.789> send<00:06:06.180> the<00:06:06.810> relevant<00:06:07.529> scientific<00:06:08.430> papers

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:08.969 
to send the relevant scientific papers

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:13.429 
to send the relevant scientific papers
and<00:06:09.949> they<00:06:10.949> didn't<00:06:11.520> send<00:06:11.759> a<00:06:12.029> single<00:06:12.930> one<00:06:13.139> they

00:06:13.429 --> 00:06:13.439 
and they didn't send a single one they

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.679 
and they didn't send a single one they
have<00:06:13.650> nothing<00:06:14.279> you<00:06:14.460> know<00:06:14.610> so<00:06:15.180> they<00:06:15.330> just<00:06:15.479> take

00:06:15.679 --> 00:06:15.689 
have nothing you know so they just take

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:17.269 
have nothing you know so they just take
a<00:06:15.719> chance<00:06:16.050> with<00:06:16.259> the<00:06:16.439> population<00:06:17.069> and

00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:17.279 
a chance with the population and

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:19.429 
a chance with the population and
hopefully<00:06:17.939> it<00:06:18.240> will<00:06:18.689> turn<00:06:18.930> out<00:06:19.080> to<00:06:19.110> be

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:19.439 
hopefully it will turn out to be

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.309 
hopefully it will turn out to be
completely<00:06:19.800> safe<00:06:20.490> and<00:06:20.819> there<00:06:21.719> will<00:06:21.930> be<00:06:21.960> no

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 
completely safe and there will be no

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:24.589 
completely safe and there will be no
risk<00:06:22.620> but<00:06:23.310> that<00:06:23.370> would<00:06:23.639> also<00:06:23.819> mean<00:06:24.210> you<00:06:24.449> know

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
risk but that would also mean you know

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:26.629 
risk but that would also mean you know
that<00:06:24.839> thousands<00:06:25.620> and<00:06:25.770> thousands<00:06:26.490> of

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 
that thousands and thousands of

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.589 
that thousands and thousands of

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:39.779 
articles have to be wrong at the same

three<00:06:45.310> what<00:06:46.310> you<00:06:46.460> say<00:06:46.700> actually<00:06:47.420> is<00:06:47.540> that<00:06:47.720> them

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
three what you say actually is that them

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.570 
three what you say actually is that them
must<00:06:48.650> be<00:06:48.770> at<00:06:48.860> risk<00:06:49.070> I<00:06:49.420> mean<00:06:50.420> it<00:06:51.080> is<00:06:51.380> definitely

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:51.580 
must be at risk I mean it is definitely

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.810 
must be at risk I mean it is definitely
risk<00:06:52.580> and<00:06:52.850> for<00:06:53.630> some<00:06:53.900> of<00:06:54.110> these<00:06:54.230> areas<00:06:54.920> the

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:55.820 
risk and for some of these areas the

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.240 
risk and for some of these areas the
risk<00:06:56.060> is<00:06:56.330> from<00:06:57.140> a<00:06:57.290> proportional<00:06:57.920> point<00:06:58.160> of

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.250 
risk is from a proportional point of

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.510 
risk is from a proportional point of
view<00:06:58.400> very<00:06:58.910> very<00:06:59.180> high
