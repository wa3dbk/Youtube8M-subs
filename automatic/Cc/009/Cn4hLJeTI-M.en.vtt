00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.360
 Hello and welcome to my 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.459
 dear friends to another 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.990
 minecraft tutorial here on my channel 

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:08.940
 I just want to show you today 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.500
 how to get widescreen back in the shader 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.570
 so can fix that shader pack 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.799
 not white is with you for that I show 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.340
 do it all in minecraft now 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.630
 we have the minecraft window here 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.950
 have my head ever started then 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.290
 he goes completely normal the singleplayer 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.640
 as usual, a world starts 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.170
 and you already have minecraft shader 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.440
 probably beautiful text already in 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.230
 done and then you fall on here and 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.109
 state terror in a week program come 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.800
 positively or so the channel sees 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:36.329
 how to pronounce it 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.370
 In any case, your screen is white 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.899
 you can not play and I have 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.249
 a second culprit here on it 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.289
 which I have already fixed that is 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:45.420
 almost the same are ultra bright before 10 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:48.420
 that one kind of motion citizens other df 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.519
 if I look at gf on it then clique 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.769
 he can play it smoothly so 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.969
 that's the shader in any case 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.350
 will work in the background too 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.019
 Everything and creates and nothing is mine 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.609
 packaged here or white and today would like 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.190
 I just show how you do it 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.420
 You could just fix that 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.520
 minecraft again but you have to 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.050
 quite close that is very important because 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.660
 that's not possible at minecraft 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.010
 so then you open running below 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.660
 Of course, I do not have that there 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.430
 down here but doing searches yes 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.740
 then enter percent from tata percent 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.500
 as always is minecraft and then 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.510
 he clicks once on ok now opens 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.300
 roaming this directory or something 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.310
 and then he goes to minecraft and you 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.140
 Do you have your shader backstage apex? 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.880
 drew rhein yes that would have that yes 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.730
 is also very important you have to with 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.260
 Make each shader pack one by one if it is 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.520
 for example, the deleted or straight 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.330
 had nothing to do with you that wanted 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.280
 I just delete that way 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.750
 you have to pack 1 for each shader 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.310
 make if it is in the shader pack 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.660
 And yes, there it would work 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.700
 do I have in which fixed the 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.530
 where he is not so I click now 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.140
 on what is not fixed and indeed 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.710
 down here on 14 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.270
 then we buy blabla then opens 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.830
 here this window and then have 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.480
 you have a lot of stuff in here, yes that 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.220
 everything belongs to the shader and so here 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.600
 is the hand of the sky and no idea 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.660
 and you definitely have to 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.710
 second do not click composite eve fsh 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.269
 but vsh komposite vsh you have to 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.950
 the most important thing is to open 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.290
 actually that you are notepad + + 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.490
 downloaded 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.370
 he is written in the normal way 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.020
 notepad + + and that's how it looks 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.150
 is a free editor that you can 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.830
 just download it is like 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.870
 winrar as if you downloaded winrar 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.180
 or something and then you have to do that with it 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.310
 open forest at not + + you have at the 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.050
 side these numbers that is quite perfect 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.330
 ok come back to tutorial you 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.950
 is now looking for line 47 because that is 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.670
 important for you that makes me float 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.080
 tempo so and in this number is 2.0 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.810
 if you have downloaded the 2 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.470
 now ends in a three as you click 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.820
 on file goes to save 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.230
 then he closes the whole thing and now 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.120
 you ask yourself if you should cover that 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.530
 in the archive that's important of course 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.880
 Do we want to update that else? 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.900
 the whole thing does not work that is 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.430
 but also important that the main completely 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.720
 closes use it power and 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.850
 minecraft is not fully closed since 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.130
 he does not do that okay we say yes he does 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.330
 It was dated so that 's about it 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.190
 even that would have to be the case with everyone 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.750
 single stands abegg and then 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:15.600
 it's back to the game 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:17.840
 I open minecraft again run into 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.840
 right 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.370
 Of course there is another 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.900
 How to fix the whole thing 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.940
 do not have to do that over this one 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.210
 this is usually s.der graphics card 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.730
 you have so I have ne nvidia gtx 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:44.280
 770 and I have the latest driver 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:46.110
 that means that I always have the card 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.000
 update constantly and so and the update 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.360
 does not quite come with the shader tomorrow 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.860
 clear 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.030
 you can already see here shader options 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.290
 I have now selected the other one 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.460
 now do not give to the bottom one 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.480
 it works now 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:03.480
 but we click the way to give it 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.280
 and here's the shader it all works 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.620
 super liquid also has everything great 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.570
 works and the whole white shit 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.540
 is now gone so the widescreen me 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:15.240
 I hope I could tutor you with the tutorial 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.830
 help a little lay now yes 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.060
 we'll see more tutorials then 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.870
 try to make a few others 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.100
 maybe like my clothes 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.870
 installed but there are already 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.610
 a whole lot on youtube i got that 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.220
 tutorials only made because of the people 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.270
 really did not know how to fix that 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.640
 and me those in the comments 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.480
 said how that works and that 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.860
 of course, I also wanted for everyone 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.320
 because I do not answer all 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.419
 can and well then we see two more 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.419
 tutorials until then and goodbye
